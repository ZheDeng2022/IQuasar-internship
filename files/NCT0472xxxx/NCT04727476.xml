      Aiming at improving clinical practice regarding the use of lisdexamfetamine for the treatment&#xD;
      of ADHD in children, the investigators want to retrospectively map the clinical use of&#xD;
      lisdexamfetamine at a specialised outpatient clinic located at Aarhus University Hospital,&#xD;
      Denmark treating children aged 7-13 with Attention Deficit Disorders in the period from 2013&#xD;
      to 2019. The investigators will describe the changes in prescription practice in the period,&#xD;
      reported side effects and reasons for selecting and discontinuing treatment with&#xD;
      lisdexamfetamine.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by the core symptoms of&#xD;
      inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, which are excessive for the person's age and&#xD;
      developmental status. It is a clinical diagnosis based on observed and reported behavioural&#xD;
      symptoms. Two main diagnostic systems are used currently, the International Classification of&#xD;
      Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&#xD;
      5th edition (DSM-5). Both systems require presence of symptoms in several settings such as&#xD;
      school, home life and leisure activities as well as the presence of functional impairment due&#xD;
      to symptoms of ADHD (e.g. impairment of psychological, social and/or educational&#xD;
      functioning). Symptoms should be evident in early life; for ICD-10 by age 7 and for DSM-5 by&#xD;
      age 12. Overall, the diagnostic criteria of ADHD are less stringent according to DSM-5&#xD;
      compared to ICD-10, which is reflected by a higher prevalence of ADHD in populations where&#xD;
      the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are applied. A systematic review (Sayal et al.) from 2018 of 55&#xD;
      studies (25 from the USA, seven from the UK, and 23 outside the USA and UK) reported a&#xD;
      prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents varying from approximately two to seven&#xD;
      percent depending mostly on the diagnostic criteria, making it one of the most common&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark the ICD-10 diagnostic system is used. The National Institute for Health and Care&#xD;
      Excellence (NICE) as well as The National Clinical Guidelines from the Danish Health&#xD;
      Authority recommend pharmacological treatment for children and adolescents with moderate to&#xD;
      severe ADHD. Severity is determined by a clinical assessment based on number of symptoms and&#xD;
      functional impairment. Both guidelines recommend the use of methylphenidate (MPH) as the&#xD;
      first choice of treatment. In the event that the use of MPH is non-effective in an adequate&#xD;
      dosage or results in adverse effects, it is recommended to switch to atomoxetine (ATX),&#xD;
      dexamfetamine (DX) or lisdexamfetamine (LDX). The subsequent choice of medication should take&#xD;
      into consideration the adverse effect profiles and duration of effect of the different drugs&#xD;
      as well as the reason for the switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In February 2013, Elvanse (LDX) received marketing authorization in the UK and Europe. It&#xD;
      became available for sale for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in Denmark in&#xD;
      April 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDX is an inactive prodrug which is gradually activated to DX by means of peptidase enzymes&#xD;
      in the red blood cells. Thus, LDX is a controlled-release drug where a single dose has an&#xD;
      effect on the ADHD core symptoms for up to 13 hours. The formulation as a prodrug reduces its&#xD;
      potential for abuse. According to www.medstat.dk which is based on data from the Danish&#xD;
      Register of Medicinal Product Statistics (LSR), the sales of lisdexamfetamine has been&#xD;
      steadily increasing during the years it has been on the market in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our clinical experience medical treatment of ADHD in children is often complicated by&#xD;
      intolerable adverse effects (e.g. weight loss due to loss of appetite or disturbance of&#xD;
      sleep), worsening of symptoms of comorbidities (e.g. anxiety, tic disorders or psychosis),&#xD;
      lack of/inadequate effect or non-optimal day coverage of treatment. In our experience, these&#xD;
      complications often lead to frequent switches in medical treatment. This is supported by a&#xD;
      study by Ben Amor et al. (2014) in which the authors reported a one-year period prevalence of&#xD;
      switching from one stimulant to either another stimulant, ATX or atypical antipsychotic of&#xD;
      19.5% in children and 17.4% in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study by Warrer et al. (2016) reported that the mean duration of MPH treatment before&#xD;
      switching to ATX was 11.2 months in a population of 55 children and adolescents aged 7-18&#xD;
      years with attention deficit disorders. 36% of the patients switched within the first 6&#xD;
      months, 56% within the first year and 76% within 1.5 years. 24% continued with MPH for 2.5&#xD;
      years before switching to ATX. The most common reasons for switching were adverse effects&#xD;
      (78%), need for stable 24-hr effect (24%) or lack of effect (16%). The conclusion of this&#xD;
      study as well as the conclusion of another study by Powell et al. (2011), was that the&#xD;
      importance of continuously evaluating the treatment of the individual patient throughout the&#xD;
      entire course of treatment needs to be emphasised, especially if there is no immediate good&#xD;
      effect and tolerability of the first choice of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aiming at improving clinical practice regarding LDX, the investigators want to describe the&#xD;
      changes in prescription practice in the period 2013 to 2019, reported side effects and&#xD;
      reasons for selecting or discontinuing LDX. The investigators expect LDX to be prescribed&#xD;
      more often in later years compared to earlier years because clinicians may be inclined to a&#xD;
      select medical treatment they have experience with rather than a new one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Hypothesis 1: The investigators expect LDX to be second choice in line with ATX in&#xD;
      later years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The investigators expect the main reasons for switching to LDX to be adverse&#xD;
      effects from MPH and/or ATX. The investigators expect to be able to describe top 5 adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The investigators expect patients who continue treatment with LDX to be&#xD;
      comparable with patients who discontinue treatment with LDX regarding gender, age, diagnosis,&#xD;
      ADHD symptoms at baseline and comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: The investigators expect adverse effects to be the main reason for&#xD;
      discontinuing LDX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there are no previous studies investigating the practical clinical use of&#xD;
      LDX in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a retrospective descriptive study that includes data from medical records of&#xD;
      approximately 600 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified in the electronic patient record system based on the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Baseline data and outcome data will be extracted from medical records by Nanna Roed&#xD;
      Søndergaard, MD, who will enter the data into a REDCap database designed for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be categorised into three groups according to whether they have received&#xD;
      treatment with LDX as a first, second or third choice of treatment. Combination treatment&#xD;
      will also be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise overall patient and treatment&#xD;
      characteristics, duration of therapy to switches, clinical reasons for switches in therapy,&#xD;
      clinical effect and adverse effects observed. Comparison between groups will be performed&#xD;
      using parametric or non-parametric test. An alfa level will be set at 0.5 in all analyses.&#xD;
      Analyses will be conducted using the statistical software program Stata 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with Danish legislation the study has been approved by the Danish Health and&#xD;
      Medicines Authority, registered at the Danish Data Protection Agency and will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data. This study requires no patient&#xD;
      contact. It will not be possible to trace the results of the study back to individual&#xD;
      patients. Data will be stored in MidtX in agreement with the EU General Data Protection&#xD;
      Regulation (GDPR). According to Danish legislation, no ethics or institutional review board&#xD;
      approvals are required for this study.&#xD;

        The patients included in this study have attended a specialised outpatient clinic at the&#xD;
        Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Aarhus University Hospital located in the&#xD;
        Central Denmark Region. The specialised outpatient clinis treats children aged 7-13 years&#xD;
        with moderate to severe ADHD. The catchment area of the Central Denmark Region comprises&#xD;
        1.3 million inhabitants. Patients are referred to the outpatient clinic from municipality&#xD;
        services, general practitioners and to a lesser extent from other hospital units. The&#xD;
        outpatient clinic is responsible for diagnosing and treating patients with the referral&#xD;
        diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and comorbid conditions.&#xD;
