  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open-label, randomized, parallel arm clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cuvitru 20%&#xD;
      subcutaneous immunoglobulin in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate patient preferences and effects on quality of life when treating MG patients&#xD;
      with SCIG. Exploratory objectives are to compare de novo administration starting SCIG&#xD;
      directly with those starting with a loading dose of IVIG followed by SCIG administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over age 18 with moderate to severe MG with MGFA Class II-IV without&#xD;
      contraindications to immunoglobulin will be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be eligible to enter either arm of the study, Arm 1: 10% Gammagard IVIG&#xD;
      followed by 20% Cuvitry SCIG and Arm 2: Cuvitru 20% SCIG alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular condition which can cause fatigable&#xD;
      weakness of skeletal muscles including bulbar, ocular, limb, axial and respiratory muscles.&#xD;
      Symptoms range from mild, transient double vision and ptosis to severe, life threatening&#xD;
      diffuse weakness, and treatments which are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory have been&#xD;
      shown to improve outcome in MG. This includes 10% intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which&#xD;
      has previous been shown by our group to improve strength at 2 and 4 weeks in patients with&#xD;
      MG. Due to delay in the onset of many immunosuppressives and potential side effects from&#xD;
      steroids and other immunosuppressive medications, IVIG is also used in clinical practice as&#xD;
      bridging of maintenance therapy until other therapies take effect or the patient stabilizes.&#xD;
      In addition, there have been other studies suggesting that 20% subcutaneous immunoglobuin&#xD;
      (SCIG) can be helpful to improve strength in patients with MG over a relatively short period&#xD;
      of time (6 weeks). Some of these studies are ongoing and are further evaluating the ability&#xD;
      of IVIG and SCIG to stabilize or improve strength IVIG in patients with MG, however, there is&#xD;
      no current published study evaluating different administration routes of immunoglobulin (IVIG&#xD;
      and SCIG) in patients with MG over a longer 6 month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to be the first to evaluate 20% Cuvitru SCIG formulation in patients&#xD;
      with neuromuscular conditions including MG. The study aim is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of 6 months of 20% SCIG Cuvitru treatment vs three months of 10% IVIG&#xD;
      &quot;pre-treatment&quot; followed by 3 months of 20% SCIG Cuvitru treatment. The study will also be&#xD;
      the first to use the myasthenia gravis impairment index (MGII) as primary outcome in&#xD;
      conjunction with standard MG outcomes.&#xD;
