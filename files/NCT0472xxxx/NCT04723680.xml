  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study programme aims to examine the real-world experience and impact of gene therapy in&#xD;
      a diverse community of people and families affected by haemophilia who have been or will be&#xD;
      exposed to gene therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational multiple cohort qualitative research study to be&#xD;
      conducted among diverse groups within the haemophilia community whose lives may have been&#xD;
      impacted by gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to allow English-speaking patients and their families to tell their own&#xD;
      life stories through narrative accounts. The narratives represent a true sharing of&#xD;
      experiences and offer insight into how these patients and families cope with haemophilia.&#xD;
