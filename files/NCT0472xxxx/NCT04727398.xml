    <textblock>
      Intraocular surgery could induce vitreous degeneration and then abnormal posterior vitreous&#xD;
      detachment (PVD) could occur including vitreoschisis and partial-thickness PVD. Vitreomacular&#xD;
      interface (VMI) abnormalities such as epimacular membrane were observed following many&#xD;
      intraocular surgeries. The incidence of peripheral break and epimacular membrane (EMM) after&#xD;
      pneumatic retinopexy were 11.7% and 4-11%, respectively. Although multiple intravitreal&#xD;
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections induced PVD of 5.6%, but&#xD;
      peripheral break was reported as only 0.67%. The incidence of rhegmatogenous retinal&#xD;
      detachment (RRD) after phacoemulsification is gradually increased with time. The accumulative&#xD;
      risk of RRD was increased from 0.27% at 1 year to 1.27% at 20 years after&#xD;
      phacoemulsification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common intraocular surgery is cataract surgery. From the literature review, many&#xD;
      methods were used to detect the PVD after phacoemulsification. The former studies used&#xD;
      indirect ophthalmoscopy and ocular ultrasound for diagnosis of PVD. The later studies used&#xD;
      the optical coherence tomography (OCT) for PVD detection. The OCT device had higher&#xD;
      effectiveness in evaluation of the posterior segment, and then it can detect&#xD;
      post-phacoemulsification PVD more and early than previous studies. Ivastinovic et al&#xD;
      demonstrated 59.2% of patients had PVD at 1 month after phacoemulsification, and increased up&#xD;
      to 71.4% at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tsukahara et al introduced wide-field OCT-based PVD classification. The advance OCT device&#xD;
      will be useful in detection of abnormal PVD and it's sequelae. If the risk factors of&#xD;
      post-phacoemulsification PVD were explored, the prevention of abnormal PVD and VMI disorders&#xD;
      could be done.&#xD;
