      This is a Phase II, single arm, open-label study to determine if treatment with eculizumab&#xD;
      prolongs pregnancy compared to historical controls in women with preeclampsia between 23-30&#xD;
      weeks gestation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if eculizumab is an effective treatment to prolong&#xD;
      pregnancy in women with preeclampsia, compared to a historical control group of women that&#xD;
      received standard of care alone. Eligible subjects will be women with preeclampsia before 30&#xD;
      weeks gestation, who have been deemed suitable for prolongation of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research procedure is administration of the study drug, eculizumab, by&#xD;
      intravenous infusions weekly for four weeks, then every other week. Eculizumab is approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for the treatment of women with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and paroxysmal&#xD;
      nocturnal hemoglobinuria and is frequently used in pregnant women with these disorders.&#xD;
      However, eculizumab is considered investigational in this study because it has not been&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for use in patients with preeclampsia. Subject participation will last&#xD;
      approximately 8-12 weeks on average, and the study drug will be continued until 48 hours&#xD;
      after delivery in the treatment arm. All subjects will be followed at 2 weeks and 6 weeks&#xD;
      after delivery to assess maternal and neonatal outcomes. A later visit may be required to&#xD;
      complete the meningococcal vaccine schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that eculizumab will prolong pregnancy in women with preeclampsia&#xD;
      diagnosed before 30 weeks gestation with overactive complement. As there is no effective&#xD;
      treatment for preeclampsia other than delivery currently, women with preeclampsia before 30&#xD;
      weeks gestation are managed using a &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach (i.e., expectant management).&#xD;
      Due to the unpredictable nature of preeclampsia, expectant management places mother and child&#xD;
      at significant risk until delivery occurs. Eculizumab may be an improvement over current&#xD;
      standard of care as it provides a treatment option for patients who would otherwise be&#xD;
      managed with expectant management alone. If the study aims are achieved, eculizumab will&#xD;
      emerge as an effective treatment option for women with preeclampsia.&#xD;
