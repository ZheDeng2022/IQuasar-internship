      Background: Breast cancer ranks first among cancer types seen in women in our country and all&#xD;
      over the world, and second after lung cancer in cancer-related deaths. Despite the recent&#xD;
      increase in its incidence, mortality has decreased due to early diagnosis and advances in&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. Classically, lymph node status, tumor size, histological type and grade,&#xD;
      age, and ethnicity are prognostic factors for this type of cancer. Bone marrow activation&#xD;
      results from malignancies and inflammation. Tumor-related inflammation has gained importance&#xD;
      in each stage of tumorigenesis. Host-dependent systemic inflammatory response has been found&#xD;
      to be effective in carcinogenesis, tumor development and progression. Inadequately controlled&#xD;
      or uncontrolled inflammatory activity may be responsible for malignant transformation.&#xD;
      Inflammatory cell stimulation occurs in lymph node metastasis and distant organ metastases&#xD;
      like primary tumor.As the cornerstone of the adaptive immune system, lymphocytes inhibit&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation, migration and destroy metastatic lesions. Monocyte-macrophages&#xD;
      inhibit angiogenesis, tumor growth and distant spread. On the other hand, tumor-induced&#xD;
      neutrophils can accelerate tumor metastasis. Many studies have examined the relationship&#xD;
      between the ratios between different cell types, such as the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR),&#xD;
      and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with malignant tumors(4,10).Apart from these, mean&#xD;
      platelet volume (MPV), which can be automatically studied in routine blood counts and shows&#xD;
      platelet activation, has been used to show tumor activity in breast, stomach, colon and&#xD;
      ovarian cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have identified the delta neutrophil index (DNI), which indicates the&#xD;
      percentage of immature granulocytes (IG) in peripheral blood due to increased bone marrow&#xD;
      activation in inflammatory conditions.It is based on counting granulocyte precursor cells&#xD;
      under microscope. With the technological developments,IG count and DNI can be automatically&#xD;
      evaluated from complete blood count parameters in automated systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study,the investigators aimed to determine the diagnostic value of preoperative IG&#xD;
      number and DNI level before clinical detection of axillary lymph node metastasis, which plays&#xD;
      an important role in the prognosis of breast cancer, and to compare these parameters with&#xD;
      other routine inflammation markers such as white blood cell count (WBC), MPV, NLR and PLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material - Methods:Patients who were older than eighteen and operated for breast pathology in&#xD;
      Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University,Department of General Surgery between February 2015 and&#xD;
      February 2020 were evaluated retrospectively.Patient data were obtained from patient&#xD;
      epicrisis forms and preoperative laboratory and postoperative pathology results recorded in&#xD;
      the computer system.Demographic data of the patients,routine blood tests,preoperative imaging&#xD;
      methods, preoperative tumor size,presence of axillary lymph node metastasis and distant organ&#xD;
      metastasis,presence of pathological axillary lymph node metastasis in the postoperative&#xD;
      period were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preoperative period, patients without axillary metastases and who did not receive&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment were examined by dividing them into two groups as pathologically&#xD;
      non-metastatic(Group NM) and metastasized(Group M) in axillary lymph node sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White blood cell(WBC)count,neutrophil count,lymphocyte count,platelet count,mean platelet&#xD;
      volume(MPV),IG count and DNI(IG percentage)were measured using an automated hematological&#xD;
      analyzer from blood samples obtained at the preoperative previous month of surgery.Neutrophil&#xD;
      to lymhpocyte ratio(NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio(PLR) were manually calculated from&#xD;
      the complete blood cell results.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical Evaluation:IBM-Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 was used&#xD;
      for statistical analysis. In the evaluation between independent groups;normal distribution&#xD;
      was checked for the kolmogorov-simirnov test.While student t test or Mann Whitney U test was&#xD;
      used in the evaluation of numerical data according to the conformity of the data to normal&#xD;
      distribution,chi-square test was used in the evaluation of categorical data.Multivariate&#xD;
      analysis was performed with parameters found to be significant in the evaluation of&#xD;
      univariate analysis and predictive values of preoperative blood parameters were&#xD;
      calculated.ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of WBC, NLR, PLR, DNI, IG&#xD;
      number and MPV values,and sensitivity,specificity values and cut-off values were obtained.&#xD;
      Numerical values are expressed as median(minimum - maximum values), categorical values as&#xD;
      percentage (%).&#xD;
