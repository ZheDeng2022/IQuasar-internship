  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early&#xD;
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and&#xD;
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then&#xD;
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and&#xD;
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a&#xD;
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing&#xD;
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a pre-validation&#xD;
      study, investigating optimized algorithms, features, functions and wearing comfort. This will&#xD;
      be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters&#xD;
      based in Stäfa (Switzerland).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare different features of the Phonak behind the ear device activated and&#xD;
      deactivated, for example the noise reduction feature. There shall be differences in listening&#xD;
      effort, awareness and sound quality shown. The study shall show the advantages especially for&#xD;
      people with severe to profound hearing losses. This will be a clinical investigation which&#xD;
      will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based in Stäfa (Switzerland).&#xD;

    <description>The Primary Outcome measure of this study is the comparison of the noise canceler off vs on with the experimental Hearing aid in regard to listening effort in a noisy environment.&#xD;
The listening effort will be measured by a subjective rating, with 11 steps, from &quot;very easy to understand&quot; to &quot;not hearable&quot;.</description>

    <description>The secondary Outcome measure of this study is the Evaluation of the sound quality, when the available gain will be increased by the feedback manager.&#xD;
The acceptance will be measured by a subjective rating (very unsatisfied-unsatisfied-neither-satisfied-very satisfied).</description>

    <description>The secondary Outcome measure of this study is the Evaluation of ability of detecting sounds in a quiet environment, compared between the experimental device and the comparator.&#xD;
The ability will be measured by a detection threshold.</description>
