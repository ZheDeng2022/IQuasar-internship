  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is superior to office blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      for assessing cardiovascular risk. On the other hand, repeated cuff inflations during ABPM&#xD;
      can cause discomfort and reduced quality of sleep. A high frequency of measurement during&#xD;
      ABPM might result in erroneously high BP measurement, incorrect hypertension diagnoses,&#xD;
      unnecessary treatment or just overtreatment with antihypertensive medication and potentially&#xD;
      serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the frequency of measurements during ABPM&#xD;
      impacts the measured BP during ABPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the Clinic of Hypertension at Aarhus University Hospital,&#xD;
      Denmark. The study will be conducted as a randomized controlled crossover study. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo two 24-hour ABPMs: One with a low frequency of measurement, 1-time per hour&#xD;
      during the day and 1-time per hour during the night, and one with a high frequency,&#xD;
      3-times/hour during the day, and 2-times/hour at night. The primary endpoint will be the&#xD;
      difference in 24-hour mean systolic BP between the high- and low frequency measurement ABPM.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if 24-hour ABPM with frequent BP measurements&#xD;
      (intervals of 20 minutes during daytime and 30 minutes during nighttime) result in&#xD;
      erroneously elevated BP in hypertensive patients compared with non-frequent BP readings&#xD;
      (measurement intervals of 60 minutes both day and night).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will comprise all patients referred to and attending the Clinic of&#xD;
      Hypertension, AUH, who are scheduled to undergo ABPM. At referral to the Clinic of&#xD;
      Hypertension, AUH, patients will be contacted with an electronic or analog letter, informing&#xD;
      them about the study and inviting them to participate. Patients who already are being treated&#xD;
      at the Clinic of Hypertension, will be invited at an appointment in the clinic. Patients will&#xD;
      be excluded from the study if they have atrial fibrillation, nighttime work, insomnia or&#xD;
      sleeping disorders, and are not physically able to undergo an ABPM (e.g. too big arm&#xD;
      circumference to fit the cuff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized controlled crossover study (figure 2). At arrival patients will be&#xD;
      fitted with the device, a SPACELABS 90217 by a nurse. The nurse will conduct an office blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement, in accordance with ESH guidelines to be sure the device is working, and&#xD;
      for later comparison. Patients will have their first ABPM conducted with either frequent or&#xD;
      non-frequent ABPM measurement protocol as described above, randomized 1:1. Patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to remove their device after 24 hours of measurement and have an appointment to&#xD;
      return the device between 2-7 days. At least two days between measurements ensure a&#xD;
      sufficient washout period. The maximum of 7 days before second measurement makes sure the&#xD;
      patient's appointment with a doctor at the clinic will not be delayed. When returning the&#xD;
      device, patients will have the same device mounted again, measuring with the frequency not&#xD;
      assigned at the initial randomization. Participants will be instructed to repeat the same&#xD;
      procedures regarding the device and to, as far as possible, conduct the same daily activities&#xD;
      on the second day of measurement as during the first day of measurement. Patients will not&#xD;
      have any alterations in blood pressure medication between the two measuring days. After each&#xD;
      ABPM, patients will answer a routine questionnaire from the clinic about sleep, discomfort,&#xD;
      pain, and the degree to which the device caused interference with daily activities and/or&#xD;
      disturbance of sleep. Since the questionnaire is standard procedure at the clinic, we will be&#xD;
      able to compare characteristics between the group who are not interested in joining the study&#xD;
      and patients do participate. In this way the investigators can ensure no unknown selection&#xD;
      bias occurs. Both ABPM will be used by the clinician at the appointment in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study conducted at the Clinic of Hypertension, AUH, the investigators found a mean&#xD;
      difference of 7 mmHg (Standard deviation = 13,76) between a 20-minute interval and a 1-hour&#xD;
      interval between measurements, respectively. Using a sample size calculation, for crossover&#xD;
      design with quantitative measurement, a two-sided significance level of 0.025 and a power of&#xD;
      0.9, and a minimal clinical difference of 10mmHg, we calculate a minimum sample size of 38&#xD;
      patients. It is estimated only 25% of patients with this difference will be in intermediate&#xD;
      hypertension group as studied in the previous pilot study, which is why 152 patients wil be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
