  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)&#xD;
      require routine treatment with dual antiplatelet (DAPT) treatment, but with the high risk of&#xD;
      bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common type of major bleeding. Helicobacter&#xD;
      pylori (Hp) infection is a high-risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding, with an incidence&#xD;
      of about 50%. Foreign authoritative DAPT guidelines do not give individual guidance to&#xD;
      Hp-infected patients. It is recommended that those with high bleeding risk should be combined&#xD;
      with proton pump inhibitors (PPI), but long-term compliance with PPI is not ideal.&#xD;
      Authoritative experts in China have agreed to recommend Hp detection and eradication therapy&#xD;
      for DAPT patients, but loss of evidence. Vonoprazan is a novel potassium ion competitive acid&#xD;
      blocker, based on Vonoprazan's dual Hp eradication therapy is simple and effective. Our team&#xD;
      will conduct a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial using a&#xD;
      non-inferior design to compare the combination of Vonoprazan + amoxicillin combined with&#xD;
      pantoprazole (PPI) for 6 months after PCI on the bleeding events of the digestive tract.&#xD;

      This study plans to enroll 2600 patients, 1300 patients in each group, in the project&#xD;
      participating hospitals who received coronary stenting and are expected to undergo DAPT ≥6&#xD;
      months after operation. Hp13C-urea breath test and serum Hp antibody scores Type detection,&#xD;
      patients with positive Hp infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiplatelet drugs (DAPT) use aspirin 100 mg qd, plus clopidogrel 75 mg qd or aspirin 100mg&#xD;
      qd plus ticagrelor 90 mg bid. The specific medication is evaluated and decided by the&#xD;
      interventional doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the subjects in each center signed a written informed consent form, they randomly&#xD;
      divided each test case into a test group or a control group at a 1:1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the project participating hospitals who received coronary stenting and are expected&#xD;
           to undergo DAPT ≥6 months after operation. Hp13C-urea breath test and serum Hp antibody&#xD;
           scores Type detection, patients with positive Hp infection. Antiplatelet drugs (DAPT)&#xD;
           use aspirin 100 mg qd, plus clopidogrel 75 mg qd or aspirin 100 mg qd, plus ticagrelor&#xD;
           90 mg bid. The specific medication is evaluated and decided by the interventional&#xD;
           doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H. pylori eradication using a dual eradication regimen, a course of 14 days, followed up&#xD;
           to 6 months after randomization; the treatment regimen is as follows: routine use of&#xD;
           Vonoprazan 20mg bid + amoxicillin 1g tid, a duration of 14 days(Considering the high&#xD;
           drug resistance rate of Hp strains in China, we increase the course of eradication&#xD;
           treatment to 14 days) .&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Introduce the subject to the possible adverse reactions to the dual eradication at&#xD;
           the informed stage, and inform the subject that when the adverse reaction occurs, the&#xD;
           researcher should be contacted as soon as possible to deal with it as soon as possible&#xD;
           to reduce unnecessary shedding. For patients who are unable to tolerate the combination&#xD;
           therapy and fall off, record the reason for the incomplete treatment and the&#xD;
           corresponding time point, and continue the safety visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. More than 1 month after completion of the dual eradication (scheduled at the 12th&#xD;
           week of follow-up, visit 3), use the 13C-urea breath test to retest Hp infection. For&#xD;
           subjects who failed H. pylori eradication, in the Department of Gastroenterology&#xD;
           Remedial treatment under the guidance of a doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the project participating hospitals who received coronary stenting and are expected to&#xD;
      undergo DAPT ≥ 6 months after operation. Hp13C-urea breath test and serum Hp antibody scores&#xD;
      Type detection, patients with positive Hp infection. Antiplatelet drugs (DAPT) use aspirin&#xD;
      100 mg qd, plus clopidogrel 75 mg qd or aspirin 100 mg qd plus ticagrelor 90 mg bid. The&#xD;
      specific medication is evaluated and decided by the interventional doctor. Taking&#xD;
      pantoprazole 40 mg daily, followed up to 6 months after randomization.&#xD;
