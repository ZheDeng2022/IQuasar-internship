  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on finding a safe and tolerable dose for a three-drug regimen that&#xD;
      combines venetoclax (Venclexta Ⓡ), CC-486 (also known as oral azacitidine) and obinutuzumab&#xD;
      (Gazyva Ⓡ) to treat cancer participants who have minimally pretreated follicular lymphoma and&#xD;
      have experienced disease progression despite trying previous cancer therapies. If a safe and&#xD;
      tolerable drug dose can be found in the first phase of the study, doctors leading the study&#xD;
      will launch a second phase of the study within an expansion cohort. Participants in this&#xD;
      expansion cohort will receive the dose established in the first phase of the study to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of the regimen/ established dose. Participants in the expansion cohort&#xD;
      will also receive the same study drugs from the first phase of the study, but in a different&#xD;
      order/combination (first pairing the two oral drugs, CC-486 and venetoclax, then adding the&#xD;
      third drug, obinutuzumab to treatment). The end goal of this research is to establish a new&#xD;
      chemotherapy-sparing treatment option for patients with follicular lymphoma that is just as&#xD;
      effective (or better) than current standard of care options.&#xD;

          8. Evidence of significant, uncontrolled diseases that could affect the participant's&#xD;
             ability to fulfill their role in the study/ protocol or interpretation of results or&#xD;
             that could increase risk to the participant, including renal disease that would&#xD;
             preclude chemotherapy administration or pulmonary disease (including obstructive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease and history of bronchospasm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection&#xD;
             (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at study enrollment, or any major episode&#xD;
             of infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (relating to&#xD;
             the completion of the course of antibiotics) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.&#xD;
             Uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial or viral infection (defined as ongoing&#xD;
             signs/symptoms related to the infection without improvement despite appropriate&#xD;
             antibiotics, antiviral therapy and/or other treatment) will result in study exclusion.&#xD;
             Caution should be exercised when considering the use of any of the study medication in&#xD;
             participants with a history of recurring or chronic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis,&#xD;
             current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Presence of positive test results for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C (HCV) antibody. Participants who are positive for HCV&#xD;
             antibody must be negative for HCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be eligible&#xD;
             for study participation. Participants with occult or prior HBV infection (defined as&#xD;
             positive total hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] and negative HBsAg) may be included&#xD;
             if HBV DNA is undetectable. These participants must be willing to undergo monthly HBV&#xD;
             DNA testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Receipt of live-virus vaccines within 30 days prior to the initiation of study&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Malabsorption syndrome, inability to swallow a large number of pills, or other&#xD;
             condition that precludes enteral route of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. A history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or known prior infection&#xD;
             with the John Cunningham (JC) virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Significant active cardiac disease within the previous 6 months including New York&#xD;
             Heart Association class 4 heart failure, unstable angina, or myocardial infarction.&#xD;
