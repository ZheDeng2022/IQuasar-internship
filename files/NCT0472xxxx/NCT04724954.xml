  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project is intended to provide information pertaining to the usability,&#xD;
      feasibility and clinical benefit of the BAC system for early sub-acute post CVA&#xD;
      rehabilitation, improved cognition and emotive state while in acute inpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      settings (Kessler Foundation) and in an outpatient clinic at the same research hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomised controlled trials will take place at Kessler Foundation (West Orange, NJ). It&#xD;
      will develop a new longitudinal therapy for elderly stroke survivors who are inpatients and&#xD;
      then outpatients at a regional rehabilitation hospital, by adding BAC training to customary&#xD;
      care for both inpatients and outpatients. Two systems will be used, improving continuity of&#xD;
      care (one each for inpatient and outpatient settings).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study targets participants, who had suffered a stroke very recently, who may or may not&#xD;
      have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairments or dementia (including Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease). It is important to find out if these improvements can be obtained with the computer&#xD;
      game-based integrative (motor-cognitive) bimanual rehabilitation developed by Bright Cloud&#xD;
      International Corp, and if these gains transfer to daily activities. The study also aims at&#xD;
      determining benefit of continuum care training on the BAC in addition to conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation for participants who are inpatients and then outpatients at a rehabilitation&#xD;
      hospital and clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAC technology acceptance (all groups); improved motor function for upper extremity;&#xD;
      strengthening shoulder and fingers increased range of motion for arms and fingers; improved&#xD;
      independence in activities of daily living; improved cognition; improved emotive state;&#xD;
      reduction in perceived upper body pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another component of the research project is a small pilot targeting individuals with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. For them the project is going to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      determine technology acceptance when using the BrightBrainer system; benefit to arms motor&#xD;
      function and strengthening when playing BCI therapeutic games; benefit to reduction or tremor&#xD;
      when playing games; cognitive benefits improvement in their well-being.&#xD;

    <description>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised (HVLT-R) is a measure of verbal memory. It provides a brief assessment of immediate recall, delayed recall and delayed recognition. Subject is read a series of nouns in several categories, and the asked t repeat these nouns by writing them on a piece of paper. The test is repeated three times, and each time the score is a count of how many nouns were remembered by the subject. The second phase of the test involves delayed recall, which is administered after about 20 minutes from the original test. subject needs to write down all the nouns they remembered and these are counted. There is a maximum of 12 correct responses during delayed recall, so max score is 12</description>

    <description>Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, Revised (BVMT-R) is a measure of visuospatial memory. In three Learning Trials, the subject views a stimulus page showing an geometric figure for 10 seconds, and there are 6 drawings presented. Then the subject is asked to draw as many of the figures as possible in their correct location on a page in the response booklet. A Delayed Recall Trial is administered after a 25-minute delay. Last, a Recognition Trial, in which the respondent is asked to identify which of 12 figures were included among the original geometric figures, is administered. Raw scores will be used, with higher numbers representing better outcomes. Raw score range is 0 (worst outcome) to 6 (best outcome)</description>
