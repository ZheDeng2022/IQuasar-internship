    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to compare the effects of functional exercises and posture exercises&#xD;
      on lower extremity functions, posture and physical activity in office workers. For this&#xD;
      reason, functional exercises will be applied to a group of office workers and posture&#xD;
      exercises will be applied to a group, lower extremity functions, posture and physical&#xD;
      activity will be evaluated before and after the training.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are studies reporting that the long working time spent at the desk in office workers&#xD;
      and working in a static position are the etiological factors of various problems in the upper&#xD;
      and lower extremities.Office workers who are eligible for inclusion criteria and willing to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be included.Participants will be randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups as functional exercise group and posture exercises group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise program:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st Group: Functional exercise group (20 people) The exercise program is planned as a&#xD;
           function-oriented exercise program aimed at improving balance skills, increasing lower&#xD;
           extremity muscle strength and functions. During all exercises, exercises will be done&#xD;
           while maintaining postural smoothness. For the postural smoothness, feedback will be&#xD;
           provided by the physiotherapist for orientation, correction and protection to the&#xD;
           participants. The exercise program will be applied online, 2 days a week for 8 weeks. In&#xD;
           the beginning, 3 sets of 10 repetitions will be progressed gradually as 3 sets of 15&#xD;
           repetitions, 3 sets of 20 repetitions, according to the tolerance of the participant.&#xD;
           Exercises will be progressed from simple to difficult. There will be a 2-minute rest&#xD;
           period between sets. All 28 exercises defined in the functional exercise group will not&#xD;
           be applied in one session. Exercise selection will be made according to the functional&#xD;
           status of the participant.Exercises are planned to be performed in a chair supported,&#xD;
           bipedal position, unipedal position, using weights, providing resistance with elastic&#xD;
           band in various degrees of difficulty and in various positions. In the beginning, 6-7&#xD;
           exercises, which are appropriate according to the evaluation results of the&#xD;
           participants, will be selected according to the difficulty level and the exercises will&#xD;
           be changed in the following weeks. The exercises will start with warm-up exercises and&#xD;
           end with cooling exercises. Warm-up exercises and cool-down exercises will take 5&#xD;
           minutes at the beginning and 5 minutes at the end, a total of 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd Group: Posture exercises group (20 people) The exercise program was planned by&#xD;
           focusing on posture exercises in order to increase the postural smoothness of the&#xD;
           participants. During all exercises, exercises will be done while maintaining postural&#xD;
           smoothness. For the postural smoothness, feedback will be provided by the&#xD;
           physiotherapist for orientation, correction and protection to the participants. The&#xD;
           exercise program will be applied online, 2 days a week for 8 weeks. In the beginning,&#xD;
           range of motion exercises will be progressed as 3 sets of 10 repetitions, then gradually&#xD;
           as 3 sets of 15 repetitions and 3 sets of 20 repetitions, according to the tolerance of&#xD;
           the participant. Stretching exercises will be done as 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions.&#xD;
           Initially, 6-7 exercises will be selected according to the postural evaluation results&#xD;
           of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises will be changed in the following weeks. Resistance will not be applied in the&#xD;
      exercises, and the participants will be asked to maintain the specified exercise position for&#xD;
      5-6 seconds for range of motion exercises and 20 30 seconds for stretching exercises.&#xD;

    <measure>6 Minute Walking Test (6 MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test is an example of a timed distance test that is widely used in clinical research and rehabilitation studies. It can be applied in a short time. Requires little equipment. Used as a field test, the six minute walk test is a simple and straightforward walk test that does not need exercise equipment, compatible with daily activities it is an inexpensive test. Before the test begins, the patient is seated in a chair near the starting point for at least 10 minutes should rest. The walking area should be at least 30 m long. A shorter corridor is more for more frequent turns and changes of direction. It takes a lot of time. It is kept for 6 minutes with the help of the stopwatch and the number of laps in the time is calculated and saved. 6 MWTs will be used to evaluate the lower extremity functions of the cases included in the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sit to Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It reflects lower extremity muscle strength and functional capacities of individuals. For the test, the individual is allowed to sit in the middle of a chair with a height of 43.18 cm, with his back upright, with his feet on the ground and arms crossed in front of his chest (right hand left shoulder, left hand on the right shoulder). While the individual is in this position, the test starts with the start command and the total number of starts made during 30 seconds creates the individual's score. One of the aims of our study is to investigate the effects of exercise programs on lower extremity functions of office workers. For this reason, sit and stand test will be used to evaluate lower extremity muscle strength for lower extremity functions of the cases included in the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 Step Up Time Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All cases are asked to climb 10 steps (14x28x120 cm) as fast as possible. Step-up time is measured by the stopwatch in seconds. The measurement is repeated three times and the average of the three measurements is recorded. One of the aims of our study is to investigate the effects of exercise programs on lower extremity functions of office workers. For this reason, the 10-step climbing time test will be used to evaluate the lower extremity functions of the cases included in the study.</description>
