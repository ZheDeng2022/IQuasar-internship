  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a stroke, more than two out of three patients experience problems with upper limb&#xD;
      movement and sensation. During the past decade, robotic technology has been increasingly used&#xD;
      to asses these problems in a detailed and accurate manner. However, sensory processing, one&#xD;
      of the most important sensory functions, has not been assessed using robotic technology yet.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators have developed a robotic assessment of sensory processing.&#xD;
      During this study, the investigators aim to initially validate this novel assessment. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to examine 20 chronic stroke patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls&#xD;
      using the robotic assessment on one hand, and a set of existing clinical assessments on the&#xD;
      other hand. The investigators hypothesize that stroke patients will have a poorer performance&#xD;
      on this novel robotic assessment compared to age-matched healthy controls, and that these&#xD;
      findings are similar to what is found with existing clinical assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 70% of stroke survivors show upper limb impairments consisting of motor and/or&#xD;
      somatosensory impairments. These impairments often persist well into the chronic stage, and&#xD;
      may lead to significant limitations in activities of daily living and may negatively affect&#xD;
      quality of life. It is therefore of utmost importance to accurately assess upper limb&#xD;
      impairments. Clinical assessments exist for both motor and somatosensory function, but lack&#xD;
      good psychometric properties. Robotic technology show promising potential and is readily&#xD;
      available to assess motor function and proprioception. Robotic assessment for sensory&#xD;
      processing is currently not yet available, despite being the most relevant somatosensory&#xD;
      function. Indeed, sensory processing shows the strongest association with upper limb&#xD;
      movement, and only shows incomplete recovery at 6 months after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently developed a novel robotic assessment of sensory processing, using&#xD;
      the Kinarm End-Point Lab (BKIN Technologies Ltd., Canada). This cross-sectional study was set&#xD;
      up to initially validate this novel robotic assessment and to collect pilot data to form the&#xD;
      basis for future research. 20 chronic stroke patients and 20 age-matched controls will be&#xD;
      recruited and will undergo extensive clinical and robotic assessment of upper limb motor and&#xD;
      somatosensory function. The investigators hypothesize stoke patients with sensory processing&#xD;
      deficits to have a worse performance on this novel robotic assessment compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls and patients without sensory processing deficits. The investigators also hypothesize&#xD;
      to see moderate to high correlations between the robotic assessment of sensory processing,&#xD;
      and clinical assessments for both somatosensory and motor function.&#xD;
