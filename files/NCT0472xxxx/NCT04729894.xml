  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the initial success of the 1970s Poison Prevention Packaging Act, the incidence of&#xD;
      pediatric medication poisonings in the United States remains high. Unintentional pediatric&#xD;
      medication ingestions result in significant morbidity and are associated with substantial&#xD;
      healthcare use and costs. A majority of these medication poisonings involve a caregivers'&#xD;
      medication and are caused by modifiable unsafe storage behaviors. A better understanding of&#xD;
      factors associated with pediatric poisonings and safe medication storage behaviors is needed&#xD;
      to inform public health policy and develop targeted educational interventions. Furthermore,&#xD;
      low-cost, scalable interventions that improve medication storage behaviors and reduce&#xD;
      pediatric poisonings are necessary to address this ongoing preventable public health crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary experiments, a baseline evaluation of caregivers demonstrated that they are&#xD;
      unlikely to have a locked medication storage device in their home, but would be willing to&#xD;
      use a locked device if one was available. Additionally, a follow-up assessment indicated that&#xD;
      a majority of caregivers had used their medication over a one-month period. The latter&#xD;
      feasibility assessment supports both caregiver willingness to use a safe storage device and&#xD;
      demonstrates that a storage device can improve medication storage behaviors in the&#xD;
      short-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these findings, we hypothesize that pediatric medication poisonings are due to improper&#xD;
      storage, that medication storage behaviors are influenced by demographic and household&#xD;
      specific factors, and that medication lockboxes improve safe medication storage behaviors and&#xD;
      reduce pediatric poisonings. These hypotheses will be evaluated using the studies in the&#xD;
      following Specific Aims: (1) to identify factors associated with pediatric poisonings, (2) to&#xD;
      identify factors associated with medication storage behaviors, (3) to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      lockboxes on storage behaviors and pediatric poisonings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this exploratory study reveal factors associated with increased risk for pediatric&#xD;
      poisoning or with safe medication storage, and should safe medication storage interventions&#xD;
      improve modifiable storage behaviors or show a reduction in pediatric poisonings, the results&#xD;
      will be used to inform targeted public health campaigns and to develop a low-cost, scalable&#xD;
      national program for improving safe medication storage and reducing pediatric poisonings.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be evaluated at regular intervals over a one year period to evaluate the impact of a medication box + education, compared to education alone, on their short and long-term medication storage behaviors. These storage behaviors include storage location in the home, storage device(s), storage location height, co-storage with non-medication items, and alternative storage locations.</description>
