  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hong Kong has an aging population. By the year of 2036, more than 30% of our population will&#xD;
      be older than 65 years old1. Aging in male has been shown to correlate with the risk of&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction(ED). The demand in ED treatment is expected to increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several ED treatment options are available, ranging from oral or intracavernosal drug&#xD;
      treatments, to vacuum erection therapy or even penile prosthesis implantation. However, none&#xD;
      of these treatment are curative nor rectify the pathophysiology of ED. Low-intensity&#xD;
      extra-corporeal shockwave therapy(LI-ESWT) has been introduced since 2010 for treatment of&#xD;
      ED. The first randomized-controlled trial by Vardi et al. had proved the efficacy of ESWT in&#xD;
      improving the International Index of Erectile Function(IIEF) score3. The International Index&#xD;
      of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain score(IIEF-EF) was significantly greater in the&#xD;
      treatment group compared with the sham therapy group. The efficacy of LI-ESWT was also&#xD;
      confirmed in meta-analyses. Nonetheless, the available studies were criticized for the&#xD;
      variations in shockwave generators, energy parameters and treatment protocol. Most studies&#xD;
      used focused electrohydraulic machines, did not include NPT as part of the outcomes&#xD;
      assessment, and only reported the short-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently LI-ESWT machine was used in few Hong Kong public hospitals for the treatment of&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction. In KEC, few pilot cases have been done using the linear LI-ESWT&#xD;
      machine. No adverse events were seen. Local published data is lacking. Yee et al. has&#xD;
      published a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial on LI-ESWT in 20144. Using an&#xD;
      electrohydraulic machine with a focused shockwave source, they concluded no significant&#xD;
      differences in IIEF-EF and Erectile Hardness Score(EHS) between treatment and sham therapy&#xD;
      after 13 weeks of treatment. In subgroup analysis significant improvement was noted in men&#xD;
      with severe baseline erectile dysfunction (LI-ESWT IIEF-EF improvement: 10.1 ± 4.1 vs sham&#xD;
      therapy IIEF-ED domain improvement: 3.2 ± 3.3; P = 0.003). There were several limitations in&#xD;
      this study. These include the small number of participants included in the subgroup analysis&#xD;
      (ranges from 18 to 21 men in each subgroups), the lack of physical measurement of erectile&#xD;
      function. The percentage of patients with 5 points or more IIEF-EF improvement and the&#xD;
      Erection Hardness Score(EHS) were also not reported. They have also used an old design with&#xD;
      focused energy source, instead of the linear energy source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the limitations of the previous international and local studies, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to investigate the efficacy of a linear electromagnetic LI-ESWT machine in&#xD;
      men with moderate and severe ED. In addition, the intermediate-term outcomes would be&#xD;
      studied, in terms of patients-reported erection scores and nocturnal tumescence and rigidity&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the efficacy and safety of LI-ESWT in treatment of moderate and severe ED&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the effect of LI-ESWT on nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan and Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Design This is a prospective, two-centre randomized controlled trial involving&#xD;
           United Christian Hospital and Tseung Kwan O Hospital. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
           accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on&#xD;
           Harmonisation, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (ICH-GCP). This RCT will be registered&#xD;
           with ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient selection and recruitment Patients would be recruited in the urology outpatient&#xD;
           clinics. Subjects who fulfilled selection criteria would be counselled to participate in&#xD;
           the study. Written consent would be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding Patients are randomised to either&#xD;
           LI-ESWT or sham therapy in a ratio of 1:1. Randomisation is performed with a random&#xD;
           number table. The designated operator who perform the procedure is not blinded. Patients&#xD;
           were blinded throughout the procedures, during clinical follow-up and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Intervention Patients would undergo a 4-week washout period of oral&#xD;
           phosphodiesterase inhibitors after recruitment. Severity of ED would be assessed by the&#xD;
           International Index of Erectile Function - Erectile Function Domain (IIEF-EF) &amp;&#xD;
           International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaires and Erection Hardness&#xD;
           Score(EHS) after the washout. Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) and rigidity would be&#xD;
           measured by the Rigiscan at the night prior to the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All procedures would be performed by a designated nurse consultant(co-investigator) in&#xD;
           an office setting using an electromagnetic linear shockwave machine. The nurse&#xD;
           consultant has received overseas andrology training, as well as on-hand machine&#xD;
           operation training by ESWT product specialist. Patient would be positioned in a supine&#xD;
           position. Shockwaves would be delivered to the stretched penis at proximal, mid and&#xD;
           distal penile shaft and bilateral crura of penis. (Energy: 0.1-0.25 mJ/mm2; 3000pulses&#xD;
           per session; Frequency 3Hz) Treatment consists of 6 sessions over 5 weeks in total. It&#xD;
           would be a twice-weekly treatment with one-week interval of resting period. Patient&#xD;
           would be discharged home after each treatment session. Sham therapy would be given with&#xD;
           a modified probe which no shockwave would be emitted. A working noise would still be&#xD;
           generated which mimicked active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post-procedure management Clinical assessment would be conducted at week 4, week 26 and&#xD;
           week 52 after completion of treatment. NPT would be measured at week 4. At all follow-up&#xD;
           the IIEF-EF and EHS would be assessed. Any complications would be assessed and&#xD;
           documented according to Clavien-Dindo classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sample Size Calculation In a recent meta-analysis, the mean improvement in IIEF-EF was&#xD;
           4.23. At 5% significance level and 80% power, 33 subjects were needed in each treatment&#xD;
           and sham group (Total 66 subjects). Overall 84 subjects would be recruited with 20% of&#xD;
           drop out expected (i.e. 42 subjects in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Study Period The expected study period would last for 44 months, including 30 months of&#xD;
           subject enrolment, 2 months of treatment and 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical Analysis The results would be analysed according to intention-to-treat&#xD;
           principle. Mann-whitney U test would be used to study the IIEF-EF results, as well as&#xD;
           all other non-parametric continuous variables in secondary outcomes. Chi-square test&#xD;
           would be used for categorical variable, independent samples t-test would be used for&#xD;
           parametric continuous variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Concern All identifiable personal data will be anonymised and will follow the HA&#xD;
      policy on handling of patient data privacy.&#xD;
