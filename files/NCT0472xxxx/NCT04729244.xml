  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are looking to conduct a study looking at the effects of cannabidiol (CBD)&#xD;
      from Hemp Oil in patients with Chronic pain, anxiety and insomnia. It is believed that CBD&#xD;
      will improve pain anxiety and sleep quality and reduce opioid use. The study will last a&#xD;
      total of 4 weeks and involve onsite visits in addition to weekly pain assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposal is to conduct a interventional cohort pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of CBD on the management of chronic pain, anxiety and insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be pre-screened from new and existing patients as well as from referral sites&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of chronic pain. Potential subjects will be screened for pain &gt;3 months who&#xD;
      are using oral analgesic including narcotics and or physical therapy to reduce pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive a comprehensive history and&#xD;
      physical exam and undergo informed consented at the Screening Visit. Baseline survey data&#xD;
      will be collected including various pain rating surveys. The patient's will be monitored for&#xD;
      compliance to complete the weekly rating using a research phone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive either CBD tincture or CBD topical cream.This will be dosed daily for a&#xD;
      total of 4 weeks. Patients will be evaluated on three pain rating scales: On initial&#xD;
      evaluation and 4th week evaluation, patients will be asked to fill out The Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory and Pain Disability Index. Once weekly, a Numeric Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On initial evaluation and at 4th week evaluation, narcotic dosing will be reviewed and&#xD;
      recorded. Quality of sleep and anxiety scale will also be recorded for the four weeks using&#xD;
      the Hamilton Anxiety scale and Sleep Quality Assessment at the start and end of the 4 weeks.&#xD;
      At initiation and conclusion of study blood work to evaluated levels of CBD in each patient.&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for side effects as well as records of pain medication use&#xD;
      throughout the duration of the study&#xD;

    <description>Pain will be reported weekly using the Numeric Rating Scale. On initial evaluation and 4 week evaluation, patients will be asked to fill out The Brief Pain Inventory and Pain Disability Index.&#xD;
The primary study endpoint will be compared between groups using the area under the curve.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Anxiety scale will be used to assess change in anxiety score at the beginning and end of the study. The two scores will be used to assess any change in anxiety.&#xD;
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) Assessment on 14 items on a scale of 0 to 4. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4(severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe. A higher score is a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Insomnia Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep Quality Assessment at the beginning and end of the study and the difference will be used to assess any change.&#xD;
Sleep Quality Assessment is based on The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), an effective clinical tool to assess sleep quality and efficiency.&#xD;
It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month.&#xD;
Scores for each question range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more acute sleep disturbances The sum of the scores of the seven components is used to compute the global sleep quality score, ranging in value from 0 to 21. A score of 0 indicates no sleep difficulties, while more-severe sleep difficulties correspond to higher values for the global and component scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Narcotic use reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using Prescription Drug Monitoring Program at the beginning and end of the study to asses any change in medication.&#xD;
The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) is an online database that houses prescribing and dispensing data for patients per state.&#xD;
It calculates MME. The total daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME) will be displayed on a patients profile.&#xD;
0 means no narcotic use and higher values show high narcotic use which is a worse outcome.</description>
