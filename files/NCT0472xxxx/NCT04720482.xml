  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP) and Pupillary Light Reflex (PLR) are key methods for&#xD;
      neurologic prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Both methods have low&#xD;
      false positive rates.Though they assess different functions of the brain, they should both be&#xD;
      sensitive to severe anoxic/ischemic injury from cardiac arrest. The aim of this observational&#xD;
      prospective study with an estimated recruitment of 50 patients is to examine the&#xD;
      interrelation between PLR and SSEP. PLR will be assessed by Neurological Pupil index (NPi)&#xD;
      and SSEP by the cortical N20 response to stimulation of the median nerve.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anoxic/ischemic brain injury is the most common cause of death among comatose survivors of&#xD;
      cardiac arrest (CA). The neurological prognosis of these patients is assessed using the&#xD;
      multimodal prognostication model, which includes several methods. Somatosensory Evoked&#xD;
      Potentials (SSEP) and Pupillary Light Reflex (PLR) are key methods for prognostication, as&#xD;
      both have low false positive rates. Though they assess different functions of the brain, they&#xD;
      should both be sensitive to severe anoxic/ischemic injury from cardiac arrest. The primary&#xD;
      aim of the study is to describe the association between PLR quantified as the Neurological&#xD;
      Pupil index (NPi) and bilateral absence of the cortical SSEP signal in patients remaining&#xD;
      comatose after cardiac arrest. The secondary aim is to define a NPi cut-off value that&#xD;
      renders a false positive rate (FPR) of less than 5% for a bilaterally absent SSEP response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An explorative, prospective, observational, cohort of 50 adult (&gt;18 years) comatose survivors&#xD;
      of CA admitted to the intensive care unit at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The results&#xD;
      from routine SSEP performed &gt; 48 hours after CA and PLR assessed using NPi calculated by&#xD;
      automated pupillometry are compared. Neurological outcome at hospital discharge is classified&#xD;
      using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), where poor neurological outcome is defined by mRS 4-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to find a significant difference in NPi of 0.7 with a power of 95% with two-sided&#xD;
      Fisher's non-parametric permutation test, 45 patients are needed assuming allocation 2:1 and&#xD;
      unequal SD in the groups 0.37 and 0.67, calculated from the IQR above, and significance level&#xD;
      0.01. To account for uncertainty within these estimates, we aim to include 50 patients with a&#xD;
      complete protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-curve) will be used to find the NPi cut-off&#xD;
      values resulting in a false positive rate of less than 5% for absent SSEP to predict poor&#xD;
      neurological outcome. NPi values below the cut-off i.e., values consistent with poor outcome,&#xD;
      will be used to calculate the predictive value for SSEP at its given prevalence. Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test will be used to assess correlation between NPi and SSEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clear correlation between the absence of cortical SSEP response and NPi values will permit&#xD;
      application of the adequate method to the individual patient. This may also enable&#xD;
      rationalisation of the multimodal assessment of the neurological prognosistication using a&#xD;
      smaller number of methods. In clinical practice, this may render the prognostication of&#xD;
      neurological function of comatose patients after cardiac arrest more accurate, as well as&#xD;
      more cost- and time efficient.&#xD;
