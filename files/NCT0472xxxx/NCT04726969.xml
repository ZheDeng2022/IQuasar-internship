      This study is a double-blind randomized controlled superiority trial aiming at providing&#xD;
      evidence on the efficacy and safety of co-administered moxidectin and albendazole versus&#xD;
      albendazole monotherapy (standard of care) against whipworm (T. trichiura) infections in&#xD;

      with albendazole-ivermectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As measure of efficacy of the treatment the cure rate (percentage of egg-positive subjects at&#xD;
      baseline who become egg-negative after treatment) will be determined 14-21 days&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind randomized clinical trial which aims at providing evidence on&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of co-administered moxidectin and albendazole versus albendazole&#xD;
      monotherapy (standard of care) against T. trichiura infections in adolescents and adults&#xD;
      (12-60 years) in Côte d'Ivoire. Additionally, this study aims to substantiate evidence on the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of co-administered ivermectin and albendazole compared to albendazole&#xD;
      monotherapy against T. trichiura in the same age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to comparatively assess the efficacy in terms of cure&#xD;
      rate (CR) against T. trichiura infections among adolescents and adults (aged 12 to 60 years)&#xD;
      of moxidectin/albendazole combination therapy and albendazole monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the trial are to compare the egg reduction rates (ERR) of these&#xD;
      treatment regimens (moxidectin/albendazole combination therapy vs. albendazole monotherapy)&#xD;
      against T. trichiura, to assess the CRs and ERRs in T. trichiura-infected participants given&#xD;
      ivermectin/albendazole combination therapy compared to those given albendazole monotherapy,&#xD;
      to determine the CRs and ERRs of the drugs in study participants co-infected with A.&#xD;
      lumbricoides and hookworm, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment&#xD;
      regimens. In addition, this study aims to characterize population pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions of the study drugs albendazole and ivermectin in T. trichiura infected&#xD;
      adolescents (aged 12 to 20 years), to evaluate pharmacogenomics of ivermectin using whole&#xD;
      genome sequencing, and to assess the effect of the gut microbiota on pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      parameters and treatment outcome (CRs and ERRs), and drug-specific off-target effects of&#xD;
      anthelmintic treatment on gut microbial communities in post-treatment samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent from individual/parents and/or caregivers, the medical&#xD;
      history of the participants will be assessed with a standardized questionnaire, in addition&#xD;
      to a clinical examination carried out by the study physician before treatment. Enrollment&#xD;
      will be based on two stool samples, which will be collected, if possible, on two consecutive&#xD;
      days or otherwise within a maximum of 5 days. All stool samples will be examined with&#xD;
      duplicated Kato-Katz thick smears by experienced laboratory technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of participants into the three treatment arms will be stratified according to&#xD;
      intensity of infection. All participants will be interviewed before treatment, 3 and 24 hours&#xD;
      and 14-21 days after treatment about the occurrence of adverse events. The efficacy of the&#xD;
      treatment will be determined 14-21 days post-treatment by collecting another two stool&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will include all participants with primary end point data (available&#xD;
      case analysis). Supplementary, a per-protocol analysis will be conducted. CRs will be&#xD;
      calculated as the percentage of egg-positive subjects at baseline who become egg-negative&#xD;
      after treatment. Differences among CRs between treatment arms will be analysed using crude&#xD;
      and adjusted logistic regression modeling (adjustment for age, sex and weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geometric and arithmetic mean egg counts will be calculated for the different treatment arms&#xD;
      before and after treatment to assess the corresponding ERRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bootstrap resampling method with 5,000 replicates will be used to calculate 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (CIs) for differences in ERRs.&#xD;
