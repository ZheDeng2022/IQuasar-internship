      This study will include 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I, Part A: Repeated intra-tumoral (IT) administrations of BT-001 as a single&#xD;
           agent, in patients with metastatic/advanced solid tumors; dose-escalation will be&#xD;
           employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I, Part B: Repeated IT administrations of BT-001 in combination with intravenous&#xD;
           (IV) infusions of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase IIa: Repeated IT administrations of BT-001 in combination with IV infusions of&#xD;
           pembrolizumab in several cohorts of patients with defined metastatic or advanced solid&#xD;
           tumor conditions.&#xD;
