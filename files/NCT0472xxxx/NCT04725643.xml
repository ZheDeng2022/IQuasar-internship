      The investigators will conduct an observational study comparing the number of bleeding days&#xD;
      before and after contraceptive implant replacement.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is very limited information regarding number of bleeding days after replacement of the&#xD;
      contraceptive implants. More detailed information on this topic will help clinicians counsel&#xD;
      patients and help women decide if they would like to pursue contraceptive implant&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study of (N=50) among women replacing&#xD;
      their contraceptive implant. The primary outcome of the study is the difference in number of&#xD;
      bleeding days between the 4-week periods before and after implant replacement. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include satisfaction with bleeding. Additionally, a secondary outcome will be the&#xD;
      number of bleeding days in month 2 and month 3 after replacement of the contraceptive&#xD;
      implant. The outcomes will be measured in bleeding diaries and satisfaction surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a text messaging application, the investigators will send the participants hyperlinks&#xD;
      to the diaries/surveys at the stated time points. Participants will report if they had&#xD;
      bleeding and the amount based on the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (Higham). Participants&#xD;
      will complete weekly surveys regarding their satisfaction with their bleeding utilizing a&#xD;
      Likert scale. The investigators will also ask participants to complete a survey regarding&#xD;
      their satisfaction with their bleeding at end of month 2 and at the end of month 3 after&#xD;
      replacement of their contraceptive implant.&#xD;
