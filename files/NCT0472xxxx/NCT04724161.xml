      This study outlines a plan for conducting a routine assessment of malaria infection&#xD;
      prevalence and intervention coverage using antenatal care (ANC) attendees. This will be a&#xD;
      non-randomized assessment of the potential to use pregnant women attending their first ANC&#xD;
      visit as a pragmatic sentinel population to monitor prevalence of malaria and the coverage of&#xD;
      malaria control interventions. The use of a questionnaire, to include standard malaria rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic testing, will be piloted with consenting women attending their first ANC visit at&#xD;
      21 individual health facilities across three of the New Net Project pilot study districts in&#xD;
      western Mozambique: seven facilities each from Changara, Chemba, and Guro Districts. The&#xD;
      results of the ANC questionnaires will be analyzed to see how well they correlate to similar&#xD;
      malaria prevalence and intervention coverage estimates obtained during the contemporary&#xD;
      community-based cross-sectional surveys administered during New Net Project pilot evaluation&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the New Nets Project, Mozambique is deploying next-generation ITNs through mass&#xD;
      campaigns in pre-determined provinces. The present study aims to leverage planned New Nets&#xD;
      Project cross-sectional surveys and strengthened routine case surveillance data in three of&#xD;
      the study districts (Changara, Guro, and Chemba) to assess (1) whether the malaria infection&#xD;
      prevalence data collected during ANC surveillance correlates with the cross-sectional survey&#xD;
      estimates of community infection prevalence in children 6 to 59 months and (2) if&#xD;
      intervention coverage data (particularly ITN ownership and use) collected from ANC&#xD;
      surveillance are valid and representative of the population as a whole. These additional data&#xD;
      could catalyze a new model of surveillance for malaria, and greatly simplify evaluation of&#xD;
      the impact of new interventions, as ANC surveillance could potentially replace or supplement&#xD;
      cross-sectional household surveys and provide more granular and timely data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pregnant women attending first ANC visit at seven health facilities in each study&#xD;
      district will be eligible for enrollment. Potential participants will be approached during&#xD;
      their visit by a health facility worker. During group counselling sessions at initial intake,&#xD;
      women will be informed of this pilot surveillance activity, and written informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from each woman individually prior to routine ANC testing. All consenting women&#xD;
      attending ANC first visit at a participating health facility will be tested for malaria using&#xD;
      an RDT and asked to complete a study questionnaire which will include questions about the&#xD;
      participant's net use, and care seeking behavior. It is expected to take 15 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Women who test positive for malaria will be given treatment according to national&#xD;
      guidelines. There is no additional benefit to individual participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Data from public health surveillance systems are used for multiple purposes, including&#xD;
      measuring the burden and monitoring the trends of a disease; guiding the planning,&#xD;
      implementation, and evaluation of prevention and control programs; and prioritizing the&#xD;
      allocation of health resources. In addition to routine health surveillance activities, public&#xD;
      health programs often collect additional data on health indicators, as well as intervention&#xD;
      coverage and program utilization, via nationally representative household surveys, such as&#xD;
      the Demographic and Health Survey and the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These household surveys provide data to help measure the burden of and monitor trends in&#xD;
      malaria, including data on the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in the&#xD;
      population. Additionally, because the surveys provide data on monitoring and coverage impact&#xD;
      indicators, they help guide the planning, implementation, and evaluation of prevention and&#xD;
      control programs, and prioritization of the allocation of national malaria control program&#xD;
      (NMCP) resources. Indeed, these representative surveys have become key tools for benchmarking&#xD;
      progress towards malaria control and elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the surveys are expensive to conduct and are limited by long periodic intervals&#xD;
      (e.g., every two to five years) and broad sampling strategies (i.e. generating national or&#xD;
      regional estimates of disease burden and intervention coverage) that fail to capture seasonal&#xD;
      trends or sub-regional heterogeneity, limiting their use for real-time or locally targeted&#xD;
      planning and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine health information systems, on the other hand, may provide a continuous, granular&#xD;
      data source representative of all age groups, primarily to help measure the burden and&#xD;
      monitor the trends of symptomatic malaria and other diseases. Many countries have implemented&#xD;
      standardized, electronic-based health management information system (HMIS), on platforms such&#xD;
      as District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2), which provide monthly health facility data&#xD;
      in real time. Despite being a potential source of valuable public health information, several&#xD;
      factors limit the utility of HMIS data and should be considered carefully. One key limitation&#xD;
      is the quality and representativity of the data being reported into HMIS, which is affected&#xD;
      not only by general data issues, but also by factors such as case management practices and&#xD;
      stockouts. These limitations require monitoring and health systems strengthening to overcome.&#xD;
      HMIS data on case numbers may also be biased because some symptomatic patients may not&#xD;
      present to a facility for care or may not seek care at all, and it can be difficult to&#xD;
      interpret the incidence because of uncertainties surrounding regional and local population&#xD;
      estimates. Further, not all health facilities report into HMIS; in many countries, the data&#xD;
      derive predominantly from public health facilities. If the population using alternative&#xD;
      sources of care for diagnosis and treatment of malaria (e.g., private facilities or&#xD;
      traditional healers) varies over time, or differs from those using public facilities, the&#xD;
      data trends observed in the HMIS may not be representative. Finally, as HMIS data are limited&#xD;
      to patients presenting with symptomatic illness, it is not possible to assess the burden and&#xD;
      epidemiology of asymptomatic infections, which are believed to represent the majority of&#xD;
      malaria infections in many populations. Representativeness and validity of routine data may&#xD;
      also be affected by diagnostic testing practices, which in turn may vary by health care&#xD;
      provider performance, seasonality, and availability of diagnostic commodities. Finally, data&#xD;
      on monitoring and coverage of malaria control interventions, such as insecticide treated bed&#xD;
      nets (ITNs), are not typically collected during routine health visits or reported in HMIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To build on the strengths and address the limitations of these two complementary surveillance&#xD;
      approaches, collecting data on parasite prevalence and coverage of malaria control&#xD;
      interventions during antenatal care (ANC) clinic visits may provide an easily accessible,&#xD;
      reliable, and representative source for monitoring population trends in malaria control with&#xD;
      a higher degree of granularity than is possible in nationally representative household&#xD;
      surveys. ANC coverage is high across sub-Saharan Africa; about 90% of women make at least one&#xD;
      ANC visit in each pregnancy. Only six countries reported that fewer than 80% of women&#xD;
      attended ANC at least once during their most recent pregnancy. Thus, pregnant women attending&#xD;
      their first ANC visit are likely to be representative of the overall population of pregnant&#xD;
      women. Pregnant women attending their first ANC visit are an ideal population for monitoring&#xD;
      trends in malaria prevalence over time, as monthly ANC attendance remains relatively constant&#xD;
      over time (minimal effects of seasonality) and is independent of malaria symptoms, thus&#xD;
      giving a general infection prevalence estimate similar to that of a community survey. It has&#xD;
      been demonstrated that malaria parasite prevalence among pregnant women correlates with the&#xD;
      prevalence among children under five years of age. This highlights the possibility that&#xD;
      pregnant women could be a good sentinel population for representative measures of trends in&#xD;
      malaria prevalence and raises the question of whether pregnant women would be a good source&#xD;
      of data on coverage of malaria control interventions that could be readily tracked over time.&#xD;
      Once scaled up, these systems may also provide these data more frequently, at a finer spatial&#xD;
      scale, and at a lower cost than household surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Mozambique, the NMCP is distributing new ITNs in mass campaigns. The New Nets Project is&#xD;
      funding community surveys in six provinces, including rapid diagnostic test (RDT) testing in&#xD;
      these provinces, to look at the impact of ITNs. This presents an important opportunity to&#xD;
      validate whether the coverage of malaria control interventions and measures of parasite&#xD;
      prevalence among pregnant women at first ANC visits is representative of the population at&#xD;
      large in Mozambique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In three districts, pregnant women presenting for their first ANC visit will be consented and&#xD;
      tested for malaria using an RDT and asked to complete a study questionnaire. A comparison of&#xD;
      results obtained at first ANC visits will be made to results from concurrent household&#xD;
      surveys conducted by the New Nets Project. If validated and found to be a sustainable change&#xD;
      to ANC visit procedures, data from the ANC sentinel population could be used to augment or&#xD;
      even replace much of the data collected through the use of Malaria Indicator Surveys, which&#xD;
      are expensive and infrequently conducted and generally only powered to the regional level.&#xD;
      This data could then be triangulated with malaria burden data from the outpatient department&#xD;
      to understand variation in community prevalence (as measured through ANC) and malaria&#xD;
      clinical incidence, thereby guiding programmatic decision-making and response.&#xD;
