  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soybean peptides are a mixture of active peptides obtained from the hydrolysis of soybean&#xD;
      protein, which have biological activities such as antioxidant, blood pressure lowering,&#xD;
      anti-fatigue and lipid lowering, etc. They can regulate food intake, increase satiety, and&#xD;
      reduce fat body ratio by reducing cholesterol and triglyceride content and stimulating CCK&#xD;
      secretion.Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a set of linoleic acid with conjugated&#xD;
      unsaturated double bond, the location and structure of the isomers have been approved by the&#xD;
      ministry of health in China as a new resource food , widely used in areas such as health care&#xD;
      products, functional foods and food additives, animal experiments showed that it has reduce&#xD;
      tumor, atherosclerosis, obesity risk.Therefore, in this study, the effect of conjugated&#xD;
      linoleic acid combined with soybean peptide on overweight and obese people was investigated&#xD;
      in a randomized controlled manner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To test the effects of combined supplementation of soybean peptide and conjugated&#xD;
      linoleic acid on body fat, liver fat and muscle content of overweight and obese people;Aim 2:&#xD;
      To test the effects of combined supplementation of soybean peptide and conjugated linoleic&#xD;
      acid on blood lipid, blood glucose, fat or inflammatory factors in overweight and obese&#xD;
      people; Aim 3: Test the impact of the above interventions on safety indicators (safety&#xD;
      indicators: liver and kidney function, self-reported adverse reactions or diseases). Aim 4:&#xD;
      To provide scientific basis for the development of functional food for weight loss and muscle&#xD;
      gain.The public health significance of this research is that find a new functional food for&#xD;
      weight loss and muscle gain.&#xD;
