  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib trial with SAR439459, a TGF-beta inhibitor, in combination with&#xD;
      cemiplimab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (advanced) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Inhibiting TGF-beta&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread and may sensitize cancers&#xD;
      to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The objective of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      this drug combination is effective in shrinking cancers, keeping them from growing, helping&#xD;
      patients live longer, and to see if the drug combination is safe.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the anti-tumor activity of the combination of anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      SAR-439459 (SAR439459) and cemiplimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To confirm the safety and tolerability of the combination of SAR439459 and cemiplimab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), median&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) and duration of response (DoR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination of SAR439459 and&#xD;
      cemiplimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive SAR439459 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and cemiplimab IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes on day 1 starting cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, then&#xD;
      every 12 weeks until progression of disease is determined or patient receives additional&#xD;
      anti-neoplastic medication.&#xD;
