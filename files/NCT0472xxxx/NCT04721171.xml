  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that 1) Neurostimulation via a novel auricular percutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      field stimulation (PENFS) device is a safe, non-invasive opioid-sparing alternative therapy&#xD;
      for severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting associated with CVS and will reduce the need&#xD;
      for opioids. We also hypothesize that 2) PENFS reduces the length of stay (LOS), and improves&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. We propose the following specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Investigate the efficacy of PENFS compared to a sham in patients with CVS seen in the&#xD;
      ED or in the clinic or hospitalized with an acute CVS episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate reduction in abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting using validated tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obviate or reduce the need for opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduce the length of hospital stay and improve patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach will specifically address the current opioid problem using a novel,&#xD;
      non-invasive neurostimulation therapy with proven efficacy for opioid withdrawal. Long-term,&#xD;
      it may improve health care outcomes and significantly reduce overall health care costs.&#xD;

      Opioid use in CVS and the critical need for opioid sparing therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the lack of knowledge about pathophysiology and evidence-based therapies, patients are&#xD;
      often hospitalized to treat symptoms of CVS. During an episode, patients present with severe&#xD;
      vomiting and abdominal pain and are treated empirically with IV fluids, antiemetics,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, and opioids. Estimates of opioid use range from 23%-27% in adults with CVS.&#xD;
      Patients are often dissatisfied with the level of analgesia as recurrent opioid use results&#xD;
      in tolerance and dependence. This often undermines the physician-patient relationship and&#xD;
      patients even leave against medical advice out of frustration with what they perceive as&#xD;
      ineffective care. This can lead to worse outcomes including recurrent hospitalizations,&#xD;
      morbidity and increased health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from a study by our group reveals that of 101 patients hospitalized with CVS&#xD;
      at Froedtert Hospital, chronic opioid therapy is associated with a two-fold increased risk of&#xD;
      hospitalization (RR 2.22, CI 1.1-4.4, P=0.02) and three-fold increase in hospital length of&#xD;
      stay (LOS) (RR 3.43, CI 1.26-9.34, P=0.01). In a study of 132 CVS patients, opioid use was&#xD;
      associated with non-response to amitriptyline (53% vs 15%, p&lt;0.05), a prophylactic therapy&#xD;
      used in CVS. This in turn was associated with increased frequency and duration of CVS&#xD;
      episodes per year and increased number of hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits&#xD;
      at baseline (18% vs 15.2%, p&lt;0.05). Hence there is an urgent need for an opioid-sparing,&#xD;
      non-invasive strategy to treat CVS symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, CVS is common and disabling and is associated with significant health care costs.&#xD;
      Our proposed project using a novel, non-invasive device to treat CVS will also address the&#xD;
      current opioid crisis.&#xD;

The Bridge device delivers low voltage (3.2), continuous stimulation for 5 days (around the clock) in alternating frequencies (1-10Hz) with an impulse interval of 100ms/2 sec. This is placed on the ear as per standard protocol at the beginning of the study and removed by the patient after 5 days.</description>
