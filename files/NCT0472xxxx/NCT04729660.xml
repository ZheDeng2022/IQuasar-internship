  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mutational falsetto is a functional voice disorder involving a failure to transition from the&#xD;
      high-pitched voice of childhood to the lower-pitch ed voice of adolescence and adulthood. In&#xD;
      the recent years, kinesio taping has begun to be employed for treating dysphonia patients. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that, because the kinesio taping relaxes the suprahyoid muscles and pushes the&#xD;
      larynx backward, it could also be used as a therapy of mutational falsetto. This study aimed&#xD;
      to assess of efficacy of the kinesio taping on male patients suffering from mutational&#xD;
      falsetto.&#xD;

    <measure>The outcomes of fundamental frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It was analyzed with noise harmonic ratio, jitter and shimmer that were calculated by computer software. Typical average values for the frequencies are 120 Hz for men and 210 Hz for women. The lower frequencies show masculine voice. The higher frequencies show feminine voices.</description>
