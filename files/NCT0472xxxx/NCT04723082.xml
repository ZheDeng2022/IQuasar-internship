  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic is a major public health problem. Weight gain is strongly associated&#xD;
      with an increase in the incidence of complex health conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D),&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancers. Behaviours linked to food and beverage&#xD;
      consumption can greatly affect body weight. Frequent consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages&#xD;
      such as carbonated soft-drinks, energy and sport drinks, fruit juices from concentrate, soda&#xD;
      and flavoured milk and water is considered to be an unhealthy dietary behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate how variations in an individual's genes may impact their&#xD;
      consumption of SSBs and thus body fatness. Specifically, the project will aim to investigate&#xD;
      whether genetic variation in the taste receptors TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 can influence an&#xD;
      individuals' perception and liking of a sweet palate and their intake of SSBs in UK. This&#xD;
      study will be an experimental study that evaluates human body composition by different&#xD;
      measurements. Additionally, two different biomarkers will be used for the study, such as&#xD;
      blood and urine samples. Blood samples is preferred source for DNA test rather than saliva.&#xD;
      Urine samples will be used to look at the sugar level in the human body and water level.&#xD;
      Around 128 adult volunteers will be recruited from Aberdeen, UK to participate in the study,&#xD;
      which will take approximately one week to complete for each individual.&#xD;

      To achieve this study recruited volunteers (n=128), aged 18 years and older will visit the&#xD;
      Rowett Institute at the University of Aberdeen for one occasion, their body composition will&#xD;
      be measured by 4 methods: DXA, BOD POD, Tanita scales and deuterium dilution and their&#xD;
      consumption of SSBs will be assessed using 24h dietary recall (once in the lab and once at&#xD;
      home over the phone). In addition, a urine sample will be collected and assessed for&#xD;
      potential markers of sugar. Individuals will have a blood sample (5 ml) taken to determine&#xD;
      genetic variation in their taste receptors and they will also undergo a taste test using&#xD;
      randomised tasting of a panel of 9 different sugar solutions measured in triplicate (in total&#xD;
      they will taste 27 little cups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will advise all the study subjects to come to a designated room in the Rowett&#xD;
      Research Institute to complete the measurement regime at a pre-determined time between 6:30&#xD;
      am - 3:00 pm on their appointment day with about 2 participants per day. Each subject will&#xD;
      take 4 hours to complete. Volunteers will complete informed consent before starting&#xD;
      participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-h recall of SSB intake (face to face and phone interview)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deuterium dilution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early morning urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measuring weight and height (BMI)&#xD;

    <description>Consumption of SSBs and other factors such as dietary behaviour and sociodemographic were examined previously among children and adults. Excessive consumption of SSBs in children, adolescents and adults strongly contribute to an increased risk of developing several health conditions. Statistical data that has been collected over time show the association between the consumption of SSBs and increased body weight. Genetic variation of an individual's taste receptors also plays a significant role in their preferences, and thus consumption of sugar and thus SSBs.</description>

      The researcher and her supervisions are aware about the DXA scan as a source of ionising&#xD;
      radiation and choosing the Rowett institute to conduct the study because it has a radiation&#xD;
      protection supervisor. There a separate DXA scan information sheet required participants&#xD;
      signature. The researcher also acknowledge the risks and ethical issues of taking biological&#xD;
      samples, wearing correct protective equipment is required and follow the procedures for&#xD;
      collection and handling samples. Participants will be fully aware about the study process&#xD;
      that providing in the information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of such samples and the use of the DXA is essential to the understanding of&#xD;
      how genetic variation impact human weight and SSBs consumption.&#xD;

        About 128 healthy adult volunteers are required to participate in the study. They need to&#xD;
        be living in Aberdeen City or Aberdeenshire. Participants will be requited by flyers&#xD;
        distributing from the public who live in Aberdeen city and Aberdeenshire. Also, from the&#xD;
        Energetics research group account on twitter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will volunteer to take part independently.&#xD;
