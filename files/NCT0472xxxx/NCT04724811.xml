  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with operatively treated&#xD;
      acetabular fractures benefit from early weight-bearing as tolerated. The study compares two&#xD;
      groups ( n = 25 each), which are randomised into either weight-bearing as tolerated or&#xD;
      touch-down weight-bearing for 6-8 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both study groups are stratified according to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of fracture (anterior approach vs anterior + additional posterior approach)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dislocated dome vs non-dislocated/ non existing separate dome fragment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, who are eligible to participate in the trial but choose not to participate in&#xD;
      randomisation are asked to enrol in a prospective cohort follow-up cohort. This is to examine&#xD;
      a potential participation bias in the RCT groups. These patients will not be counted into the&#xD;
      target amount of 50 RCT patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the past 20 years, the established treatment of dislocated acetabular fractures has been&#xD;
      surgical reduction and stable osteosynthesis. Good long-term results have been reported in&#xD;
      these patients. At present, the mobilisation of these patients after surgery is generally&#xD;
      restricted for several weeks ranging from 6-12 weeks touch-down- or non-weight-bearing with&#xD;
      no uniform protocol. However there is no scientific evidence for limiting post operative&#xD;
      weight-bearing. Accordingly the need of studies on weight-bearing surrounding periarticular&#xD;
      fractures has been advocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetabular fractures in the elderly population are becoming more common and pose significant&#xD;
      challenges for treatment including postoperative rehabilitation. Our aim is to investigate if&#xD;
      patients benefit of a more liberal weight-bearing regime postoperatively. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is measured at 1 year, secondary outcomes are followed up to 10 years postoperatively&#xD;
