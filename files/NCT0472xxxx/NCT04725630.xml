  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to adhere to a healthy dietary&#xD;
      pattern to maintain optimal blood glucose levels and overall health. The increasing costs of&#xD;
      healthy foods, however, is a barrier to maintaining healthful dietary patterns, particularly&#xD;
      for individuals with T2DM who are experiencing food insecurity (i.e., inadequate or insecure&#xD;
      access to food due to financial constraints). Lower diet quality may result in difficulties&#xD;
      maintaining optimal blood glucose levels, leading to higher rates of diabetes complications,&#xD;
      and increased acute care usage and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective strategies to address this issue are lacking despite the well-known impact of food&#xD;
      insecurity on maintaining optimal blood glucose levels. One way to address this problem is to&#xD;
      provide subsidies to purchase healthy foods through a subsidized healthy food prescription&#xD;
      program. These programs may help to reduce food insecurity and improve diet quality, thereby&#xD;
      improving blood glucose control and reducing diabetes complications over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and&#xD;
      maintenance (RE-AIM) of a subsidized healthy food prescription program among adults who are&#xD;
      experiencing food insecurity and persistent hyperglycemia through three concurrent studies; a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, an implementation study, and a modelling study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of a subsidized healthy food&#xD;
      prescription program compared to a healthy food prescription only in reducing blood glucose&#xD;
      levels among adults who are experiencing food insecurity and persistent hyperglycemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is vital for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to adhere to a healthy dietary&#xD;
      pattern to maintain optimal blood glucose levels and overall health. However, the increasing&#xD;
      costs of healthy foods is a barrier to maintaining healthful dietary patterns, particularly&#xD;
      for individuals with T2DM who are experiencing food insecurity (i.e., inadequate or insecure&#xD;
      access to food due to financial constraints). Lower diet quality may result in difficulties&#xD;
      maintaining optimal blood glucose levels, leading to higher rates of diabetes complications,&#xD;
      and increased acute care usage and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the adverse impact of food insecurity on maintaining optimal blood glucose levels is&#xD;
      well documented, effective strategies to address food insecurity among individuals with T2DM&#xD;
      are lacking. One approach to address this problem is to provide subsidies for individuals to&#xD;
      purchase healthy foods through subsidized healthy food prescription programs. These programs&#xD;
      may help to reduce food insecurity and improve diet quality, thereby improving blood glucose&#xD;
      levels and reducing diabetes complications over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, we will conduct three concurrent&#xD;
      studies (i.e. randomized controlled trial, implementation study, modelling study) to examine&#xD;
      the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of a subsidized&#xD;
      healthy food prescription program among adults who are experiencing food insecurity and&#xD;
      persistent hyperglycemia. The randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      subsidized healthy food prescription program compared to a healthy food prescription only in&#xD;
      improving average blood glucose levels, quantified via hemoglobin A1C, among adults who are&#xD;
      experiencing food insecurity and persistent hyperglycemia. Secondary outcomes include blood&#xD;
      glucose levels quantified via fructosamine, the proportion of patients with elevated&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1C (i.e. â‰¥ 8.5%), diet quality and skin carotenoid levels, intermediate clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (blood lipids, blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference, need for anti-hyperglycemic&#xD;
      medication/insulin) and patient-reported outcomes (psychosocial well-being, self-rated&#xD;
      health, diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes self-management, diabetes distress, diabetes&#xD;
      competing demands, perceived financial barriers to chronic disease care, hypoglycemic&#xD;
      episodes, household food insecurity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 404 adults who are experiencing food insecurity and persistent hyperglycemia (i.e.,&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1C 7-12%) from urban and rural primary care clinics will be randomized to a 6&#xD;
      month subsidized healthy food prescription intervention (n=202) or a healthy food&#xD;
      prescription comparison group (n=202).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subsidized healthy food prescription program consists of the following two core elements:&#xD;
      1) The one-time healthy food prescription pamphlet is a low literacy resource comprised of a&#xD;
      pre-printed healthy food prescription that outlines an evidence-based healthy dietary&#xD;
      pattern; 2) The healthy food subsidy provides $1.50/day/household member to purchase healthy&#xD;
      foods in participating supermarkets for 6 months. The intervention will be delivered over 6&#xD;
      months to allow sufficient time for dietary changes to be reflected in two A1c cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (0 months) and follow-up (6 months), participants will access a pilot-tested&#xD;
      web-based platform to provide responses to sociodemographic and health-related items, and a&#xD;
      variety of patient-reported outcomes, including food insecurity. To assess diet quality,&#xD;
      dietary intake will be assessed via two 24-hour dietary recalls at each time point using the&#xD;
      Automated Self-Administered Dietary Assessment Tool for Canada (ASA24-Canada-2018). Clinical&#xD;
      measurements (biochemical and physical measurements) will be obtained to assess blood&#xD;
      glucose, blood lipids, BMI, blood pressure, skin carotenoids, and waist circumference. Need&#xD;
      for anti-hyperglycemic medication/insulin will be quantified via administrative health&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
