      Purpose: This study aimed to compare patients' satisfaction with mandibular overdentures&#xD;
      retained by three-splinted implants and conventional complete dentures during a seven-year&#xD;
      follow-up period. Materials and Methods: Thirty edentulous male patients (mean age: 60 years)&#xD;
      were carefully selected and divided into two equal groups. All patients received a new set of&#xD;
      complete dentures. (Group I) patients received three implants in the anterior mandible and&#xD;
      were connected after three months with bars, clips and loaded. (Group II) patients' received&#xD;
      conventional complete dentures. Patients' satisfaction was recorded for both groups at three&#xD;
      weeks (baseline) and after 1, 3, 5 and 7 years. Patients were then asked to grade their&#xD;
      overdentures/dentures on a visual analog scale and written questionnaire to evaluate their&#xD;
      overall satisfaction. Results: satisfaction scores of Group I patients was found to be&#xD;
      statistically significantly higher than that of Group II patients (p &lt; .05) at 3, 5 and 7&#xD;
      years follow-up, meanwhile no statistically significant difference was found at baseline or&#xD;
      after 12 months. Conclusions: The long-term results suggest that three implants-retained&#xD;
      mandibular overdenture with a clip-bar attachment appears to be a successful rehabilitation&#xD;
      strategy which is superior to conventional dentures for patients with advanced ridge&#xD;
      resorption.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inclusion criteria stipulated that patients must have been wearing dentures on a&#xD;
             regular basis, have been edentulous for a minimum of 3-years, and are capable of&#xD;
             reading and writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  insufficient bone volume to install three 13mm. interforaminal implants (Group I),&#xD;
             insufficient interarch space. Patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, smokers,&#xD;
             psychological problems of removable denture acceptance, gag reflex, absence of a&#xD;
             maxillary complete denture and medical or physical considerations that would seriously&#xD;
             affect the surgical procedure (Group I) or the follow-up period were also excluded&#xD;
