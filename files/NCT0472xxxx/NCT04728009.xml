    <textblock>
      This study aimed to preliminarily determine safety and efficacy of longan and lingzhi&#xD;
      mushroom syrup on immune and inflammatory responses. Apparently healthy Thai adults (N = 8)&#xD;
      aged 18-60 years were recruited into a prospective, single-group study. All participants were&#xD;
      assigned to consume 5 mL of longan and lingzhi mushroom syrup daily for 12 weeks. Blood&#xD;
      concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), BUN&#xD;
      (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine (Cr), immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE), and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline (week 0), week 4, week 8, and week 12.&#xD;

    <description>Fresh fruit pulps of longan were stewed in hot water until they softened. No sugar and additives were added. The pulps were removed by filtration in order to obtain concentrated longan juice. After that, spray-dried powder of lingzhi mushroom extract was dissolved in water in the ratio of 1:2. To make the finished product, 99 g of longan juice was mixed with 1 g of the lingzhi extract in water. The sugar content of the syrup was 77 degrees Brix.</description>
