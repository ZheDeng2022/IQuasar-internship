  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthetic inhalation induction could be one of the most stressful experiences for children&#xD;
      during the perioperative period, with almost 50% of them showing anxiety. It is an essential&#xD;
      challenge for pediatric anesthesiologists on how to decrease anxiety for children in the&#xD;
      operating room (OR) environment and to facilitate a smooth induction of anesthesia. Various&#xD;
      factors like parental separation, unfamiliar surroundings, fear of physicians and needle&#xD;
      injections can increase their preoperative anxiety. The researchers conducted the current&#xD;
      study to investigate whether intranasal remimazolam can reduce anxiety in children before&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty children aged 1-5 years old were randomly allocated into three equal groups based on&#xD;
      the premedication routes: Group R with intranasal remimazolam, Group D with intranasal&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine and Group P with intranasal placebo, respectively.&#xD;
