  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is a high grade glioma (brain tumor) that is treated with surgery or&#xD;
      biopsy followed by radiotherapy (RT) given daily over 3 or 6 weeks with or without an oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Radiation is targeted to the visible residual tumor on magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) images plus a large margin of 15 to 30 mm to account for possible cancer cells&#xD;
      outside the visible tumor and for potential growth or shifts in tumor position throughout the&#xD;
      prolonged RT course. Standard RT uses MRI to create a reference plan (with large margins) and&#xD;
      treats that same volume every day. This exposes a large amount of healthy brain tissue to&#xD;
      radiation leading to toxicity and reduced quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new technology, the MR-Linac, combines an MRI scanner and a Linac (radiation delivery&#xD;
      machine) into one unit. This allows for &quot;adaptive&quot; RT by obtaining an updated MRI scan each&#xD;
      day just prior to treatment, adapting the RT plan to take into account any changes in the&#xD;
      tumor or the patient's anatomy on that given day. This allows for a smaller (5 mm) margin on&#xD;
      the visible tumor as its position can be tracked daily. The goal of this study is to use&#xD;
      adaptive RT with small margins to demonstrate that the local control of the visible tumor is&#xD;
      not compromised compared to the large volumes used with standard non-adaptive RT, while&#xD;
      determining whether smaller margins lead to decreased radiation toxicity and therefore&#xD;
      improved quality of life by minimizing radiation exposure.&#xD;
