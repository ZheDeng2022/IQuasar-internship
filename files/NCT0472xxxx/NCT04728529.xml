  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study aims to compare the recent septic shock management protocol from American&#xD;
      College of Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) to Ultrasound-guided Septic Shock Management (USSM)&#xD;
      protocol. USSM protocol laid on Doppler ultrasonography to evaluate stroke volume, cardiac&#xD;
      index, and systemic vascular resistance in each step of management to decide the proper fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation and vasoactive therapy; differs from ACCM protocol which use clinical finding&#xD;
      in its early step. ACCM protocol application elicits risk of improper therapy since clinical&#xD;
      sign per se often could not describe the certain cardiac output. This can be prevented&#xD;
      earlier by USSM protocol. The outcome compared of the two protocols is: mortality rate,&#xD;
      clinical parameter, macrocirculation hemodynamic parameter, laboratory microcirculation&#xD;
      parameter, and signs of fluid overload. The investigators hypothesized if the USSM protocol&#xD;
      had a better outcome and less fluid overload complication.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial to compare the usage of ACCM protocol and USSM&#xD;
      protocol in fluid resuscitation for septic shock pediatric patients. The USSM protocol is the&#xD;
      intervention, and the ACCM protocol is the control. This study implemented in septic shock&#xD;
      pediatric patients treated in the intensive care unit. Each patient will be randomized into 2&#xD;
      groups, the USSM group or the ACCM group. In the initial step, all patient in each group will&#xD;
      receive early acute/emergency therapy: oxygen support, vascular access, and fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation. The monitoring of the patient including clinical parameters and laboratory&#xD;
      examination for both groups, except Doppler ultrasonography that performed in each step of&#xD;
      management of the intervention group. The monitoring is performed every 15 minutes in the&#xD;
      first hour of resuscitation. If the patient show good response (fluid responsive shock), the&#xD;
      monitoring stops in 1 hour. In contrast, if the patient reveal fluid refractory shock, the&#xD;
      vasoactive agent will be administered and monitoring continues until 6 hours. All outcome&#xD;
      parameters, except mortality rate, will be recorded at 6 hours. The mortality rates will be&#xD;
      recorded at 72 hours and time of intensive care discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size in this study was calculated by clinical trial formula for mortality rate with a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 and study power of 0.2. From the calculation, the subject needed&#xD;
      is 170 patients for each group (total 340 subjects). The basic characteristics of the patient&#xD;
      will be analyzed descriptively. All parameter data will be analyzed statistically by&#xD;
      Statistical Product and Service Solution (SPSS) 20, preceded by normality test and&#xD;
      homogeneity test. The study analysis will be intention-to-treat. The mortality rate was&#xD;
      analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Data transformation will be performed if needed&#xD;
      in case of outlier data or out-of-range results.&#xD;
