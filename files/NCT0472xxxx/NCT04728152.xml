      We therefore propose a research project based on the prospective evaluation of miRNAs (blood&#xD;
      and salivary) in patients with endometriosis diagnosed (by clinical examination and imaging)&#xD;
      or suspected of endometriosis (clinical/radiological discordance) and in need of management&#xD;
      in routine care (surgical or medical PMA) in the Endometriosis Expert Center Hospital.&#xD;

        The study population consists of women between the ages of 18 and 43 with a formal&#xD;
        endometriosis diagnosis or suspicion of endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in the study are already receiving routine medical (PMA) or surgical care in the&#xD;
        Gynecology-Obstetrics and Reproductive Medicine Department of the hospital. All of these&#xD;
        patients already benefit from a validation of therapeutic indications in a&#xD;
        multidisciplinary consultation meeting (medical-surgical RCP or fertility).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patients concerned by the study are treated without any change in the course of care,&#xD;
        nor modification of the therapeutic indications, nor modification of the diagnostic tests&#xD;
        (imaging or biology) necessary according to the context, which are carried out according to&#xD;
        the recommendations of the HAS.&#xD;
