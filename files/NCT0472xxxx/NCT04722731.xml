  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to expand the evidence of prevention of anxiety disorders in children.&#xD;
      Children of anxious parents are at increased risk of developing anxiety disorders. Twin&#xD;
      studies support a direct environmental transmission of anxiety between parent and child, and&#xD;
      a main mechanism is suggested to be the parenting style of anxious parents, characterised by&#xD;
      criticism and rejection, overprotection and modelling of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take a novel approach to prevent childhood anxiety disorders by evaluating&#xD;
      the Confident Parents - Brave Children (CPBC) program, a parent program targeting anxious&#xD;
      parents, in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;

      RESEARCH QUESTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the CPBC-program effective in preventing childhood anxiety disorders within a period&#xD;
           of 12 and 36 months respectively, compared to a self-help parenting book?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the CPBC-program effective in preventing childhood anxiety symptoms within a period&#xD;
           of 12 and 36 months respectively, compared to a self-help parenting book?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the effect moderated by severity of parental anxiety, child anxiety symptoms at&#xD;
           baseline, or gender or age of the child?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the study effective in increasing parental self efficacy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the effect of CPBC-program mediated by changes in parental criticism and rejection,&#xD;
           overprotection, parental modelling of anxiety or parental accommodation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the CPBC-program cost-effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN The first study is a full scale parallel randomised controlled trial (allocation ratio&#xD;
      1:1). This study will include follow-up assessments after 12 and 36 months and will evaluate&#xD;
      the relative efficacy of the CPBC-program versus an active control group (self-help book).&#xD;
      The second part includes a mediation analysis and the third part is a within trial economic&#xD;
      evaluation comparing the outcomes and costs between the CPBC-program and control using two&#xD;
      types of analyses (cost-utility analysis and cost-consequence analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER To have an 80% power to detect a significant (p â‰¤ 0.05) small to moderate difference&#xD;
      (standardised mean difference = 0.4) the investigators will need to recruit 194 children.&#xD;
      Given an anticipated attrition of 10%, the investigators will aim at including a total of 216&#xD;
      children. Participants will be recruited through advertisements. The participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either (1) CPBC-program or (2) reading a self-help book.&#xD;
