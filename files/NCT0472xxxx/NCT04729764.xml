  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza (influenza for short) is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by&#xD;
      influenza virus. The symptoms of the disease range from mild, moderate to severe, and severe&#xD;
      cases require hospitalization and may die. According to estimates by the US Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention in 2018, influenza causes approximately 290,000 to 640,000&#xD;
      deaths worldwide each year. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of influenza has become a&#xD;
      serious public health problem.&#xD;

      The GP681 in this test is a prodrug of a polymerase acidic protein (PA, Polymerase Acidic&#xD;
      protein) inhibitor. Its metabolite GP1707D07 can selectively inhibit the cap-dependent&#xD;
      endonuclease of influenza virus and prevent influenza virus replication. Mechanism of action&#xD;
      against influenza virus. The results of previous non-clinical studies show that GP681 can&#xD;
      effectively inhibit influenza virus replication, has good safety, and has antiviral activity&#xD;
      1,000 times that of oseltamivir phosphate. It also has good antiviral activity against&#xD;
      oseltamivir resistant strains. And it is expected to have a longer half-life than oseltamivir&#xD;
      phosphate. Therefore, it is expected that a new type of PA inhibitor can be developed to&#xD;
      provide patients with influenza with a new mechanism of action, better efficacy, and higher&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This trial uses a double-blind technique, that is, neither the investigator nor the subject knows what kind of drug they are taking. The sponsor or its designated unit shall provide the trial drug and placebo to ensure that the placebo's shape, color, smell, taste, and weight are consistent with the trial drug, and the drug randomization and supply management system (RTSM) is used for drug randomization</masking_description>
