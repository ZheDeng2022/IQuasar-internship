      The purpose of this study is to develop biocompatible wireless electronic devices that will&#xD;
      allow continuous, non-invasive hemodynamic and physiology measurements in the ICU.&#xD;

      Screening: All ICU patients will be screened by the study team based on inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria through review of electronic medical records. For screening at Prentice&#xD;
      Women's Hospital, screening criteria will be automatically applied through the use of the&#xD;
      electronic data warehouse, and information from infants meeting this screening criteria will&#xD;
      be transferred to the study team through electronic data warehouse. A screening and&#xD;
      enrollment log will be kept to track ICU patients/parents who have been approached and agreed&#xD;
      or declined to participate in the study. The screening and enrollment log will be kept on the&#xD;
      Northwestern University housed REDCap server. Only the study team will have access to this&#xD;
      log. All non-ICU participants will be screened through question and answer with a parent or&#xD;
      guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device application: Standard devices will be used continuously in all subjects and this data&#xD;
      compared to that collected using novel wearable sensors suggested in this study. In the ICU&#xD;
      population, after patients are consented in the ICU, multiple wearable sensors (up to 5) will&#xD;
      be placed on the patient for the duration of the study. Multiple devices are required to&#xD;
      estimate BP. One or more devices will be placed on the chest or back, and one or more&#xD;
      additional devices will be placed peripherally (e.g. leg, foot, arm, hand, head, or ear).&#xD;
      Placing multiple devices will allow determination of which location provides the best signals&#xD;
      in specific ICU populations. These devices will be placed using a medical grade skin adhesive&#xD;
      similar to the ones used in the ICUs, which will minimize the risk of skin irritation or&#xD;
      allergic reaction. Alternatively, the investigators are currently testing a &quot;soft wrap-around&#xD;
      device&quot; (similar to that currently used for blood pressure monitoring in the premature&#xD;
      babies) with a sensor. The soft wrap-around device is composed of hypoallergenic cotton.&#xD;
      Overlying this cotton, and not touching the subject's skin, may include Coban wraps, paper&#xD;
      tape, or a Velcro adhesion mechanism. Given the very small size of premature infants in the&#xD;
      NICU, the investigators may incorporate this new technology as needed in the NICU. Each&#xD;
      device is encapsulated in medical grade materials and applied using medical grade adhesive.&#xD;
      The adhesives will be changed between uses. The device itself will be re-used. It will be&#xD;
      cleaned with Super Sani-Cloth between each use. In the ICU population, devices will be left&#xD;
      in place for up to 48 hours, but will be checked by study staff to ensure skin integrity and&#xD;
      signal quality at least once every 24 hours. In the non-ICU population, standard of care&#xD;
      devices will be attached to participants according to ICU standard of care procedures. The&#xD;
      wearable sensors will be placed in the same manner as outlined above but will be left in&#xD;
      place for only up to 3 hours during an outpatient study visit to the Center for autonomic&#xD;
      Medicine in Pediatrics (CAMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently upgraded a new firmware version activating the ability for&#xD;
      the sensor to continuously measure bioimpedance for respiratory rate. This function does not&#xD;
      require any modification to the physical device itself or the adhesive. However, the&#xD;
      bioimpedance functionality does require delivery of low amplitude sinusoidal current through&#xD;
      the electrodes of the chest unit. The frequency of the current is 4 kHz - a frequency range&#xD;
      used typically for human bioimpedance measurements by FDA cleared systems. The maximum&#xD;
      current delivered is 8 μA. These parameters are below commonly used body fat percentage&#xD;
      impedance analyzers that are widely commercially available. Furthermore, bioimpedance is&#xD;
      standardly used in NICUs / PICUs leveraging the ECG electrodes that are then displayed on&#xD;
      standard of care monitors. Commercially bioimpedance devices that are FDA approved inject&#xD;
      currents that are 10x greater than our system (e.g. the CoVa Monitoring System 2 for&#xD;
      continuous wearable sensing of thoracic impedance). Finally, the parameters in our sensor&#xD;
      follow IEC 60601-1-2 guidelines for electromagnetic safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video monitoring: In some participants, video monitoring of participant position and movement&#xD;
      will be utilized during the study. This is an optional, additional part of the study in which&#xD;
      families can choose to participate or not participate. If a family chooses to participate, a&#xD;
      video camera will be utilized to capture participant movement and position for the duration&#xD;
      of the study in the ICU or at CAMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cuff-based blood pressure: While the wearable sensors are attached to participants in both&#xD;
      the ICU and non-ICU populations, the participants will also be monitored with the normal&#xD;
      standard of care monitoring montage. In addition, during one 3- or 4-hour period while the&#xD;
      wearable sensors are attached to the patient, a member of the study team may take the&#xD;
      participant's BP using the ICU standard cuff-based method every 15 minutes. Cuff-based&#xD;
      measures typically happen every 15-60 minutes for standard clinical care, depending on the&#xD;
      stability of the patient and physician discretion. In the ICU cohort, if a standard clinical&#xD;
      cuff-based BP measure is taken during the 15-minute time epoch, the clinical measurements&#xD;
      will be used rather than obtaining a separate research measurement. Outside of this 3- or&#xD;
      4-hour window and for the remainder of the study duration in the ICU population, cuff-based&#xD;
      BP measures will be made only as frequently as needed for standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin temperature: While the wearable sensors are attached to the participant, skin&#xD;
      temperatures will be taken using a standard infrared thermometer. These measurements will be&#xD;
      made at the same interval as the above cuff-based BP, over the same 3- or 4-hour period by a&#xD;
      member of the study team. Outside of this 3- or 4-hour window, no skin temperature measures&#xD;
      will be made for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device data: Wearable sensors can stream data continuously using near field communication&#xD;
      (NFC) or Bluetooth technology. An encrypted laptop, iPad, or similar device will be left in&#xD;
      the patient or CAMP study room and used to capture the continuous data stream from the&#xD;
      wearable sensor. Additionally, wearable sensors can include onboard memory, and physiologic&#xD;
      streams may be recorded to this onboard memory until transfer to an encrypted laptop for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care data: In all participants where data from standard of care monitoring is&#xD;
      captured and stored using the BedMasterEx system (all PICU and CCU beds, some NICU beds),&#xD;
      these data will be used for comparison to data captured using EWP. In any participants where&#xD;
      data are not captured and stored using the BedMasterEx system, video recordings will be made&#xD;
      of the Phillips monitors using an encrypted mobile device. Within 48 hours, videos will be&#xD;
      downloaded and transferred to a HIPAA secure server. In NICU patient without BedMasterEx&#xD;
      data, the Somnostar system may be used to capture data for up to 4 hours of the study. All&#xD;
      study data will be stored on an encrypted laptop and/or secure networkfor analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin integrity: Before and after wearable sensors are placed on the participant, the&#xD;
      participant's skin integrity will be monitored using the ICU standard protocol, either the&#xD;
      Braden Q scale (≥6 months of age) and/or Neonatal Skin Risk Assessment Scale (NSRAS; &lt;6&#xD;
      months of age). Additionally, a member of the study team will use a validated skin integrity&#xD;
      scale to score participants' skin condition at sensor placement site before sensor placement&#xD;
      and immediately after sensor removal. At both of these time points, photographs will be taken&#xD;
      of the participants' skin at the site of sensor placement to document any skin changes that&#xD;
      occur during the period of wearable sensor wear. No faces will be photographed. Additional&#xD;
      skin scores and photographs may be performed/taken between 30 minutes and 24 hours after&#xD;
      sensor removal, as deemed necessary by the study and/or clinical team. The study team will&#xD;
      consult the ICU bedside care team or CAMP clinical team within 1 hour for any concerning&#xD;
      changes in skin integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: After the study period ends, the parents will be approached to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaires. These questionnaires will take less than 10 minutes to complete and are meant&#xD;
      to assess opinions on use of these devices in the ICUs. These questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed using REDCap or a printed version of the REDCap questionnaire. All questionnaire&#xD;
      data will be stored on the secure REDCap server housed by Northwestern University.&#xD;
