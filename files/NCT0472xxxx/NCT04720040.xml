  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of improving depressive symptoms by&#xD;
      applying tDCS for 6 weeks to patients with mild to moderate depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients received tDCS for 30 minutes with an intensity of 1.5 to 2 mA. tDCS was applied over&#xD;
      the left (anode) and right (cathode) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 5~7 times a week&#xD;
      and they were evaluated every 2weeks through questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>Average change of K-BDI-II at 6 weeks after treatment compare to the base respectively. This scale contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.The lower the total score, the better the symptoms.</description>

    <description>The BAI contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HRSD has been criticized for use in clinical practice as it places more emphasis on insomnia than on feelings of hopelessness, self-destructive thoughts, suicidal cognitions and actions. This scale contained 17items and each item is scored on a 3 or 5point scale. The lower the total score, the better the symptoms.</description>
