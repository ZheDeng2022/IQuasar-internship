  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease of aging. The&#xD;
      average age of PD onset is about 60 years old. Sarcopenia is common in PD patients, and one&#xD;
      in five Parkinson's patients is diagnosed with severe sarcopenia. The prevalence of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease is expected to increase in the coming decades as the population ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is a syndrome with progressive and widespread loss of skeletal muscle mass and&#xD;
      function, resulting in disability, loss of quality of life, and even death. Chronic disease,&#xD;
      long-term bedridden, unreasonable diet and drug therapy may be the important factors leading&#xD;
      to sarcopenia. China is gradually stepping into an aging society. Sarcopenia, as an&#xD;
      age-related disease, lacks effective treatment, and has become a global public health problem&#xD;
      and frontier research problem, bringing huge economic burden to families and society. The&#xD;
      decline of the musculoskeletal system in the elderly will lead to muscle atrophy and loss of&#xD;
      muscle strength, as well as decreased motor ability and balance ability, and ultimately lead&#xD;
      to a decline in the quality of life of the elderly. The European Working Group on Sarcopenia&#xD;
      recommends routine screening for sarcopenia in older people aged 65 and over in the&#xD;
      community. At present, screening for sarcopenia has not received enough attention in China,&#xD;
      and there is no unified standard for screening methods. The assessment of sarcopenia mainly&#xD;
      focuses on three aspects: muscle mass, muscle strength and muscle function. The main symptoms&#xD;
      of Parkinson's disease patients are postural tremor, bradykinesia and stiffness. The&#xD;
      existence of sarcopenia may lead to poor treatment control in PD patients, and the&#xD;
      recognition of sarcopenia in PD patients may have therapeutic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project through the cross-sectional survey of Parkinson's disease less muscle disease&#xD;
      prevalence situation, further clear according to Parkinson's disease staging classification&#xD;
      muscle disease prevalence, less and less by Logistic regression analysis to investigate the&#xD;
      muscle disease and Parkinson's disease progression and the correlation between the severity&#xD;
      of disease, for the next step nursing intervention strategies for implementation of PD&#xD;
      patients less muscle disease provides guidance basis, to prevent and delay the less muscle&#xD;
      disease is of great significance.&#xD;

      The research content PD patients admitted to the Department of Neurology of our hospital from&#xD;
      January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022 were evaluated according to the assessment criteria for&#xD;
      Asian sarcopenia patients (pre-sarcopenia, sarcopenia stage and severe sarcopenia stage), and&#xD;
      the muscle mass, muscle strength and functional status of each patient were recorded. To&#xD;
      understand the current situation of sarcopenia in PD patients, and to clarify the correlation&#xD;
      between sarcopenia and the course and severity of disease in Parkinson's disease patients,&#xD;
      and actively look for the influencing factors that can be intervened to guide the development&#xD;
      of nursing intervention measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research target This project through the cross-sectional survey of Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      less muscle disease prevalence situation, further clear according to Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      staging classification muscle disease prevalence, less and less by Logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis to investigate the muscle disease and Parkinson's disease progression and the&#xD;
      correlation between the severity of disease, for further implementation of PD patients with&#xD;
      less muscle disease provide guidance on the basis of nursing intervention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem to be solved Dyskinesia, static tremor, and myotonia are common features of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, which contribute to the loss of function and independence of Parkinson's&#xD;
      patients. The methods used for the assessment of sarcopenia in the general population (such&#xD;
      as the inability to measure walking speed and muscle strength) may not be applicable to PD&#xD;
      patients, so it is necessary to consult clinical experts and teachers in the implementation&#xD;
      process of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future research ideas&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Through a large sample size cross-sectional survey, this project clarified the&#xD;
           prevalence of sarcopenia in Parkinson's disease patients, collected data to clarify&#xD;
           related preventive measures to reduce the disease burden, and provided theoretical basis&#xD;
           for further implementation of nursing intervention strategies in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct further multicenter and cross-sectional investigation and study in the&#xD;
           future, so as to better define the correlation between Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
           sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To gradually develop sarcopenia assessment criteria for patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Research method, technical route and schedule The research methods Study Design This study&#xD;
      was a cross-sectional survey Subjects: PD patients who were admitted to the outpatient and&#xD;
      inpatient departments of the Department of Neurology of our hospital on January 1, 2021 and&#xD;
      December 31, 2022 were evaluated by H-Y grading scale and UPDRS-3 scale. Obtain basic patient&#xD;
      information by consulting patient's medical records or asking patient's family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included in the standard&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Meets MDS-2015 diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease; 2) The patient can stand&#xD;
      independently; 3) Informed consent of patients and their families. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Parkinson's disease syndrome caused by cerebrovascular diseases, encephalitis and trauma;&#xD;
      2) Progressive nuclear ascending paralysis, multiple system atrophy, Lewy body dementia and&#xD;
      other Parkinson's superposition syndrome; 3) severe physical disease; 4) diseases of the&#xD;
      digestive system; 5) wasting diseases such as infection and tumor 6) with severe mental&#xD;
      illness or cognitive impairment. Withdrawal criteria The patient requested withdrawal.&#xD;
      According to the literature, the incidence of sarcopenia in Parkinson's disease patients was&#xD;
      30.6%, the allowable error was 3%, the confidence was 0.95, and the qualified rate of the&#xD;
      questionnaire was 90%. Combined with the above data, the sample size was calculated to be 908&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research tools and evaluation indicators Patients' basic information was obtained by&#xD;
      consulting patients' cases or inquiring patients' family members through self-developed&#xD;
      patients' basic information table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General information: gender, age and course of disease of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutrition status assessment: height, weight, triceps skin fold thickness, leg&#xD;
           circumference, diet, MNA scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parkinson's disease symptom assessment H-Y scale, Parkinson's disease non-motor symptom&#xD;
           rating scale (NMSS), bell drawing test&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients were screened using the calf circumference and SARC-F questionnaire.&lt;SARC-F&gt; is&#xD;
           a simple patient-assessed screening questionnaire, which includes 5 items in total,&#xD;
           including strength, assisted walking, standing up, stair climbing, and the number of&#xD;
           falls in a year. A total score of 4 or more was considered positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sarcopenia evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluation of muscle mass Bioelectrical independence analysis (BIA) was used to evaluate&#xD;
           the patient's muscle mass (male &lt;7.0kg/m2, female &lt;5.7kg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Muscle strength assessment Hand-held gripper was used to measure the patient's main&#xD;
           hand. When measuring grip strength, let the patient exert his hand at a constant speed&#xD;
           to the maximum, and avoid visual feedback and verbal stimulation during exertion.&#xD;
           Posture: 1) Standing posture: feet naturally on the ground, arms naturally droop; 2)&#xD;
           Sitting posture: shoulder adducted neutral position, elbow flexed 90 degrees, upper arm&#xD;
           flat with chest, forearm in neutral position; 3) Prostrate: the upper arm ababducts, the&#xD;
           elbow is straight, and the body is 30 degrees, the forearm is neutral, the jaws up to&#xD;
           hold the gripper, the lower end of the gripper is supported on the bed, the upper limb&#xD;
           joints can not be flexed, moved, the gripper can not contact the body or press down.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The AWGS 2019 recommended diagnostic threshold for grip strength for sarcopenia is less&#xD;
           than 28.0kg for men and less than 18.0kg for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Physical function AWGS recommends the use of the 6M walking test, 5 times sitting up&#xD;
           test to assess physical function. The time required to walk 6m at a normal pace from the&#xD;
           beginning of the movement, without acceleration or deceleration halfway, and measured at&#xD;
           least 2 times to record the average speed. The bound value is 1.0m/s. If the patient was&#xD;
           unable to walk independently, a five-time sitting test was used to replace the walking&#xD;
           test, with a threshold of ≥12s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The prevalence of sarcopenia in PD patients was statistically analyzed; 2) The prevalence&#xD;
      of sarcopenia in PD patients stratified by age, sex and H-Y; 3) Correlation between&#xD;
      sarcopenia and other factors using Logistic regression model.5. Main innovations&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Currently, there are few studies on the prevalence of sarcopenia in PD patients at home&#xD;
           and abroad, and most of them are small sample size studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The prevalence of sarcopenia was determined according to the disease stage of PD&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Expected results and assessment indicators of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The prevalence of sarcopenia in PD patients was determined through a cross-sectional&#xD;
           survey of outpatients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between sarcopenia and disease&#xD;
           course, disease grade and other factors of Parkinson's disease, and to actively seek&#xD;
           potential causes, especially reversible causes, so as to provide guidance for the&#xD;
           further implementation of individualized lifestyle intervention (exercise combined&#xD;
           nutrition) and related health education for sarcopenia.&#xD;
