    <description>Self-Care Agency Scale was used to determine the self-care skills and abilities of the participants. It is a 5-point Likert-type scale with 35 items. Each item of the scale is scored between 0 and 4 (0= very uncharacteristic of me, 4= very characteristic of me). In the scale, 8 items (3, 6, 9, 13, 19, 22, 26, and 31) are scored reversely (0= very characteristic of me, 4= very uncharacteristic of me). The scale is evaluated over 140 points. In evaluation, the score over 120 points is defined as high, the score between 82 and 120 points is defined as moderate, and the score below 82 points is defined as low.</description>

    <measure>Change from the Genital Hygiene Behavior Scale Points at 7th and 15th weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at the end of the 7th week, at the end of the 15th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Genital Hygiene Behavior Scale was used to determine the genital hygiene behaviors of the participants.It is a 5-point Likert-type scale with 23 items consisting of three sub-dimensions. The sub-dimensions of the scale are &quot;General Hygiene (the first 12 items)&quot;, &quot;Menstrual Hygiene (items between 13 and 20), and &quot;Abnormal Finding Awareness (items between 21 and 23 )&quot;. Participants rate each item from 1 to 5 according to their suitability (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree). In the scale, 5 items (7, 14, 19, 20, 23) are scored reversely (1 = strongly agree, 5 = Strongly disagree). The highest score that can be obtained from the scale is 115 and the lowest score is 23. High scores indicate positive genital hygiene behavior.</description>
