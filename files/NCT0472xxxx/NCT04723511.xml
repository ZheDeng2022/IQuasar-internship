  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the effects of application of a twelve sessions of Global&#xD;
      Postural Re-education Technique (GPR) on Craniovertebral angle (CVA), functional abilities,&#xD;
      stability of sense of position, cognitive abilities and treatment satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample of 36 participants with a CVA less than 50 degrees will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of the two groups either receiving global postural reeducation added to traditional Kendall&#xD;
      exercises or a group that receives Kendall Exercises only. Treatment sessions will be&#xD;
      continued for a total of 12 sessions with a rate of 2-3 sessions per week. The effect of&#xD;
      these two treatments will be assessed by various variables including: forward head angle via&#xD;
      photogrammetry and Kinovea App, functional abilities via neck disability index, stability of&#xD;
      sense of position by Cervical Range of Motion instrument (CROM) ,cognitive abilities via&#xD;
      Stroop and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) tests and agreeability of treatment&#xD;
      techniques via treatment satisfaction scale.&#xD;

    <description>treatment techniques include corrective exercises both local and global to correct forward head posture.&#xD;
first session will be to educate participants the treatment sequence. This will be a session of Kendall exercises as described below. This will followed be performing GPR techniques of Anterior Chain stretch in the supine frog like position for 20 minutes followed by posterior chain stretch against the wall for another 20 minutes. This is repeated in the first 6 sessions. Staring from the seventh session the time of holding each position is decreased to 15 minutes and a third position (standing against the wall) is introduced and performed for 15 minutes. Starting from the eighth session a forth position of sitting on the floor position is introduced and performed for another 15 minutes. total of a session will then take a bout 90 minutes.</description>
