      BACKGROUND Knowledge about the perceived impact of stroke on survivors' lives is still scarce&#xD;
      in Pakistan due to the lack of translated and culturally adapted self-rating scales. The&#xD;
      stroke impact scale is a comprehensive self-reported outcome measure designed to assess the&#xD;
      quality of life following the stroke. Although the psychometric properties of SIS found to be&#xD;
      superior to the conventional generic quality of life scales, it has not been translated and&#xD;
      tested in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE To translate and cross-culturally validate the Urdu version of stroke impact scale&#xD;
      3.0 for Pakistan MATERIAL AND METHODS Established guidelines were followed for translation&#xD;
      and adaption of the Stroke impact scale 3.0. A prospective cohort of 116 patients with mild&#xD;
      to moderate stroke self-reported their recovery on the Urdu version of SIS 3.0. The patients&#xD;
      were concurrently evaluated on the established scales to assess the validity using the&#xD;
      Spearman correlation coefficient. ANOVA was used to determine the discriminant validity.&#xD;
      Ninety patients were consecutively re-evaluated to determine the test-retest reliability,&#xD;
      precision, minimal detectable change (MCD) and clinically minimally important difference. The&#xD;
      coefficients of ICC, Cronbach's alpha, and weighted kappa were calculated to establish the&#xD;
      stability and consistency of the scale. The receiver operating curve was used to estimate the&#xD;
      MCID of SIS-16 using global rating scale as an anchor.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 &quot;Change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, A week after the first assessment</time_frame>
    <description>A 59-item self-reported scale with 8 domains, scores of each domain range from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate a better health-related quality of life</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale-16 &quot;Change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, A week after the first assessment and at discharge upto 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 16 items of 4 physical function. Its score varies from 0 to 100 and higher score indicates more functioning of the patient</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-form 36, &quot;Change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, A week after the first assessment</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a generic HRQoL measure that includes 8 domains. Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, and higher values indicate better function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index, &quot;Change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, A week after the first assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index used to evaluate activities of daily living in stroke patients measures and measures 10 basic aspects of activities of daily living related to self-care and mobility: control of bowels and bladder, grooming, toilet use, feeding, transfer, mobility, dressing, stairs, and bathing. Its score ranges from 0 to 100, and lower scores indicate greater dependency.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement, &quot;Change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, A week after the first assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Composed of 30 items, score range from 0-100, measures physical function and higher score indicates more physical functioning of patient</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Rivermead Mobility Index, &quot;Change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, A week after the first assessment</time_frame>
    <description>A 15-items scale with each item score range from 0 to 5. Its score varies from 0 to 100 and higher score indicates more functioning of the patient</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global rating of change scale &quot;Change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>at discharge up to 12 weeks only, Please note it simply ask the patient how much change he has experienced over the course of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Measures self-perceived change in health status and the main purpose is to quantify the extent to which a patient has improved or deteriorated over time. Score lower than 0 means patient has deteriorated and more than 0 means patient has improved. Its score varies from -7 to +7</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, &quot;Change&quot; is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, A week after the first assessment, at discharge upto 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is 14 items scale for assessment of anxiety and depression. Scale consists of 7 items for depression and 7 items for depression and each item scored from 0 (no problem) to 3 (severe problem). Scores on individual items can be summed to calculate a score for anxiety and for depression and higher score is indicative of more depression and anxiety. Score of each sub scale varies from 0-21, where 0-7 means normal, 8-10 means mild, 11-14 means moderate, 15-21 means sever disorder.</description>
