      This study to examines the impact of anifrolumab on disease activity, immune phenotypes, and&#xD;
      development of neutralizing antibodies to quadrivalent influenza vaccine in patients with&#xD;
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). 10 patients with moderately to severely active SLE will&#xD;
      be treated with anifrolumab in addition to standard of care lupus treatments and 10 will&#xD;
      receive only standard of care medications. All will receive influenza vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our group preciously observed that lupus patients with an elevated interferon alpha signal&#xD;
      produced less neutralizing antibody to influenza vaccine which was directly or indirectly&#xD;
      associated with increased flares and autoantibody production after immunization. Anifrolumab&#xD;
      is an inhibitor of signaling through the Type I interferon alpha beta receptor. The current&#xD;
      study is an open label parallel group pilot study to examine the impact of anifrolumab on&#xD;
      development of neutralizing antibodies to quadrivalent influenza vaccine in patients with&#xD;
      SLE. 10 patients with moderately to severely active SLE will initiate treatment with&#xD;
      anifrolumab while continuing standard of care medications and 10 will receive only standard&#xD;
      of care medications. Two weeks after baseline all will receive influenza vaccine. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn at baseline (Day 0), just prior to immunization (Week 2), and Weeks 4,&#xD;
      8, 12 and 16. Disease activity, gene/cytokine expression, autoantibody production and patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes will also be tracked.&#xD;
