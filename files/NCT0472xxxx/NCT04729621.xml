  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate similar efficacy and safety between TVB-009 and&#xD;
      Prolia® (denosumab)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study to demonstrate similar&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of TVB-009 compared to Prolia® administered subcutaneously at doses of 60&#xD;
      mg every 26 weeks. Approximately 326 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either TVB-009 or Prolia®. At week 52, patients in the Prolia® arm will&#xD;
      be re-randomized 1:1 to either continue with a third dose of Prolia® or transition to TVB-009&#xD;
      and receive a single dose of TVB-009 in the transition period to assess immunogenicity and&#xD;
      safety after a transition from Prolia® to TVB-009. The total treatment duration for each&#xD;
      patient is 78 weeks.&#xD;
