  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Astigmatism is a common refractive error resulting from a toric-surfaced cornea which using a&#xD;
      toric soft contact lens could be one of the therapy options. Due to the numerous possible&#xD;
      combinations between sphere powers, cylinder powers, and cylinder axes, manufacturers of&#xD;
      disposable soft toric contact lenses limit their toric lens range, while still aiming to&#xD;
      cater to the majority of astigmatic patients. Due to that reason, the possibility of&#xD;
      astigmatism patients getting a different combination of power and axis with toric soft&#xD;
      contact lenses sold on the market will be high due to SKU limitations. This research aims to&#xD;
      ascertain the impact of altering cylinder power and axis on visual quality and convenience in&#xD;
      astigmatism participants using toric soft contact lens. The study was conducted at Kirana&#xD;
      Ciptomangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, starting in April 2020. The study is a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, participant-masked, crossover clinical trial where the participants were tested&#xD;
      for the following conditions on different days using full spherocylinder correction and&#xD;
      under-correction by 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 DC while maintaining spherical equivalence. Axis was&#xD;
      also misaligned between -30° and +30°, in 10° steps. For each visit, the patient was examined&#xD;
      visual acuity, contrast visual acuity using the Pelli-Robson, and assessed patient comfort&#xD;
      using the VAS method.&#xD;
