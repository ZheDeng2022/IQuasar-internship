    <measure>Change in anxiety as measured by GAD-2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) Scale has a total score ranging from 0 to 6 with a score of 3 being the cut-off for identifying possible cases and in which further diagnostic evaluation for generalized anxiety disorder is warranted.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety as measured by the FASA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Family Accommodation Scale - Anxiety (FASA) is a 9-item scale of measuring caregiver accommodation behaviors (modification of routines, facilitating avoidance, etc.) in light of youth anxiety. It has a total score ranging from 0 to 36 with the higher score indicating more frequent parental accommodation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Program Feedback Scale (PFS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS is a reliable, valid measure of the perceived acceptability of single-session interventions. It asks participants to rate acceptability and feasibility of an SSI they just completed. It has a total score ranging from 0 to 28 with the higher score indicating perceived acceptability and feasibility of the program.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Change in Problem-Solving, and Preparedness to Manage Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two questions (Schleider et al., 2020) will be used to assess change in ability to solve problems, and ability to manage distress. Participants will be asked, &quot;to what extent are you able to solve the problems [with your child's anxiety] facing right now?&quot;, and &quot;how prepared do you feel to manage [your child with] distressing situations?&quot; It has a total score ranging from 2 to 10, with a higher score indicating better ability to solve problems, and to manage distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State Hope Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>State Hope Scale is a 6-item self-report scale designed to evaluate hope in adolescents and adults, including two reliable subscales: agency and pathways. It has a total score ranging from 6 to 48 with the higher scores representing higher hope levels.</description>
