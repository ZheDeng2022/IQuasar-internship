  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this project is to provide new knowledge through a comprehensive set&#xD;
      of analyses that investigate the complex interplay between regular mango intake, gut&#xD;
      microbial structure/ function, mechanisms of inflammation and insulin sensitivity in over&#xD;
      weight (OW)/obese (OB) human subjects with chronic low-grade inflammation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, 2-arm, parallel, placebo-controlled design Human&#xD;
      participants (n=44) with BMI &gt;25 and high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), a global&#xD;
      marker of inflammation, &gt;1.0 and ≤10 ng/L will be recruited. Recruited subjects must meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, sign and date a written Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form. Participants will be randomized into one of the two beverage&#xD;
      intervention groups i.e., mango or control beverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be asked to come for 1 Screening Visit, 1 pre-study, and 3 Test Day Visits&#xD;
      (two of which will also include OGTT testing). The initial screening visit will provide&#xD;
      subjects with their site-specific, IRB-approved informed consent document prior to the start&#xD;
      of any study-related procedures. Subject eligibility will be determined through a high&#xD;
      sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) marker value, anthropometric measurements, vital&#xD;
      signs, fasting blood glucose test (finger prick), and completion of a survey related to&#xD;
      general eating, health, mood and exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will follow a limited polyphenolic diet throughout the duration of their&#xD;
      participation, although stricter guidelines will be imposed during the 3 days prior to a&#xD;
      study visit that involved blood/urine/fecal collection. Shopping lists and meal plans will be&#xD;
      provided to subjects, along with counseling by the study investigators, to help subjects&#xD;
      adhere to the limited polyphenolic diet. The trial will initiate with a 3-day food diary to&#xD;
      assess background (pre-study) dietary intake followed by counseling to follow a diet&#xD;
      relatively low in (poly)phenolic rich-beverages/foods, which will be maintained for the&#xD;
      duration of the experiment. After an initial 7-day wash-in period on the limited polyphenolic&#xD;
      diet, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 test treatments based on a randomization&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three main Test Day visits will occur at Day 0; baseline), Day 14 (mid-point), and Day 28&#xD;
      (end-point). Two of the Test Day Visits(Day0 and Day 28) will last about 2.5-3 h and involve&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) measurements, anthropometric (weight, waist circumference; body&#xD;
      composition) assessment, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed. The&#xD;
      Test Day Visit on Day 14 will last about 1-1.5 hours, and subjects will be required to remain&#xD;
      at the Clinical Nutrition Research Center for the duration of the visit. Fasting blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected via a butterfly needle placed by a certified phlebotomist. Subjects&#xD;
      will maintain daily food and GI-tract diary during the 4-week feeding trial. The diary will&#xD;
      include questions about food intake and the condition of gastrointestinal tolerance and bowel&#xD;
      function. Urine and fecal samples will be collected to monitor modifications occurring in the&#xD;
      metabolites during the supplementation. .&#xD;
