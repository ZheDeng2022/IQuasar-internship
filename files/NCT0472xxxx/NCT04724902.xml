      Introduction and Purpose: Compression is a tactile stimulus that can reduce the perception of&#xD;
      pain by stimulating tactile skin receptors and the speed of nerve conduction. It is highly&#xD;
      associated with cryotherapy and other non-pharmacological physical agents without&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain control. However, there is still a lack of evidence on its possible&#xD;
      effects on the modulation of this type of pain. This study will evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      compression by elastic bandages, on pain and on the function of belonging with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (KO). Methodology: A randomized, blinded controlled clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted. Individuals with KO (n = 90; both sexes; between 40 and 75 years old), will be&#xD;
      allocated into three groups (n = 30 / group): Compression (submitted to compression by&#xD;
      elastic bandage on the affected knee, 20 min, in 4 days consecutive); Sham (submitted to the&#xD;
      same protocol with elastic bandage, but without compression); and Control (waiting list,&#xD;
      without intervention). All will be taken one day before the start and one day after the last&#xD;
      intervention. They will also be adopted in the 12th and 24th weeks after the intervention.&#xD;
      The main outcome will be the pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale). The Western Ontario &amp;&#xD;
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) physical function questionnaire, physical&#xD;
      function tests (step test, sit and stand test in 30s, 40m accelerated walk test), and the&#xD;
      perception scale global change (GRC). Data analysis: SPSS 24.0 software will be used for&#xD;
      descriptive analysis and performance of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, two-way ANOVA and multiple&#xD;
      comparison tests. A 95% confidence level and a 5% significance level will be adopted.&#xD;

      Study design: The study consists of a randomized controlled clinical trial that meets the&#xD;
      guidelines recommended by CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) for&#xD;
      non-pharmacological studies TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication)&#xD;
      and OARSI recommendations for clinical trials with patients with knee osteoarthritis . The&#xD;
      procedures will always be carried out at the same times for each volunteer, during the&#xD;
      intervention and evaluation days, so that the same time interval between interventions and&#xD;
      evaluations is respected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations will be carried out by a &quot;blind&quot; evaluator with no information about the&#xD;
      identification of the group to which the volunteer belongs. The evaluator will also be&#xD;
      trained to maintain balance in discussions and questions raised by individuals regarding the&#xD;
      research project and the interventions or evaluations used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening, evaluation and intervention will be carried out at the School Health Unit -&#xD;
      USE, Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), São Carlos. It is a non-probabilistic&#xD;
      sampling study, for convenience and intentional. Volunteers will be recruited from public&#xD;
      announcements and waiting lists from local and regional physiotherapy, rehabilitation,&#xD;
      orthopedics and rheumatology outpatient clinics, as well as from an existing list of&#xD;
      volunteers diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis, available in our laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 90 individuals will participate in the study, of both sexes, aged between 40&#xD;
      and 75 years, diagnosed with KO according to the clinical and radiographic criteria of the&#xD;
      American College of Rheumatology. The individuals will perform a radiographic examination of&#xD;
      both knees, with lateral, anteroposterior, and axial views. Radiographic exams will be&#xD;
      performed at the University Hospital, UFSCar. The screening of volunteers will be carried out&#xD;
      by a physiotherapist specialized in the subject and experienced in the evaluation of&#xD;
      individuals with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects: The project was initially submitted to the Ethics and Research Committee&#xD;
      involving human beings (Plataforma Brasil), approved under Opinion Number: 3.955.692, and&#xD;
      submitted to the registration of clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Then, the study&#xD;
      activities will be carried out. Volunteers will receive a verbal and written explanation of&#xD;
      the objectives and methodology of the study, and those who agree to participate will sign an&#xD;
      informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The individuals included in the study will be stratified by sex and randomly&#xD;
      divided using the digital tool (www.randomization.com). Three groups will be randomized, with&#xD;
      30 individuals each: a) Compression: compression will be applied around the entire knee with&#xD;
      KO through tensioned elastic bandages; b) Sham will also receive the application of elastic&#xD;
      bandages around the knee with KO, but without compression; c) Control: patients on the&#xD;
      waiting list, who will not receive intervention. To avoid selection bias, the confidential&#xD;
      allocation method will be adopted using an opaque, non-translucent and sealed envelope. In&#xD;
      addition, the group to which the individual belongs will only be revealed immediately before&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size was calculated preliminarily using the G * Power software&#xD;
      (version 3.1.3; University of Trier, Germany). Two calculations were performed, the first&#xD;
      considering pain (assessed by VAS) and the second, function (assessed by the WOMAC&#xD;
      questionnaire). The calculation was based on the application of an F-test for the difference&#xD;
      between three independent means (three groups). The effect size considered for this&#xD;
      calculation, based on a previous study, was d = 0.45 for VAS, and d = 0.39 for WOMAC, which&#xD;
      after conversion represent respectively f = 0.225 and f = 0.195). The effect sizes of f are&#xD;
      between small and moderate, and match the rating range for the displayed d values. The level&#xD;
      of significance was 5% and the power 95%. The calculations indicated a total of 54&#xD;
      individuals by the VAS and 72 individuals by the WOMAC questionnaire. The calculation to be&#xD;
      considered will be related to the WOMAC questionnaire, with 24 individuals per group, making&#xD;
      a total of 72 individuals. Considering a possible dropout rate of 20%, 29 participants must&#xD;
      be allocated to each group, but to facilitate calculations and randomization, 30 participants&#xD;
      will be allocated per group, totalling 90 individuals included in the study. A more reliable&#xD;
      calculation will be performed after a preliminary analysis of the data collected from a pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The elastic bandages used will be (Selecta® 13cm x160 cm, composed of 45%&#xD;
      cotton, 20% elastodiene and 27% polyamide) involving the entire knee surface, positioned&#xD;
      considering anatomical aspects: covering the femoral condyles and the anterior tuberosity of&#xD;
      the tibia. The bandage will involve the knee from the distal (tibial tuberosity) to the&#xD;
      proximal (femoral condyles), respecting the blood flow of the venous return. The level of&#xD;
      compression was defined according to recommendations in the literature on compression&#xD;
      interventions in lymphedema and venous changes, and should be kept between 30 mmHg and 60&#xD;
      mmHg. The occurrence of any sign of venous stasis (flushing and / or edema) may also indicate&#xD;
      the need for a reduction in the level of compression or interruption of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To standardize the level of compression presented, a previous reliability study (n = 10) was&#xD;
      performed, with the aid of a pressure gauge (Stabilizer® - Chattanooga Group), positioned on&#xD;
      the knee, between the patient's skin and the elastic bandage . The manometer was inflated to&#xD;
      40mmHg, a value indicated by the manufacturer as the resting pressure of the pneumatic bag47,&#xD;
      and we then began to wrap the knee with the bandage. The number of turns that the tensioned&#xD;
      elastic bandage allowed to wrap the knee was collected to reach the indicated compression&#xD;
      range (30 mmHg ≤ x ≥ 60 mmHg), and if necessary, more than one band could be used. It was&#xD;
      also evaluated what level of compression the Sham group would receive with the non-tensioned&#xD;
      bandage. In both groups, the circumference of the knees was collected at three points&#xD;
      (popliteal fossa, 10 cm above and 10 cm below) and the number of turns that were taken with&#xD;
      the bandage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first step was performed in the test-retest format, with an interval of seven days, so&#xD;
      that it was possible to calculate the intra-rater reliability level, which indicated a Kappa&#xD;
      Coefficient48 of 0.625, considered a substantive agreement. From the reliability study, it&#xD;
      was possible to calculate the average number of turns that should be performed both in the&#xD;
      Compression group and in the Sham group so that the level of compression is maintained in the&#xD;
      stipulated range. In the Compression group, all patients used a bandage, with an average of&#xD;
      5.7 turns (ranging from 5 to 7 turns) and the pressure level maintained at 48 mmHg (ranging&#xD;
      from 46 to 52 mmHg). In the Sham group, everyone also used a bandage, with an average of 4&#xD;
      turns (ranging from 3 to 5 turns) and the pressure level maintained at 00 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the evaluations, the individuals of the three groups will receive&#xD;
      face-to-face training, consisting of therapeutic exercises recommended for the treatment of&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis (KO), as well as a booklet with the proposed exercises, prepared by our&#xD;
      research group, so that they can also perform the exercises without supervision. After&#xD;
      completing the evaluations, participants in the Sham and Control groups will be able to&#xD;
      receive the same treatment available to the Compression group, if they so request. In&#xD;
      addition, they will remain on our list of volunteers for further studies in KO. The&#xD;
      applications of the interventions will be performed by a physiotherapist previously trained&#xD;
      on these procedures performed on the knee joint. The therapist will also be trained to&#xD;
      maintain balance in explaining the study's general outlook, in discussions and questions&#xD;
      raised by individuals about the research project and about the interventions or assessments&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The registration of the data collected in the evaluations will be carried out&#xD;
      through digital forms (Google Forms) and automatically stored in an electronic database in&#xD;
      the Cloud (Google Drive), protected by password, to guarantee the security of the data and&#xD;
      the participants. After completion of the collections, the data will be analysed by a &quot;blind&quot;&#xD;
      biostatistician, with no information on the identification of the groups, using the SPSS 24.0&#xD;
      software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independent variables of interest in the study are group (Compression, Sham and Control)&#xD;
      and time [pre- (assessment 1) and post-intervention (assessments 2, 3 and 4)]. The dependent&#xD;
      variables are VAS (pain intensity), WOMAC (total score), Step test (seconds), Sit and stand&#xD;
      test in 30 seconds (number of repetitions), and 40 m accelerated walk test (speed in m / s).&#xD;
      The data distribution, or normality, will be tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and,&#xD;
      according to the result, parametric or non-parametric tests will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, descriptive analyses will be performed, using measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion: mean and standard deviation when following a normal distribution, and the median,&#xD;
      minimum and maximum, when non-normal distribution. For normal data, the two-way ANOVA with&#xD;
      mixed design will be the parametric test chosen to compare the means of the dependent&#xD;
      variables, considering both factors simultaneously, one from repeated measurements (pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention, and follow up of 12 and 24 weeks) and another of independent samples&#xD;
      (Compression, Sham and Control). If significant differences are found, tests of multiple&#xD;
      comparisons (Post-Hoc) will be performed to assess the differences. For distribution of&#xD;
      non-normal data, the possible reasons for non-normality, analysis of possible correction and&#xD;
      then non-parametric tests can be applied, using both repeated (time) and non-repeated&#xD;
      (groups) comparisons with Bonferroni adjustments or similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all variables, a 95% confidence level will be determined and a significance level of 5%&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant. Added to this, the difference between the&#xD;
      groups will be compared to the MDCI values defined for each variable. When the MDCI values&#xD;
      are not available, Cohen's d coefficient will be calculated (effect size:&gt; 0.8 large, close&#xD;
      to 0.5 moderate and ≤ 0.2 small). Finally, to preserve the benefit of randomization, allowing&#xD;
      for a balanced distribution of prognostic factors in the compared groups and, consequently,&#xD;
      the observed effect, an intention-to-treat analysis will be adopted using the&#xD;
      expectation-maximization imputation method.&#xD;
