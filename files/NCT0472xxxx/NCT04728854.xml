    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to improve the quality of future clinical trials in bullous&#xD;
      pemphigoid (BP), the investigators will monitor repeated measurement data from patients with&#xD;
      BP on standard-of-care treatments at four week intervals for four months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study team plans to recruit 45 subjects from the autoimmune blistering disease clinic at&#xD;
      Emory Dermatology Clinic. The plan is to improve the quality of future clinical trials in&#xD;
      bullous pemphigoid (BP), the team will monitor repeated measurement data from patients with&#xD;
      BP on standard-of-care treatments at four week intervals for four months. This time frame&#xD;
      will allow completion of both aims in the three year time period. Aim 1 will evaluate the&#xD;
      BPDAI scoring over time with specific reductions in the activity score as future outcomes for&#xD;
      therapeutic response and assess changes in patient reported outcomes particularly related to&#xD;
      pruritus for future clinical trial endpoints. Aim 2 will focus on the development of&#xD;
      teledermatology platform for improving patient recruitment and retention. The data from this&#xD;
      proposal will be critical for future BP clinical trials and clarify gaps in the current&#xD;
      knowledge related to the natural disease history of BP patients on standard-of-care&#xD;
      therapies, changes in BPDAI scores over time, and pruritus specific outcome measures to&#xD;
      define the quality of life impact.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Bullous pemphigoid disease area index (BPDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Bullous pemphigoid disease area index (BPDAI) activity score is the arithmetic sum of 3 subcomponents: cutaneous blisters/erosions, cutaneous urticaria/erythema, and mucosal blisters/erosions. Scores can range from 0 to 360 for BPDAI total activity (maximum 240 for total skin activity and 120 for mucosal activity), with higher scores indicating greater disease activity (worse outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ItchyQol score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>ItchyQoL focuses on pruritus as the main symptom impacting quality of life. ItchyQol score is based on an averaged 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) over three time periods. Lower score correlates with better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Autoimmune Bullous Disease Quality of Life score (ABQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Autoimmune Bullous Disease Quality of Life (ABQoL) score is a 17 item questionnaire assessing quality of life in patients with autoimmune blistering diseases. It is a patient reported score. Each question ranges from 0 to 3 points, with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life. The maximum ABQOL score is 51.</description>

    <measure>Change in patient and physician global assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician and Patient Global Assessments will assess skin related health on a 0-5 scale at each visit. The lower score correlates with disease improvement (better outcome).</description>
