      This is a Phase 2 mechanistic clinical trial to assess the systemic and mucosal&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the multicomponent meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB or Bexsero&#xD;
      (R)) (group 1, 40 subjects) against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, using a placebo vaccine (normal&#xD;
      saline) as a comparator (group 2, 10 subjects). There will be 50 participants, ages 18-49,&#xD;
      both male and non-pregnant female subjects, enrolled at 1 site in the US. The goal will be to&#xD;
      ensure adequate representation of subjects by sex in both treatment groups. The enrollment&#xD;
      will be stratified by both sex and treatment arm. The rectal mucosal biopsy cohort (&quot;biopsy&#xD;
      cohort&quot;, N=20) will be enrolled first to address the primary objective of the study. During&#xD;
      enrollment of the &quot;biopsy cohort&quot; male and non-pregnant female subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      4:1 to either 4CMenB or placebo, up to a maximum of 10 male and 10 non-pregnant female&#xD;
      subjects. Group 1 (N=40) will receive two doses of 4CMenB on Day 1 and Day 29. Group 2 (N=10)&#xD;
      will receive two placebo injections on Day 1 and Day 29. Both groups will receive a&#xD;
      single-dose prefilled syringe that is administered intramuscularly (0.5-mililiter each). The&#xD;
      duration of each subject's participation is approximately 8 months, from recruitment through&#xD;
      the last study visit, and the length of the study is estimated for 14 months. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to characterize the rectal mucosal Immunoglobulin G IgG antibody response to&#xD;
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) elicited by the 4CMenB vaccine as compared with the placebo&#xD;
      vaccine (normal saline) in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 2 mechanistic clinical trial to assess the systemic and mucosal&#xD;

      ensure adequate representation of subjects by sex in both treatment groups. The enrollment&#xD;
      will be stratified by both sex and treatment arm. A subset of subjects in each treatment&#xD;
      group (N=16 in Group 1, N=4 in Group 2) will undergo rectal mucosal biopsy at two time points&#xD;
      (baseline and following the second vaccination) for assessment of tissue Neisseria&#xD;
      gonorrhoeae (GC) specific cellular responses. The rectal mucosal biopsy cohort (&quot;biopsy&#xD;
      cohort&quot;, N=20) will be enrolled first to address the primary objective of the study. During&#xD;
      enrollment of the &quot;biopsy cohort&quot; male and non-pregnant female subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      4:1 to either 4CMenB or placebo, up to a maximum of 10 male and 10 non-pregnant female&#xD;
      subjects. All subjects will undergo sampling of mucosal secretions for testing for antibodies&#xD;
      against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC). Male subjects will undergo oropharyngeal and rectal&#xD;
      mucosal sampling, and female subjects will undergo oropharyngeal, vaginal and rectal mucosal&#xD;
      sampling. Group 1 (N=40) will receive two doses of 4CMenB on Day 1 and Day 29. Group 2 (N=10)&#xD;
      will receive two placebo injections on Day 1 and Day 29. Both groups will receive a&#xD;
      single-dose prefilled syringe that is administered intramuscularly (0.5-mililter each). The&#xD;
      duration of each subject's participation is approximately 8 months, from recruitment through&#xD;
      the last study visit, and the length of the study is estimated for 14 months. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to characterize the rectal mucosal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response to&#xD;
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) elicited by the 4CMenB vaccine as compared with the placebo&#xD;
      vaccine (normal saline) in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objectives are: 1) To&#xD;
      characterize the serum IgG antibody response to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) elicited by the&#xD;
      4CMenB vaccine as compared with the placebo vaccine in healthy adult subjects, 2) To assess&#xD;
      the safety and reactogenicity of 4CMenB in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
