    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare developmental outcome for young children (12 to 35&#xD;
      months of age) with astigmatism meeting American Academy of Ophthalmology spectacle&#xD;
      prescribing guidelines and who are prescribed and provided spectacles for either Full-Time&#xD;
      wear (encouraged and reinforced) or Ad Lib wear (wear dependent on child acceptance).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefits and drawbacks of spectacle treatment for bilateral astigmatism in young children&#xD;
      are not known. The SPEC study compares outcomes for young children (12 to &lt; 35 months of age)&#xD;
      with astigmatism meeting spectacle prescribing recommendations and randomized to either&#xD;
      Full-Time spectacle wear (encouraged and reinforced) or Ad Lib spectacle wear (only as&#xD;
      accepted by the child). The primary outcome analysis compares cognitive development at 38-42&#xD;
      months in children randomized to the Full-Time and Ad Lib groups. Secondary analyses compare&#xD;
      Language, Motor, Social-Emotional, and Adaptive Behavior developmental outcomes and visual&#xD;
      acuity outcome for children randomized to the Full-Time and Ad Lib groups.&#xD;
