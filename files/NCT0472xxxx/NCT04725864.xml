    <textblock>
      The ProFET study aims to investigate if luteal phase support by vaginal progesterone, is&#xD;
      superior to no luteal phase support, in terms of live birth rate per woman after a frozen&#xD;
      embryo transfer (FET), in a natural cycle (NC) after in-vitro fertilization (IVF), and if 7&#xD;
      weeks of treatment is superior to 3 weeks duration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal progesterone supplementation is routine treatment after IVF with fresh embryo&#xD;
      transfer, but it is uncertain whether vaginal progesterone after frozen embryo transfer in&#xD;
      natural cycles is efficacious in terms of increasing the chance of a live birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ProFET study is a multicenter, open randomized, controlled trial planning to include 1800&#xD;
      women, intended to undergo a FET in a natural cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives are to investigate if luteal phase support by vaginal progesterone, is&#xD;
      superior to no luteal phase support, in terms of live birth rate per woman after a frozen&#xD;
      embryo transfer, in a natural cycle and if 7 weeks of treatment is superior to 3 weeks&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to compare groups regarding pregnancy outcomes including biochemical&#xD;
      pregnancy, clinical, ongoing and term pregnancy rates, as well as rates of miscarriage,&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy, and ectopic pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are also perinatal and obstetrics outcomes, self-reported side effects,&#xD;
      adverse events and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also analyze the effect of S-Progesterone level before FET on the&#xD;
      chance of achieving live birth and secondary pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
