  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a study conducted as a placebo-controlled, double blind, 1:1 randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial testing a Tumor Necrosis Factor Blocker (Anti-TNFα) substance&#xD;
      versus placebo in subjects with a 2-year 50% risk of progression to stage 3 T1D across&#xD;
      multiple centers. The trial will investigate the ability of Anti-TNFα to prevent or delay&#xD;
      progression to Stage 3 T1D in the targeted patient population.&#xD;

             days) of screening visit if performed as part of TN01 Pathway to Prevention (PTP)&#xD;
             study at time of screening; defining a 50% two-year progression risk):&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Abnormal glucose tolerance: i. 2-hr glucose ≥ 140 and &lt;200 mg/dL, fasting glucose ≥&#xD;

             Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative within 30 days of randomization and may not&#xD;
             have had signs or symptoms of an EBV compatible illness lasting longer than 7 days&#xD;
