      This study is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase 2 study of irinotecan liposome&#xD;
      injection in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have progressed after&#xD;
      platinum-based first-line therapy. Subjects will receive irinotecan liposome injection until&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed after platinum-based first-line&#xD;
      therapy will be enrolled in this study. Patients will receive irinotecan liposome injection&#xD;
      at 70 mg/m^2 intravenously, over 90 min on Days 1 of every 14-day cycle until progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Imaging assessments will be conducted every three cycles to evaluate&#xD;
      the preliminary efficacy of irinotecan liposome injection as second-line regimen in patients&#xD;
      with SCLC.&#xD;
