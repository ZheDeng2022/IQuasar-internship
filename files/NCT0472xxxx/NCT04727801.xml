    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized prospective observational data&#xD;
      collection study of the Verily Patch. The Verily Patch is an investigational wearable,&#xD;
      continuous temperature sensor which will be evaluated against reference oral and axillary&#xD;
      temperature measurements to support development activities for the Verily Patch.&#xD;
