    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by mycobacterial organism. It is the leading infectious disease&#xD;
      cause of death globally, with more than 10 million new cases and over 2 million deaths&#xD;
      annually. Developing countries bear the greatest brunt of the disease. The long duration of&#xD;
      current treatment is associated with poor compliance, thereby contributing to frequent&#xD;
      relapses and to the emergence of drug-resistant TB. In addition, individuals who have been&#xD;
      clinically cured may have lung damage, which could be permanent. Therefore, new and more&#xD;
      effective therapeutic agents against TB are needed. Emerging evidence has shown that lipid&#xD;
      lowering drugs like statins can make the TB bacteria more susceptible to current treatments.&#xD;
      This proof-of-concept clinical trial will add the repurposed drug atorvastatin, commonly used&#xD;
      to reduce cholesterol levels, to the standard therapies of TB patients in Nigeria.&#xD;
      Atorvastatin is a well-tolerated and safe drug, and its addition is expected to accelerate&#xD;
      clearance of the TB-causing bacteria without additional side effects. If this research is&#xD;
      successful, it could provide evidence for using a common, easily available generic drug to&#xD;
      improve treatment of one of the most debilitating infectious diseases.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Tuberculosis is a chronic disease responsible for most deaths from infectious&#xD;
      disease with an estimated I0 million cases and close to 2million deaths globally. 1 Despite&#xD;
      the availability of therapy for TB, the scourge of the disease has not abated especially in&#xD;
      the developing countries. The disease is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium&#xD;
      tuberculosis, a non-spore forming intracellular organism. TB exists in two forms; primary and&#xD;
      secondary infection. While primary infection most times goes unnoticed and are usually&#xD;
      associated with non-specific symptoms, secondary infections are usually associated with&#xD;
      profound symptoms and signs in various organs especially in the lungs. Majority of persons&#xD;
      overcome primary infection but the tubercule bacilli may lie dormant in the macrophages.2&#xD;
      Secondary infection occurs as a result of either endogenous reactivation or exogenous&#xD;
      re-infection. Pulmonary TB is responsible for more than 85% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTB infect and survive humans by evading the various immune defense systems.3 The organism&#xD;
      accumulates and utilizes an abundant amount of lipids and cholesterol for its cell wall, and&#xD;
      as a source of carbon for synthesis of virulence factors. 4 Mycobacterium tuberculosis also&#xD;
      utilizes cholesterol as a vehicle to enter macrophage, inhibit phagocytosis and inhibit&#xD;
      growth and development of phagocytes.5 These greatly impairs the hydrolytic and antimicrobial&#xD;
      properties and activities of phagocytes.5,6 Current therapy is as old as the disease itself;&#xD;
      is of long duration, hence it is associated with poor compliance. This contributes to&#xD;
      frequent relapses and emergence of resistant form of the disease. Average interval between&#xD;
      one episode of TB and another range from 6-18 months after completion of therapy. Despite&#xD;
      clinical cure, approximately half of patients have permanent lung damage. In Nigeria, TB is a&#xD;
      major risk factor for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, lung fibrosis/scarring and other&#xD;
      diseases. It is clear that new and innovative therapeutic agents are needed to tackle this&#xD;
      hydra- headed disease. In order to address these challenges, a lipid lowering agent,&#xD;
      atorvastatin is being repurposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of statins have been demonstrated in infectious diseases and especially in&#xD;
      tuberculosis than other organisms.7 In vitro studies have demonstrated that statins could&#xD;
      strengthen the host response against M. tuberculosis and inhibit the activation of T cells&#xD;
      induced by M. tuberculosis antigens.8,9 In another study, murine bone marrow-derived&#xD;
      macrophages that were exposed to simvastatin and were infected with M. tuberculosis, showed a&#xD;
      significant reduction in mycobacterial growth, without adverse effects on cell viability.10&#xD;
      Treatment of TB in animal model with statins and anti TB drugs showed that treatment with&#xD;
      anti-TB drugs plus simvastatin reduced the percentage of relapses by 50% compared with&#xD;
      treatment with only anti-TB drugs.11 Taken together, all these studies in animal model&#xD;
      indicate that statins has anti-TB effect, reduces bacillary load, shortens the duration of&#xD;
      therapy and decreases relapse rate when used with first-line anti-TB drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the clinical evidence on the role of statins in TB were from retrospective and nested&#xD;
      case control studies from Asian continent.12,13 In one study in Taiwan, diabetic subjects&#xD;
      older than 65 treated with statins had a lower risk of developing active tuberculosis, with a&#xD;
      risk of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.60-0.97). 12 Chronic use of statins (more than 90 days) was&#xD;
      associated with the lowest risk (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.53-0.72) as shown in another study.13&#xD;
      Within the limits of the designs of these studies, the positive and protective role of&#xD;
      statins in TB in humans were demonstrated and has provided basis for further studies. This&#xD;
      proposal seeks to provide robust evidence in a well designed study, for repurposing statins&#xD;
      to treat TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this is successful, the investigators anticipate a significant improvement in health and&#xD;
      well being for patients. Patients will have the option of being treated with an effective and&#xD;
      safe regimen with minimal side effects including patients with HIV/TB co-infection, as&#xD;
      statins can be co-administered safely with antiretroviral drugs. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate a reduction in relapse rate, persistence and resistance to&#xD;
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Currently, patients still experience post treatment&#xD;
      non-infectious complications that limit their functionality. The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      this treatment will mitigate against this and lead to improvement in the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients and survivors. Both direct and indirect costs of the disease can be rechanneled to&#xD;
      revamp the health system and other economic potentials of the developing world. If this prove&#xD;
      successful, there would be an accelerated and significant progress to achieving the World&#xD;
      Health Organization and End TB Sustainable Development Goals. Overall the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate a great turn around in the socio-economic life of people and countries of the&#xD;
      developing world where TB has caused untoward and unimaginable stagnation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design/Research Plan The investigators propose a Phase IIA/IIB randomized open&#xD;
      label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics(PK), and efficacy of&#xD;
      atorvastatin in subjects with uncomplicated, smear-positive, drug-susceptible pulmonary&#xD;
      tuberculosis. See Figure I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented and eligible patients with active tuberculosis will be recruited and be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either 30/40mg of atorvastatin with standards anti-TB drugs for 2months or the&#xD;
      standards anti-TB drugs alone for 2months. Randomization will be based on Zelen rule 14 and&#xD;
      follow a predefined allocation ratio of 1:1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IIA will seek to determine the safety and early bactericidal efficacy of atorvastatin&#xD;
      in combination with standard anti-TB in 40 patients. Phase IIB, will seek to determine&#xD;
      safety, and sputum culture conversion of atorvastatin in combination with standard anti-TB&#xD;
      compared with standard anti-TB drugs alone after 2months in a total of 150 patients. Figure&#xD;
      I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized for supervised drug administration and assessed daily for vital&#xD;
      signs and adverse effects AEs especially at phase IIA. Semi intensive profiling of plasma&#xD;
      atorvastatin concentrations with a validated high-performance liquid chromatography will be&#xD;
      conducted after the first dose on day 1 through to the last dose on day 14. Sputum will be&#xD;
      collected for 16hours overnight for two nights before drug intake, daily from days 1 to 4,&#xD;
      and every alternate day until day 14 in both cohorts. Samples will be transported and&#xD;
      refrigerated till colony forming unit is done. Full blood count, coagulation studies, serum&#xD;
      chemistry, lipid profile, Creatinine phosphokinase, urinalysis, and 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be performed prior to drug intake and at regular intervals&#xD;
      during and at 2 weeks. Patients recruited for this phase will continue in the assigned study&#xD;
      arm and join the phase IIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis will be done in the two groups at the end of the 2weeks with particular&#xD;
      emphasis on safety profile, incidence and number of adverse effects, bactericidal activity&#xD;
      and a preliminary report of serum levels of atorvastatin in two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the phase IIB, patients will be randomized as previously stated into any of the two&#xD;
      groups and will be monitored closely. Sputum will be collected at 4, 6 and 8 weeks for&#xD;
      smear/GenXpert. At the end of 8 weeks, sputum will be collected overnight for MTB culture in&#xD;
      addition. During this period, number and types of AEs in the participants will also be noted.&#xD;
      At the end, patients will be discharged from the study to continue and complete course of&#xD;
      standard anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. To determine the performance of the Sweat TB test,&#xD;
      patients will be prospectively enrolled and the results from the test compared with&#xD;
      sputum/GenXpert result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigations will be done at laboratories at OAU/OUATHC, Ile Ife. Microbiological&#xD;
      assessment including CFU/ culture conversion will be done at the Mycobacterial Laboratory,&#xD;
      OAU/OAUTHC, Ile Ife. Drug assays will be done at the collaborating center; Birmingham&#xD;
      Heartlands Hospital/University of Birmingham, UK&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be coerced to enroll in the study but they will be allowed to enroll after&#xD;
      full written and informed consent. However they will be encouraged to attend all clinic and&#xD;
      research appointment. However in order to ensure adherence to research protocol especially&#xD;
      the period they need to be assessed, they will be provided with transport fare for the period&#xD;
      of evaluation. For the initial 2 weeks of hospilisation, all fee including feeding will be&#xD;
      borne by the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
