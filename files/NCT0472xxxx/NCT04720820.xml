  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine the effect of early supported discharge (ESD) service on the&#xD;
      functional outcomes and quality of life of acute stroke patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      disability in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a double-armed prospective multi-centered, assessor-blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing the effect of ESD program with conventional rehabilitation&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early Supported Discharge (ESD) is a form of medical service applicable to acute stroke&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate disabilities. ESD service was developed to facilitate patient&#xD;
      to their daily livings at home, reduce the length of stay in the hospital with possibly&#xD;
      better or equivalent outcomes for patients and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESD service has been proven to be non-inferior in the functional and quality of life measures&#xD;
      as well as cost-effective, compared to the conventional rehabilitation service in many&#xD;
      countries, however the effectiveness of ESD service may differ among countries and medical,&#xD;
      economical circumstances. This study aims to examine the effect of ESD service on the acute&#xD;
      stroke patients with mild to moderate disabilities in Korea and demonstrate its feasibility&#xD;
      as an alternative medical service option to those patients.&#xD;
