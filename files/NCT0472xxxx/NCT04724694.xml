  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is very common among primary care Veterans and can seriously impact overall&#xD;
      patient functioning and well-being. Currently, behavioral treatments for pain management are&#xD;
      not often provided in primary care because they are designed to be delivered in specialty&#xD;
      care settings, such as chronic pain clinics. To address this gap in care, the proposed study&#xD;
      will test if Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (Brief CBT-CP) is an&#xD;
      effective treatment. Therefore, the first objective of the proposed study is to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of Brief CBT-CP compared to primary care treatment as usual to&#xD;
      assess treatment effectiveness by examining changes in pain-related physical activity&#xD;
      interference, psychological distress, pain intensity, and other related outcomes. 178&#xD;
      eligible participants will be randomized into either Brief CBT-CP and primary care treatment&#xD;
      as usual or primary care treatment as usual only. Eligible Veterans will include those with&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain and pain-related functional impairment identified from primary&#xD;
      care. Participants assigned to Brief CBT-CP will receive six sessions of treatment in&#xD;
      30-minute appointments. This intervention will include education and goal setting, activities&#xD;
      and pacing, relaxation skills, cognitive coping, and relapse prevention. Assessments will&#xD;
      include validated self-report measures that will take place at pre-treatment (baseline),&#xD;
      mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. The second objective of this study&#xD;
      is examine the mechanisms by which Brief CBT-CP leads to improvement in patient outcomes.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will reveal if changes pain self-efficacy (i.e., perceived ability to&#xD;
      manage pain or engage in usual activities despite being in pain) and catastrophizing (i.e.,&#xD;
      unhelpful, negative though patterns about pain and pain management) lead to improvements in&#xD;
      patient functioning. The third objective of this study will be to explore perceptions of&#xD;
      Brief CBT-CP among patients who experience significant improvement in outcomes compared to&#xD;
      those who did not experience improvement. Participants will include up to 40 patients who&#xD;
      were treated with Brief CBT-CP. Participants will be interviewed about key components of the&#xD;
      treatment and their perception of effectiveness. Interview data will be compared to the&#xD;
      results of statistical analysis to help understand the mechanisms by which Brief CBT-CP is&#xD;
      effective or identify areas for improvement. Results of this study will provide information&#xD;
      needed to determine if Brief CBT-CP should be widely disseminated across VA primary care&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory -- Interference subscale (BPI-I) to assess change at 12 week follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is a validated 7-item subscale that evaluates pain-related interference in daily activities and social and occupational functioning. Average scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher pain-related interference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory -- Pain Intensity subscale (BPI-P) to assess change at 12 week follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is a validated 4-item subscale that evaluates pain intensity. Average scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse pain intensity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire -- 9 (PHQ-9) to assess change at 12 week follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 9-item measure of depressive symptoms is validated for use in primary care. Total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more depression symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) to assess change at 12 week follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is 21-items and rates current attitudes, behaviors, and plans to commit suicide. Average scores range from 0 to 38, with higher scores indicating higher intensity of suicidal ideation.</description>

    <description>This 26-item abbreviated version of the full-length WHOQOL measure evaluates quality of life in several domains such as social relationships and satisfaction with person-environment interactions. Scoring is by subscales representing four domains (i.e., physical health, psychological, social relationship, and environment). Transformed mean scores for each domain range from four to 20, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life in the respective domain.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive Brief CBT-CP in addition to usual primary care treatment. Brief CBT-CP is a manualized protocol that includes six, 30-minute sessions over the course of 6-12 weeks. Session one focuses on foundational pain education and the development of treatment goals. Session two emphasizes balanced engagement in physical activity and pleasurable events. Session three emphasizes skills training for easily implemented relaxation techniques. Sessions four and five focus on recognizing and modifying unhelpful thoughts that negatively impact pain. Session six focuses on relapse prevention and independent implementation of CBT-CP skills following treatment.</description>
