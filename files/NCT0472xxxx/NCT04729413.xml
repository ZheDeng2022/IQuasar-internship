  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the preliminary efficacy of a novel couples'&#xD;
      counseling intervention to promote the health of pregnant women living with HIV in Lusaka,&#xD;
      Zambia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this study is that women living with HIV in heterosexual couples&#xD;
      that have better relationship functioning and more social support will have greater odds of&#xD;
      achieving optimal health during and after pregnancy. The study further hypothesizes that the&#xD;
      couples-based intervention will improve interpersonal dynamics, such as communication, and in&#xD;
      intrapersonal factors, such as women's mental health, which will mediate intervention effects&#xD;
      on HIV care and treatment outcomes. The study will test the hypotheses through two specific&#xD;
      aims: (1) compare service utilization and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)&#xD;
      outcome indicators in two study conditions; and (2) establish the effect of the intervention&#xD;
      on intra- and inter-personal mechanisms influencing outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Couples in the intervention group will receive two group health education sessions (one during pregnancy and one postpartum) covering information on pregnancy and postpartum health, as well as three couple counseling visits (one during pregnancy and two postpartum). The couples counseling sessions will provide (1) information on key relationship topics (communication, trust and respect, love and support); (2) relationship skills exercises (role playing); and (3) the opportunity to discuss health and relationship priorities/goals of the couple.</description>
