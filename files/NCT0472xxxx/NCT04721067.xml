      This randomized trial will determine the effects of internet cognitive behavioral therapy on&#xD;
      measures of systemic inflammation in HIV-positive people receiving antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot trial is to evaluate the effects of cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on changes in circulating levels of hsCRP at 24 weeks in&#xD;
      virologically-suppressed, HIV-positive adults with insomnia, defined as having an Insomnia&#xD;
      Severity Index (ISI) score â‰¥ 11. Secondary objectives include comparing changes in hsCRP at&#xD;
      12 weeks, changes in other circulating inflammation biomarkers (IL-6, sCD14, sCD163,&#xD;
      CD14+CD16+ monocytes) at both 12 and 24 weeks, and ISI scores and other self-reported patient&#xD;
      outcomes at both 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>SHUTi is the empirically supported, internet CBT-I that is fully accessible via tablets and smartphones. It uses a self-guided, fully automated, interactive, multimedia format to deliver six 45-minute sessions, the structure and content of which mirror traditional face-to-face CBT-I. Session content includes sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, cognitive restructuring, and relapse prevention. SHUTi is enhanced through a variety of interactive features, including personalized goal setting, graphical feedback based on inputted symptoms, animations and illustrations to enhance comprehension, quizzes to test user knowledge, patient vignettes, and video-based expert explanation. Across sessions, patients also receive tailored sleep recommendations and feedback based on the sleep diary data they enter into the program.</description>

    <description>A research assistant (RA) will deliver the active control procedures. During the first 4 weeks, the RA will have two calls with each control participant - one 45-minute call on insomnia education (including their HIV provider's role in its management) and one 45-minute call on sleep hygiene practices. To end the first call, the RA will email or mail a list of local behavioral health services to patients and will encourage them to follow-up with their HIV provider. We will then notify the HIV provider, which will encourage them to address their patient's insomnia and provide the same list of local services.</description>

             response (yes) to one or more of the three questions (for Question #3, the previous&#xD;
             attempt must be within the past 10 years) on the Patient Suicidality Form (see&#xD;
             Appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed disease or process, besides HIV infection, associated with increased&#xD;

        postponement of that study visit until the course of therapy is completed; postponement&#xD;
        outside of the allowed study visit timeframe will result in study discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of investigational agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, systemic immunosuppressive&#xD;

             Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Physiologic testosterone replacement therapy or topical steroids is not exclusionary.&#xD;
        Inhaled/nasal steroids are not exclusionary as long as the participant is not also&#xD;
        receiving HIV protease inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;

          -  History of bipolar disorder or a psychotic disorder, including schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;

             arising time earlier than 4:00am or later than 10:00am (thus preventing adoption of&#xD;
             SHUTi interventions).&#xD;
