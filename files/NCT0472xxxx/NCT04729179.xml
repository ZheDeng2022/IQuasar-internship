    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is serious chronic pain condition which is often accompanied by sleep&#xD;
      disturbances, fatigue and disability and reduced quality of life. There is no cure and&#xD;
      treatments are based on reliving symptoms and maintaining function. The currently available&#xD;
      medical treatments are not helping many patients, and many get side-effects. Medical cannabis&#xD;
      is sought after among patients and many use this medication un-licenced, although it is not&#xD;
      properly documented if it works or is safe. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the&#xD;
      effects and safety of medical cannabis in a properly designed randomized trial. The aim of&#xD;
      the study is to investigate if cannabidiol (CBD) can improve pain, sleep, function and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia. The study will include 200 patients, who will&#xD;
      receive either cannabidiol or placebo over a period of 24 weeks. Participants will be closely&#xD;
      looked after for improvements in their condition and for potential side-effects to ensure&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a serious chronic pain condition affecting 2-5 % of the&#xD;
      background population. The disease burden in most affected individuals is substantial; with&#xD;
      widespread musculoskeletal pain, high pain intensity, often accompanied by sleep&#xD;
      disturbances, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and emotional distress. Fibromyalgia is&#xD;
      associated with disability and muscle fatigue, affecting daily life activities, leading to&#xD;
      poor social participation and incapacity for normal employment. Studies have shown that many&#xD;
      patients, are not satisfied with the treatments offered, and rate their health and quality of&#xD;
      life after treatment as poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently is no cure for fibromyalgia, and management aiming at symptom reduction&#xD;
      and maintenance of optimal functioning is recommended by clinical guidelines, including both&#xD;
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment strategies. Recommendations for the&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment of fibromyalgia propose antidepressants and anticonvulsants, which&#xD;
      target central pain processing mechanisms. These treatments have been tested in controlled&#xD;
      trials for their efficacy in patients with fibromyalgia, and meta-analyses on these&#xD;
      interventions have revealed that overall effect sizes are modest, as only a minority of&#xD;
      patients have substantial benefit (patient reported pain relief of 50% or greater), while&#xD;
      more have moderate benefit (patient reported pain relief of 30% or greater). Many patients&#xD;
      have no or minimal benefit or will discontinue the treatment due to side effects. However, it&#xD;
      appears that even moderate reductions in pain may lead to considerable increase in&#xD;
      self-reported quality of life and other outcome domains in this specific patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical cannabis is popularly advocated for different health conditions including chronic&#xD;
      pain, both among politicians and in the general population in Denmark, although evidence is&#xD;
      sparse efficacy and on what types of medical cannabis to use and what dosages to prescribe&#xD;
      for the different conditions. In addition, safety issues such as adverse events and serious&#xD;
      adverse events is not properly assesed. Physicians are reluctant to prescribe medical&#xD;
      cannabis to their patients, and many patients living with chronic pain are known to&#xD;
      self-administer unlicensed medical cannabis. The extent of actual cannabis use is unknown,&#xD;
      although, one study has documented that 13% of patients with fibromyalgia use cannabis&#xD;
      regularly with a more extensive use among male patients compared to females. Numbers from a&#xD;
      Danish context show that only 17 out of 286 (6%), patients with fibromyalgia participating in&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program in Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg hospital during&#xD;
      2018, stated that they were using self-administrated cannabis on a regular basis (unpublished&#xD;
      data). As self-administrated off-label use of cannabis is illegal in Denmark, this number may&#xD;
      well be underreported. Still, individuals diagnosed with fibromyalgia who do admit to&#xD;
      cannabis use, are sharing stories with health professionals about how unlicensed cannabis has&#xD;
      improved their coping with everyday life, functional ability, pain, sleep, fatigue, mood and&#xD;
      overall health related quality of life. Such compelling stories cannot be ignored and&#xD;
      underline the necessity of exploring the efficacy of medical cannabis in a proper research&#xD;
      design (i.e. with good internal validity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the cannabis plant for medical purposes is limited in Europe and the European&#xD;
      addiction societies stresses the need for further studies on the efficacy and possible&#xD;
      dangers regarding medical cannabis intake. Regulations are lacking on registration and&#xD;
      medical indications, and the development of uniform compounds regarding strength and types of&#xD;
      products and rules concerning sales and marketing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, production and distribution of medical cannabis is illegal. However, starting&#xD;
      from January 1st, 2018, a four-year pilot scheme has been legalized and approved by the&#xD;
      Danish Medicines Agency, allowing for medical cannabis in the treatment of conditions such as&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, spinal injuries and nausea after chemotherapy and neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      Although patients suffering from fibromyalgia have few treatment options for management of&#xD;
      their disabling condition, this group is not included in the pilot scheme. However, it is&#xD;
      legal for physicians to prescribe cannabis for this and other patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical cannabis Medical cannabis is the term for medications derived from dried cannabis&#xD;
      plants in the form of capsules, pills or extracts/oils. The top shoot of the plant contains&#xD;
      100 cannabinoids that are divided into two subgroups; Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and&#xD;
      cannabidiol (CBD), affecting the cannabinoid type 1 receptors located in the central nervous&#xD;
      system, and the cannabinoid type 2 receptors located outside of the central nervous system.&#xD;
      While the THC cannabinoids have psychoactive, appetite stimulating and nausea reducing&#xD;
      effects, cannabidiol has anti-inflammatory, anti-convulsive and immune modulating effects.&#xD;
      Studies are inconclusive regarding the effect of cannabidiol on appetite and food intake.&#xD;
      Cannabinoids are known to be highly lipophilic and to accumulate in fatty tissue, and may&#xD;
      influence the metabolism, fat distribution and accumulation in users. It has been implicated&#xD;
      that both TCH and CBD have pain reducing effects. CBD is confirmed to have a favorable safety&#xD;
      profile compared to THC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has approved Epydiolex® as the first prescription&#xD;
      cannabis drug derived from the cannabis plant, for treating rare and severe forms of&#xD;
      epilepsy. Synthetically manufactured cannabis such as dronabinol (USA) and nabilone (USA and&#xD;
      UK), have been approved earlier in the treatment of nausea after chemotherapy. The only&#xD;
      synthetic cannabis based approved drug in Denmark is Sativex® for the treatment of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis. However, none of the cannabis drugs are currently approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic pain conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence is sparse on medical cannabis in the treatment of fibromyalgia. In a Cochrane review&#xD;
      on herbal cannabis (hashish, marihuana), plant-based and synthetic cannabinoids for&#xD;
      fibromyalgia, only two out of four identified studies on the topic were included, due to&#xD;
      small sample sizes, short-term duration and poor reporting of the other studies. The two&#xD;
      studies were both on synthetic cannabinoid (nabilone). No high-quality studies on plant-based&#xD;
      cannabis could be identified. Evidence for efficacy was inconsistent as one study favored&#xD;
      nabilone on pain and quality of life, compared to placebo, and the other study favored&#xD;
      nabilone on sleep compared to Amitriptyline (anti-depressant). However, the quality of the&#xD;
      studies was low, and tolerability was low due to side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent systematic reviews, have investigated the existing evidence on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      cannabinoids for chronic non-cancer pain, including fibromyalgia. No impact on physical and&#xD;
      emotional functioning has been found, and only low-quality evidence found improved sleep and&#xD;
      patient global impression of change. Thus, it was concluded to be unlikely that cannabinoids&#xD;
      are effective in the treatment of non-cancer pain, as findings were inconsistent. Survey&#xD;
      studies, however, have showed favorable effect on fibromyalgia symptoms and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, and improved pain management and sleep, among users of unlicensed cannabis&#xD;
      compared to non-users, although no information on type and dosages of cannabis was given in&#xD;
      the surveys. Negative patients' perspectives themes such as the high cost, the negative&#xD;
      effects of cannabis and the &quot;views of others&quot;, including their health care professionals,&#xD;
      were also identified. A recent retrospective study showed significantly favorable outcomes on&#xD;
      fibromyalgia symptoms among medical cannabis users, and only mild adverse events. However,&#xD;
      the retrospective design, the relatively small sample size and short duration reduced the&#xD;
      quality of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the high demand and an increasing popularity of medical cannabis - which is&#xD;
      currently used unlicensed among many patients with fibromyalgia, despite the lack of&#xD;
      high-quality evidence on efficacy and safety, a well-designed randomized trial with a large&#xD;
      sample size and clinically relevant duration is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol use&#xD;
      compared to placebo, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol compared to&#xD;
      placebo in patients with fibromyalgia over 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES: The primary hypothesis of the study is that pain intensity will be significantly&#xD;
      reduced in participants receiving cannabidiol compared to those receiving identically&#xD;
      appearing placebo after 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses are that sleep quality and duration, activities of daily living and&#xD;
      quality of life, will be improved in participants receiving cannabidiol compared to those&#xD;
      receiving placebo after 24 weeks. It is also hypothesized that participants receiving&#xD;
      cannabidiol will improve on several supportive exploratory secondary outcomes (see outcome&#xD;
      measures section), and that a higher proportion of those receiving cannabidiol will have a&#xD;
      substantial benefit (50 % pain reduction) and a moderate benefit (30 % pain reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: The trial is designed as a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double blind and parallel-group trial.; the trial contains three periods: A pre-randomization&#xD;
      screening period (week -8 to 0), a main trial period (week 0 to 24), and a post&#xD;
      interventional observation period (week 24 to 36). The trial is designed to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of cannabidiol use for patients with fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is scheduled to start inclusion of first patient first visit, February 2021 or as&#xD;
      soon as possible thereafter, and the study period will go on for two year and end with the&#xD;
      last patient last visit in December 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants, who are included at screening, will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to&#xD;
      receive either cannabidiol 50 mg or placebo. Allocation will also be stratified based on sex&#xD;
      (male vs. female), age and pain intensity (over vs. under 7 on the Fibromyalgia Impact&#xD;
      Questionnaire Revised version (FIQ-R) pain numeric rating scale, to ensure that the groups&#xD;
      are equal. A computer-generated randomization sequence will create subject identification&#xD;
      numbers and allocate the subjects to treatment arms. The randomization sequence will be&#xD;
      created by an independent biostatistician using a random number generator (SAS Proc Plan),&#xD;
      and subsequently entered in the electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF), that will be developed&#xD;
      specifically for the study, by an independent data manager. If unblinding of a participant is&#xD;
      required due to an adverse event, the primary investigator can request to break the&#xD;
      randomization code for the individual patient, via the independent data manager. The&#xD;
      unblinding will always be performed at patient level and unblinding can take place any time&#xD;
      during the day (24/7). Randomization and concealed allocation are done electronically in the&#xD;
      e-CRF at the randomization visit (week 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Parker Institute, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital,&#xD;
      University of Copenhagen. The Parker Institute is a well-established research institute and&#xD;
      clinical department with secretariat, data managers and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) trained&#xD;
      health care professionals including physicians and study nurses. Monitoring will be conducted&#xD;
      from the initiation and throughout the trial by the GCP-unit at Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg&#xD;
      hospital, in accordance with the GCP rules and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will end when the last patient has completed the last visit as well as the 12-week&#xD;
      post interventional observation period, or prematurely discontinued the intervention or&#xD;
      withdrawn from the trial, which comes last.&#xD;
