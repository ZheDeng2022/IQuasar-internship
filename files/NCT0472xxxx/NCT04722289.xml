  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Danish healthcare system is universal and free of charge for Danish citizens, as all&#xD;
      healthcare services are financed by general taxes. However, socioeconomic differences exist&#xD;
      in access to healthcare services, treatment, and consequences of type 2-diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a realistic evaluation approach, this study aimed to evaluate the implementation of a&#xD;
      Danish peer support intervention, targeted on improving self-management and use of healthcare&#xD;
      services among socially vulnerable people with type 2-diabetes (&quot;peers&quot;). The study focused&#xD;
      on the mechanisms generating the intended outcomes. Further, how contextual factors in peers'&#xD;
      everyday life facilitated or hindered the mechanisms to operate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a multi-method case study (n=9). Data include qualitative semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews with four key groups of informants (peer, peer supporter, project manager, and a&#xD;
      diabetes nurse). Each type of informant per case was interviewed (n=25) to obtain different&#xD;
      perspectives of how the peers' interacted, and benefited from the intervention. All&#xD;
      interviews were completed immediately after the after the 6-month intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, a quantitative survey was conducted among peers at baseline (N=9) and follow-up&#xD;
      (N=9) to obtain information about how peers' individual contextual factors, such as their&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics, co-morbidity, diabetes complications, social relations, and&#xD;
      other life events influenced how they perceived and interacted in the intervention. Further,&#xD;
      to measure improvements in their diabetes-self management (DSM) and use of healthcare&#xD;
      services (outcomes). Questions from the Danish National Health Survey were used to measure&#xD;
      DSM: (eating habits, physical activity,and medication intake). Use of healthcare services was&#xD;
      measured by the number of times (during a 12-month period) the peers' attended diabetes&#xD;
      controls at the GP; food therapist, and ophthalmologist or had other form of contacts with&#xD;
      relevant health care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data were collected between February 2018 and April 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 6-month individual face-to-face peer support provided by non-professional persons&#xD;
      with T2D can improve self-management and use of healthcare services among socially vulnerable&#xD;
      people with T2D if contextual factors such as peers' sociodemographic characteristics, health&#xD;
      condition, and social relations facilitate their engagement in the intervention. Potential&#xD;
      mechanisms that generate the expected outcomes might be: peers' motivation, trust, perceived&#xD;
      beliefs and needs; and experience of being supported by the peer supporters.&#xD;

      The intervention consists of five components: Recruitment of peers and peer supporters;&#xD;
      training of peer supporters; match making of peers and peer supporters; individual&#xD;
      face-to-face meetings between peers and peer supporters; and ongoing supervision and network&#xD;
      meetings for peer supporters. The peer support meetings are held approximately every second&#xD;
      week for six months and contain three activities: 'Social and emotional support'; 'Assistance&#xD;
      in daily management'; and 'Linkage to healthcare services'&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A multi-method case study approach was used to identify mechanisms generating improved diabetes self-management and use of healthcare services (outcome) Thus, using this method, it enabled to investigate similarities and differences in how the mechanisms operated depending on peers' context.&#xD;
All peers and peer supporters included and matched in the intervention from February 2018 to July 2019 were invited by the project manager to participate in this study. In total, 9 out of 12 pairs who completed the intervention during this period accepted the invitation, and were thereby selected as cases. The peers were recruited through CfD (N=7), their GP (N=1), and the home care (N=2). The peer supporters were recruited among people who had completed a patient education in CFD (N=5), by members from the DDA (N=2), their GP (N=1), or by people who applied via 'Together on Diabetes' webpage (N=2).</intervention_model_description>
