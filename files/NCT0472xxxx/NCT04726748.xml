  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostatic urethral lift (Urolift) has been developed as a minimally invasive alternative to&#xD;
      transurethral resection of the prostate with no need of general anaesthesia, less need of&#xD;
      urinary catheter and less exposure to post-operative complication. Its efficacy and safety&#xD;
      have been assessed by 2 clinical randomized trials with evidence of urinary symptom&#xD;
      improvement remaining inferior to TURP but durable for 5 years. Urolift preserved overall&#xD;
      quality of life better than TURP. Urolift has been recommended by the European Association of&#xD;
      Urology guidelines and recognized by French authorities but cannot be financed by the&#xD;
      hospital itself. Reimbursement of the implants by healthcare system is therefore needed for&#xD;
      the distribution of Urolift in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional cost of the implants could be compensated by a reduced length of hospital stay&#xD;
      and a lower rate of post-operative complications inducing healthcare expenditures. This study&#xD;
      aims to assess if Urolift could be a cost-effective therapeutic strategy compared to&#xD;
      transurethral surgery with 2 phases design: a field study comparing patients treated with&#xD;
      Urolift to those treated with TURP/laser during 1 year follow-up, and an additional study&#xD;
      comparing healthcare consumptions during 3 years follow-up between each group using data of&#xD;
      the French National Claims Database (SNDS database).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral surgery such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), laser&#xD;
      enucleation or laser vaporisation, is the first line surgical treatment for bladder outlet&#xD;
      obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Even if bipolar and laser surgery have&#xD;
      improved surgical outcomes in terms of length of hospital stay and post-operative&#xD;
      complications, these procedures remain associated with a significant amount of infectious and&#xD;
      bleeding complications, as well as with some persistent side effects such as sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction and urinary incontinence.&#xD;
