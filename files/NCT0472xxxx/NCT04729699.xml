  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of physiotherapy program and review the&#xD;
      associations between neck movements, pain, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) movements and&#xD;
      quality of life in individuals with migraine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is one of the most common type of headaches in the world causing the greatest&#xD;
      disability in individuals under 50 years of age. Many different health organizations&#xD;
      (American Headache Society etc.) recommend regular physical activity and exercise for the&#xD;
      treatment and prevention of migraine. However, the relationship between aerobic exercise and&#xD;
      migraine is still not completely clear. Unfortunately, a research database to validate the&#xD;
      benefits of exercise for people with migraine is still being developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of physiotherapy program and review the&#xD;
      associations between neck movements, pain, temporomandibular movements and quality of life in&#xD;
      individuals with migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics of Kaunas Region&#xD;
      (2020-06-30 No.BEC-SR(M)-266).&#xD;

    <measure>Functional health and well-being - SF-36v2®</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire. Measure is divided into 8 subscales: Physical Functioning, Activity Limitation due to Physical Ailments, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Activity Limitation due to Emotional Problems, General Mental Health and Health Transition. Answers were scored (total score 100) and a higher total score meant a better quality of life.</description>
