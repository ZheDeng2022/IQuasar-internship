      Normobaric oxygen therapy was shown to be effective in reducing post craniotomy&#xD;
      pneumocephalus. Theoretical assessment of normobaric oxygen therapy in treating&#xD;
      pneumocephalus has shown that a higher level of oxygen concentration will significantly&#xD;
      decrease the time for absorption of pneumocephalus. The therapeutic efficacy is not fully&#xD;
      established in patients with chronic subdural hematoma after burr hole drainage. Both&#xD;
      radiological outcomes and clinical outcomes would be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is not a benign disease. Morbidity and mortalities were high&#xD;
      especially in those with recurrence requiring reoperations. The use of subdural drain after&#xD;
      burr hole drainage is an excellent example demonstrating that by reducing CSDH recurrence, a&#xD;
      significant improvement in functional outcomes can be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumocephalus is very common after burr hole drainage for CSDH. The use of high-flow oxygen&#xD;
      had been reported to be effective in small case series, showing effectiveness in clinical and&#xD;
      radiological outcomes. However, no large, prospective, controlled trial has been conducted to&#xD;
      establish the efficacy of oxygen therapy on functional outcomes for patients with&#xD;
      pneumocephalus after burr hole drainage in CSDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral CSDH has a different prognosis and is associated with a poorer outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to treating pneumocephalus, the use of perioperative oxygen has been suggested to&#xD;
      minimize tissue hypoxemia and infection. In a study published in the New England Journal of&#xD;
      Medicine, the use of perioperative supplementary oxygen was shown to reduce surgical site&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperoxia with oxygen therapy has shown to be safe with minimal changes to the cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow (CBF) from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does post-operative high-flow oxygen improve pneumocephalus in terms of volume reduction&#xD;
           in CSDH patients after burr-hole drainage?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does post-operative high-flow oxygen reduce the recurrence rate of CSDH (radiologically)&#xD;
           if pneumocephalus volume is reduced after oxygen therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does post-operative high-flow oxygen reduce the recurrence rate of CSDH (clinically), as&#xD;
           defined by symptomatic recurrence requiring reoperation, if pneumocephalus volume is&#xD;
           reduced after oxygen therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does post-operative high-flow oxygen improve CSDH patients' functional outcome in terms&#xD;
           of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months and 6 months?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Oxygen therapy for CSDH patients with post-operative pneumocephalus will&#xD;
      experience significant resorption of intracranial air within 24 hours. There is a reduction&#xD;
      in recurrence rate in terms of the re-operation rates. There is an improvement in functional&#xD;
      outcome in terms of mRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Study To evaluate changes in pneumocephalus volume and functional outcome after&#xD;
      oxygen therapy in post-operative CSDH patients treated by burr hole drainage, as compared to&#xD;
      the standard care by breathing in room air or low concentration oxygen during the&#xD;
      post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Prospective randomized 1:1 parallel-arm study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Randomization Patients will be recruited when they are considered fit for oxygen&#xD;
      therapy as determined by the treating clinician. The timing of burr hole evacuation may vary&#xD;
      according to the availability of the emergency operative time slot. The index intervention is&#xD;
      postoperative oxygen therapy: 100% normobaric oxygen through a nonrebreather mask (NRM) at&#xD;
      12-15 Litre/minute consecutively for 24 hours. Removal of the nonrebreather mask is allowed&#xD;
      during meals or other activities such as physiotherapy. The duration of mask removal would be&#xD;
      documented. Compliance with NRM is considered to be good if the mask is kept &gt; 90% of the&#xD;
      time during the 24 hours treatment period. The reference intervention is standard&#xD;
      post-operative care: the patient would be breathing in normobaric room air. For the reference&#xD;
      arm, if the patient has desaturation (i.e. SaO2 &lt; 93%), supplemental O2 therapy can be given&#xD;
      to keep SaO2 &gt; 93%. Arterial blood gas would be obtained by the clinicians when deemed&#xD;
      necessary. If there is a significant deviation from the study protocol occurs, the patients&#xD;
      will be analyzed according to their originally assigned groups (intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-rebreather masks, when they are tightly applied, are associated with a lower aerosol&#xD;
      dispersion distance (as compared to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or venturi&#xD;
      masks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim data analysis would be performed and the study would be terminated if a significant&#xD;
      difference in the primary outcome is observed.&#xD;
