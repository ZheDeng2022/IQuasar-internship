&#xD;
          -  if the patient is male, he must continue contraception for at least 31 weeks (90 days&#xD;
             plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo 5 half-lives) after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational drug. In addition, male patients must abstain from sperm donation&#xD;

             disease) or who are on hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient requires concomitant chronic treatment with systemic corticosteroids or&#xD;
             any other systemic immunosuppressive agents. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal&#xD;

             uncontrolled diabetes, bleeding disorder, interstitial lung disease, etc.), unrelated&#xD;

          -  Known microsatellite-instability (MSI-H or dMMR) as evidenced by a standard laboratory&#xD;
             practice (e.g. PCR or staining or sequencing etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or patients who are involuntarily incarcerated.&#xD;
