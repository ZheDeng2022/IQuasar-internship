  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to compare the effectiveness of dry needling in improving pain and&#xD;
      disability versus placebo, and versus infiltration, inpatients with myofascial&#xD;
      temporomandibular dysfunction in the short, medium and long term.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Patients beliefs about group allocation: A scale of cale of four options (Experimental Dry needling / Experimental Injection / Placebo Comparator / Active Comparator) in which patients had to indicate which intervention they believe they have received during the treatment sessions.</description>

    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported disability questionnaire: Craniofacial Pain and Disability Inventory (CF-PDI).&#xD;
The CF-PDI contains 21 items divided into 2 subscales according to their content and exploratory factor analysis: &quot;pain and disability&quot; and &quot;jaw functional status.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal summation (TS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Initially, a needlle stimulus is measured locally and distally. Then, the TS is triggered by 10 consecutive pressures on the PPT at the pressure determined at each location. For each pulse, the pressure was gradually increased at a rate of 2 kg/s at the determined PPT and held for 1 s before being released (with an interval of one second between each stimulus).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The level of depressive symptomatology was measured by the Spanish version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II); a 21-item self-report rating scale that assesses affective, cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression. Each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety (STAI questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) is a questionnaire that measures trait anxiety (a personality factor that predisposes the patient to suffer from anxiety) and the state of anxiety (environmental factors that protect or generate anxiety). Each of the two sub-scales (trait anxiety and state anxiety) consists of 20 items, ranging from 0 (nothing) to 3 (a lot).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesiophobia (TAMPA scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia. To assess the fear of movement and pain-related fear. The 11 items are scored 1-4, with total scores ranging from 11 to 44. The addition of all the points obtained from each of the items results in the level of kinesiophobia, with higher scores indicating greater perceived kinesiophobia</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fair avoidance beliefs (FAB questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fear-avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire . The instrument consists of two subscales, a four-item physical activity subscale, and a seven-item work subscale. Each item is scored from 0 to 6 and summed to produce the subscale score. Possible scores range from 0-28 to 0-42, with higher scores indicating greater fear avoidance beliefs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain catastrophizing (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophizing Scale (PCS). This tool is a 13-item questionnaire designed to measure the three components of pain-related catastrophizing: rumination, magnification, and helplessness, resulting in a unique score. Each item is responded to on a 5-point scale (0 not at all, 4 all the time) relating the degree to which the individual experiences a thought or feeling of a painful situation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expectation of improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one week</time_frame>
    <description>Patients´ expectations of pain improvement after the intervention. Patients report their estimated pain perception after the treatment by completing a Self reported Visual Analog Scale. Minimum value is 0 (best); Maximun value is 10 (worst).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Central sensitization inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It serves to identify the symptoms related to central sensitization. It consists of 25 items that are scored from 0: never to 4: always reaching a maximum score of 100. Results are interpreted as follows: subclinical = 0 to 29; mild = 30 to 39; moderate = 40 to 49; severe = 50 to 59; and extreme = 60 to 100.</description>
