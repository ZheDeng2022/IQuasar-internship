    <description>DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis, derived using differential weighting given to each of the four components. The components of the DAS28 (ESR) assessment included: TJC with 28 joints assessed, SJC with 28 joints assessed, ESR (millimeters per hour) and PtGA recorded on 100mm VAS (scores ranging 0 [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad]). DAS28 (ESR) was calculated as 0.56*sqrt (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt (SJC28) + 0.70*ln(ESR [mm/hour] + 0.014*PtGA [mm]; where, ln = natural logarithm, sqrt = square root of. Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. Here, all participants who achieved remission (DAS28-ESR &lt;=3.2) at Month 6 have been reported</description>
