      Overall Goal: To study the feasibility and safety of &quot;periareolar minimally invasive surgery&quot;&#xD;
      protocol in patients undergoing periareolar minimally invasive surgery vs. Control group&#xD;
      (inframammary approach).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective1: Test the hypothesis that, the periareolar approach is more feasible and&#xD;
           safer than the inframammary approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective2: Identify risk factors that are predictive of the need for periareolar&#xD;
           approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective3: Assess outcomes and postoperative results of both periareolar and&#xD;
           inframammary approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first successful cardiac operation was performed in 1896, in Germany by Rehn (1),&#xD;
      followed by the first successful cardiac valve operation in 1912 by Tuffier (2) and the first&#xD;
      successful mitral valve operation in 1923 (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1956, Lillehei repaired multiple valvular lesions through a right thoracotomy using&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1990s, the success of laparoscopic operations in general surgery renewed an interest&#xD;
      in minimally invasive approaches for cardiac surgery. Navia and Cosgrove (5) and Cohn et al.&#xD;
      (6) performed the first minimally invasive valve operations via the right parasternal and&#xD;
      transsternal approaches. Remarkably, excellent exposure was achieved through smaller&#xD;
      incisions, thereby making complex valve repair possible and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1996, Carpentier et al. (7) performed the first video-assisted mitral valve repair through&#xD;
      a minithoracotomy using ventricular fibrillation. With more experience, video-assisted,&#xD;
      2-dimensional endoscopes and robotics were introduced by Carpentier (7) and Chitwood (8,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009 Poffo et al (10,11) describe a new technique of minimally invasive cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      He and his colleagues adopting periareolar access for mitral valve surgery since 2006 and&#xD;
      published this technique in 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, due to its feasibility and safety, was soon incorporated as an ideal access for&#xD;
      other cardiac pathologies such as tricuspid valve disease, atrial septal defect, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, and pacemaker leads endocarditis. This led Poffo and his colleagues to publish&#xD;
      a long-term result on his technique in 2018 supporting the use of periareolar access as a&#xD;
      routine surgical technique for correction of several cardiac pathologies, especially in&#xD;
      women. (12)&#xD;
