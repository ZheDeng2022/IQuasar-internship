  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of mental fatigue on industrial work performance, biomechanical&#xD;
      determinants, (electro-)(psycho-) physiological measures and physical ergonomics.&#xD;
      Additionally, the current project wants to evaluate whether or not the Laevo exoskeleton&#xD;
      influences the aforementioned parameters when mental fatigue is acutely induced.&#xD;

    <measure>VICON: Placement accuracy Box</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy of placement box during the dual-task will be measured with VICON. VICON-markers will be placed on the box to track its movement during the trial. First, the optimal position of the box for each level (ground or shoulder) will be determined, these will form the reference frames. Next, the accuracy of each relocation will be determined by the offset compared to these reference frames. This will be calculated into a percentage.</description>

    <measure>Work performance: Percent accuracy Serial Seven Task</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>An audio record of this task will be made to verify made errors posthoc. During the serial seven task participants are given a number between 900 and 950. The given starting number will change each trial. Participants are asked to subsequently subtract seven as fast as possible.The researcher will take note of every answer. If the participant makes an error, he/she may continue to calculate with the wrong number. The ratio of correct answers to the total number of responses will indicate the percent accuracy for each participant.</description>

    <description>During a 15 minute trial, the participant will relocate a box of 5 kilograms between ground level and shoulder height. During this task, the participants are asked to perform the serial seven task, continuously subtracting seven from a given number between 900 and 950. Afterwards, the participant will perform a 60- minute Stroop task and is asked to repeat this abovementioned physical dual-task.</description>

    <description>A modified Stroop task of approximately 60 min will be used in order to induce mental fatigue (MF). This will be based on their performance during the max test that was conducted during the familiarization session. In this task, which will be partitioned in 4 blocks of 468 stimuli, four colored words (&quot;rood&quot;, &quot;blauw&quot;, &quot;groen&quot; and &quot;geel&quot;) will be presented one at a time on a computer screen. The participants will be required to indicate the color of the word, ignoring the meaning of the word itself.</description>

    <description>In the control task subjects will have to watch a documentary of 60 min on the same computer screen as the one used for the experimental trial. In order to avoid under- and over-arousal the subjects will have the opportunity to choose between several documentaries as proposed by the research team.</description>
