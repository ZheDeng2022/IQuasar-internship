  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intervention group will receive brief diabetic education, CGM education and use and have a&#xD;
      CGM placed before discharge. They will also sign up for &quot;Cloud&quot; access of their CGM data. A&#xD;
      medical assistant will review their CGM data daily to make sure they are using the CGM&#xD;
      adequately. The principal investigator will review the CGM data and call the patient for a&#xD;
      brief phone evaluation of their glucoses and their transition from the hospital to outpatient&#xD;
      care. The will be called 4 times between discharge and day 15 by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment group will receive a blinded CGM to be reviewed 30 days after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction in hospitalizations and ER visits within the first 30 days is the primary outcome.&#xD;
      Time in range, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and patient satisfaction will also be evaluated 30&#xD;
      days after discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to a community hospital with diabetes will be evaluated for being high risk&#xD;
      for rehospitalization. High risk patients will be identified and those that are found to be&#xD;
      high risk will be evaluated for entrance to the study and consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those that consent will be randomized to two arms, an intervention arm and a standard care&#xD;
      arm with CGM monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will include a brief 15 minute diabetic education session and a 15 minute brief&#xD;
      education on how to use the Freestyle Libre CGM. A sensor will be placed and initiated before&#xD;
      discharge. They will also sign up for a Freestyle Libre View account and grant access to the&#xD;
      intervention team. The will receive a handout of reasons to call the principal investigator&#xD;
      during the first 15 days and will be told to access the PI through the hospital operator. The&#xD;
      PI will call the patient on day 3-4, day 5-6, day 9-10 and day 14-15 after reviewing their&#xD;
      CGM data. The PI will review their glucoses and also any concerns from their hospitalization.&#xD;
      The team can then help bridge any treatment or care gaps with the patients PCP or care team.&#xD;
      The CGM data will be recorded for the first 14 days and data will be sent to the PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment arm will get 15 minutes of education on how to use the Libre Pro&#xD;
      blinded CGM sensor and the sensor will be placed before discharge. The sensor will be sent&#xD;
      back the the team and downloaded. After 30 days the data will be sent to the patients PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured for 30 days from discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction will be measured by a phone interview in both groups once after 31-40&#xD;
      days from discharge&#xD;
