  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hypothesizes that the administration of Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in CKD&#xD;
      patients with hyperkalemia while avoiding dietary potassium restriction will normalize their&#xD;
      serum potassium levels. Additionally, we aim to assess the effects of a high potassium diet&#xD;
      on renal function, endothelial function, acidosis, systemic inflammatory status and gut&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated with better outcomes in CKD patients.&#xD;
      However, the presence of hyperkalemia can prevent patients from increasing plant-based foods&#xD;
      in their diets. While hyperkalemia can have severe health consequences in advanced CKD, the&#xD;
      decreased consumption of plant-based foods can be associated with adverse health outcomes in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a non-absorbed cation exchanger that selectively&#xD;
      binds potassium in the intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll CKD patients with an eGFR ≤45mL/min and a serum potassium ≥&#xD;
      5mEq/L, administering SZC to achieve normokalemia, and provide them with a diet rich in&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables. Endothelial function, inflammatory biomarkers and stool microbiota&#xD;
      will be measured to assess the potential benefits of providing a diet rich in fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables, albeit rich in potassium, in advanced CKD patients. Because these patients are&#xD;
      usually restricting the intake of plant-based proteins and foods due to the concerns of&#xD;
      hyperkalemia, eliminating this serious and potentially-life threatening clinical condition&#xD;
      might carry health benefits, such as improved endothelial function and decreased inflammation&#xD;

    <description>Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC), a non-absorbed cation exchanger, selectively binds potassium in the intestine. SZC is in a powder form and will be provided to patients in packets containing 5g or 10gm of the medication. Participants will mix the contents of one packet with water (about 45mL). The drink should be stirred and drank immediately. If powder remains in the glass, then water should be added and the remainder of the drink should be consumed. Other medications should be taken 2 hours before or after SZC.&#xD;
At Day 0 and Day 1, participants will be taking SZC at 10gm three times a day. A serum potassium will be checked on Day 2; if serum potassium is &lt;5.1mEq/L, then the dose will be decreased to the maintenance dose of 5gm per day. At each serum potassium checks, the medication dosage will be adjusted accordingly.</description>
