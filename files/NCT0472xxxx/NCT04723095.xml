  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study collects information and data on patients with neuroendocrine cervical cancer.&#xD;
      Information from this study may be used to better understand the correlation between clinical&#xD;
      data, such as patient characteristics, treatment, and disease outcomes, and overall patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect, both prospectively and retrospectively, data on disease characterization,&#xD;
      treatment, and outcomes for patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To organize clinical information in order to support multifaceted queries of patient&#xD;
      characteristics, treatment, and disease outcome data and to facilitate correlation of these&#xD;
      characteristics with patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To have a single data repository kept on a secure platform that will integrate clinical&#xD;
      information and research findings and serve as an archive for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' medical records are reviewed retrospectively and prospectively. Patients are&#xD;
      followed up by email, telephone, or United States (U.S.) mail every 4 months for up to 10&#xD;
      years from date of initial study enrollment. Patients, who are beyond 5 years from their&#xD;
      initial diagnosis, are followed up by email, telephone, or U.S. mail annually.&#xD;
