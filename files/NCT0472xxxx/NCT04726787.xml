      The REMIT Trial is an open label, single arm phase IIa study investigating Radiotherapy as&#xD;
      preferred bridging method prior to Tisagenlecleucel treatment in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma approved to receive CD19 CAR-T cells as per their&#xD;
      licensed indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit 20 patients who have been approved to receive Tisagenlecleucel&#xD;
      treatment and where the tumour is amendable to radiotherapy as per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial subjects (patients) during a 14 day screening phase will have their metabolic tumour&#xD;
      burden assessed by PET-CT and bridging radiotherapy will be planned. Bridging radiotherapy&#xD;
      will commence immediately after leukapheresis with dose adjustments according to disease&#xD;
      burden and localisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease areas requiring effective long-term control will receive full dose radiotherapy, 20 -&#xD;
      30Gy /5-15# and other areas will receive low dose radiotherapy, 4Gy / 2# for optimal tumour&#xD;
      debulking and priming effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard lymphodepletion will be given day -5 to day -3 followed by Tisagenlecleucel infusion&#xD;
      on day 0. A window of 14-21 days will be left from last dose of radiotherapy and day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up at 3 and 6 months after Tisagenlecleucel infusion for a minimum&#xD;
      of 12 months.&#xD;
