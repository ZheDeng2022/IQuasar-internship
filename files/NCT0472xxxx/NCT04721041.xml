      Gut microbiota, known as &quot;unrecognized organs&quot;, is closely related to the occurrence and&#xD;
      development of tumors. Cancer is thought to occur secondary to local chronic inflammation.&#xD;
      And some bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori, also have direct genotoxicity, changing&#xD;
      intracellular signaling pathways and thus causing abnormal cell growth. Systemic intestinal&#xD;
      dysbiosis may lead to cancer, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can be a new weapon&#xD;
      in anti-cancer treatment. The reduction of intestinal flora diversity may lead to intestinal&#xD;
      dysbiosis, thereby reducing the body immunity and promoting the formation and development of&#xD;
      neoplasm. It has been reported that FMT can be used to treat melanoma, liver cancer and&#xD;
      prostate cancer after immunotherapy failed. But the mechanism of gut microbiota on the tumor&#xD;
      itself remains to be further explored. In 2019, an Italian study reports the efficacy of FMT&#xD;
      for diarrhea induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      suggesting the therapeutic potential of gut microbiota for tumor-related gastrointestinal&#xD;
      complications [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal Microbiota transplantation (FMT), the most classic way to treat diseases using gut&#xD;
      microbiota [2], refers to the transplantation of functional microbiota in the feces of&#xD;
      healthy people into the intestines of patients. It can reconstruct the overall gut microbiota&#xD;
      of patients, thus treating gastrointestinal diseases and external gastrointestinal diseases&#xD;
      of patients. In 2013, FMT was for the first time coined into the treatment guidelines on&#xD;
      recurrent CDI, and now it plays an important role as a key treatment for clostridium&#xD;
      difficile infection [3]. Washed microbiota transplantation (WMT), a new stage of FMT, is&#xD;
      based on the automatic microfiltration machine (GenFMTer, Nanjing, China) and the following&#xD;
      repeated centrifugation plus suspension with support from specific facilities. Compared with&#xD;
      manual FMT, WMT can reduce the rate of adverse events (such as fever, diarrhea, abdominal&#xD;
      pain, abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, etc.) without affecting the efficacy. In&#xD;
      addition, Zhang et al. have proved that WMT is better than the manual preparation of FMT in&#xD;
      improving safety, enriching the precise amount of microbiota and quality controllable in&#xD;
      practice [4]. In December 2019, A panel of 28 experts from 22 hospitals or institutes in 15&#xD;
      cities has contributed to the &quot;Nanjing consensus on methodology of washed microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation&quot; according to the international standards, and the consensus is published in&#xD;
      Chinese Medical Journal in July 2020 [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we conducted a prospective, one-arm, open-label study on the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of WMT in the treatment of oncotherapy-related intestinal complications. This study aimed to&#xD;
      exploring the therapeutic potential of WMT in the treatment of oncotherapy-related intestinal&#xD;
      complications and improving the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
