  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vericiguat (BAY1021189) is under development to treat heart failure, a condition in in which&#xD;
      the heart has trouble pumping blood through the body. Renal impairment which co-occurs in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure is a common condition in which the kidneys are not filtering the&#xD;
      blood as well as they should.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study was to learn more about the safety of vericiguat (BAY1021189), how it&#xD;
      was tolerated and the way the body absorbed, distributed and excreted the study dug given as&#xD;
      a single oral dose of 2.5 mg tablet in participants with renal impairment and healthy&#xD;
      participants matched for age-, gender-, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants stayed at the trial site for about 6 days. During this time, the doctors&#xD;
      took blood and urine samples and checked the participants' health. About 7-14 days after the&#xD;
      participants took vericiguat (BAY1021189), the researchers checked the participants' health&#xD;
      again and asked about any medical problems they had.&#xD;
