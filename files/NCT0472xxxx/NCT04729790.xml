  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, parallel assignment, double-blinded, efficacy and safety&#xD;
      study to be conducted in subjects with recurrent C. difficile Infection (RCDI). Approximately&#xD;
      200 subjects will be enrolled in the study and randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive lyophilized&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria obtained from either single or three donors (group 1 receiving healthy&#xD;
      microbiota collected from single donor 90g stool for 2 consecutive days; group 2 receiving&#xD;
      healthy microbiota collected from three donors 90g stool for 2 consecutive days). All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed for approximately 180 days following FMT treatment for safety.&#xD;

      The endpoints of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lyophilized product by&#xD;
      capsules obtained either from single or three donors and the prevention of subsequent bouts&#xD;
      of CDI in 60 days post FMT.&#xD;

    <masking_description>An independent statistician will develop a randomization list using SAS. Randomization in permuted blocks will be used to achieve balance across treatment groups. The randomization scheme consists of a sequence of blocks such that each block contains a pre-specified number of treatment assignments in random order. The purpose of this is to balance the randomization scheme at the completion of each block. The target sample size is 200 evaluable subjects or as many as can be done up to that number.</masking_description>
