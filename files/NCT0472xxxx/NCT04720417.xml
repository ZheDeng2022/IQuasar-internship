  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of combining defactinib and VS-6766 in treating&#xD;
      patients with uveal melanoma that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). The&#xD;
      way cells communicate with one another (different cell signaling pathways) are overactive in&#xD;
      uveal melanoma tumor cells. Giving defactinib together with VS-6766 may block pathways that&#xD;
      are important for the growth of uveal melanoma cells, and may result in shrinkage or&#xD;
      stabilization of the cancer and prolonged time to disease progression and survival.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the potential efficacy of the combination of defactinib hydrochloride&#xD;
      (defactinib [VS-6063]) and Raf/MEK serine/threonine kinase inhibitor RO5126766 (VS-6766) in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effectiveness of defactinib in combination with VS-6766 in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of the combination of defactinib and VS6766.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study the pharmacodynamic profile of defactinib in combination with VS-6766 in&#xD;
      pre-treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate mechanisms of resistance to the combination of defactinib and VS-6766.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the potential efficacy of circulating cell free deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) for prediction/monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive defactinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and VS-6766 PO twice a week (BIW)&#xD;
      (Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday) for 3 weeks in every cycle. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until death or up&#xD;
      to 2 years after the last patient is enrolled.&#xD;
