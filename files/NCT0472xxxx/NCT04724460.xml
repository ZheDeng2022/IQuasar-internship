  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the optimal duration of anticoagulation&#xD;
      therapy (6 months versus 18 months) with direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for&#xD;
      cancer-associated low-risk pulmonary embolism patients. The major secondary purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate whether home treatment of cancer-associated low-risk pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism patients with rivaroxaban is feasible, effective, and safe through an observational&#xD;
      management study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT), is a major health problem in the world. There have been many clinical studies&#xD;
      evaluating VTE, although data on low-risk PE, including incidental PE and asymptomatic PE has&#xD;
      been quite limited. However, low-risk PE was reported to account for a large proportion of&#xD;
      all the diagnoses of PE detected on computed tomography in daily clinical practice, and&#xD;
      optimal management strategies for these patients are becoming clinically more relevant. The&#xD;
      current American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines weakly suggest the same&#xD;
      approach for low-risk PE patients with cancer as other PE patients with cancer. However,&#xD;
      whether anticoagulation therapy should be continued indefinitely remains uncertain and the&#xD;
      duration of treatment in these patients might vary widely in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
      Recently, some observational studies reported that low-risk patients with cancer have a high&#xD;
      risk of VTE recurrence, suggesting the benefit of prolonged anticoagulation therapy. In this&#xD;
      open-label, superiority trial, the investigators randomly assign low-risk PE patients with&#xD;
      active cancer to receive either rivaroxaban for 6 months (short DOAC group) or rivaroxaban&#xD;
      for 18 months (long DOAC group).&#xD;

    <description>Hospitalization for VTE recurrence or bleeding events. VTE recurrence event is defined as PE and/or DVT by confirmation of new thrombus or exacerbation of the thrombus by objective imaging examinations or autopsy. Bleeding events are clinically relevant bleeding events, which is defined as major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Major bleeding is defined as International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding, which consisted of a reduction in the hemoglobin level by at least 2 g/dL, transfusion of at least 2 units of blood or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding event is defined as overt bleeding (i.e. is symptomatic or visualized by examination) which is not meeting the criteria for major bleeding, requires medical attention or is associated with discomfort for the subject such as pain, or impairment of activities of daily life.</description>
