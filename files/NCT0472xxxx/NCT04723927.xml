  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Gait analysis is a process of measuring and evaluating the walking patterns of patients by using surface electromyograph and motion analysis system.&#xD;
All participants perform overground walking to assess the change of kinematic, kinetic and muscle activation using a motion analysis and surface EMG</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on metabolic energy expenditure</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects underwent measurements respiratory metabolism energy during treadmill walking at a comfortable speed for 5 minutes.&#xD;
It assess the change of metabolic energy expenditure using a portable cardiopulmonary metabolic system (Cosmed K4bÂ², Rome, Italy).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on muscle activity</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects underwent measurements of muscle activity during treadmill walking at a comfortable speed for 5 minutes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on brain activity</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects underwent measurements of brain activity by measuring fNIRS during treadmill walking at a comfortable speed and high speed for 5 minutes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a series of tests used to evaluate lower extremity function and mobility in older people.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Four Square Step Test (FSST)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Four Square Step Test (FSST) is used to assess dynamic stability and the ability of the subject to step over low objects forward, sideways, and backward.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 meter walk test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of self selected speeds by measuring the time it takes an individual to walk 10 meters. To perform the test, patient walks 10 meters (33 ft) and the time is measured when the leading foot crosses the start line and the finish line. The instructions are: &quot;Please walk this distance at your normal pace when I say go.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Bathel index (MBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The MBI is a measure of activities of daily living, which shows the degree of independence of a patient from any assistance. It covers 10 domains of functioning (activities): bowel control, bladder control, as well as help with grooming, toilet use, feeding, transfers, walking, dressing, climbing stairs, and bathing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 minutes walking test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test (6MWT) measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fall Efficacy Scale (FES)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Falls Efficacy Scale (FES) is a ten-item test rated on a 10-point scale from not confident at all to completely confident.</description>
