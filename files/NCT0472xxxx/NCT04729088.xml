    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of Isosorbide Mononitrate&#xD;
      gel for intra anal administration. For the current study 2g of a 0,5% gel will be used (as&#xD;
      part of a safety investigational profile with doses up to 2% in other studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product will be administered to the participants by the study physician&#xD;
      as a single dose. Blood samples will be collected prior dose and up to 36:00 hours to&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters, including adverse events, will be monitored by the study team during&#xD;
      confinement (up to 24 hours post dose), at the 36 hour sample collection (ambulatory basis)&#xD;
      and as reported by the subjects or verified at the discharge visit, up to 15 days after&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
