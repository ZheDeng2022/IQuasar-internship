  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UAB Institute for Arts In Medicine (AIM) is currently implementing an expressive&#xD;
      emotional writing pilot project for adults with paralysis caused by neurological conditions&#xD;
      such as traumatic head or spinal cord injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the inability to move certain parts of the body, persons with paralysis caused by&#xD;
      neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury, traumatic head injury, and stroke&#xD;
      experience grief from the loss of physical capacity, social or occupational role function,&#xD;
      and life goals. Common complications associated with grief in these individuals include&#xD;
      increased anxiety and depression, poor physical health, and low sense of purpose in life.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is essential to identify community-based, self-help support that can serve as a&#xD;
      step to facilitate healthy grieving in these individuals. Such support should aim at shifting&#xD;
      their mindset from focusing on their loss (disability) to restoring daily function.&#xD;
      Constructing and reconstructing the story of one's own life has been reported in several&#xD;
      autobiographic accounts as a coping strategy to learn acceptance and how to live with various&#xD;
      traumatic conditions (i.e., grief resolution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Writing about emotionally traumatic or challenging experiences has been shown to have a&#xD;
      surprisingly beneficial effect on reports of symptom reduction and health care use, as well&#xD;
      as improvements in health status and well-being in people with chronic conditions. Expressive&#xD;
      emotional writing programs have demonstrated the ability to improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      individuals with chronic conditions. Although expressive writing could be a promising avenue&#xD;
      in reducing grief and improving psychosocial and physical functioning among adults with&#xD;
      paralysis, currently, few programs on expressive emotional writing are available for these&#xD;
      individuals. Therefore, the UAB Institute for Arts in Medicine (AIM) will implement an&#xD;
      innovative expressive emotional writing pilot project for adults with paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maximize the number of adults with paralysis who can benefit from participating in this&#xD;
      expressive emotional writing program, the investigators will partner with two additional&#xD;
      organizations -the Is-Able Center and the Lakeshore Foundation in Birmingham, Alabama. The&#xD;
      Is-Able Center (https://isable.org/) is a non-profit community organization which provides&#xD;
      services including grief support that encourage, educate and empower the quality of life for&#xD;
      individuals with disabilities. The Lakeshore Foundation (https://www.lakeshore.org/) is also&#xD;
      a non-profit community organization that serves and advocates for people with physical&#xD;
      disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The writing program will take place at both the Is-Able Center and Lakeshore Foundation&#xD;
      starting in July 2020. The program will run for 10 consecutive weeks, with weekly writing&#xD;
      activities. The grant funds will be used to reimburse mileage for adults with paralysis for&#xD;
      participation in the writing program, hire a program coordinator, and two coaches to&#xD;
      facilitate the writing program and facilitate discussion conducted in each of the two&#xD;
      community organizations.&#xD;
