  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a significant difference in&#xD;
      aesthetic and functional outcomes between nasalis sling flaps and lobed flaps of nasal tip&#xD;
      wounds requiring reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized clinical trial. Approximately 32 participants who are undergoing nasal&#xD;
      tip wound reconstruction surgery will be invited to participate and randomized to receive&#xD;
      either the nasalis sling repair or the lobed flap repair. Patients will be asked to complete&#xD;
      a few questionnaires including a VAS scale, the Surgical Outcomes scale, the NOSE instrument,&#xD;
      and the Nasal Appearance and Function Evaluation Questionnaire (NAFEQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of these procedures.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-16 weeks after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>This visual analog scale (VAS) measures outcomes of functionality and appearance with values ranging on a continuum from 0 to 10, and higher scores representing a better outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical Outcome Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6-16 weeks after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Surgical Outcome Scale is a likert agreement scale on surgical outcomes with values ranging from 1 (agree) to 5 (disagree), and lower scores representing a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6-16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Instrument is a questionnaire of nose functionality. This is a checklist of of problems related to the nose/nasal area with possible answers ranging from &quot;not a problem&quot; to a &quot;severe problem&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Nasal Appearance and Function Evaluation Questionnaire (NAFEQ) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6-16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal Appearance and Function Evaluation Questionnaire (NAFEQ) Scale is a likert scale on nasal appearance and function evaluations with values ranging from 1 (always; very poor; very dissatisfied) to 5 (never; excellent; very satisfied), and higher scores representing a better outcome.</description>
