      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uveitis is inflammation inside of the eye. It can cause vision loss. Little is known about&#xD;
      the disease. There are few treatment options. Researchers want to learn how the bacteria in&#xD;
      the gut might affect how people with uveitis respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the natural bacteria present in the gut and intestines to study whether it&#xD;
      might affect uveitis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 13 and older with non-infectious uveitis who are enrolled in the ADalimumab Vs.&#xD;
      conventional ImmunoSupprEssion for uveitis (ADVISE) trial, and their uveitis is being treated&#xD;
      or will be treated with an oral corticosteroid, conventional immunosuppressive drugs, or&#xD;
      adalimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 study visits at their respective clinical sites. The visits will be&#xD;
      6 months apart. The visits will align with the main ADVISE trial visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood samples. A needle will be used to take blood from an arm vein.&#xD;
      They will also give stool samples. They will get stool collection kits. They will collect&#xD;
      each sample at home and send it to the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete online diet history questionnaires. They will get an ID and&#xD;
      password to access the questionnaires. The ID is a unique code. This means it does not&#xD;
      contain any personal identifiers. They can complete the questionnaires at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last for 6 months.&#xD;

      Objective: To investigate the potential of gut microbiota as a biomarker of responsiveness to&#xD;
      treatment and to evaluate treatment related changes in fecal microbiota composition among&#xD;
      posterior segment uveitis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Up to 150 participants with uveitis may be enrolled in this study across up&#xD;
      to 21 participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective, case-control ancillary study. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a stool sample, blood sample, and complete an on-line Diet History Questionnaire&#xD;
      (DHQ). The study will last approximately three years, with two years for recruitment and one&#xD;
      year for follow-up. Participants must be co-enrolled in the parent ADVISE protocol (NCT&#xD;
      03828019.) in order to be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome answers whether there is a gut microbial signature at&#xD;
      baseline that can predict therapeutic response among uveitis patients. Additionally, this&#xD;
      study will explore whether the gut microbial ecology change differentially in response to&#xD;
      conventional immunosuppressives or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) treatment.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include exploring if there are molecular or immune phenotypic markers of&#xD;
      activity or therapeutic response: To identify molecular correlates of disease activity and&#xD;
      treatment response through transcriptional profiling (bulk ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing&#xD;
      of whole blood samples collected in PAXgene tubes or a similar RNA stabilizing tube) and to&#xD;
      identify immunophenotypic correlates of activity and treatment response through flow&#xD;
      cytometry analysis (using Transfix tubes or a similar direct draw collection tubes used to&#xD;
      stabilize venous blood at the point of collection and preserve whole blood specimens for&#xD;
      immunophenotyping by flow cytometry.)&#xD;
