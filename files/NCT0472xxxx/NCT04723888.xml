  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to define whether nutritional supplement (oral&#xD;
      administration with alpha-ketoglutarate) capable of filling-up the citric acid cycle&#xD;
      (anaplerotic therapy) can improve outcomes in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm of&#xD;
      39-49 mm in diameter on ultrasound imaging. Alpha-ketoglutarate is commonly used as a&#xD;
      nutritional supplement specially by athletes to increase muscle strength. They can be mixed&#xD;
      with formula or other foods. Subjects will be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an age-related disease that characterized by permanent&#xD;
      regional dilation of the abdominal aortae, which results in catastrophic event of rupture and&#xD;
      sudden death. Currently, no effective drug to limit the progression or reduce the risk of&#xD;
      rupture has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic pathways, including glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid&#xD;
      metabolism, have indispensable roles in normal and dysfunctional vasculature. The Krebs cycle&#xD;
      is responsible for obtaining energy from food in the form of ATP, and ATP is essential for&#xD;
      muscle contraction and correct functioning of all organs. Besides, tight control of&#xD;
      mitochondrial functions is critical for maintaining metabolism balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an important metabolite in Krebs cycle, alpha-ketoglutarate not only improved energy&#xD;
      metabolism, but also extended lifespan and reduced morbidity in aging mice. It is widely used&#xD;
      in the market as a nutritional supplement specially by athletes to increase muscle strength.&#xD;
      Until now, no obvious toxic and side effects to the body was observed. Given the high&#xD;
      bioavailability, we propose that dietary supplementation with alpha-ketoglutarate can improve&#xD;
      the outcome in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 39-49 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the project team intends to establish the abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture risk&#xD;
      prediction model in the elderly cohort in the early stage, and randomize groups in patients&#xD;
      with an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 39-49 mm in diameter based on whether or not to&#xD;
      supplement alpha-ketoglutarate. There are two cohorts: the alpha-ketoglutarate intervention&#xD;
      cohort and the parallel control cohort. By observing the efficacy in terms of change in&#xD;
      aortic diameter and abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture incidence in the two groups during the&#xD;
      follow-up period, it provides evidence-based medical evidence for the future clinical&#xD;
      application of alpha-ketoglutarate.&#xD;
