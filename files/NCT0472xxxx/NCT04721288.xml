  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if an innovative mobile health intervention designed to&#xD;
      improve patient-provider communication can reduce unscheduled hospitalizations, and visits to&#xD;
      the emergency department and ambulatory clinic in adult heart, liver, and kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mobile health technologies such as smartphones and wearable devices can remotely monitor&#xD;
      health. These technologies hold promise to improve health outcomes in a spectrum of patients&#xD;
      by providing health care teams with better connectivity which may prompt more timely&#xD;
      responses to questions and improvements to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients benefit&#xD;
      from improved monitoring and removal of communication barriers as the most common reasons for&#xD;
      readmission and mortality may be mitigated by clinical intervention. Additionally, medication&#xD;
      adherence is critical in transplant patients to prevent graft rejection. We anticipate that&#xD;
      remote monitoring will improve medication adherence/adjustments, and will allow for&#xD;
      identification of early health issues, reducing preventable hospital readmissions. Thus, this&#xD;
      study will determine if an innovative mobile health intervention, designed to improve&#xD;
      patient-clinician communication, reduces unnecessary hospital readmission and visits to the&#xD;
      emergency department and transplant clinic when utilized in addition to the standard of care&#xD;
      telephone communication system. We will also incorporate clinical and continuous ambulatory&#xD;
      physiologic data collected as part of the mobile health intervention to develop machine&#xD;
      learning algorithms capable of identifying early indicators of adverse outcomes in adult&#xD;
      heart, kidney, and liver transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that: the delivery of personalized communication using a mobile health&#xD;
      application will improve patient self-management resulting in a 50% reduction in preventable&#xD;
      hospital readmission, and unscheduled visits to the emergency department and transplant&#xD;
      clinic. With tailored communication through the mobile health application, we expect fewer&#xD;
      standard of care phone messages for patients in the intervention group and patients with&#xD;
      higher activity levels (average daily step-count) pre-transplantation will have lower index&#xD;
      hospitalization length of stay. Finally, the large dataset collected from this study will&#xD;
      allow novel machine learning-derived risk prediction models to more accurately predict&#xD;
      adverse outcomes (e.g., organ rejection, infection, and death), compared to conventional&#xD;
      regression models.&#xD;
