  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS) can occur when there is a gradual reduction in the blood&#xD;
      supply to injured limbs, most commonly after fractures or crush injuries. If ACS is not&#xD;
      diagnosed early enough, it can result in muscle and other tissues dying off because of the&#xD;
      lack of blood supply. Diagnosing ACS remains a challenge for doctors - currently clinical&#xD;
      assessment and pressure probes are used to assess patients at risk of ACS. Previous research&#xD;
      has shown that measuring pH in injured muscles is promising in diagnosing ACS and may help&#xD;
      doctors diagnose ACS earlier than they can using current methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will use a pH probe to measure muscle pH, and in particular,&#xD;
      any build-up of acid caused by reduced blood flow in the injured limb. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare the pH probe values with the existing methods for diagnosing ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a fracture or crush injury who are risk of developing ACS will be recruited&#xD;
      into the study. Participants will have a pH probe inserted into tissue close to their injury&#xD;
      and pH data will be logged for up to 72 hours. Diagnosis and any treatment decisions for&#xD;
      participants in the study will be made using the existing methods and not based on&#xD;
      information from the pH probe (the team treating the patient will not have access to the pH&#xD;
      data). Data on diagnosis and any treatment given for ACS will be collected from participant's&#xD;
      medical notes. The Soft pH trial team will compare how well the pH probe performs in&#xD;
      diagnosing ACS compared to the existing methods. The investigators will follow participants&#xD;
      up at 6 months after their initial injury to identify missed ACS cases based on clinical&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosing ACS earlier may reduce the likelihood of long-term symptoms and loss of function&#xD;
      that is often seen in cases of ACS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are admitted to an orthopaedic trauma unit or intensive care unit with fractures&#xD;
      or crush injuries and who are at risk of developing Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS) are&#xD;
      eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will undergo routine monitoring for signs and symptoms of ACS. Patients who&#xD;
      are able to make decisions about the ongoing treatment of their injured limb will be&#xD;
      approached about the study. The patient will initially be given a short verbal statement&#xD;
      about the study. At this point, patients may agree to take part or request additional&#xD;
      information about the study. If patients request additional information, they can be offered&#xD;
      a brief Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) or more detailed PIL. After reading this, they may&#xD;
      agree to take part. Patients who agree to take part can either give verbal agreement to take&#xD;
      part at this stage, or written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to take part will have a pH probe inserted into their injured limb. The pH&#xD;
      probe will be attached to a pH monitor which will record pH data for up to a maximum of 72&#xD;
      hours (24 hours per probe). The surgical team will not have access to the pH data. During the&#xD;
      time participants are considered &quot;at risk&quot; for ACS, patients will be monitored in the routine&#xD;
      way (using regular clinical assessment and pressure monitoring). If ACS is diagnosed in the&#xD;
      routine way, then treatment (fasciotomy) will be offered as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients start to recover, written informed consent will be sought from those&#xD;
      participants who gave verbal agreement at the outset of their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until their discharge from hospital, clinical information will be collected from their&#xD;
      medical notes or collected directly onto the study case report forms. Information from the pH&#xD;
      monitor will be downloaded into the study website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will usually be followed up as part of routine care approximately 6 months after&#xD;
      their initial injury. Where possible, the study follow-up will coincide with this routine&#xD;
      follow-up. The study follow-up will include clinical examination of the limb that sustained&#xD;
      the initial injury (including any evidence of contracture, strength of flexion/extension and&#xD;
      any sensory abnormalities). At the 6 month follow-up participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to establish that the Softcell pH monitoring system measures muscle&#xD;
      pH in an injured limb over time, monitoring changes in muscle pH that are consistent with&#xD;
      ischaemia (drops in pH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The properties of the pH probe as a diagnositic test will be investigated. The first analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out after recruitment is complete, and initial data (up to 72 hours&#xD;
      monitoring for ACS, and to potential discharge) is available. For this analysis, the presence&#xD;
      of disease will be defined as fasciotomy within 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second analysis will be undertaken at the end of the study after the 6 month patient&#xD;
      reviews have been undertaken. For this analysis, the presence of disease will be defined as&#xD;
      fasciotomy within 72 hours OR evidence of contracture at 6 months OR significant reduction in&#xD;
      strength OR significant sensory loss which is not improving by six months that anatomically&#xD;
      suggest ACS.&#xD;
