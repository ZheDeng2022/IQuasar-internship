  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility of providing immunonutrition supplementation&#xD;
      to older burn patients (age 65 and older) and its impact on burn wound healing. Supplements&#xD;
      containing arginine and omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to have beneficial effects on&#xD;
      healing in other types of wounds but data within the burn population remains limited. 20&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into two arms, immunonutrition or conventional supplement and&#xD;
      can expect to be on study for 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies performed previously in burn patients have had mixed patient cohorts with small&#xD;
      sample sizes and these have failed to show any large improvements in wound healing. However,&#xD;
      in older populations the investigators suspect that immunonutrition supplements may have a&#xD;
      larger benefit to these patients as they often present with malnutrition and are more likely&#xD;
      to struggle with delayed wound healing. In this pilot study, the investigators look to assess&#xD;
      the impact of immunonutrition supplements the burn wound healing of adults over the age of 65&#xD;
      years with 5-15% total burn surface area (TBSA) partial thickness and full thickness burn&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome objective of the study will be time to complete wound closure. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives include need for surgical grafting, length of inpatient stay, and&#xD;
      infections including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, wound infections, and blood stream&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
