  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a companion imaging study that will add FES-PET/CT imaging to the FORESEE&#xD;
      trial at HCI. This study will establish the feasibility of using FES-PET/CT imaging to guide&#xD;
      therapeutic decision making for functional precision oncology trials. The unique ability of&#xD;
      FES-PET/CT to show absence of functional estrogen receptors throughout the entire body may&#xD;
      improve confidence among research oncologists that an ER+ metastatic breast cancer patient is&#xD;
      truly refractory to hormonal therapies which is a critical determination in the study design&#xD;
      of the FORESEE trial.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a companion imaging study to IRB # 131027 FORESEE: Functional precision oncology for metastatic breast cancer: a feasibility trial. This companion imaging study will obtain [18F]Fluoroestradiol (FES)-PET/CT imaging of breast cancer patients refractory to all combinatorial hormonal therapies enrolled in the FORESEE trial and correlate the FES-PET/CT results with data from FORESEE including estrogen receptor (ER) status and drug profiling results from patient-derived organoid models.</intervention_model_description>
