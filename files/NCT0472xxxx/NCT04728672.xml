  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletes with chronic ankle instability tend to develop Glutei muscle weakness. This weakness&#xD;
      makes the lower limb prone to injuries. Kinesio Tape (KT) may assist this muscle in&#xD;
      performing its functions thus preventing injuries.&#xD;

      The aim was to study the effects of Kinesio Tape on hip abductor muscle strength and EMG&#xD;
      activity. Pretest-posttest experimental design was used. The study was conducted in the&#xD;
      research lab of the University. Thirty-four athletes with a mean age of 22.08 years&#xD;
      participated in the study. For the experimental group Kinesio Tape and for the control group&#xD;
      Micropore Tape (MT) was applied over Gluteus Medius (GM) muscle. GM muscle's strength and EMG&#xD;
      activity were noted in supine and during the Single-Leg Squat Test (SLST) respectively before&#xD;
      and after the intervention. Hip abductor muscle strength measured through a maximum voluntary&#xD;
      isometric contraction (MVIC) and GM activation measured through EMG. Handheld dynamometer&#xD;
      (Lafayette manual muscle test system), Power Lab EMG system.&#xD;
