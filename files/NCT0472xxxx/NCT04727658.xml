  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiosurgical thalamotomy on GammaKnife has been shown to be effective in the management of&#xD;
      tremors. However, several teams describe a significant risk of severe neurological&#xD;
      complications. In addition, fitting the invasive frame and the need to travel to GammKnife&#xD;
      centers often limit access to treatment in this population of elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear accelerators have greatly improved their precision, now reaching that of GammaKnife. A&#xD;
      possible alternative is therefore to treat patients on linear accelerators, without an&#xD;
      invasive frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the FRACTHAL study is to assess the feasibility and safety of treatment of&#xD;
      essential and / or parkinsonian tremor by fractional radiosurgical thalamotomy on a linear&#xD;
      accelerator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of the FRACTHAL study is based on the fact that dividing the dose into 3&#xD;
      sessions will both protect healthy tissue around the target while maintaining therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy on the treatment target.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be carried out according to a design by Simon in two stages (Simon, 1989).&#xD;
First step: 14 patients will be included in the study. When the 14th patient has been treated, the inclusions will be suspended for 1 year until analysis of the primary endpoint.&#xD;
• Second stage: 34 additional patients will be recruited for a total of 48 patients.</intervention_model_description>
