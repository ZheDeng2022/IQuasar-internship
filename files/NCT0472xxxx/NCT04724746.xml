  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed Stage IA/IB study is to establish feasibility of an&#xD;
      integrated cognitive-behavioral intervention for reducing SUD and PTSD symptoms among women&#xD;
      who experienced a sexual assault within the past six weeks. The intervention will be tested&#xD;
      in an open label trial to make final modifications to evaluate feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of the five to six week integrated intervention with standardized&#xD;
      repeated measures during a one-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Alcohol Use Disorder symptoms on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test is a screening tool that will be used to gather data about participants' alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol related-problems. This screening measure is rated on a 5-point scale and based in terms of standard alcoholic drinks. A score of 8 or more is associated with harmful or hazardous drinking, a score of 13 or more in women, is likely to indicate alcohol dependence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Percent Drinking Days on The Time Line Follow-Back</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will report on drinking during the 30 days prior to initiation of the study, and every day until study completion completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Time Line Follow Back (TLFB) will be used to assess heavy drinking in the past 30-days. This calendar-assisted interview yielded estimates in terms of the number of standard drinks consumed daily in the past 30 days used to obtain retrospective self-report of alcohol use by using a calendar and other memory prompts to stimulate recall.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of standard drinks per drinking day on The Time Line Follow-Back</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will report on drinking during the 30 days prior to initiation of the study, and ever day until completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Time Line Follow Back (TLFB) will be used to assess heavy drinking in the past 30-days and use. This calendar-assisted interview yielded estimates in terms of the number of standard drinks consumed daily in the past 30 days used to obtain retrospective self-report of alcohol use by using a calendar and other memory prompts to stimulate recall.</description>

    <time_frame>: Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the 20-item Posttraumatic Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (PCL-5) to measure traumatic stress symptoms corresponding with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5 PTSD criteria. Items are rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely) with higher scores indicating greater traumatic stress symptoms. Total scores will be used.</description>

    <measure>Change in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms on The Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (CAPS-5) is the gold standard in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) assessment. It is a structured 30-minute interview that can be used to diagnosis PTSD. Items focus on symptom presence, onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact on functioning, and symptom improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depression Symptoms on The Beck Depression Inventory-II</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a widely used self-report measure for attitudes and symptoms of depression. The BDI-II includes 21 self-report items and takes approximately 5-minutes to complete. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The maximum total score is 63. A total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety Symptoms on The Beck Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) assesses symptoms of anxiety via 21-item self-report. The BAI reliability discriminates anxiety-disordered from non-anxiety disordered patients and demonstrates excellent convergence with related anxiety scales. The values for each item are summed yielding an overall or total score for all 21 symptoms that can range between 0 and 63 points. A total score of 0 - 7 is interpreted as a &quot;Minimal&quot; level of anxiety; 8 - 15 as &quot;Mild&quot;; 16 - 25 as &quot;Moderate&quot;, and; 26 - 63 as &quot;Severe&quot;.</description>

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a widely used self-report measure for symptoms of depression. The PHQ-9 includes 9 self-report items, with total scores ranging from 0 to 27, and takes less than 5-minutes to complete. Scores of 5 (mild), 10 (moderate), 15 (moderately severe), and 20 (severe) are cut-off points.</description>
