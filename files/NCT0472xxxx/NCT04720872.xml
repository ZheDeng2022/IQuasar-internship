  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial with a control group that aims to evaluate the effects of a manual&#xD;
      therapy protocol, together with a physical therapist-directed vestibular rehabilitation&#xD;
      program, in patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction. The intervention&#xD;
      period will last approximately 4 weeks. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, just&#xD;
      after the intervention, as well as 1 and 6 months after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral vestibular disorders are common in otorhinolaryngology practice. These patients&#xD;
      often complain of vertigo and dizziness, as well as balance problems, causing an important&#xD;
      impact on health-related quality of life. The objective of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of manual therapy combined with physical therapist-directed vestibular rehabilitation&#xD;
      in patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction. The design of this study is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with two groups (experimental and control groups). The impact of&#xD;
      dizziness on daily function and quality of life (Dizziness Handicap Inventory), the fear of&#xD;
      falling and the balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale-16 items),&#xD;
      postural control (stabilometric platform) as well as the intensity (visual analogue scale)&#xD;
      and number of the vertiginous crisis will be determined. The intervention period will last&#xD;
      four weeks. Participants of the experimental group will receive 4 sessions of manual therapy&#xD;
      together with physical therapist-directed vestibular rehabilitation, while participants of&#xD;
      the control group will receive home-based vestibular rehabilitation. Outcome measurements&#xD;
      will take place at baseline, immediately after the intervention, one month and six months&#xD;
      after the intervention. Within-group and between-group data will be analyzed and interpreted.&#xD;
