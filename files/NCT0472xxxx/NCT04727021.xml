  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat venous thromboembolic disease, also known&#xD;
      as VTE. In people with VTE, blood clots form in the veins of the legs, groin, or arms. These&#xD;
      clots or a piece of a clot can break free and move around the body in the blood vessels.&#xD;
      These clots can block small blood vessels, causing other conditions like high blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart attack, and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before people with a medical condition can take an approved treatment in a new form,&#xD;
      researchers do trials in healthy participants. This helps them understand how the new form&#xD;
      acts in the body and to better understand its safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the researchers will compare how much of the trial treatment gets into the&#xD;
      blood when taken in 2 different forms in a small number of participants. The trial will&#xD;
      include about 30 men who are aged 18 to 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, there will be 2 groups of participants. The participants will take rivaroxaban&#xD;
      in the current tablet form and in a new liquid form 1 time. This was a &quot;crossover&quot; trial. In&#xD;
      a crossover trial, all the participants will take both forms of the treatments, but in a&#xD;
      different order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, the participants will stay at their trial site 2 times for 5 days. But, the&#xD;
      participants can be in the trial for up to about 6 weeks. During the trial, the doctors will&#xD;
      take blood and urine samples and check the participants' heart health using an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and measure the blood pressure. The participants will also answer&#xD;
      questions about how they are feeling, if they have any medical problems, and about any&#xD;
      medications they are taking.&#xD;
