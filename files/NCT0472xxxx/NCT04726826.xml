  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify clinically informative biomarkers of host defense&#xD;
      pathways with potential utility as diagnostic and prognostic tools among children&#xD;
      hospitalized with acute febrile illness in a resource-constrained sub-Saharan African&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypothesis is that a panel of biomarkers, readily measurable from a peripheral&#xD;
      blood sample, may serve as a clinically useful instrument to distinguish between common&#xD;
      pediatric causes of fever, predict those children at greatest need of aggressive supportive&#xD;
      care and/or adjunctive therapies, and identify those children at greatest risk of mortality.&#xD;
      The use of objective and quantitative tools may facilitate the triage and clinical care of&#xD;
      febrile children admitted to hospital in the sub-Saharan African context.&#xD;

      For pediatric patients presenting to Jinja Regional Referral Hospital in whom admission to&#xD;
      hospital is deemed necessary by an attending physician, the parent or guardian will be&#xD;
      approached for consent to participate in the study. If granted, a small volume (1mL) of blood&#xD;
      will be withdrawn for processing and storage. A RDT for malaria and whole blood lactate level&#xD;
      will be performed at the bedside. Basic demographic and clinical data will be collected from&#xD;
      the case admission record, and patients will be followed during their hospital admission.&#xD;
      Possible outcomes will include: death, discharge without disability, discharge with&#xD;
      disability, abscondment, and loss to follow-up. The length of stay among survivors will be&#xD;
      recorded (excluding patients leaving against medical advice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples will be shipped to the collaborating laboratory in Canada for analysis for&#xD;
      biomarkers. ELISA-based commercially-available assays for biomarker levels will be used to&#xD;
      quantify biomarker levels. In order to measure levels of 13 biomarkers from a plasma sample&#xD;
      of 500uL or less, highly co-ordinated procedures with experienced technicians are required to&#xD;
      perform the ELISA. Our laboratory in Canada has established protocols, experienced staff able&#xD;
      to perform the testing, as well as equipment and reagents allowing the testing to be done&#xD;
      efficiently. While it would be desirable to augment Ugandan capacity for biomarker testing,&#xD;
      this would require significant investment of time and resources for training and testing, and&#xD;
      may not be feasible in the context of this early study. If biomarkers can be identified that&#xD;
      have clinical utility, laboratory capacity for ELISA measurement of levels should be&#xD;
      developed or a simplified platform (e.g., lateral flow immunochromatographic test) should be&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia and meningitis will be diagnosed clinically. A combination of tachypnea,&#xD;
      respiratory distress (nasal flaring, intercostal and/or subcostal indrawing, or cyanosis) and&#xD;
      characteristic findings on chest auscultation (asymmetrical air entry, crackles, dullness to&#xD;
      percussion) will be used to make a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. In our setting, chest&#xD;
      x-ray is not available on site and radiographic confirmation will not be routinely available.&#xD;
      Neck stiffness, positive Kernig's or Brudzinsky's signs, convulsions and coma will be used to&#xD;
      make a diagnosis of meningitis. Where a lumbar puncture is performed, according to clinical&#xD;
      judgment, the results will be used to complement clinical diagnosis. CSF pleiocytosis or a&#xD;
      positive CSF culture for recognized pathogens will be used to support the diagnosis of&#xD;
      meningitis.&#xD;

        The choice of the age range for this study is as follows. Children under 5 represent a&#xD;
        vulnerable group, in whom infectious diseases play a major role as contributors to overall&#xD;
        mortality. Children under 2 months of age (the neonatal group) represent a unique&#xD;
        population with different infectious risks and are therefore outside the scope of our&#xD;
        current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The reason for exclusion of isolated diarrheal illness is that dehydration, acidosis and&#xD;
        electrolyte imbalances are the proximal causes of mortality, rather than activation of host&#xD;
        defense pathways with excessive inflammation and endothelial activation. Host biomarkers&#xD;
        are therefore not expected to predict mortality with the same accuracy in diarrhea&#xD;
        syndromes.&#xD;
