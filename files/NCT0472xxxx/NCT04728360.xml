    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, Phase 3 study designed&#xD;
      to compare efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and PK of BAT2206 with Stelara in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is composed of a ≤ 28-day screening period, a 16-week initial treatment period&#xD;
      (TP1), a 24-week secondary treatment period (TP2), a 12-week efficacy and safety follow-up&#xD;
      period up to end-of-study visit, for a maximum total study duration of 56 weeks.&#xD;
