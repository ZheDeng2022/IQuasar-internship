      GS001 is a open- label, non- randomized, uncontrolled, study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and kinetics of GS001 in hemophilia A subjects with residual FVIII&#xD;
      levels&lt;1IU/dl. Three patients will be enrolled sequentially every 3 weeks or more between&#xD;
      cohorts and administered with single infusion of GS001.Dose escalation may occur after a&#xD;
      single patient has been safely dosed if the resulting FVIII activity at Week 3 is &lt; 5&#xD;
      IU/dL.The dosing to the second subject will not be performed until acquiring the approve from&#xD;
      independent safety committee.The dose levels are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 2×10^12 vg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 6×10^12 vg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. 2×10^13 vg/kg Subjects will provide informed consent and then undergo screening&#xD;
      assessments up to 4-8weeks prior administration of GS001. All subjects will undergo 52(+- 2)&#xD;
      weeks safety observation.&#xD;
