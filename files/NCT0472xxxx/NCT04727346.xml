  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CBCT is considered an innovative imaging modality that can view the upper respiratory airway&#xD;
      anatomy in a 3D manner. Recent studies tried to evaluate the accuracy of CBCT in analyzing&#xD;
      the upper respiratory airway and its related structures. Although, most of these studies&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate the 3D imaging of upper respiratory airway in OSA patients and their&#xD;
      healthy counterparts, the determination of its level of collapse with the aid of CBCT wasn't&#xD;
      clearly evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISE is considered a dynamic approach to determine the level of upper respiratory airway&#xD;
      collapse accurately, but CBCT can offer better evaluation of anatomical upper respiratory&#xD;
      airway characteristics and morphology which in turn affects treatment planning and patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction after surgery. The hypothesis is agreed with other studies who found that&#xD;
      retroglossal collapse appears more frequently during the end of expiration imaged by dynamic&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is the validity of CBCT in determining the level of collapse through assessing&#xD;
      different orthogonal planes at end of inspiration and expiration especially in those patients&#xD;
      having a tongue/palate interaction or lengthy palate where this anatomical variation wasn't&#xD;
      been probably evaluated with DISE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this validity two-arm study, a total (n) patients will be included; all are diagnosed with&#xD;
      OSA and will undergo surgical treatment after appropriate planning. Patients will be&#xD;
      classified into two equal groups with allocation ratio (1:1). Patients of the study group&#xD;
      will be examined after scanning with CBCT at both ends of expiration and inspiration and&#xD;
      DISE. Control group patients will be examined by DISE only. After discussing the treatment&#xD;
      plan with the patient and educating the patient with all the data needed, an arabic consent&#xD;
      form will be signed by the willing participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These (n) patients will be selected by the ENT specialist according to the following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A multidisciplinary approach will be performed to diagnose OSA patients who are&#xD;
           indicated for surgery. Firstly, a comprehensive assessment of patients' history will be&#xD;
           performed; including evaluation of all risk factors and complete sleep history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) which consists of eight section questionnaire that&#xD;
           defines the frequency of an individual to fall asleep during regular daily activities&#xD;
           will be obtained from the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Afterward, a proper physical examination will be performed including a thorough clinical&#xD;
           examination of the oropharynx, nasopharynx, and hypopharynx to evaluate any anatomical&#xD;
           abnormalities as impotency of the nasal airway, elongated soft palate or uvula, enlarged&#xD;
           lingual tonsils, and any other pathological conditions of tongue, palate, and tonsils.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, Polysomnography (PSG) (sleep study) will be performed to allow proper evaluation&#xD;
           of normal and abnormal physiological sleep episodes. Apnea/Hypoapnea Index (AHI) will be&#xD;
           reported to detect the severity of OSA and patients were classified into mild (AHI =&#xD;
           5-14/ hour), moderate (AHI = 15-30 / hour) and severe (AHI &gt;30 / hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients in both groups will undergo upper airway surgery, DISE will be performed by&#xD;
           the same ENT surgeon to detect the level of collapse in the upper airway which will be&#xD;
           assessed by LwPTL and VOTE classifications, emphasizing on the primary structures&#xD;
           contributing at upper airway collapse, either alone or in combination: the larynx,&#xD;
           palate, tongue and pharyngeal lateral walls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group participants only will be scanned by CBCT twice; once at the end of&#xD;
           inspiration and the other at the end of expiration while they are gently holding their&#xD;
           breath for as long as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the study group, surgical procedures decision will be taken after appropriate&#xD;
           assessment to sites of collapse in CBCT views at both ends of expiration and inspiration&#xD;
           vies in combination to DISE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, strict post-operative instructions will be given to patients of both group and&#xD;
           a 3 months follow up would be done.&#xD;
