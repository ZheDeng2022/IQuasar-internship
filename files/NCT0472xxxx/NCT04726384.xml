      The aim of the project was to assess the acceptability of the device as well as adherence to&#xD;
      the study. The objective of study was to assess physical activity in patients with COPD&#xD;
      during in-hospital pulmonary rehabilitation program. The number of steps, average energy&#xD;
      expenditure expressed in MET and kcal, and physical activity time during the consecutive 5&#xD;
      days of the rehabilitation stay were analyzed. Physical activity level was continuously&#xD;
      monitored to assess intensity during in-hospital procedures as well as during leisure time.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients participated in pulmonary rehabilitation program consisted of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  specific respiratory exercises for 30 minutes - relaxation exercises for breathing&#xD;
           muscles, strengthening exercises the diaphragm with resistance, exercises to increase&#xD;
           costal or chest breathing, prolonged exhalation exercise, chest percussion, once a day&#xD;
           for 30 min,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  training on a cycle ergometer, twice a day for 20-30 min.- until the Heart Rate reaches&#xD;
           70% of the HRmax (220-age),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fitness exercises - coordination and balance exercises, stretching exercises using&#xD;
           elastic bands, balls rehabilitation, sensory pillows. Performed in a standing position,&#xD;
           kneeling, sitting, lying on side, abdomen and back, once a day for 30 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schultz autogenic training, once a day 20 min.&#xD;

    <description>The group was monitored for physical activity levels using the SenseWear Armband device. The group was informed of the purpose of the study and asked to wear the device 24 hours a day for the next 4 days (Friday-Monday) excluding bath time, no more than 30 minutes. Patients received the device on Thursday afternoon and returned it on Tuesday. However, the days Friday-Monday were analyzed to have a record of the entire days</description>

    <description>Physical activity was assessed using the Sensewear Armband device. Patients received the device on Thursday mornings, prior to exercise and treatments. The device was placed on the right arm throughout the study. Patients in whom the device monitored a minimum of 95% of the time of the study day were analyzed. Prior to the study, the devices were programmed to record a minimum level of intense (&gt;3MET) and moderate ( &gt;6MET) exercise.</description>
