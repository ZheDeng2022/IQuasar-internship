  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the BRAINYAC program is to prepare high school students for, and deliver,&#xD;
      the experience of working in a neuroscience research laboratory over a summer. Our program&#xD;
      goals are to prepare local students from Upper Manhattan and the South Bronx with the skills&#xD;
      necessary to enter a working research laboratory over a period of 8 months, and support them&#xD;
      in learning key laboratory skills and communicating them to an audience.Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that students' self-reports of scientific effectiveness and science identity will improve&#xD;
      over the course of the 8-month long program. Self-reported efficacy measures predict academic&#xD;
      performance in science, so an improvement in these self-report measures may indicate a higher&#xD;
      likelihood to succeed in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) studies or careers.&#xD;
      Likewise, science identity has a positive impact on a student's likelihood of entering a&#xD;
      science career, particularly in populations that are under-represented in science.Over a&#xD;
      4-year period we will track students' self-reports of (1) scientific efficacy, including&#xD;
      their level of confidence in scientific writing, oral presentation, library and literature&#xD;
      search, conducting research and general academic skills, and (2) science identity. We will&#xD;
      adopt a mixed-methods approach combining survey data with focus groups and interviews to&#xD;
      present a full picture of these changes. We also propose to track students after they leave&#xD;
      the program, to measure whether the changes in scientific self-efficacy translate into STEM&#xD;
      studies at the level of higher education or career choices. We will also obtain data from&#xD;
      scientific mentors in the program to inform us whether we are adequately supporting them in&#xD;
      providing the students with training.&#xD;

      This study will utilize a mixed methodological approach integrating quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data elements. It will employ a one-group, pretest-posttest research design, in&#xD;
      order to allow us to determine the effect of participation in the BRAINYAC program (i.e., the&#xD;
      intervention) on participating students' STEM development (i.e., efficacy and identity). The&#xD;
      study will also include retrospective individual and focus group interviews in order to&#xD;
      obtain a fuller understanding of the concepts under study (e.g., scientific identity,&#xD;
      readiness to pursue science, etc.) from the students' point of reference. To the extent&#xD;
      possible, the study will incorporate a longitudinal analysis in order to examine how program&#xD;
      participation affects students' academic and career decisions in their final high school and&#xD;
      postsecondary years through retrospective surveys of alumni participants. In addition to&#xD;
      assessing program impact, the research design will include an evaluation component to examine&#xD;
      program implementation. Through an examination of program documentation (e.g., student&#xD;
      attendance, descriptions of activities) and retrospective surveys of participants (i.e.,&#xD;
      students and mentors) this component will determine the extent to which the program was&#xD;
      implemented as proposed. It will provide valuable information connecting program elements to&#xD;
      observed outcomes and can be used to make modifications to the research and/or program&#xD;
      designs, as needed.&#xD;
