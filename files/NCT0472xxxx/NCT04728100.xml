  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by prolongation&#xD;
      of the corrected QT interval (QTc) on the electrocardiogram. LQTS is associated with a risk&#xD;
      of syncope or sudden death from ventricular arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in the duration of the corrected QT interval and / or changes in the morphology&#xD;
      of the T wave on the electrocardiogram are markers of an increased risk of sudden death and&#xD;
      syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a personal portable 6-lead device (DI, DII, DIII, aVF, aVL and aVR) connected to&#xD;
      the patient's smartphone has entered the market (KARDIA MOBILE 6L, AliveCor, Mountain View,&#xD;
      CALIFORNIA, USA). The APPLE WATCH Series 6 (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA) can also record an&#xD;
      ECG. If the device is designed to record a single lead (DI), several works have shown that it&#xD;
      is possible to record 9 leads (DI, DII, DIII, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6) by moving simply the&#xD;
      device (Spaccarotella CAS et al. JAMA Cardiology 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These devices were originally designed to screen for atrial fibrillation, but they produce&#xD;
      accurate 6- and 9-lead ECGs and could potentially allow ambulatory ECG monitoring of patients&#xD;
      with LQTS.&#xD;
