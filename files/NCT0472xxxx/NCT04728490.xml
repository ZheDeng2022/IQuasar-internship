  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The only curative treatment in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis is allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT). It has been reported that intermediate and higher risk&#xD;
      patients according to international prognostic scores benefit from HSCT in terms of survival&#xD;
      (Kröger et al, 2015). In 2013, we conducted in France a prospective trial testing the use of&#xD;
      ruxolitinib before transplantation (&quot;JAK-ALLO study&quot; NCT01795677). Outcome of patients was&#xD;
      better in patients transplanted with a matched sibling donor than an unrelated donor&#xD;
      confirming other studies (Kröger et al, 2009; Rondelli et al, 2014). In the JAK-ALLO trial,&#xD;
      acute GVHD incidence was high, often hyperacute and severe. Recently, the EBMT group has&#xD;
      reported a registry study on familial haplo-identical transplantation (haplo) in patients&#xD;
      with myelofibrosis (Raj et al, 2018). Post-transplant cyclophosphamide was used in 59% of&#xD;
      cases. One-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 61 and 58% which&#xD;
      favorably compared to outcome after unrelated transplantation. Genova team has also reported&#xD;
      impressive results after haplo-identical transplantation in their center (Bregante et al,&#xD;
      2015). Bregante et al have reported outcome of 2 cohorts transplanted from 2000 to 2010 and&#xD;
      from 2011 to 2014. The main difference between the 2 periods is the more frequent use of&#xD;
      haplo in the second period (54% versus 5%). Outcome was much better in the second period with&#xD;
      OS at 70% versus 49% and authors suggest that this improvement is related to the best outcome&#xD;
      among haplo transplantation. The improvement of outcome after haplo has been attributed to a&#xD;
      better GVHD prophylaxis, especially with the use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. Given&#xD;
      the poor outcome after unrelated transplantation and especially in HLA mismatched unrelated&#xD;
      setting and encouraging results in family haplo identical transplantation, this current study&#xD;
      proposes to test haplo-identical transplantation in myelofibrosis patients without a matched&#xD;
      related donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is disease and rejection-free survival one year after&#xD;
      haplo-identical transplantation in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis.&#xD;
