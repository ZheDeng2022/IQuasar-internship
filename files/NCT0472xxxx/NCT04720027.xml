      To establish which of the radiofrequency venous ablation modalities studied in the original&#xD;
      3RF study (Venefit (Closurefast), vs. Radiofrequency induced Thermal Therapy vs. Endovenous&#xD;
      Radiofrequency) is most effective in relieving patients' symptoms and signs from varicose&#xD;
      veins disease, and in maintaining absence of reflux in the treated vein segment (of the great&#xD;
      saphenous vein (GSV)) 5 years following surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results of randomised trials and meta-analyses have shown that endovenous thermal ablation of&#xD;
      the GSV using radiofrequency ablation or laser is associated with improved recovery compared&#xD;
      with conventional surgery. Furthermore, radiofrequency ablation (using the Closurefast&#xD;
      device) has been shown to cause less pain and require less analgesic intake than laser&#xD;
      treatment. At the time the 3 RF study was conceived there were two other radiofrequency&#xD;
      devices that were marketed to have theoretical advantages over the Closurefast technique. All&#xD;
      three devices were in use in clinical practice (including at Worcestershire Royal Hospital)&#xD;
      in 2013. The initial study focused on clinical results (up to 12 months) and anatomical&#xD;
      results (up to 6 months) and remains the only clinical trial to date that has directly&#xD;
      compared the outcomes of radiofrequency thermal ablation devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This second (long term) phase of the study aims to assess which of the radiofrequency venous&#xD;
      ablation modalities studied in the original 3RF study (Venefit (Closurefast), vs.&#xD;
      Radiofrequency induced Thermal Therapy vs. Endovenous Radiofrequency) is most effective in&#xD;
      relieving patients' symptoms and signs from varicose veins disease, and in maintaining&#xD;
      absence of reflux in the treated vein segment (of the great saphenous vein (GSV)) 5 years&#xD;
      following surgery.&#xD;
