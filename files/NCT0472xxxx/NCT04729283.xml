  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this present study is to compare functional results and quality of life after&#xD;
      sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis and sigmoid cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rectal resection surgery can lead to numerous complications in term of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      results with onset of fecal incontinence or in contrast constipation, and in term of&#xD;
      genitourinary results with occurrence of dysuria, erectile dysfunction, or vaginal dryness.&#xD;
      The low anterior resection syndrome is defined by the occurrence after rectal resection, of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms like fecal incontinence or stool evacuation difficulties, which&#xD;
      affect quality of life, despite conservation of anal sphincter. This syndrome is now well&#xD;
      known and used in many countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a lack of data concerning gastrointestinal functional results after sigmoid&#xD;
      surgery whether it is for cancer or diverticulitis. Some studies highlighted symptoms&#xD;
      persistence in many patients after sigmoidectomy. Lately, the LARS score was used after&#xD;
      sigmoidectomy for cancer. This study reveals symptoms of low anterior resection syndrome for&#xD;
      41 % of patients. The correlation between rectal resection and sigmoidectomy could be explain&#xD;
      by the resection of the upper part of rectum in case of sigmoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The issue of genito-urinary disorders after sigmoidectomy are poorly researched. Previous&#xD;
      studies demonstrate a higher risk of erectile disorders after pelvic surgery and especially&#xD;
      for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a lack of data on functional results and quality of life for patients who&#xD;
      are going into sigmoid surgery, whether for cancer or diverticulitis. The aim of this&#xD;
      longitudinal study is to compare digestive functional outcome, genitourinary outcomes and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients who undergo sigmoid resection for diverticulitis and cancer.&#xD;
