  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates whether proton radiation therapy directed to the prostate&#xD;
      tumor and nearby lymph nodes, is an effective way to treat patients with high-risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer who are receiving radiation therapy, and if it will result in fewer gastrointestinal&#xD;
      and genitourinary side effects. Proton beam therapy is a new type of radiotherapy that&#xD;
      directs multiple beams of protons (positively charged subatomic particles) at the tumor&#xD;
      target, where they deposit the bulk of their energy with essentially no residual radiation&#xD;
      beyond the tumor. By reducing the exposure of the healthy tissues and organs to radiation in&#xD;
      the treatment of prostate cancer, proton therapy has the potential to better spare healthy&#xD;
      tissue and reduce the side effects of radiation therapy. The information learned from this&#xD;
      study may also help researchers to learn more about proton therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of acute grade 2+ gastrointestinal toxicity compared to historical&#xD;
      photon treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of acute grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity compared to historical&#xD;
      photon treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the feasibility of extended-field proton irradiation of high-risk prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To demonstrate safety of proton therapy followed by high dose rate (HDR) boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo pelvic proton beam therapy daily on Monday-Friday for 5-7 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      may receive a high-dose rate brachytherapy boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months,&#xD;
      and 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 years.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of grade 2+ gastrointestinal toxicity within 30 days of receiving radiation therapy (RT) will be measured. It will be compared to the theorized reduction to 24% toxicity using the exact binomial test. Assessments are based on version 5 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), and the worst severity of GI toxicity will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Acute grade 2+ genitourinary (GU) toxicity rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity within 30 days of receiving radiation therapy (RT) will be measured. Assessments are based on version 5 CTCAE, and the worst severity of GU toxicity will also be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Optimal frequency of cone beam computed tomography (CT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Will determine the optimal frequency of cone beam CT during treatment and assess subsequent need for adaptive re-planning. The feasibility of extended-field proton irradiation of high-risk prostate cancer will be estimated using a re-planning rate of less than 10%. The re-planning rate will be estimated as binary variable, yes or no. The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) around the 10 % re-planning count based on the binomial distribution for the estimated 30 patients will be used (0.021-0.265). The study will be deemed feasible if the observed rate is not higher than the upper bound of the estimated 95% CI.</description>
