    <textblock>
      The goal of this investigation is to assess whether or not there is a significant difference&#xD;
      in the presence and/or degree of post-operative ecchymosis, pain, and edema between groups of&#xD;
      patients undergoing upper lid blepharoplasty with traditional local anesthetic (LA) and those&#xD;
      who receive tranexamic acid (TXA) in addition to traditional LA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood clot formation involves a cascade of reactions that results in the production of&#xD;
      thrombin, which converts fibrinogen into fibrin. In turn, fibrin aggregates and forms a clot.&#xD;
      Hemostasis depends on a balance between this clotting cascade and the processes that break&#xD;
      down clots, particularly the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and plasmin's subsequent&#xD;
      degradation of fibrin polymers. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an agent, first patented in 1957,&#xD;
      that competitively inhibits plasmin generation and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, TXA promotes clotting and, therein, hemostasis, making it useful for controlling&#xD;
      surgical bleeding. (See figure below.) Indeed, a 2012 meta-analysis demonstrated that&#xD;
      administering TXA intra- or perioperatively reduces the probability of receiving a blood&#xD;
      transfusion by one-third.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, large trials have shown that TXA does not increase the risk of thromboembolic&#xD;
      events in patients. One study noted that there was a slightly increased incidence of seizures&#xD;
      in patients who received TXA, though this was limited to patients who underwent open-heart&#xD;
      surgery, which is, itself, an independent risk factor for seizures. Another study halved the&#xD;
      dose of TXA administered to its participants, but this did not reduce seizure risk amongst&#xD;
      the participants. Thus, the data on this adverse effect remains inconclusive, and surgeons&#xD;
      continue using TXA for its hemostatic effects, especially in cardiac and orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeries. Given that facial plastic surgery does not incur the same sort of blood loss as&#xD;
      cardiac or orthopedic surgery, efforts to describe TXA use in this field have focused on its&#xD;
      established anti-inflammatory properties in addition to hemostasis. There are reports of TXA&#xD;
      use in rhinoplasties, face lifts, and blepharoplasties; however, such reports are scarce,&#xD;
      with randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trials even more so. Only one study has&#xD;
      examined TXA use in blepharoplasties. In that study, 34 patients were randomized to receive&#xD;
      an injection of lidocaine mixed with either TXA or saline. The authors did not find any&#xD;
      significant difference in post-operative parameters including size of periocular ecchymoses&#xD;
      and patient-reported pain level. Since the only randomized controlled trial investigating TXA&#xD;
      use in blepharoplasty involved 34 participants, the investigators aim to add to the body of&#xD;
      knowledge on this matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigator's study will be structured differently from that of Sagiv et&#xD;
      al. Firstly, the patients will serve as their own controls, since we will inject one eyelid&#xD;
      with a solution containing TXA and another with a placebo solution. This will help reduce&#xD;
      bias between study groups that may have existed in Sagiv et al's trial. Secondly, the&#xD;
      investigators will follow the patients for 3 months after the procedure, which is eleven&#xD;
      weeks longer than the duration of follow-up amongst participants in Sagiv et al's trial. This&#xD;
      will give the investigators an even better sense of TXA's impact on patients' post-operative&#xD;
      courses. In summary, the investigators wish to characterize TXA's hemostatic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects in patients who undergo blepharoplasty. Since there is currently&#xD;
      only one publication that accomplishes this, the investigators' objective is to expand&#xD;
      knowledge in this area so that surgeons performing facial plastic procedures can optimize&#xD;
      patients' recovery and outcomes.&#xD;
