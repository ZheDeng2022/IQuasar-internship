  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to compare patient-reported,&#xD;
      clinical, and functional outcomes in patients undergoing RTSA with and without subscapularis&#xD;
      repair after placement of a modern &quot;lateralized&quot; implant over the course of 24-months&#xD;
      postoperative.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and&#xD;
      clinical and functional outcomes between RTSA with and without subscapularis repair. The&#xD;
      specific aims for this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there is a difference in PROM scores between RTSA with and without&#xD;
      subscapularis repair during the 24-month postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there is a difference between the two surgical approaches with respect to&#xD;
      shoulder function, specifically range of motion and strength, during the 24-month&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there is a difference in shoulder dislocation rates between RTSA with and&#xD;
      without subscapularis repair during the 24-month postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there is a difference in surgical complications, re-operation or revision&#xD;
      rates between RTSA with and without subscapularis repair during the 24-month postoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To quantify the operative times for RTSA with and without subscapularis repair, and determine&#xD;
      if there is a difference between the two approaches.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial comparing two groups, RTSA with and RTSA without subscapularis repair. Eighty-four participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio in blocks of 12. All participants will be recruited from the patient populations of six fellowship trained upper extremity orthopaedic surgeons at initial consult. Patients will be randomized intraoperatively using a telephone/web-based system.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients will be blinded to their group allocation. This is possible because the incision and rehabilitation processes are consistent between groups. It is not possible for the treating surgeon to be blinded to group allocation, therefore a research team member (athletic or physical therapist) will remain blinded to group allocation and conduct all study related assessments as well as administer the patient-reported questionnaires. This will be maintained by the participant not removing their shirt during the study assessment. Patients will not be informed of which procedure they will undergo until the study is complete.</masking_description>

    <measure>ASES Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES is a patient-reported upper extremity-specific functional assessment tool and is scored out of a maximum 100 points, where 100 represents maximum function and no pain (Richards et al., 1994). It has a pain component measured on a visual analog scale as well as ten Likert-scale questions on function (e.g., put on a coat, sleep on affected side). The ASES is reliable and is validated for this population and is one of the most commonly used shoulder outcomes in North America.</description>

    <description>The Constant Score is validated and reliable PROM/clinical tool used to evaluate overall shoulder function based on pain, activities of daily living, and the clinical evaluation of ROM and strength (Constant &amp; Murley, 1987). This score is widely reported in European-based literature. Minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 100, with higher scores being a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is valid, reliable, responsive PROM used to document overall wellness based on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety/depression (Herdman et al., 2011). A single value is calculated (the value index), which indicates how good or bad a patient's health state is relative to a specified population. There are two components, VAS for general health, with 0 minimum and 100 maximum, with higher scores being more positive. The second component is a 25 point scale with minimum 5 and maximum 25 wit h lower scores more positive.</description>
