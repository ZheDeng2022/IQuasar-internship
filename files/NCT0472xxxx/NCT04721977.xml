  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tucatinib in combination&#xD;
      with trastuzumab and capecitabine in participants with unresectable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic HER2+ breast cancer who have had prior treatment with taxane anti-cancer agent,&#xD;
      trastuzumab, pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). The primary hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      confirmed objective response rate (cORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as determined by independent central review (ICR) for the&#xD;
      combination of tucatinib, trastuzumab and capecitabine, is greater than 20%.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to ~21 months</time_frame>
    <description>cORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters) per RECIST v1.1. The percentage of participants who experience a confirmed CR or PR as determined by ICR based on RECIST v1.1 will be presented.</description>

    <description>For participants who demonstrate a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters) per RECIST v1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST v1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The DOR as determined by ICR based on RECIST v1.1 will be presented.</description>
