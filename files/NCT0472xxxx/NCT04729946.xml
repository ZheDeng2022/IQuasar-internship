    <textblock>
      The Pure-Vu® System can be effectively used as a cleansing device in patients admitted with&#xD;
      acute LGIB to the intensive care unit and the regular nurse floor (RNF) bypassing the need to&#xD;
      administer an oral bowel preparation for adequate visualization and hence decreasing time to&#xD;
      colonoscopy and improving diagnostic and therapeutic yield.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), while generally defined as gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz, can be categorized into small bowel and colorectal&#xD;
      bleeding, two sites with distinct presentations as well as diagnostic and management options&#xD;
      (1). Acute LGIB secondary to a colorectal source usually presents with sudden onset&#xD;
      hematochezia with or without acute blood loss anemia and hemodynamic instability, and usually&#xD;
      leads to multiple invasive procedures and hospitalizations. It accounts for up to one-third&#xD;
      of all hospitalizations related to GIB (2). The current guidelines recommend urgent&#xD;
      colonoscopy to be performed within 8 to 24 hours of presentation and after adequate colon&#xD;
      preparation to improve visualization and diagnostic/therapeutic yield (1). While studies&#xD;
      looking at optimal timing of colonoscopy are limited for patients with acute LGIB, a study&#xD;
      comparing 48 patients with diverticular bleeding who underwent colonoscopy after rapid&#xD;
      polyethylene glycol (PEG) preparation and within 12 hours of presentation with endoscopic&#xD;
      hemostasis compared to 73 controls without endoscopic hemostasis, found a significant&#xD;
      improvement in outcomes in the group that underwent hemostasis, including bleeding (0% vs.&#xD;
      53%) and hospital length (median of 2 days vs. 5 days) (3). In another RCT of 100 patients&#xD;
      presenting with LGIB, colonoscopy within 8 hours of presentation after rapid preparation lead&#xD;
      to a more definite diagnosis compared to patients who underwent elective colonoscopy within&#xD;
      96 hours of presentation (4). Urgent colonoscopy however requires the rapid administration of&#xD;
      a large volume bowel preparation over 3-4 hours until the rectal effluent is clear (1). Purge&#xD;
      preparation can be challenging in critically ill patients and frequently requires the&#xD;
      placement of a nasogastric tube for administration of the preparation which could place the&#xD;
      patient at risk of aspiration, poor tolerance, and rarely, electrolyte imbalances (1).&#xD;
      Moreover, bleeding can subside while awaiting resuscitation and bowel preparation prior to&#xD;
      endoscopic intervention, which could lead to a decreased diagnostic and therapeutic yield.&#xD;
      The guidelines recommend against unprepped colonoscopy due to poor visualization and&#xD;
      increased perforation risk (1). A pilot study looked at the effect of &quot;hydroflush&#xD;
      colonoscopy&quot; in acute LGIB with minimally prepped colons (tap water enema without oral&#xD;
      preparation). &quot;Hydroflush colonoscopy&quot; was defined as colonoscopy using a combination of a&#xD;
      water jet pump irrigation and a mechanical endoscope suction device (BioVac direct suction&#xD;
      device). Out of the 12 patients included, the cecum was reached 69% of the time and&#xD;
      endoscopic visualization was found to be adequate to find the source of bleeding in all&#xD;
      procedures (5). The Pure-Vu® System (MotusGI Ltd.), a novel Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) 510k cleared intra-procedural cleansing device, has been recently introduced. The&#xD;
      Pure-Vu® System integrates with the colonoscope and generates a pulsed vortex mixture of&#xD;
      water and air in order to remove debris and is active at the time of cleansing to evacuate&#xD;
      colonic contents simultaneously (6). Its effectiveness has been studied in colonoscopies&#xD;
      requiring minimal preparation regimens with excellent and safe results (7,8). A multicenter&#xD;
      European feasibility study looked at 47 patients referred for colonoscopy who received a&#xD;
      limited bowel preparation and found significant improvement in the proportion of patients&#xD;
      with adequate preparation, with a median Boston bowel preparation score (BBPS) increased from&#xD;
      3[0-5] to 9 [8-9] (8). The REDUCE trial (9), another multicenter, single-arm study, was the&#xD;
      first trial to study Pure-Vu® in the inpatient setting, which enrolled 95 hospitalized&#xD;
      subjects. Adequate bowel preparation improved from 38% (95% CI 28,49) to 96% (CI 90-99) in&#xD;
      the evaluated segments. The mean BBPS improved from 1.74 in the left colon, 1.74 in the&#xD;
      transverse colon, 1.5 in the right colon to 2.89, 2.91 and 2.86 respectively (p&lt;0.001) (9).&#xD;
