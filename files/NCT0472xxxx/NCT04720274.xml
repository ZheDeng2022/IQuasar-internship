    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a combination of electromyopathy (EMG) shorts and muscle&#xD;
      monitoring software to collect data from participants performing physical exercises in order&#xD;
      to determine the combination's diagnostic efficacy and ability to provide rehabilitative&#xD;
      guidance for people who are recovering from hip injuries. Both healthy volunteers and Duke&#xD;
      Patients seeking treatment for their hip pain and/or injuries will be enrolled in our&#xD;
      research. If participants choose to take part they will be asked to wear these EMG shorts and&#xD;
      perform various exercises like running on a treadmill, riding a stationary bike, or lifting&#xD;
      weights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study consists of one study visit for healthy volunteers, but will last&#xD;
      up to six months for Duke Patients. At each standard of care clinic visit throughout six&#xD;
      months, Duke Patients will be asked to also come in for a study visit, wear the EMG shorts,&#xD;
      and perform the same exercises preformed during the first study visit.&#xD;
