  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line Toripalimab combined with&#xD;
      bevacizumab, nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in the treatment of patients with advanced&#xD;
      pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma(PSC) is a rare primary lung cancer, which belongs to the&#xD;
      category of non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), accounting for about 0.3%-1.3% of lung cancers&#xD;
      .Platinum-based combination chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant chemotherapy and palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy for NSCLC, and it is also commonly used for PSC. Advanced PSC has a low response&#xD;
      rate to systemic chemotherapy and a short duration of curative effect. The primary&#xD;
      progression rate of aggressive platinum-based chemotherapy is 60%-70%, showing that PSC is&#xD;
      highly resistant to multiple chemotherapeutics. In recent years, the progress of targeting&#xD;
      MET tyrosine kinase mutations has been relatively rapid, but most of the mutant PSCs&#xD;
      targeting EGFR, KRAS, ALK, and BRAF V600E are case reports and there is no effective&#xD;
      treatments. Immunotherapy has rewritten the treatment pattern of NSCLC. However, the current&#xD;
      application of immunotherapy in PSC are mostly case reports. In immunotherapy, IMpower150&#xD;
      research data suggests that the combination of immunity and anti-angiogenesis +&#xD;
      platinum-containing dual-agent chemotherapy can bring sustained OS benefits in NSCLC patients&#xD;
      , and safety tolerated. However, PSC has moderate to high tumor mutation burden (TMB &gt;10&#xD;
      mutations/Mb). This high mutation rate may increase tumor immunogenicity, making&#xD;
      immunotherapy a better treatment option. At the same time, VEGF, as a cytokine that promotes&#xD;
      the growth and differentiation of vascular endothelial cells, plays a decisive role in&#xD;
      promoting tumor neovascularization. In this regard, immunotherapy combined with&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis and chemotherapy is worth exploring in the treatment of PSC.&#xD;
