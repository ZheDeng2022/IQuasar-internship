  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) in Chinese children and adolescents is only 1 / 10&#xD;
      of that in Europe and the United States, which is a &quot;rare&quot; childhood tumor. Due to the &quot;drug&#xD;
      shortage&quot; and extremely low incidence, it has brought great difficulties to the domestic&#xD;
      clinical research and failed to achieve the desired effect. In this study, we apply a&#xD;
      well-documented effective protocol on newly diagnosed children and adolescents with HL to&#xD;
      understand whether the same treatment regimens can obtain similar event free survival rates&#xD;
      and overall survival rates and then find out the problems existing in the current clinical&#xD;
      care of HL in China, so as to make continuous improvement in the future and prepare for&#xD;
      innovative clinical research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, enrolled patients from age 1 through 18 years with newly diagnosed and&#xD;
      biopsy-proven HL are stratified into 3 risk groups according to 3 COG published trials:&#xD;
      AHOD0831 (high risk-all Ann Arbor stages III and IV with B symptoms), AHOD0031 (intermediate&#xD;
      risk-Ann Arbor stages IB, IAE, IIB, IIAE, IIIA, IVA with or without bulk disease, and IA or&#xD;
      IIA with bulk disease) and AHOD0431 (low risk-Ann Arbor stage IA or IIA without bulky&#xD;
      disease). Staging was determined with contrast-enhanced CT scanning or MRI, bilateral bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsies and FDG-PET. B symptoms included weight loss &gt; 10%, unexplained recurrent&#xD;
      fever &gt; 38Â°, or drenching night sweats. Bulk disease included a mediastinal mass with&#xD;
      diameter greater than one third of the thoracic diameter on an upright anterior-posterior&#xD;
      (AP) chest radiograph or extramediastinal nodal aggregate &gt; 6 cm in the longest transverse&#xD;
      diameter on axial CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low risk group: Patients receive 2 cycles of doxorubicin,vincristine, etoposide,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (AVE-PC) followed by early response (ER) evaluation. Rapid&#xD;
      early responders (RERs) receive 2 additional AVE-PC cycles. Slow early responders (SERs)&#xD;
      receive 2 additional ABVE-PC cycles followed by involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT). IFRT&#xD;
      consists of 21 Gy in 14 fractions of 1.5 Gy per day and is scheduled within 4 weeks after&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermediate risk group: Patients receive 2 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine,&#xD;
      etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (ABVE-PC) followed by ER evaluation. RERs receive&#xD;
      2 additional ABVE-PC cycles. SERs receive 2 additional ABVE-PC cycles followed by IFRT. IFRT&#xD;
      consists of 21 Gy in 14 fractions of 1.5 Gy per day and is scheduled within 4 weeks after&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High risk group: Patients receive 2 cycles of ABVE-PC followed by ER evaluation. RERs receive&#xD;
      2 additional ABVE-PC cycles followed by IFRT. SERs receive 2 cycles of IFOS/VINO and 2 cycles&#xD;
      of ABVE-PC followed by IFRT. IFRT consists of 21 Gy in 14 fractions of 1.5 Gy per day and is&#xD;
      scheduled within 4 weeks after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have disease progression at any time will be removed from this protocol.&#xD;
