  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The usual treatment for stuck rings includes a variety of techniques including use of ice to&#xD;
      reduce swelling, use of lubricants, and sometimes the use of string or ring cutters. The&#xD;
      success rate of these techniques is variable and cutting the ring is usually reserved as a&#xD;
      last resort. Sometimes removal of a ring can take time, and can cause some small injury to&#xD;
      the patient. Because of this, it is important to consider other methods for ring removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is looking at using a device that uses compression to reduce swelling of the&#xD;
      finger causing the ring to be stuck. This device has been approved for use in Canada. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective a compression device is at removing stuck&#xD;
      rings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study question is: how effective is a compression device at removing stuck rings?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Compression Device (CD) is a device that uses circumferential compression to reduce&#xD;
      swelling around a stuck ring. The device is used by placing it near, but not over-top, the&#xD;
      offending ring, and then is inflated compressing the finger. The device is applied, and the&#xD;
      hand elevated, for approximately five minutes. The device is then removed, and with a small&#xD;
      amount of lubricant, the ring is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients requiring ring removal at the QEII emergency department, if a compression device&#xD;
      can be used safely, will be asked if they would like to be included in the study and have&#xD;
      their ring removal attempted by a compression device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following removal attempt, the clinician will document information about the ring removal.&#xD;
      This will include some questions regarding the patient's experience with the removal. No&#xD;
      identifying information or personal health information will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to collect information about use of the compression device for a&#xD;
      period of one year. Following this time, the data will be analyzed to determine how effective&#xD;
      the compression device is at removing rings including statements regarding patient&#xD;
      experience. This information will be documented in a manuscript intended for publication and&#xD;
      may be presented at academic conferences or other continuing education events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be measuring the success rate of ring removal with the compression&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will record information on any side effects of use of the&#xD;
      compression device, as well as patient experience including pain and satisfaction.&#xD;
