  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To test the effects of a fiber-blend containing snack prototype in an escalating dose&#xD;
      regimen (from 1 to 3 servings per day over a period of 6 weeks) on the configuration and gene&#xD;
      content of the gut microbiota of overweight and obese participants (BMI 25-35 kg/m2), while&#xD;
      consuming a controlled diet that contains quantities of saturated fats in the upper tertile&#xD;
      and quantities of fruits and vegetables in the lower tertile of consumption in the NHANES&#xD;
      database (high saturated fat-low fruit and vegetable; HiSF-LoFV). Changes in the&#xD;
      representation of bacterial genes involved in carbohydrate utilization in the microbiomes of&#xD;
      participants will be correlated with changes in plasma biomarkers at the end of each&#xD;
      escalating dose phase by comparing features of their pre- vs post-treatment plasma proteomes&#xD;
      and metabolomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants will be asked to continue to consume their habitual diet (free diet&#xD;
      phase) for 1 day prior to being provided with a HiSF-LoFV diet in the form of packed-out&#xD;
      meals and snacks to consume for the following 62 days. Ten days after starting to consume the&#xD;
      HiSF-LoFV diet, participants will supplement this diet with a fiber-blend containing snack&#xD;
      (~10g fiber/serving) once daily for a total of 14 days; the energy contribution from the&#xD;
      HiSF-LoFV diet will be reduced accordingly to maintain energy needs during this time and the&#xD;
      remainder of the study. For the next 14 days, the diet will be supplemented with two of the&#xD;
      same fiber-blend containing snacks per day, followed by 14 days in which the snacks will be&#xD;
      consumed three times daily. Subsequently, a 'wash-out' phase of ten days in which the&#xD;
      HiSF-LoFV diet is consumed without any of fiber snack supplementation will conclude the&#xD;
      study. Stool, urine and blood will be sampled periodically throughout.&#xD;
