  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open, prospective, observational multicenter cohort study aims to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety as well as the effective serum concentration of Posaconazole for prevention of&#xD;
      pulmonary fungal infections in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The&#xD;
      correlation of UGT1A4*3 genotype and Cmin of Posaconazole, as well as invasive fungal disease&#xD;
      (IFD) breakthrough rates will be utilized to evaluate the efficacy while the safety of&#xD;
      Posaconazole will be assessed by the overall incidence and severity of adverse events in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      This open, prospective, observational multicenter cohort study aims to study the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and effective concentration of Posaconazole tablets for prevention of pulmonary fungal&#xD;
      infection in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A total of 360&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients receiving Posaconazole tablets are expected&#xD;
      to be enrolled. Posaconazole tablets will be taken orally from the day of transplantation&#xD;
      (300 mg Q12h D1) followed by 300 mg Qd, until 90 days after transplantation. The total&#xD;
      duration of the study is estimated to be 24 months, with each patient participating for an&#xD;
      estimated 3 months. The relationships between UGT1A4*3 genotype and drug serum concentration,&#xD;
      IFD incidence, Aspergillus infection rate, IFD-related mortality rate, IFD-free survival&#xD;
      rate, and overall survival rate will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of Posaconazole&#xD;
      tablets in preventing invasive pulmonary fungal infection in patients with hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation. Safety of Posaconazole tablet will be validated by the overall&#xD;
      incidence and severity of adverse events in patients.&#xD;
