  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke ranks 3rd among disability-causing diseases worldwide. Following a stroke, loss of&#xD;
      lower extremity motor function causes serious gait disturbances. The walking activity is the&#xD;
      basis for daily and social engagement activities. Mobility (locomotion) ability; gait&#xD;
      analysis can be evaluated with tests and reports examining walking performance. ABILOCO is&#xD;
      also a questionnaire developed by Caty et al., evaluating mobility and locomotion in&#xD;
      individuals after stroke. The aim of this study is; To investigate the validity and&#xD;
      reliability of the Turkish version of the ABILOCO questionnaire developed to evaluate&#xD;
      mobility in patients with stroke. The sample of the study will be literate individuals who&#xD;
      have had a stroke who applied to the Neurology Unit of Ankara Hacettepe University Faculty of&#xD;
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information of the cases will be recorded. ABILOCO questionnaire will be adapted&#xD;
      to Turkish. The validity and reliability comparison of the ABILOCO questionnaire with the&#xD;
      Berg Balance Scale and Timed Get Up and Go Test will be performed.&#xD;

      The sample of the study will consist of literate individuals who applied to Ankara Hacettepe&#xD;
      University Faculty of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Department and were diagnosed with stroke. The number of cases in the study will be&#xD;
      determined as 5 to 10 times the number of items in the questionnaire, and 65-130 individuals&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having a definite stroke diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who have stable post-stroke systemic findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini-mental test score of 24 and above&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who can walk 10 meters unsupported&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who passed 2 months after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for exclusion from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Having musculoskeletal problems that affect the mobility of the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use ABILOCO, which has been validated for individuals with stroke. Permission&#xD;
      was obtained from Gilles D. Caty, the development of the questionnaire, to conduct&#xD;
      translation and validity and cultural adaptation stduies into Turkish. In the study, firstly,&#xD;
      the original English version of the questionnaire will be translated into Turkish by two&#xD;
      professional translators independent of the study, and then it will be translated back into&#xD;
      its original language English by two native English speakers who do not have a medical&#xD;
      background. Translators will be brought together to discuss the two obtained versions of the&#xD;
      questionnaire. The latest version of the questionnaire will be translated into the native&#xD;
      language of the inventory and its compliance will be checked. Mini-Mental Test will be&#xD;
      applied to determine the cognitive status of the participants. Berg Balance Scale and Timed&#xD;
      Get Up and Go Test will be applied for mobility assessment. After that, the ABILOCO&#xD;
      questionnaire will be applied to the participants. In order to test the reliability of the&#xD;
      survey, the survey will be repeated 7 days later. Informed consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
      participant regarding their voluntary participation in the study and their sociodemographic&#xD;
      information will be recorded.&#xD;
