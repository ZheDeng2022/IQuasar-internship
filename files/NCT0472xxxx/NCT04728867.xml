  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital 3D animation and cadaveric videos have been increasingly used in surgical education&#xD;
      and provide tremendous opportunity to develop new surgical educational tools, particularly&#xD;
      during this Coronavirus-19 pandemic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, blinded study is designed to compare the educational&#xD;
      effectiveness of various educational tools including the surgical textbook, animation, and&#xD;
      cadaveric videos in laparoscopic rectal surgery among board-certificated surgeons. Initially,&#xD;
      an electronic questionnaire assessing the knowledge about laparoscopic rectal surgery will be&#xD;
      created and validated by the board-certificated colorectal surgeons. Exploratory and&#xD;
      confirmatory factor analyses will be utilized to test the structure validity of the&#xD;
      questionnaire. After the questionnaire will be sent to the graduates completing the general&#xD;
      surgery residency program in Turkey, the volunteers will be then randomized into four groups&#xD;
      based on the study material including a textbook, 3D animation, cadaveric video, and both 3D&#xD;
      animation + cadaveric video. A step-by-step educational 3D animation and a cadaveric video&#xD;
      will be prepared in order to teach the technical steps of laparoscopic rectal surgery.&#xD;
      Volunteers in four groups were given 2 weeks to review their educational material. After the&#xD;
      2-weeks of the study period, the volunteers will be asked to answers the same electronic&#xD;
      questionnaire imported in the edited live laparoscopic rectal surgery. Pre- and&#xD;
      post-educational assessment of the questionnaire among the groups will be performed and&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;

    <description>Rectal cancer questionnaire that assesses the knowledge about laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. We are expecting to see improved post-educational scores (higher than 20- mean value) (rectal cancer educational questionnaire) compared to the pre-educational scores. Higher than 20 is improved and better outcomes Range: 15-25</description>
