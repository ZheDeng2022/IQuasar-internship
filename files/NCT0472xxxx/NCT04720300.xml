  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (cRCT) portion of the study will focus on evaluating&#xD;
      the use of information, marketing, and incentives to shape student travel behavior to campus&#xD;
      through the three channels identified in Ajzen's (1991) framework.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate whether a package of information, marketing, and incentives&#xD;
      shifts student travel behavior to campus over one year, and in turn if these shifts in travel&#xD;
      behavior result in improved academic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives of the cRCT include evaluating whether the intervention results in&#xD;
      relatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Greater utilization of travel modes alternative to single-occupant vehicle travel&#xD;
           (transit, biking, walking, bike-sharing, electric scooters, and carpooling)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lower rates of car ownership&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Superior college performance--higher grade point averages (GPAs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. More credit hours completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Higher retention rates&#xD;

    <description>The Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) App will be provided to students in the Intervention Group and is intended to facilitate their use of alternative transportation modes such as public transit, ride-hailing, walking, biking, bike share, and e-scooter share to get to campus. The MaaS App will be downloaded to students' smartphones and will provide real-time, multimodal trip planning to students on demand when they open the app. This means, for instance, that a student can plan a trip that includes driving to a train station, taking the train, and then walking from the alighting train station to their final destination. The app will be white label, i.e. it will have a customized look and feel specific to the participating south Florida colleges, and it will have personalization features so that students can tailor the app to their travel patterns. Students in a cluster assigned to the MaaS group will also receive information concerning housing options. Students complete surveys</description>
