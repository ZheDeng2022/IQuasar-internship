  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of this study is that Kangaroo Father Care (KFC) will positively impact&#xD;
      acute physiologic and long-term behavioral outcomes in infants, fathers, and families.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the NICU at Prentice Women's Hospital. A member of the&#xD;
      study team will screen all NICU patients for inclusion and exclusion criteria by reviewing&#xD;
      electronic medical records. A screening and enrollment log will be kept to track families who&#xD;
      have been approached and agreed or declined to participate in the study. The screening and&#xD;
      enrollment log will be kept on a secure REDCap server housed by Northwestern University. Only&#xD;
      the study team will have access to this log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kangaroo Care (KC) Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, families will be scheduled to participate in two sessions of KC over two&#xD;
      sequential days. The goal will be to schedule the KC sessions for the same time of day (i.e.&#xD;
      morning, afternoon, or evening). However, if this is not possible given the parents', the&#xD;
      sessions will be scheduled for any time of day that participating parents are able to visit&#xD;
      their infant in the NICU. Each session will include two hours of continuous KC, with one day&#xD;
      focused on Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) and the other on Kangaroo Father Care (KFC), in a&#xD;
      randomized order. These sessions will include continuous skin-to-skin holding of the infant&#xD;
      by the parent, per standard of care protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologic Recording:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Infant: Prior to the first scheduled KC session, two wearable, wireless biosensors will be&#xD;
      placed on the infant to continuously capture physiology measures including electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      movement, systolic blood pressure (BP-S), and others for the duration of the study. One&#xD;
      device will be placed on the infant's chest or back. A second device will be placed&#xD;
      peripherally, on the infant's leg, foot, arm, or hand. The devices are encapsulated in a&#xD;
      medical-grade silicone and will be adhered to the infant's skin using a medical-grade&#xD;
      adhesive, similar to the adhesives standardly used in the NICU. The biosensors will be left&#xD;
      in place for up to 48 hours, but will be checked by study staff at least once every 24 hours&#xD;
      to ensure skin integrity and signal quality. The adhesives will be changed between uses. 2)&#xD;
      Parent: The same type of wearable, wireless biosensor will also be used to record 4 hours of&#xD;
      continuous physiology including ECG, HR, temperature, movement, SpO2, and others in the&#xD;
      infant's parents. The biosensor will be placed on the parent's chest 1 hour before the start&#xD;
      of a scheduled KC session and worn for 1 hour preceding the scheduled KC session, during the&#xD;
      2-hour KC session, and for 1 hour after the completion of the KC session. The biosensor will&#xD;
      be worn by the parents for approximately 4 hours in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the wearable biosensors are placed on the infant, the infant's skin&#xD;
      integrity will be evaluated using the age-appropriate, NICU standard of care protocol for&#xD;
      monitoring skin integrity. Study staff will take photographs of the skin at the site of&#xD;
      biosensor placement before the biosensors are placed and after the biosensors are removed.&#xD;
      Skin changes occurring while the biosensor is adhered to the infant's skin will be documented&#xD;
      photographically. No faces will be photographed. The study team will consult the bedside care&#xD;
      team within 1 hour for any ≥2 changes in skin integrity (based on the age-appropriate skin&#xD;
      integrity scale score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some patients, video monitoring of patient position and movement will be utilized during&#xD;
      the study. This is an optional, additional part of the study in which families can choose to&#xD;
      participate or not participate. For participating patients/families, a video camera will be&#xD;
      mounted in the patient room for the duration of the KC sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva Sample Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva will be collected from enrolled infants and parents non-invasively to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of KFC on established biomarkers of stress (cortisol and testosterone) and&#xD;
      father-infant bonding (oxytocin). Before, during, and after each KC session, saliva will be&#xD;
      collected from the participating parent, and their infant. A trained member of the study team&#xD;
      will collect saliva from infants using oral swabs made from an inert polymer and&#xD;
      appropriately sized for an infant mouth (approximately 5 mm). Oral swabs will be taken from&#xD;
      the infant immediately prior to beginning a KC session (T1), 30 minutes into the KC session&#xD;
      (T2), and 30minutespost-session (T3). Parents will self-collect saliva samples at the time&#xD;
      points outlined above, using an adult-sized oral swab. At T2, the trained study team member&#xD;
      will be able to help the parent collect the saliva sample, if necessary, while the parent&#xD;
      continues to hold their infant. This approach to salivary sample collection and biomarker&#xD;
      analysis is similar to that established by previous studies of kangaroo care and takes into&#xD;
      consideration the30-minute delay before cortisol reactivity in saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When saliva is collected from parents at time points T1, T2, and T3, parents will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete a brief saliva questionnaire. These questionnaires will take approximately&#xD;
      five minutes each to complete and will be completed on paper or directly in REDCap, depending&#xD;
      upon the participant's preferences. At T2, a study team member will be able to help the&#xD;
      parent complete the survey, if necessary, while the parent continues to hold their infant.&#xD;
      Data provided on surveys completed on paper will be transferred to secure REDCap forms by&#xD;
      study staff and destroyed within 24 hours. All questionnaire data will be stored long term on&#xD;
      the secure REDCap server housed by Northwestern University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ psychosocial measures to capture the short- and long-term impacts of&#xD;
      KFC. Specifically, validated measures of parenting confidence, relationship quality, infant&#xD;
      bonding, and father involvement will be assessed via a set of paper or REDCap surveys&#xD;
      administered in the NICU (short term) at baseline and the day before discharge (T-1) , and at&#xD;
      home (long term) at 2 weeks (T+14) and 4 weeks (T+30) after discharge. Each of these sets of&#xD;
      surveys will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. At baseline, each parent will&#xD;
      complete the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (RDAS) and the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PBQ). At T-1, each parent will complete the RDAS , the PBQ, and the Parenting Sense of&#xD;
      Competence Scale (PSOC). These questionnaires will be completed on paper or directly in&#xD;
      REDCap, depending upon the participant's preferences. Data provided on surveys completed on&#xD;
      paper will be transferred to secure REDCap forms by study staff and destroyed within 24&#xD;
      hours. At T+14 and T+30, each parent will complete the RDAS, the PBQ, the PSOC, and a Father&#xD;
      Involvement Questionnaire. These questionnaires will be completed directly in REDCap only.&#xD;
      Each parent will receive an email containing a link to their set of questionnaires at both&#xD;
      post-discharge time points. All questionnaire data will be stored long term on the secure&#xD;
      REDCap server housed by Northwestern University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearable Sensor Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wearable sensor that will be used in this study can stream data continuously using near&#xD;
      field communication (NFC) or Bluetooth technology. An encrypted laptop, iPad, or similar&#xD;
      device will be left in the patient room and used to capture the continuous data stream from&#xD;
      the wearable sensor. Additionally, wearable biosensors can include onboard memory, and&#xD;
      physiologic streams may be recorded to this onboard memory until transfer to an encrypted&#xD;
      laptop for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of Care Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients in rooms where data from standard of care monitoring is recorded on the&#xD;
      BedMaster system, this data will be used for comparison to data captured using the wearable&#xD;
      sensors. In participants in rooms where this system is not available, the MediCollector&#xD;
      system will be used to capture background data during the approximately 48-hour study.&#xD;
