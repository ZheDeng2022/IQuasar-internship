      Change and effect of cerebral autoregulation during targeted temperature management in&#xD;
      neurocritical patients&#xD;

      Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is the ability of cerebral vascular system to contract or&#xD;
      diastole with the change of perfusion pressure, and to maintain the stability of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow. It has been found that there are different degrees of CA damage in patients with&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage, ischemic hypoxic encephalopathy and sepsis. At the same time, studies have shown&#xD;
      that CA damage or loss is related to brain dysfunction and poor prognosis in patients with&#xD;
      neurocritical diseases. Therefore, early assessment and intervention of CA can help identify&#xD;
      individuals with high risk of complications and improve outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted temperature management (TTM) is a kind of body temperature management started when&#xD;
      the core temperature of patients is higher than 37.5 ℃, including achieve hypothermia&#xD;
      (TTMhypo) and maintain normal temperature (TTMnorm). TTMhypo has been widely considered as&#xD;
      one of the neuroprotective therapies for a variety of brain diseases and injuries, including&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, hypoxic brain injury caused by out-of-hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest and neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Its neuroprotective effects in&#xD;
      reducing brain edema, reducing intracranial pressure, reducing brain metabolism and&#xD;
      inhibiting apoptosis have been recognized. However, the existing studies mainly focus on the&#xD;
      effect of TTMhypo on the mortality and neurological outcome of patients with severe&#xD;
      neurological diseases in ICU. There is no large clinical study on the effect of targeted&#xD;
      temperature management (TTM) on cerebral autoregulation in patients with severe neurological&#xD;
      diseases. Due to the controversy of TTMhypo on mortality and neurological outcome, this study&#xD;
      aime to reduce the patient's core temperature to normal. Patients with severe neurological&#xD;
      disorders who still had cerebral autoregulation dysfunction, had fever, and needed to reduce&#xD;
      the core temperature to normal. Therefore, the effect of TTMnorm on cerebral autoregulation&#xD;
      before and during cooling was observed.The main measures were the THRR, Mx and TOx during&#xD;
      cooling.&#xD;
