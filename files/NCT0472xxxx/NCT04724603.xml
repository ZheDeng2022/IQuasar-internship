    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the imputability of adverse events in patients who have&#xD;
      had phage therapy for the treatment of their bone or joint or implant infection, in order to&#xD;
      find out whether these adverse effects are related to surgery, antibiotic treatment or&#xD;
      bacteriophages.&#xD;
