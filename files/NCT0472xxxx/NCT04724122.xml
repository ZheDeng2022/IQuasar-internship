  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incorporating elements from recognized surgical and anesthesia facility assessment tools the&#xD;
      survey assesses surgery and anaesthesia at Ethiopian public hospital facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surveys assesses infrastructure, workforce, and availability of resources across all&#xD;
      National facilities providing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An online national cross-sectional survey, designed through a consultative process involving&#xD;
      senior clinicians - anesthesia providers, surgeons, and obstetricians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elements incorporated from existing tools, including the Safe Surgery Hospital Assessment&#xD;
      Tool, World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) Anaesthesia Facility&#xD;
      Assessment Tool and the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery Surgical Assessment Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey questions grouped into themes: infrastructure, human resources, service delivery, and&#xD;
      the availability of medications, equipment, and guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final quantitative survey includes 77 questions, for distribution to clinicians at a&#xD;
      convenience sample of government hospitals providing major surgical services. Private&#xD;
      facilities are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online survey link sent via the N4PCc collaborator network to clinicians at each site.&#xD;
      All collaborators and clinicians are perioperative practitioners (anesthesia providers,&#xD;
      surgeons, obstetricians, nurses) at their respective institutions. Additional facilities with&#xD;
      no N4PCc collaborator contacted via the department of anesthesia at each institution.&#xD;
      Telephone follow-up with non-responding hospitals to overcome barriers to completion,&#xD;
      including assistance with data input where required.&#xD;
