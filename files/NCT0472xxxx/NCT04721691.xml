  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of Epidiolex in patients with ESES. ESES is&#xD;
      characterized by sleep potentiated spikes with a spike index greater than 85% (conventional&#xD;
      definition) and 50% (new definition)1. Several drugs including: steroids, intravenous Gama&#xD;
      globulin, Clobazam, other benzodiazepines, Valproic acid, and other anti-epileptic drugs have&#xD;
      been tried with mixed benefits2,3. Cannabidiol (CBD) would provide a novel mechanism of&#xD;
      action to assess for its efficacy in this population. This will be a double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial.&#xD;

      This study attempts to view the effect of Epidiolex on subjects with Electrical Status&#xD;
      Epilepticus of Sleep (ESES). ESES can cause various types of seizures which can fluctuate&#xD;
      during sleep. Similar studies have been conducted with Epidiolex with other seizure disorders&#xD;
      such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet Syndrome. Since there is no data available&#xD;
      on the effect of Cannabidiol (CBD) on patients with ESES, this study hopes to fill that void.&#xD;
      As such, patients that have been diagnosed with ESES will be eligible to participate in this&#xD;
      study to ascertain whether or not Epidiolex can reduce the frequency or intensity of the&#xD;
      seizures brought on by ESES during sleep.&#xD;

    <description>Epidiolex (Cannabidiol) is a colorless to yellow solution in a 100mL vial that is to be administered with a 5mL syringe.The starting dosage is 2.5 mg/kg twice daily, or 5 mg/kg/day. After one week, the dosage can be increased to a maintenance dosage of 5mg/kg twice daily, or 10 mg/kg/day. Patients who are tolerating Epidiolex at 10mg/kg per day and require further reduction of seizures may benefit from a dosage increase up to a maximum recommended maintenance. Dosage of 10mg/kg twice daily (20mg/kg/day), in weekly increments of 2.5 mg/kg twice daily(5mg/kg/day), as tolerated. For patients in whom a more rapid titration from 10 mg/kg/day to 20 mg/kg/day is warranted, the dosage may be increased to no more frequently than every other day administration of the 20 mg/kg/day. Dosage resulted in somewhat greater reductions in seizure rates than the recommended maintenance dosage of 10 mg/kg/day, but with an increase in adverse reactions.</description>
