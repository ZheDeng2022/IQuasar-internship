  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vasculitic neuropathy (VN) results from inflammation and destruction of the walls of&#xD;
      predominantly small vessels with subsequent ischemic damage of peripheral nerves. VN is&#xD;
      painful in vast majority of patients and the pain is intractable with pharmacotherapy in&#xD;
      about 40% of cases. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive&#xD;
      method of modulation of brain plasticity and is regarded as one of alternative methods to&#xD;
      alleviate pain associated with various kind of neuropathies. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of analgesic effect of rTMS in vasculitic neuropathy with sham&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;

      Vasculitic neuropathies (VN) are a group of disorders resulting from inflammation of&#xD;
      predominantly small vessels with destruction of their walls and subsequent ischemic damage of&#xD;
      peripheral nerves. Neural damage may or may not coexist with the damage of other organs.&#xD;
      Examples of conditions associated with VN include diabetes, microscopic polyangiitis,&#xD;
      eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), granulomatosis with&#xD;
      polyangiitis (Wegener's), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and others. VN&#xD;
      is painful in about 80% of patients of whom 40% suffer from the pain intractable with&#xD;
      pharmacological therapy. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive&#xD;
      method of modulation of brain plasticity. In this method, series of magnetic stimuli are&#xD;
      delivered to the cerebral cortex, where they turn to electric current and depolarize&#xD;
      repetitively the targeted neurons. If the stimulation is repeated during subsequent days it&#xD;
      is capable to modify the activity of targeted cortical area for weeks or even months and by&#xD;
      this way to achieve therapeutic effect. rTMS is widely regarded as one of alternative methods&#xD;
      to alleviate pain associated with various kind of neuropathies. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to compare the effectiveness of analgesic effect of rTMS in vasculitic neuropathy with sham&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
