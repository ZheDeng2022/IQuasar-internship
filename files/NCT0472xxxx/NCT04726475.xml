  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether cannabidiol (CBD) can interfere with the&#xD;
      reconsolidation (storage) of pathological fear memory in humans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to contribute towards the&#xD;
      development of a novel ultra-brief intervention for anxiety-related psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      such as panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Building off innovative&#xD;
      work in the basic neuroscience of fear memory interference (see Stern et al., 2018 for a&#xD;
      review), this experiment will be the first to evaluate whether cannabidiol (CBD) can&#xD;
      interfere with the reconsolidation of naturally acquired pathological interoceptive fear&#xD;
      memory in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder or subthreshold elevated concerns&#xD;
      about having additional panic attacks will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions:&#xD;
      (1). Memory reactivation + CBD, (2). Memory reactivation+ Placebo, or (3). CBD alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic all study procedures will occur online and over&#xD;
      videoconference with study staff. Additionally, CBD or placebo oil will be mailed to the&#xD;
      participant's location.&#xD;

    <description>A script-driven imagery approach adapted from prior research (see Brunet et al., 2018) will be used for the memory reactivation procedure. Specifically, participants will be instructed to write a brief one-page narrative in the present tense, first-person singular, focusing on their worst panic attack's most disturbing moments. The participant will then be asked to read the narrative aloud &quot;as if they were back in the event&quot; and record it on a recording device. Lastly, the participant will be asked to close their eyes and listen to their recording once while focusing intensely on their panic memory.</description>
