  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of&#xD;
      alpelisib and olaparib compared with single agent cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      platinum resistant or refractory high-grade serous ovarian cancer, with no germline BRCA&#xD;
      mutation detected.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include adult women with platinum resistant or refractory high-grade serous&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, with no germline BRCA mutation detected. Participants will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to either alpelisib plus olaparib or single agent cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
      (paclitaxel or PLD) in this open-label, active controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity that precludes further treatment, or until discontinuation of study treatment due to&#xD;
      any other reason. After treatment discontinuation, all participants will enter in the&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up period, which consists of a safety follow-up visit and a 9-week&#xD;
      post-progression visit. Once they complete the post-treatment follow-up, participants will&#xD;
      then enter the survival follow-up period.&#xD;
