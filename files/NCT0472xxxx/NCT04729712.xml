  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery (MITS) is a surgical method used to perform lung surgery&#xD;
      through small incisions between the ribs and includes both Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery&#xD;
      (VATS) and Robotic assisted Thoracic Surgery (RATS). MITS can cause a significant amount of&#xD;
      postoperative pain and if this is not adequately controlled, it can delay the patient's&#xD;
      recovery and it may be a precipitating factor for the development of Chronic Persistent&#xD;
      Surgical Pain (CPSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anaesthesia is the use of nerve numbing medications known as local anaesthetics to&#xD;
      block sensations of pain from a specific area of the body. For MITS, blocking pain arising&#xD;
      from the chest wall/rib cage would improve the patient's recovery after the operation and&#xD;
      overall patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been significant advancements made in thoracic (chest wall) regional anaesthesia&#xD;
      techniques. Ultimately, this involves injecting local anaesthetics around the nerves that&#xD;
      supply the chest wall. A single injection of these medications will only have a maximum&#xD;
      effect for up to 12 hours and often this is considerably less. To prolong the pain free&#xD;
      benefit, a thin tube known as a catheter will be placed so that the local anaesthesia&#xD;
      medication can be continuously given by a specific mechanical pump designed for this purpose.&#xD;
      This mechanical pump will be located at the patient's bedside and can precisely deliver the&#xD;
      medication in question at a rate between 10-15 ml/hr. This infusion of local anaesthesia&#xD;
      medication will continue for 48 hours after the operation and will be monitored by the&#xD;
      hospital's pain team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of two techniques for thoracic&#xD;
      regional anaesthesia after this type of surgery. Participants will be randomly assigned (like&#xD;
      tossing a coin) to receive either an Anaesthesiologist ultrasound guided Erector Spinae Plane&#xD;
      Block (ESP) with catheter insertion or surgeon video-assisted Paravertebral block (PVB) with&#xD;
      catheter insertion. Both these regional anaesthesia techniques are well established in&#xD;
      clinical practice, but there is little evidence published comparing them for this type of&#xD;
      surgery, in terms of quality of patient's short term (1-2 days) and longer-term (3 months)&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) block has emerged as a new regional anaesthesia technique which&#xD;
      has had promising early results in attenuating severe acute pain associated with Minimal&#xD;
      Invasive Thoracic Surgery (MITS). In a recent randomised control trial among MITS patients,&#xD;
      single-shot ESP block improved Quality of Recovery score (QoR-15) and reduced overall&#xD;
      complications at 24 hr compared with single-shot serratus anterior plane block (SAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block (PVB) has been widely used for analgesia after thoracic surgery for over&#xD;
      two decades because it reduces postoperative pain and opioid requirements. When compared with&#xD;
      systemic analgesia and alongside with epidural analgesia, it is considered the &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot; for thoracic regional analgesia techniques. Both ESP and PVB have usually been&#xD;
      described as a single-shot technique. However, catheter techniques offer the prospect of&#xD;
      flexibility and prolonged analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placement of a thoracic PVB catheter can be achieved by an anatomical landmark or ultrasound&#xD;
      technique. Ultrasound technique has a higher success rate and safer profile when compared to&#xD;
      the landmark technique but is technically challenging. However, in MITS an opportunity arises&#xD;
      for directly visualised placement of a PVB catheter by the surgeon under thoracoscopic&#xD;
      guidance. Insertion of the PVB catheter and verification by the surgeon under direct vision&#xD;
      could be a more reliable and safer method, but there are limited randomised controlled trials&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of this technique. Also, there are limited clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      trials on the catheter-based ESP analgesia technique using patient-centred outcomes.&#xD;
      Furthermore, no study has evaluated the effect of acute analgesia over 24-48 hr with&#xD;
      continuous regional nerve block on CPSP at 3 months after MITS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aim to complete a multicentre, prospective, double-blinded,&#xD;
      randomised controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      Anaesthesiologist-administered, ultrasound guided ESP catheter analgesia is equivalent to&#xD;
      surgeon-administered, video-assisted PVB catheter analgesia, in terms of early recovery&#xD;
      (QoR-15), respiratory spirometric function at 24-48 hr, and CPSP at 3 months after MITS&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting: This study will take place between three level four academic hospitals in the&#xD;
      Republic of Ireland (Mater Misericordiae Univeristy Hospital-MMUH, St Vincent's University&#xD;
      Hospital-SVUH and St Jame's University Hospital-SJH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care: Standard of care will be identical in both groups. The only difference will&#xD;
      be that one group will receive an anaesthesiologist ultrasound guided placement of an erector&#xD;
      spinae (ESP) catheter and the other will receive a surgeon video-assisted placement of a&#xD;
      paravertebral block (PVB) catheter. Patients in both groups will be given a general&#xD;
      anaesthetic as part of their care. All patients will be intubated with a double-lumen&#xD;
      endotracheal tube and a radial arterial line will be sited for continuous haemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring. Venous access will be at the discretion of the consultant anaesthesiologist. The&#xD;
      haemodynamic goal will be to maintain a systolic blood pressure within 20% of baseline and to&#xD;
      avoid a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute. Persistent hypertension and or&#xD;
      tachycardia above this point will trigger an opioid (oxycodone, morphine or fentanyl) to be&#xD;
      given intravenously. The frequency and dosage of this will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      anaesthesiology team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention: Participants will be randomised into either the ESP or PVB group. No&#xD;
      other forms of regional analgesia techniques (e.g. Intrathecal opioids, epidural analgesia,&#xD;
      and subcutaneous infiltration of local anaesthetic) will be used during this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety reporting: Any unexpected complications that may arise from this trial will be&#xD;
      documented and reported to the principal investigator, surgical consultant and the relevant&#xD;
      hospital patient safety board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and justification: The primary outcome will be the QoR-15 score at 24 hours post&#xD;
      operatively. The established minimum clinically important difference in QoR-15 is 8.0 and the&#xD;
      SD of QoR-15 scores is typically between 10-16. [range of QoR score is 1-150]. We have chosen&#xD;
      a SD of 12 to reflect our study population. Therefore, assuming Type I error = 0.05 and Type&#xD;
      II error = 0.2 (80% power to detect this difference), then n=36 patients will be required in&#xD;
      each group. We aim to enroll n=40 each group to allow for loss to follow up, missing data or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Potential participants for this trial will be identified by a member of the&#xD;
      surgical, anaesthetic or research team. A list of patients scheduled to have MITS will be&#xD;
      made available the day before the procedure. These patients' electronic medical records will&#xD;
      undergo a preliminary review to determine if they are potential candidates for this trial,&#xD;
      i.e. if participants meet the inclusion criteria and have no exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suitable patient will be approached the evening before surgery if available.&#xD;
      Alternatively, patients will be approached on the ward on the morning of surgery and their&#xD;
      suitability to participate in the trial will be confirmed. The purpose of the trial,&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks (including benefits and risks) and method of follow up will be&#xD;
      explained to the patient. A comprehensive and informative leaflet will be given to each&#xD;
      patient and they will be afforded an adequate amount of time (minimum 10 mins) to study it.&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that their participation in the study is entirely voluntary and&#xD;
      they will have the opportunity to withdraw from the study at any time and this will not&#xD;
      affect the quality of care they receive. Following this, participants will be offered an&#xD;
      opportunity to ask any relevant questions and voice any potential concerns. If he/she&#xD;
      professes an interest in participating in the trial written consent will be obtained. This&#xD;
      process will be completed before transferring the patient to the theatre environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed on Day 1 and Day 2 postoperatively for QoR-15 and&#xD;
      spirometric score. A member of the research team will phone the patient at 3 months after the&#xD;
      date of surgery and they will be asked to complete two questionnaires to assess for CPSP (BPI&#xD;
      and SF-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record Keeping: All patient data collected will be handled in accordance with European Union&#xD;
      General Data Protection Regulations (EU 2016/679). Data will be initially collected manually&#xD;
      and then transcribed onto Microsoft excel. Data collected from each hospital site will be&#xD;
      stored securely in the Department of Anaesthesiology at the respective hospital, on a&#xD;
      password-protected desktop computer stored in a locked office, such that only investigators&#xD;
      assigned to data processing and analysis will have access to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The collected raw data will be initially inspected for any errors, this&#xD;
      includes but is not limited to double-entry errors, missing data and data that was&#xD;
      incorrectly entered. Patients with missing or incorrect data will be excluded from the trial&#xD;
      and this data will not be included in the final analysis. The data will be tested for normal&#xD;
      distribution according to the Shapiro-Wilk test. Normally distributed data will be compared&#xD;
      between the two groups using the unpaired student t-test and non-normal distributed data will&#xD;
      be compared by using Mann-Whitney U test. All data will be summarised as mean + standard&#xD;
      deviation and p value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financing and Insurance/Indemnity: Investigators in each hospital will be covered by the&#xD;
      clinical indemnity scheme (CIS). No funding has been sought to conduct this clinical trial.&#xD;
      Existing resources available to the investigators are sufficient to meet the aims of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
