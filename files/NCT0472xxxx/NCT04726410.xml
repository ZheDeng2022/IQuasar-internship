    <textblock>
      The Cold Stored Platelet Early Intervention in Traumatic Brain Injury (CriSP-TBI) trial is a&#xD;
      proposed 3 year, open label, single center, randomized trial designed to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility, efficacy, and safety of urgent release cold stored platelets (CSP) in patients&#xD;
      with TBI requiring platelet transfusion. Patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      standard care or early infusion of urgent release cold stored platelets (CSP). The proposed&#xD;
      pilot study will enroll at the University of Pittsburgh and will enroll approximately 100&#xD;
      patients. The primary outcome for the pilot trial is feasibility, with principal secondary&#xD;
      clinical outcome of 6-month Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet transfusion is commonly provided to patients with moderate or severe TBI who are on&#xD;
      antiplatelet medications. Evidence suggests that patients on antiplatelet medications may&#xD;
      have worse outcomes following TBI. Current literature has not demonstrated major outcome&#xD;
      improvements in those patients who receive platelet transfusion. This lack of significant&#xD;
      benefit may be due to insufficient dosing or due to the poor hemostatic function of standard&#xD;
      care room temperature platelets. Studying the potential benefits of Cold Stored Platelet&#xD;
      transfusion in the TBI population will provide needed direct comparison of room temperature&#xD;
      and cold stored platelet transfusion which is unable to occur in patients with hemorrhagic&#xD;
      shock, who may require large volumes of red blood cells and plasma concomitantly with&#xD;
      platelet transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By providing Cold Stored Platelets in an urgent release fashion following injury, a&#xD;
      potentially superior hemostatic agent is given early, closer to the time of injury. The&#xD;
      current pilot trial was designed to determine the feasibility, efficacy and safety of urgent&#xD;
      release cold stored platelets as compared to standard care in TBI patients requiring platelet&#xD;
      transfusion. There are no high-level data which appropriately characterize the urgent release&#xD;
      use of cold stored platelets out to 14 days or their function over that time period as&#xD;
      compared to standard room temperature platelets. These results will be able to inform future&#xD;
      large randomized clinical trials allowing the most appropriate injured population, inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and primary outcome to be selected and utilized.&#xD;

    <description>10-item questionnaire used to quickly assess post-traumatic amnesia following head injury. The GOAT is read orally to the patient and may be easily administered at the bedside. The total score accounts for orientation of person, place, and time, and recollection of events pre and post- injury. Cutoff scores are available to identify abnormal, borderline, and normal orientation. The total GOAT score is obtained by deducting the sum of the error points from each incorrect response from 100. A score of 66 or lower is categorized as &quot;impaired,&quot; 66-75 as &quot;borderline,&quot; and 76-100 as &quot;normal.&quot;</description>
