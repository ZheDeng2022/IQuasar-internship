    <measure>General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-year</time_frame>
    <description>Oral health-related quality of life (QoL) measured 1 year after surgery using the GOHAI in the 2 groups of patients (MR with or without PVP).&#xD;
The GOHAI is an oral-disease-specific QoL measure made by the patient. The GOHAI comprises 12 items grouped into three dimensions: the functional dimension (eating, speaking, swallowing); the pain or discomfort dimension (drugs, gingival sensitivity, discomfort when chewing certain foods); and, the psychosocial dimension (concerns, relational discomfort, appearance). The response format for each item is based on a five-point Likert scale: always = 1; often = 2; sometimes = 3; seldom = 4; never = 5. A summary score (ranging from 0 to 60) is calculated for each patient with a higher score indicating better oral health. GOHAI scores close to 30 have been reported in head and neck cancer patients after oncologic surgery and pedicled or free flap reconstruction.</description>

    <measure>Functional outcome: Performance Status Scales for Head and Neck (PSS-HN)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS-HN is a 3-item scale designed to evaluate functional performance of H&amp;N cancer patients, specifically Normalcy of Diet, Eating in Public, and Understandability of Speech. Each subscale is rated based on semi-structured interview with a score of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better performance. The subscale scores are reported separately, and the Normalcy of Diet subscale will be the primary score of interest for this trial.&#xD;
The PSS-HN can be rated by health professionals including speech &amp; language therapists and research nurses. The person collecting this data will remain consistent, as far as is feasible, throughout the course of the study. Scores are determined following an unstructured interview.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional outcome: MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The MDADI is a self-administered questionnaire designed specifically for evaluating the impact of dysphagia on the QoL of patients with head and neck cancer. It surveys QoL issues relevant to swallowing via several subscales: Emotional, Functional, and Physical. A fourth measurement, the Global subscale, is a single question designed to establish quickly an overall assessment that pertains to swallowing. A score ranging from 0 to 100 is calculated for each subscale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of dysphagia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional outcome: Speech Handicap Index (SHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SHI is a well-validated and widely used self-questionnaire for assessing speech problems in OOPC patients. It comprises 3 items and provides insight into the nature and severity of patients' complaints. Response categories for all but 1 item range on a 5-point scale (''never,'' ''almost never,'' ''sometimes,'' ''almost always,'' and ''always''). The questionnaire also includes an overall speech quality item, with 4 response categories (''good,'' ''reasonable,'' ''poor,'' and ''severe''). A total SHI score is calculated by summing all items (score range, 0-120), with higher scores indicating higher levels of speech related problems.</description>

    <measure>Evolution of patient QoL: GOHAI score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 6 months, and at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Evolution of patient QoL GOHAI score at 6 months (this score will be compared to the score measured at baseline and at 1 year).&#xD;
The GOHAI is an oral-disease-specific QoL measure made by the patient. The GOHAI comprises 12 items grouped into three dimensions: the functional dimension (eating, speaking, swallowing); the pain or discomfort dimension (drugs, gingival sensitivity, discomfort when chewing certain foods); and, the psychosocial dimension (concerns, relational discomfort, appearance). The response format for each item is based on a five-point Likert scale: always = 1; often = 2; sometimes = 3; seldom = 4; never = 5. A summary score (ranging from 0 to 60) is calculated for each patient with a higher score indicating better oral health. GOHAI scores close to 30 have been reported in head and neck cancer patients after oncologic surgery and pedicled or free flap reconstruction.</description>

    <measure>Evolution of patient QoL: Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 6 months and at 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a general self-report questionnaire designed to assess QoL in cancer patients. It consists of five functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea, and vomiting), a global QoL scale, and six single questions assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients.&#xD;
As recommended by the EORTC, the scales and single-item variables of the QLQ-C30 will be linearly transformed into a score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functioning scale and for the global QOL scale represents a better level of functioning, whereas a high score for a symptom scale or a single item scale denotes a high level of symptoms or problems.</description>

    <measure>Evolution of patient QoL: Quality of Life Questionnaire - Head &amp; Neck Cancer Module (QLQ-H&amp;N35) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 6 months and at 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 is a tumor specific self-report questionnaire for head and neck cancer patients including seven symptoms scales (pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contacts, and sexuality) and six single items (teeth problems, mouth opening, dry mouth, sticky saliva, coughing, and feeling ill).&#xD;
As recommended by the EORTC, the scales and single-item variables of the H&amp;N35 questionnaire will be linearly transformed into a score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functioning scale and for the global QOL scale represents a better level of functioning, whereas a high score for a symptom scale or a single item scale denotes a high level of symptoms or problems.</description>

    <description>PVP is based on CT-scan with millimetric thin slice acquisitions of the facial bone and fibulas. The surgeon defines the exact sites of the intended mandibular osteotomies. A single external subcontracted laboratory (Materialise®) produces the various cutting guides for mandibular resection, flap conformation and the preformed plates for flap osteosynthesis. Flap conformation is entirely performed at the donor site before section of the vascular pedicle (flap still vascularized).</description>

    <description>Flap modeling and positioning requires one or multiple cuneiform osteotomies. The bone transplant is shaped to restore the contours of the mandibular defect using preoperative imaging studies and the resection specimen. Flap conformation begins at the donor site and is generally completed at the recipient site after fibular pedicle section and before microvascular anastomosis (during ischemia time). The different bone fragments are fixed together and to the native mandible using either titanium miniplates or reconstruction plate and monocortical screws. Regardless of the material used for fixing the fibular flap to the native mandible, the use of a reconstruction plate adapted to the native mandible (or other similar techniques) prior to tumor resection is recommended to guide flap shaping and positioning, and to insure an accurate MR.</description>
