    <textblock>
      Central sleep apnea (CSA) is a common condition and its treatment remains elusive. The focus&#xD;
      of this proposal is to identify the role of the physiologic path involving cortical arousals&#xD;
      in CSA by decreasing arousal frequency using the pharmacological agent zolpidem. The goal is&#xD;
      to identify the acute effects of administering zolpidem on sleep and respiratory outcomes,&#xD;
      and subsequently, its effect on the severity of CSA and propensity to develop CSA. This study&#xD;
      will shed light on the mechanisms underlying CSA that involve cortical arousals and will&#xD;
      guide future therapeutic interventions for CSA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The literature suggests that zolpidem may be effective in the treatment of central sleep&#xD;
      apnea (CSA). However, evidence regarding the efficacy of zolpidem and the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in its effect on CSA are not well-studied. Furthermore,&#xD;
      respiratory-related arousals are hypothesized to contribute CSA symptoms and severity. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to determine the effect of decreasing respiratory-related arousals on the&#xD;
      propensity to develop central apnea. The investigators hypothesize that administration of the&#xD;
      nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem will decrease the frequency of respiratory-related&#xD;
      arousals, lower the central apnea-hypopnea index, and widen the CO2 reserve during sleep in&#xD;
      patients with CSA compared to no treatment. Participants will complete a night study on a low&#xD;
      dose of zolpidem and another night study without zolpidem in a crossover manner. The order of&#xD;
      night studies is randomized. The results will help unveil the role of arousals in CSA and the&#xD;
      acute effect of zolpidem on CSA severity and the propensity to CSA.&#xD;
