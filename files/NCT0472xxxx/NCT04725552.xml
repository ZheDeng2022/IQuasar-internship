  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the proposed research is to increase patients' and general&#xD;
      practitioners' (GPs') awareness of alcohol as a relevant factor for a wide variety of health&#xD;
      problems in general practice, and enable earlier help and treatment. To achieve this, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to test the feasibility of a pragmatic strategy for identification of&#xD;
      alcohol-related health problems, and the feasibility of a web-based intervention between&#xD;
      consultations, as a supplement to usual care in general practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is a major health problem, and there is a strong need for improved identification&#xD;
      of and interventions for alcohol-related health problems. These constitute somatic and&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric health problems, caused, precipitated, or complicated by alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will especially recruit patients in late adulthood (60+), as this group may&#xD;
      experience more barriers with digital interventions, and will have more health problems&#xD;
      potentially affected by alcohol. The investigators have developed the identification strategy&#xD;
      and the interventions in close collaboration with key stakeholders: patients and health care&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to test the feasibility of interventions for hazardous (a quantity or pattern&#xD;
      placing patients at risk for adverse health events) and harmful alcohol consumption&#xD;
      (consumption resulting in adverse events), with two distinct components, namely pragmatic&#xD;
      case finding and a digital self-administered intervention (called Endre) for use between&#xD;
      consultations. The study will focus mainly on aspects related to acceptability, demand,&#xD;
      implementation and practicality. The results from this feasibility study may give valuable&#xD;
      knowledge on how this treatment approach should be adapted and implemented, and will indicate&#xD;
      whether a full-scale RCT is warranted. This study is testing the feasibility of interventions&#xD;
      intended to facilitate change for both patients (reduced alcohol consumption) and for&#xD;
      physicians (improved addressing of alcohol and improved intervention delivery).&#xD;

    <intervention_name>'Change' - an e-health intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The aim of the e-health intervention is to support the patient's change process and facilitate the doctor's ability to help. We plan for a web-application instead of a native application. A web-application enables use from mobile devices and from computers and is thus not dependent on a specific mode or system. Before including patients (postponed to September 2020 because of the Corona-virus pandemic), about 30 members of the general public have tested the e-health intervention.</description>
