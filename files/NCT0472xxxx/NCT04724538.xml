  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic of unprecedented proportions with an exponential&#xD;
      increase in incidence. Airway epithelium infection caused by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      triggers a cascade of difficult-to-control reactions, a so-called &quot;cytokine storm&quot;. In&#xD;
      contrast to the previously used method of external beam radiation therapy for patients at&#xD;
      high risk of a cytokine storm, in present study a different dose delivery mechanism through&#xD;
      inhalation of 99mTc-labeled carbon ultrafine aerosol obtained from a TechnegasPlus generator&#xD;
      is used. By utilizing anthropometric phantoms the dosimetric characteristics of the applied&#xD;
      technique and obtained the coefficients of the transition from the count rate over the area&#xD;
      of interest to the activity contained in this area (in kBq) were studied. By observing a&#xD;
      group of healthy volunteers after inhalation of 99mTc-labeled carbon ultrafine aerosol, the&#xD;
      accumulated dose in the human lungs under internal irradiation of 99mTc was determined. A&#xD;
      novel technique has been developed and the possibility of using inhaled low-dose radionuclide&#xD;
      therapy in the complex treatment of patients with COVID-19 - associated pneumonia has been&#xD;
      studied. As a result, a significant improvement of hematological parameters in the group of&#xD;
      patients after inhalation of 99mTc-labeled carbon ultrafine aerosol as compared to the&#xD;
      control group is expected.&#xD;

        <description>Patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia were observed for safety after administration of 99mTc-pertechnetate aerosol inhalation, and followed up at 1, 3, 7 days after inhalation. Patients did blood test to observe for abnormalities in clinical parameters and compare to baseline results as assessed by CTCAE v5.0. These tests were also performed in patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia receiving standard treatment. The results were compared between the two groups.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Neutrophils (N) After 99mTc-pertechnetate Aerosol Inhalation for Adverse Events Monitoring as Evaluation Safety of This Procedure in Patients With COVID-19 Viral Pneumonia.</title>
        <description>Patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia were observed for safety after administration of 99mTc-pertechnetate aerosol inhalation, and followed up at 1, 3, 7 days after inhalation. Patients did blood test to observe for abnormalities in clinical parameters and compare to baseline results as assessed by CTCAE v5.0. These tests were also performed in patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia receiving standard treatment. The results were compared between the two groups.</description>

        <title>Level of D-dimer in Blood After 99mTc-pertechnetate Aerosol Inhalation for Adverse Events Monitoring as Evaluation Safety of This Procedure in Patients With COVID-19 Viral Pneumonia.</title>
        <description>Patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia were observed for safety after administration of 99mTc-pertechnetate aerosol inhalation, and followed up at 1, 3, 7 days after inhalation. Patients did blood test to observe for abnormalities in clinical parameters and compare to baseline results as assessed by CTCAE v5.0. These tests were also performed in patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia receiving standard treatment. The results were compared between the two groups.</description>
