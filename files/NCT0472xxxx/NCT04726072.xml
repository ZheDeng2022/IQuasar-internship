      This randomized-control trial pilot study investigates the potential neuroprotective effects&#xD;
      of mindfulness-based interventions in older adults. In this study, the researchers examine&#xD;
      the effects of Kundalini yoga on neurotypical brain aging with a focus on volumetric changes&#xD;
      in the bilateral hippocampi and posterior cingulate cortex. 14 healthy, meditation-naïve&#xD;
      participants (ages 60 to 80) were recruited. Half were randomly assigned to the Kundalini&#xD;
      yoga group and half to the psychoeducation group. Overall, three participants withdrew from&#xD;
      the study. The yoga intervention lasted for 12 weeks and the psychoeducation intervention&#xD;
      lasted for 10 weeks. Structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data were&#xD;
      obtained at baseline and 12-week follow-up. The researchers will focus on analyzing&#xD;
      structural MRI data, examining gray matter volume within a priori regions of interest&#xD;
      (bilateral hippocampi and posterior cingulate cortex). Results from this pilot study are&#xD;
      intended to provide effect-size estimates for future studies that would confirm the effects&#xD;
      of Kundalini yoga on neurological aging. Researchers predict participation in the Kundalini&#xD;
      yoga intervention, compared to the psychoeducation control condition, will result in a&#xD;
      greater increase in gray matter volume of the bilateral hippocampi and posterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex from pre- to post-intervention. If the results are positive, this would provide&#xD;
      initial neurobiological support for Kundalini yoga as a potential means to mitigate the&#xD;
      effects of neurological aging and as a preventive measure for Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
      dementia, which could be assessed in future confirmatory clinical trials.&#xD;

      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were recruited from the Douglas Hospital as well as from the broader community&#xD;
      through the use of an advertisement in The Gazzette and Le Devoir newspapers. Participants&#xD;
      were pre-screened to ensure they were eligible for the study based on the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. This screening process included a cognitive assessment as well as having&#xD;
      participants lie in a mock scanner to assess their level of comfort and ability to complete&#xD;
      the neuroimaging scans required for the study. If anyone was unable to comfortably lie in the&#xD;
      mock scanner, then they were still given the option to participate in the program, but not as&#xD;
      a research participant. A total of 14 participants were recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were evenly and randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was the&#xD;
      Kundalini yoga group while the other was a psychoeducation program (which acted as the&#xD;
      control group). All seven participants in the Kundalini yoga group completed the study while&#xD;
      only four participants in the psychoeducation group completed the study (i.e. three&#xD;
      participants withdrew from the study). Participants were between the ages of 60 to 80 years&#xD;
      old with no prior meditation experience and were relatively healthy with a baseline&#xD;
      Mini-Mental State Examination score of 28-30. Participants were matched across groups for&#xD;
      gender, age, and years of education. The study lasted about 12 weeks for participants in the&#xD;
      Kundalini yoga group and about 10 weeks for those in the control group. The discrepancy in&#xD;
      program length was the result of scheduling complications. Each condition had weekly,&#xD;
      two-hour, group-based sessions that were led by a trained interventionist. The Kundalini yoga&#xD;
      group exercises were customized for participants to ensure safety and are a mixture of&#xD;
      postures, breathing exercises, and meditation. Additionally, participants were encouraged to&#xD;
      do practice exercises at-home for half an hour a day. They were asked to report on the extent&#xD;
      of their at-home practices. The control group consisted of a psychoeducation program where&#xD;
      participants were taught about memory and healthy aging. Participants in this group were also&#xD;
      encouraged to do at home tasks for about half an hour a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural and functional MRI data were obtained both before and after participating in the&#xD;
      intervention. The order of scanning was randomized and counterbalanced within and across&#xD;
      subjects. Overall, scanning lasted about one hour in duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the structural scan, participants were asked to lie down for 10 minutes. There were no&#xD;
      images presented on the screen during this time. For the resting-state functional scan,&#xD;
      participants were asked to look at a fixation cross presented on the screen while trying to&#xD;
      relax.&#xD;
