  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II single arm, open-label study of SM-88 used with methoxsalen, phenytoin,&#xD;
      and sirolimus (MPS) in metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer. It is designed to determine&#xD;
      efficacy, defined as the objective response rate (ORR) of this investigational treatment. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that SM-88 used with MPS will lead to significant anti-tumor responses with&#xD;
      acceptable toxicities in patients with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase II single arm trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of SM-88&#xD;
      plus three subtherapeutic conditioning agents (methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus [MPS])&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty patients will be enrolled in first stage of the study, and if 3 or more patients have&#xD;
      an objective response (complete or partial response) then an additional 20 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the second stage of the study. Patients will receive the recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of SM-88 (460 mg by mouth [PO] twice a day [BID] D1 - 28) as well as three&#xD;
      conditioning agents (MPS): methoxsalen (10 mg PO daily [Qd] D1 - 28), phenytoin (50 mg PO Qd&#xD;
      D1 - 28), and sirolimus (0.5 mg PO Qd D1 - 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy will be conducted every 3 cycles (approximately every 12 weeks) with&#xD;
      CT chest/abdomen/pelvis using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Safety including clinic visits, and exams&#xD;
      will occur every 4 weeks on Day 1 of each cycle. Laboratory testing will be performed every 2&#xD;
      weeks for the first 2 cycles and then on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle.&#xD;

             associated with deterioration of renal function).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated, or anticipated to be treated, with a calcineurin inhibitor (because&#xD;

             purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy [HUS/TTP/TMA]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant cataracts or aphakia (absence of lens over the eye, typically&#xD;

             14 days of initiation of study drug. When possible these medications and grapefruit&#xD;
             juice should be avoided for the duration of the study treatment and alternate&#xD;
             therapies are preferred.&#xD;
