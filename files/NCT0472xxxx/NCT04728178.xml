  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the goal-directed fluid therapy based on the data obtained from the hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring system, which provides continuous CO, SV and SVV measurements through arterial&#xD;
      pressure wave with standard fluid therapy in perioperative fluid management of patients&#xD;
      undergoing head and neck surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the ethics committee approval and patients consent, the study was completed with a&#xD;
      total of ASA I-III, 60 patients over the age of 18 who will undergo head and neck&#xD;
      surgery.After randomization, patients underwent arterial cannulation. The arterial cannulas&#xD;
      of the study group patients were integrated into the hemodynamic monitoring system with a&#xD;
      special transducer, and their fluid management was planned to achieve a target value of 13%&#xD;
      or less through SVV monitoring. In the control group, fluid management was set as MAP (Mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure) 65 mmHg and above and diuresis 0.5ml/kg/hour and above. Crystalloid&#xD;
      infusion at 7ml/kg/hour was started in both groups. When SVV value increased to 13% and over&#xD;
      in the study group, 250 ml of crystalloid was given in the first stage, and if it continued&#xD;
      to be 13% and over, 250 ml of colloid bolus was given. Vasoconstrictor agent was used when&#xD;
      SVV was below 13% and MAP was below 65 mmHg. The patients in the control group were given 250&#xD;
      ml of crystalloid in the first stage if the MAP was below 65 mmHg, and 250 ml of colloid&#xD;
      bolus if the hypotensive episode continued. If hypotension persisted despite these fluid&#xD;
      boluses, a vasoconstrictor agent was used. In addition, when the diuresis of the patients was&#xD;
      detected at 0.5mg/kg/hr or less, 250 ml of colloid bolus was administered.&#xD;
