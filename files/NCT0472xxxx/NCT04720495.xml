  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fourteen patients having anterior maxillary undercut defect were selected to match a list of&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were randomly allocated using a computer system into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A undergo inverted U-shaped maxillary ridge splitting using piezotomes with&#xD;
      simultaneous implant placement in the same surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B undergo inverted U-shaped maxillary ridge splitting as a first stage and after four&#xD;
      weeks, ridge expansion and implant placement will be performed with only envelop flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment included measurements of bone gain at the undercut defect and bone density labial&#xD;
      to implants in each group from the cone-beam computed tomography&#xD;

    <description>A full mucoperiosteal flap was raised using the sharp periosteal elevator to expose the bone crestally and buccally.&#xD;
An inverted U-shaped bone cut, down to the cancellous bone, was done in the undercut area with a piezoelectric device.&#xD;
The horizontal bone cut was made apical to the most concave point in the undercut area with a distance of 3 mm.&#xD;
The two vertical bone cuts were placed at least 1 mm away from the adjacent roots and extended beyond the undercut area.&#xD;
The released bone end was minimally elevated using a periosteotome through a greenstick fracture.&#xD;
All implants were installed with the implant shoulders flush to the bone level using a low-speed drilling procedure.</description>

    <description>The first surgery is the same as one stage ridge splitting Four weeks later, after revascularization between the bone block and the mucoperiosteum, the second surgery will be performed.&#xD;
A crestal incision was done and the envelope flap slightly elevated to preserve the blood supply.&#xD;
The implants will be placed in the same manner as one stage ridge splitting</description>
