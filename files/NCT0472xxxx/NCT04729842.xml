  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective comparative randomized study was done to compare Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine&#xD;
      in patients undergoing forearm surgeries under axillary brachial plexus block. The study&#xD;
      compares the onset and duration of sensory block, onset and duration of motor block and&#xD;
      duration of analgesia between these two drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective comparative randomized study to compare Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine in&#xD;
      patients undergoing forearm surgeries under axillary brachial plexus block. A sample size of&#xD;
      100 was considered who are meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected, and&#xD;
      divided into two groups of 50 each using computer-generated randomization and allocation&#xD;
      concealment was done using sealed sequentially numbered containers opaque envelope technique&#xD;
      (SNOSE). One group will receive Bupivacaine and the other Ropivacaine. Patients were blind to&#xD;
      the study. In the Bupivacaine group, 30 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine was injected equally divided&#xD;
      and injected in four nerves (musculocutaneous, median, radial and ulnar nerves). In the&#xD;
      Ropivacaine group, 30 ml of a solution containing 0.5% ropivacaine was equally divided and&#xD;
      injected in the four nerves. Sensory block was tested with a 22-gauge hypodermic needle by&#xD;
      using the pinprick test and compared with the contralateral hand. Sensory block was graded as&#xD;
      Grade 0: Sharp pin felt, Grade 1: Analgesia, dull sensation felt and Grade 2: Anaesthesia, no&#xD;
      sensation felt. Motor function was assessed as per the modified Bromage scale. 0: Able to&#xD;
      raise the extended arm to 90 degrees for a full 2 sec, 1: Able to flex the elbow and move the&#xD;
      fingers but unable to raise the extended arm, 2: Unable to flex the elbow but able to move&#xD;
      the fingers and 3: Unable to move the arm, elbow or fingers. The onset of sensory blockade&#xD;
      was assessed by the time from the completion of injection of the study drug till the loss of&#xD;
      pinprick sensation. It was assessed every minute. The onset of motor blockade was assessed&#xD;
      when there was Grade 1 motor blockade. It was assessed every minute. Duration of sensory&#xD;
      blockade was assessed by the time between onset of sensory blockade and return of dull&#xD;
      sensation to pinprick. .It was assessed every 15 minutes. Duration of motor blockade was&#xD;
      assessed by the time between onset of motor blockade and time at which patients could first&#xD;
      move their fingers. It was assessed every 15minutes. Duration of analgesia is the time&#xD;
      interval between the onset of sensory block and the patient's first analgesic request. The&#xD;
      rescue analgesia in the form of inj. Diclofenac sodium (1.5 mg/kg) intramuscularly was given.&#xD;
      Block was considered to have failed when sensory anaesthesia was not achieved within 30 min.&#xD;
      General anaesthesia was given subsequently to these patients and was excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Again, a patient showing an allergic reaction to the intervention were also withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis - Normally distributed quantitative data were presented as mean Â± SD,&#xD;
      whereas data not normally distributed were presented as median (IQR). While comparing&#xD;
      quantitative data between the two groups, for normally distributed quantitative data,&#xD;
      Independent student t-test was used, on the other hand, Mann-Whitney test was used. For&#xD;
      comparing qualitative variable chi-square or Fischer exact test was applied as appropriate.&#xD;
      In case of repeated measure data, mixed effect ANOVA was used. For all test P value of &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      was considered as significant and P-value &lt; 0.001 was considered as highly significant. SPSS&#xD;
      version 21 (IBM, Newyork) was used for data analysis.&#xD;
