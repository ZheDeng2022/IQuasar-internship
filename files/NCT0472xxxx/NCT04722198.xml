  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine L. plantarum PS128 can improve symptoms in early onset PD&#xD;
      patients. L. plantarum PS128 is a psychobiotic that regulates the level of dopamine in&#xD;
      specific brain regions. Patients with early onset PD will receive PS128 treatment for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Symptoms of PD will be clinically evaluated before and after the treatment, and the&#xD;
      results will be compared.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS scale refers to Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, and it is a rating tool used to gauge the course of Parkinson's disease in patients.&#xD;
The UPDRS scale consists of the following five segments: 1) Mentation, Behavior, and Mood, 2) ADL, 3) Motor sections, 4) Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale, and 5) Schwab and England ADL scale.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese Version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete.The maximum total score is 21. A higher score reflects more poor sleep quality.</description>

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a line, 10 cm in length. Individuals point to or mark a spot on the line where they feel indicates their current their emotion, fatigue level and sleep quality. The score of emotion level is from 0cm (very nervous) to 10 cm (very relaxing). The score of fatigue level is from 0 cm (very energetic) to 10 cm (very sleepy). The score of sleep quality is from 0 cm (poor) to 10 cm (sleep well). The maximum total score is 100% (equal 10cm).</description>
