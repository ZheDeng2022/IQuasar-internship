  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaining a greater understanding of how each exercise mode affects lymphedema, as well as&#xD;
      other health-related outcomes will improve exercise prescription guidelines relevant to this&#xD;
      specific lymphedema. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to compare the effects of Xbox&#xD;
      kinect rehabilitation and resistance exercises on limb volume, symptoms severity, physical&#xD;
      function, and quality of life in women with Breast cancer-related lymphedema.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer-related lymphedema is a common and debilitating side effect of cancer&#xD;
      treatment. This study compared the effect of Xbox kinect rehabilitation and resistance&#xD;
      exercises on breast cancer-related lymphedema volume and severity, as well as participant's&#xD;
      physical function and quality of life. Women diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer related&#xD;
      lymphedema were randomly divided into two groups: the kinect based rehabilitation group KBRG&#xD;
      and resistance exercise group REG. woman in The KBRG received virtual reality therapy using&#xD;
      Xbox Kinect-based games, the REG received resistance training in addition both groups&#xD;
      received complex decongestive physiotherapy. The intervention was five sessions per week for&#xD;
      8 weeks. The outcome measures included limb volume, symptoms severity, physical function&#xD;
      (muscle strength and range of motion) and quality of life. All these outcomes were assessed&#xD;
      at pretreatment (baseline) and after the end of treatment at week eight (W8).&#xD;
