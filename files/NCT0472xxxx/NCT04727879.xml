  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The work carried out at the Brest University Hospital on serum immunological changes in&#xD;
      patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (based on clinical protocols TENOR, SEMAPHORE,&#xD;
      THEN) made it possible to describe the changes in the distribution of lymphocyte&#xD;
      subpopulations and cytokine levels during PPR, before and then under treatment compared to&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in systemic autoimmune or inflammatory pathologies, serum immunological mechanisms&#xD;
      are rarely a reflection of intra-tissue mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the specific case of PMR, there are few data concerning muscular or joint immunological&#xD;
      modifications. The investigators now wish to study the immunological modifications occurring&#xD;
      at the tissue sites of interest, in particular in the shoulder bursae&#xD;
