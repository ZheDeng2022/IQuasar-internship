  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general purpose of this project is; Evaluation of cerebral oxygenation results in&#xD;
      premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results will be evaluated in two different applications. The first practice and the&#xD;
      first sub-aim of the study is to determine the effect of kangaroo care on cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation (rSO2) in premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second application and purpose is to determine the effect of giving the infant the&#xD;
      facilitated tucking position by hand and the nesting bed on the cerebral oxygenation (rSO2)&#xD;
      of the infant during the heel blood collection process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted between December 2020 and December 2021 at Level III NICU at the&#xD;
      Medical Faculty Hospital in Konya.&#xD;

      The general purpose of this project is; To determine the effect of kangaroo care and&#xD;
      facilitated tucking position on cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) in premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the study has two sub-objectives. First sub purpose; to determine the effect&#xD;
      of kangaroo care application given to premature inafants hospitalized in the NICU with the&#xD;
      mother on cerebral oxygenation (rSO2), physiological parameters (heart rate, peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiratory rate) and comfort / comfort levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a single blind, parallel group, pre-test and post-test randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First sub purpose; total sample size was determined as 40 preterm babies (20 in each group).&#xD;
      Block randomization was used in this study. During the data collection phase, the purpose of&#xD;
      the study will be explained to the parents of preterm infants by the researcher, and written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the parents who agree to participate in the study through the&#xD;
      &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot;. Introductory Information Form, Physiological Parameter and rSO2&#xD;
      Follow-up Chart and Neonatal Comfort Scale created by the researcher will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second sub purpose; to determine the effect of facilitated tucking position on the infant's&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation (rSO2), physiological parameters (heart peak beat, SpO2 and respiratory&#xD;
      rate), pain and comfort / comfort levels during the heel stick procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a single blind, parallel group, two intervention groups in&#xD;
      pre-test and post-test order, and a randomized controlled control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second sub purpose; the total sample size was determined as 66 (22 in each group). Block&#xD;
      randomization was used in this study. During the data collection phase, the purpose of the&#xD;
      study will be explained to the parents of preterm infants by the researcher, and written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the parents who agree to participate in the study through the&#xD;
      &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot;. The Introductory Information Form, Physiological Parameters and rSO2&#xD;
      Tracking Chart, PIPP-R and Neonatal Comfort Scale created by the researcher will be used.&#xD;

    <description>The PIPP-R scale includes 3 behavioral (frowning, squeezing eyes, nasolobial-groove), 2 physiological (heart rate and oxygen saturation) and 2 contextual (behavioral state and gestational age) items used in the assessment of pain in newborns. The items of the scale are scored as 3, 2, 1, 0 ((0-6 points that the pain is mild, 7-12 points is moderate, and 13-21 points is at a severe level.)</description>

    <description>The scale consists of 7 items: muscle tone, alertness, facial tension, calmness / agitation, body movements, respiratory response, and crying. The lowest possible score from Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale is 6 and the highest score is 30. High scores indicate that the baby is not comfortable.</description>
