  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at how a new medicine called NNC0194-0499 works in the body of Japanese men&#xD;
      and non-Asian men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Japanese participants will either get NNC0194-0499 or placebo - which treatment participants&#xD;
      get is decided by chance. Non-Asian participants will get NNC0194-0499.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get 1 or 2 injections of the study medicine. It will be injected with a&#xD;
      needle into a skin fold on the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for a maximum of 66 days. Participants will have 8 scheduled visits with&#xD;
      the study doctor. For 1 of the visits participants will stay at the clinic for 6 days (5&#xD;
      nights).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes blood sampling. Participants will not be able to take part in the study if&#xD;
      the study doctor thinks there is a risk for participants health.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The present trial is split into two parts reflecting the two trial populations: Japanese subjects and non-Asian subjects. For the Japanese part, it is designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded within cohorts, parallel group, single-dose trial.
