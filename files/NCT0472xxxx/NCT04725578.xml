  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stony Brook University is home to several mental health clinics, that all work towards&#xD;
      achieving overall wellness of their clients. The goals of Stony Brook University are met with&#xD;
      the help of associated clinics that strive to improve wellness of individuals and their&#xD;
      communities by helping to treat both mental and physical health impairments. One of these&#xD;
      many clinics is the Krasner Psychological Center (KPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the KPC faces a challenge common to virtually all mental health clinics across&#xD;
      the United States: the demand for psychological services far outpaces the number of available&#xD;
      providers. Indeed, in the US, approximately 70% of those in need of mental health services do&#xD;
      not receive them. As such, wait-lists at mental health clinics like the KPC are increasingly&#xD;
      long, and longer wait-times for psychotherapy have predicted worse clinical outcomes once&#xD;
      treatment is accessed (i.e., a 'nocebo' effect). Thus, there is a pressing need for&#xD;
      effective, sustainable service delivery models that may facilitate more rapid access to&#xD;
      care-for instance, providing a low-intensity service rapidly after an individual decides to&#xD;
      seek treatment, capitalizing on client motivation. This sort of rapidly-provided,&#xD;
      low-intensity service might have the added benefit of reducing overall waitlist&#xD;
      lengths--e.g., if some subset of clients find the low-intensity service to be sufficient, a&#xD;
      single session might be sufficient (in some cases) to spur positive behavioral and emotional&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One solution to this problem is the integration of single-session services into mental health&#xD;
      clinics. Extensive research suggests that both youths and adults can benefit from just one&#xD;
      session of goal-directed counseling, and these clinical benefits have been observed for a&#xD;
      wide array of problems-including anxiety, depression, self-harm, and interpersonal conflicts.&#xD;
      This research suggests the possibility that, for some subset of clients, a single session of&#xD;
      counseling may be helpful, or even sufficient, in reducing clinical distress. Further,&#xD;
      offering such service in a telehealth format will alleviate frequently cited barriers to care&#xD;
      like transportation, geographic constraints, and limited time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      short-term effects of the new telehealth-Single-Session Consultation (SSC) service, which is&#xD;
      presently being provided to clients on the waiting list for psychotherapeutic services at the&#xD;
      Krasner Psychological Center. The telehealth-SSC offers clients the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in a single, goal-directed consultation session based on Solution-Focused Brief&#xD;
      Therapy (SFBT) within two weeks of inquiring about services at the KPC (typically, clients&#xD;
      wait 2-6 months prior to their initial clinic appointment). SFBT is an evidence-based therapy&#xD;
      approach that guides services offered by existing single-session therapy clinics&#xD;
      internationally. Clients who participate in the telehealth-SSC at any of these clinics may&#xD;
      find the session helpful; two weeks after participating in the session, they receive the&#xD;
      option to remain on the waitlist for long-term psychotherapy or remove themselves from the&#xD;
      waitlist for psychotherapy, depending on whether they feel their clinical needs have been&#xD;
      successfully addressed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Stony Brook University (SBU) clinical psychology doctoral program is currently ranked 4th&#xD;
      among the top clinical psychology doctoral programs in the country (2016, U.S. News and World&#xD;
      Report, Best Graduate Schools) and is accredited by both the APA Committee on Accreditation&#xD;
      (APA CoA) and the Psychological Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS). The Krasner&#xD;
      Psychological Center (KPC) is a psychology training clinic housed in the Department of&#xD;
      Psychology and associated with the doctoral program in clinical psychology at SBU. The&#xD;
      mission of the KPC is twofold, namely, (a) to provide high quality experiential training in&#xD;
      the delivery of psychological services to trainees in the associated 3 doctoral program, as&#xD;
      well as to externs, doctoral interns, and post-doctoral residents; and (b) to provide&#xD;
      evidence-based mental health services to the nearby communities. All supervisors at the KPC&#xD;
      are doctoral-level psychologists. Psychotherapy services at the KPC are based on&#xD;
      Cognitive-Behavior Therapy models and include weekly, outpatient psychotherapy for a wide&#xD;
      range of problems in children and adults; therapy is designed to be short-term, personalized,&#xD;
      and effective in empowering clients to manage their symptoms and distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telehealth-single-session consultation, a one-time service provided to adolescents and&#xD;
      adults (13+) on the clinics' waitlist (which may extend from 2 to 6 months), includes&#xD;
      components of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT). SFBT lends itself naturally to the&#xD;
      single-session format in that it focuses on the present and future, targeting the desired&#xD;
      outcome of therapy, a future in which the primary problem is absent or less influential.&#xD;
      Importantly, SFBT providers focus on the factors that maintain/underlie solutions rather than&#xD;
      the factors than maintain/underlie problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL SCREENING PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      When individuals seeking services at the KPC express interest in scheduling an appointment&#xD;
      with a clinician, they are first instructed (by phone) about the clinical and research aims&#xD;
      by the clinic's staff. The clinical staff is a trained, independent member and is not&#xD;
      involved in the provision of psychotherapy or single-session consultation services. The&#xD;
      clinical staff conducts a standardized, structured phone screen with the individual to&#xD;
      identify primary reasons for seeking mental health services and to assess the appropriateness&#xD;
      of presenting concerns for treatment at the KPC. If the individual is eligible to receive&#xD;
      services at the KPC (i.e., if their concerns fall within the scope of clinical problems&#xD;
      treated; if the individual/family is English-speaking; and if problems are not so acute as to&#xD;
      require immediate hospitalization, in which case they are referred to the nearest emergency&#xD;
      room), the client is placed on the waitlist for psychotherapy services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the same phone call, if the identified patient is 13 years or older, the clinic staff&#xD;
      then introduces the opportunity to participate in the telehealth-Single Session Consultation&#xD;
      (SSC) service at the KPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinic staff indicates that as part of telehealth-SSC service participation the client&#xD;
      will be asked to complete questionnaires in order to provide their clinician with information&#xD;
      about their current mental health, and for the purposes of planning and assessing the&#xD;
      usefulness of services. The clinic staff will also indicate that the individual may opt to&#xD;
      allow or not allow us to use this data for research purposes. They will be informed that if&#xD;
      they do choose to allow their data to be used for research, it will be de-identified and&#xD;
      combined with other patient data for the purposes of understanding how well our treatment&#xD;
      programs work for different types of individuals. The staff will emphasize that their choice&#xD;
      to participate, or not participate in research will NOT impact their eligibility for the&#xD;
      telehealth-SSC service or longer-term psychotherapy in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician will obtain fully informed consent via Qualtrics prior to the SSC appointment.&#xD;
      Adult patients (or adolescent patient and her/his parent) can either agree or disagree to&#xD;
      allow the research team to use their clinical data for research by checking the appropriate&#xD;
      check-box on the consent form. Patients will also be able to elect to participate in the&#xD;
      specific study described in the consent form and/or to have their de-identified data added to&#xD;
      a registry for future unspecified research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES SPECIFIC TO THE TELEHEALTH-SINGLE-SESSION CONSULTATION SERVICE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately prior to telehealth-SSC participants will be asked to complete the following via&#xD;
      a Qualtrics survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PHQ-9&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GAD-7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck Hopelessness Scale - 4 item&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readiness for Change Rulers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the one-hour telehealth-SSC session, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the following via a Qualtrics survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consultation Feedback Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Working Alliance Inventory Short Form - client&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck Hopelessness Scale - 4 item&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readiness for change Ruler&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, two weeks after completing the telehealth-SSC, participants will be followed-up with&#xD;
      a Qualtrics survey containing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PHQ-9&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GAD-7&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 1: A client may reschedule an SSC session if they are unable to attend it. The KPC will&#xD;
      not limit the number of times a client is permitted to reschedule an SSC session, should they&#xD;
      remain interested in receiving one. Additionally, if clients endorse significant clinical&#xD;
      risk (to themselves or others) while participating in the study, study procedures may be&#xD;
      interrupted (e.g., an SSC session may be terminated in order to address urgent clinical&#xD;
      needs). If a client's initial SSC session is interrupted or terminated due to a need to&#xD;
      address urgent clinical risk, the client will be permitted to reschedule their SSC session&#xD;
      for a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 2: If a participant does not respond to the clinic's requests for a 2-week follow-up&#xD;
      within two weeks of being contacted, per KPC policy, it will be assumed that the client is no&#xD;
      longer interested in services and will be removed from the waiting list. Pre-to-post SSC data&#xD;
      for these clients will still be used for analyses unless they request that their data not be&#xD;
      used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 3: The lead investigator (Jessica Schleider) will train all SSC clinicians prior to&#xD;
      their delivering SSC sessions with clients. This training will be approximately 2 hours in&#xD;
      length and will review the principles and key elements of the SSC protocol, in addition to&#xD;
      challenges that might emerge while delivering the SSC.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Readiness for Change Ruler</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; immediately Post-SSC</time_frame>
    <description>The readiness for change ruler is a 3 item measure that examines participant's willingness to change to improve their mental health on a 0 (not at all confident/important/ready) to 10 scale (completely confident/ready). The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher score indicating higher levels of willingness to change.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working Alliance Inventory - Short</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post-SSC</time_frame>
    <description>The working alliance inventory asks participants to rate 12 statements regarding their personal experiences they had with their therapist on a scale of 1 (Never) to 7 (Always). The overall score will be a single mean score (possible range: 1-7; items 4 and 10 are reversed scored) reflecting patient-rated working alliance with their therapist. Higher scores reflect a stronger perceived therapeutic alliance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consultation Feedback Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post-SSC</time_frame>
    <description>The consultation feedback form contains 5 items, rated on a 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 5 (&quot;Very much&quot;) Likert scale, indicating endorsement of a series of statements about responses to the Single Session Consultation program (e.g., &quot;Did you find the consultation helpful in addressing your concern(s)?&quot; and &quot;How hopeful are you that the action plan will be useful?&quot;). Higher mean scores across these 5 items indicate greater perceived usefulness of the SSC.</description>
