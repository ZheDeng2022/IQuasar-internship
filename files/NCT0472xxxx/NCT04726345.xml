  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, open-label, single-center trial of up to 78&#xD;
      participants who are adult patients (aged 18-80 years) and are undergoing unilateral&#xD;
      retrograde ureteroscopy with planned ureteral stent placement for treatment of urinary tract&#xD;
      stones. Eligible patients will be randomly and divided into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Group&#xD;
      A will receive fexofenadine 180 mg once daily in addition to standard of care treatment.&#xD;
      Group B will receive placebo in addition to standard of care treatment. The routine standard&#xD;
      of care treatment will consist of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of the study are the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ) urinary&#xD;
      symptom score and pain score. Secondary outcomes include (i) number of office phone calls due&#xD;
      to urinary symptoms; (ii) duration of analgesic use; (iii) duration and quantity of narcotic&#xD;
      use; (iv) number of emergency department visits; (v) drug-related adverse effects; (vi) other&#xD;
      domains of the USSQ.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ureteral stents treat ureteral obstruction, allow for passive dilation of the ureter,&#xD;
      maintain urine flow to the bladder, and aid in the recovery of the ureter after endoscopic&#xD;
      surgery or ureteral injury. These stents are routinely utilized after urologic procedures for&#xD;
      the treatment of urolithiasis and are generally kept in place for 1-2 weeks following the&#xD;
      procedure. Despite their advantages, indwelling ureteral stents cause discomfort and reduce&#xD;
      patient quality of life. These symptoms are partially attributed to local irritation to the&#xD;
      ureter and bladder. Bothersome stent-related symptoms include urinary urgency, frequency,&#xD;
      flank pain, hematuria, dysuria, sexual side effects, and emotional distress. The majority of&#xD;
      patients with ureteral stents experience symptoms post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have indicated that agents such as antimuscarinics or alpha-1 adrenergic&#xD;
      receptor antagonists may improve stent-related symptoms. The indications for anticholinergic&#xD;
      medications are based on blocking involuntary bladder muscle contraction; however, the&#xD;
      efficacy of these drugs is still controversial. Furthermore, these medications have potential&#xD;
      adverse side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antihistamines also show potential in alleviating stent-related symptoms. Multiple in vitro&#xD;
      studies have shown H1 receptor activity involved both in ureteral peristalsis and in bladder&#xD;
      contraction. Both first- and second-generation H1 antagonists have shown activity in the&#xD;
      urinary tract. In clinical practice, antihistamines are commonly utilized in the management&#xD;
      of bladder pain caused by interstitial cystitis. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      found efficacy of antihistamines for pain management in the setting of renal colic from&#xD;
      obstructing ureteral stones. There is novel evidence that in patients with indwelling stents,&#xD;
      there are inflammatory changes in the bladder with an associated eosinophilic reaction.&#xD;
      Eosinophilic cystitis is commonly associated with bladder irritation or allergy, and these&#xD;
      findings point to a novel paradigm of treating patients with antihistamines. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of antihistamines for managing&#xD;
      stent-related symptoms.&#xD;
