  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients suffering an Achilles tendon rupture develop long term functional&#xD;
      deficits in the affected leg. The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate a new&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) for reducing muscle&#xD;
      atrophy and improving tendon properties. If proven beneficial, the proposed protocol can be&#xD;
      easily adopted and incorporated as part of routine care for Achilles tendon rupture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achilles Tendon Ruptures (ATR) are common and permanently affect the function of the lower&#xD;
      leg. Regardless of treatment approach the majority of patients develop long term functional&#xD;
      deficits, which include decreased plantar flexion strength, lower heel-rise height, and&#xD;
      altered gait patterns. It is believed that tendon lengthening and calf muscle atrophy, which&#xD;
      develop during the first few weeks of recovery, are major factors contributing to these&#xD;
      functional deficits. The initial development of atrophy is likely caused by reduced loading&#xD;
      and muscle activity of the affected leg. However, long-term atrophy may be related to tendon&#xD;
      elongation. On the other hand, tendon elongation initially rises during the first few weeks&#xD;
      of unloading and slowly reduces, but not completely, when loading is resumed. However,&#xD;
      atrophied calf muscles may not provide sufficient loading for optimal tendon recovery.&#xD;
      Therefore, there seems to be vicious spiral between tendon elongation and muscle atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to develop a neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol for Achilles tendon ruptures. Our preliminary data has shown that&#xD;
      force applied to the tendon can be modulated using electrical intensity and pad placement.&#xD;
      Therefore, NMES can produce significant contraction in the calf muscles and induce&#xD;
      controllable, low-magnitude, cyclic loading to the tendon; which cannot be achieved with&#xD;
      voluntary muscle contractions. This approach can potentially overcome limitations of the&#xD;
      current rehabilitation protocols.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will receive standard rehabilitation for Achilles tendon repair. In addition, neuromuscular electrical stimulation will be applied to the calf muscles of the injured leg. The stimulation volume, the electrode placement and the intensity of the stimulation will be selected based on the mechanical strength of healing Achilles tendon. The intervention will be applied for 6 weeks after repair.</description>
