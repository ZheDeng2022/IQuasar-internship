  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled study is to compare the number of&#xD;
      physician top-up interventions during the first stage of labour between two different&#xD;
      neuraxial analgesia techniques : the dural puncture epidural and the standard epidural.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Providing adequate labour analgesia has always been an important issue in obstetrical&#xD;
      anesthesia. Different types of neuraxial techniques include standard epidural analgesia&#xD;
      (EPL), combined spinal epidural analgesia (CSE) and dural puncture epidural analgesia (DPE).&#xD;
      DPE, which has gained in popularity in recent years, is similar to CSE in which the dura&#xD;
      mater is punctured, however without injection of medication in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
      Recent studies have found benefits of the DPE technique, such as less fetal bradycardia than&#xD;
      CSE, better bilateral sacral analgesia than EPL and faster onset than EPL. No study has yet&#xD;
      compared DPE to EPL when an ultra-low concentration of local anesthetic protocol is used for&#xD;
      maintenance of analgesia. We hypothesize that in term primiparous and multiparous&#xD;
      parturients, a dural puncture epidural technique will improve labour analgesia quality during&#xD;
      the first stage of labour (based on physician top-up interventions) compared with a standard&#xD;
      epidural technique when a patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with ultra-low&#xD;
      concentration epidural mixture classically used in our institution based on our hospital&#xD;
      orders and national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis for this study is to show that there will be 50% reduction in the&#xD;
      incidence of parturients in need of at least one physician top-up intervention during the&#xD;
      first stage of labour in the DPE group compared to the EPL group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be approached by the anesthesia research team upon arrival at the birth&#xD;
      unit. The randomization will be done at the time the parturient requests an epidural.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done in a 1:1 ratio until we reach 65 subjects in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before neuraxial catheter placement, a 20G or 18G intravenous (IV) catheter is inserted and&#xD;
      standard monitoring is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attending or resident in anesthesiology will place the neuraxial catheter following the&#xD;
      next steps :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidural space is identified in seated position (L2-L3 or L3-L4) using an epidural&#xD;
           needle 17G 10 cm Tuohy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of resistance to saline technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In both groups, a needle-through-needle technique is performed using a 25G 5-inch&#xD;
           Whitacre spinal needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In group DPE, a single dural puncture with confirmation of free-flow CSF is performed&#xD;
           and in group EPL no dural puncture is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter is placed 4-5 cm in the epidural space: 19G multi-orifice Perifix FX catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation of analgesia in both groups will be as followed :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test dose of 3mL bupivacaine 0,25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial bolus (10mL Bupivacaine 0,125% plus fentanyl 50mcg) fractioned in two doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCEA is then initiated with a basal infusion of 6mL/h (solution of bupivacaine 0,0625% +&#xD;
           fentanyl 2mcg/mL) and 8 mL boluses are permitted every 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If analgesia is inadequate, defined as NPRS ≥ 4, within the first 30 minutes of epidural&#xD;
      initiation OR more than 30 minutes after catheter placement and after 2 PCEA boluses in less&#xD;
      than 1 hour, the initial step will be to administered a nurse top-up intervention: 10 mL&#xD;
      bolus of the epidural infusion (bupivacaine 0,0625% + fentanyl 2mcg/mL) via the infusion&#xD;
      pump. If analgesia is still inadequate 30 minutes after initial nurse top-up intervention,&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist is called, the catheter is pulled back 1cm and a physician manual top-up&#xD;
      10mL bolus of bupivacaine 0,125% is administered. If 30 minutes after the physician manual&#xD;
      top-up bolus analgesia is still inadequate, analgesia management is transferred to the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard nurse care during and after catheter placement will be applied following an already&#xD;
      established protocol at our center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesia will be evaluated using the verbal NPRS from Gélinas C. (2007) that allows&#xD;
      parturients to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10. Sensory blockade will be evaluated&#xD;
      using ice. The evaluation will start at the S2 dermatome, where S2 is assessed at the&#xD;
      midpoint of the popliteal fossa, and will be moving in a caudad to cephalad direction. The&#xD;
      evaluator will assess asymmetrical blockade, which is defined as a difference in sensory&#xD;
      blockade to cold sensation greater than 2 dermatomal levels between the left and right side&#xD;
      of the patient. Motor blockade will be evaluated using the Bromage score (1978).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulation criteria will be evaluated at certain times following initial physician bolus. The&#xD;
      criteria already established in our center are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No obstetrical contraindications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensory blockade ≤ T4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of motor blockade according to Bromage score (score = 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg AND/OR a fall of less than 20 mmHg compared to the&#xD;
           patient's initial systolic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative postural hypotension test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Successful squat test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parturients overall satisfaction with neuraxial analgesia will be evaluated the day following&#xD;
      delivery. Presence or absence of post dural puncture headache symptoms will be noted at 24h&#xD;
      post partum.&#xD;
