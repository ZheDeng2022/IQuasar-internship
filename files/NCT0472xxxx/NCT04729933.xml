  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated, prospective study to demonstrate the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of implantation of the V-Wave Interatrial Shunt System (herein called the &quot;V-Wave&#xD;
      Shunt&quot; in patients immediately following percutaneous mitral valve repair using the MitraClip&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The V-Wave Shunt is a device placed across the interatrial septum (IAS) by cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization which allows for the transfer of blood from the left atrium (LA) to right&#xD;
      atrium (RA). The intended effect is to reduce excessive left-sided cardiac filling pressures&#xD;
      in patients with advanced heart failure (HF) and thus improve symptoms related to pulmonary&#xD;
      congestion. All patients in the study must meet all anatomic and clinical eligibility in the&#xD;
      FDA approved indications for use of the MitraClip in functional mitral regurgitation (MR).&#xD;
      All patients must have persistence of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or&#xD;
      ambulatory class IV HF symptoms despite maximally tolerated guideline directed medical&#xD;
      therapy (GDMT) as assessed by a Cardiologist specialist in advanced heart failure (HF). All&#xD;
      patients will have reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 20% and ≤ 50% and&#xD;
      at least moderate to severe 3-4+ MR with a functional or combined functional and degenerative&#xD;
      mechanism. Despite MitraClip treatment and maximum GDMT, these patients are at high risk for&#xD;
      recurrent HF events and readmission, and thus there is an unmet need for further therapies to&#xD;
      improve outcomes in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing transseptal puncture used for MitraClip placement will be used to place the&#xD;
      V-Wave Shunt device after MitraClip placement.&#xD;
