      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare disease. It is caused by the human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV). RRP affects the upper and lower respiratory tracts. It is difficult to&#xD;
      treat and can be fatal. Researchers want to see if PRGN-2012 can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe, tolerable dose of PRGN-2012 and to see if it works in treating RRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older who have RRP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood&#xD;
      tests and viral studies. They may have a computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck and/or&#xD;
      chest. The structures inside their nose, throat, larynx (voice box), and upper windpipe will&#xD;
      be viewed using a small tube with a built-in camera (endoscope). Their arm veins will be&#xD;
      evaluated. They will have a pregnancy test, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have surgery. Their papilloma will be removed. They will have another&#xD;
      surgery if it grows back. They will have to stay at the hospital for 1 to 2 days after each&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires about how much RRP affects their voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get PRGN-2012 as an injection under the skin on days 1, 15, 43, and 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have optional leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits 6, 12, and 24 weeks after their last dose of PRGN-2012. These&#xD;
      visits will assess the safety of PRGN-2012 and disease response to the treatment. After the&#xD;
      24-week visit, participants will be called every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for up to 3 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare papillomatous disease of the&#xD;
      aerodigestive tract that is caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) types 6 or 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RRP can progress to cause severe voice disturbance, airway compromise, fatal pulmonary&#xD;
      lesions, and invasive cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no proven effective systemic therapy for RRP that leads to cure. Participants&#xD;
      require repeated surgical procedures for disease debridement and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently completed phase II clinical trial investigating avelumab in subjects with RRP&#xD;
      demonstrated an acceptable safety profile from avelumab and a high rate of partial responses,&#xD;
      but no participants were cured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis revealed that the ability to measure infiltration of papillomas by HPV&#xD;
      antigen-specific T-cells is rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A therapeutic vaccine may induce de novo HPV antigen-specific T-cell responses and decrease&#xD;
      incidence of recurrence after surgical debulking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and tolerability and recommended phase II adjuvant dosing of&#xD;
      PRGN-2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed diagnosis of laryngeal RRP&#xD;
&#xD;
      A history of 2 or more interventions in the last 12 months for the control of RRP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I, 3+3 dose escalation clinical trial evaluating PRGN-2012 at two dose levels&#xD;
      (1x10^11 and 5x10^11 particle units (PU)) administered as adjuvant therapy after&#xD;
      standard-of-care debulking surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive up to 4 separate injections of PRGN-2012 in separate limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 3-6 subjects at each dose level, and 12 subjects treated at the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;

             to New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
             requiring medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions including recent (within&#xD;
             the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, liver disease, lung disease&#xD;
             (with the exception of what is specified in the inclusion criteria) , or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigators, may increase the risk&#xD;
             associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability&#xD;
             of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study. Participants with mild to moderate asthma or&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) well controlled with oral or inhaled&#xD;
             medications are permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled, topical intranasal or intro-ocular&#xD;
             steroids, and adrenal replacement doses &lt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are&#xD;
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of Grade &gt;1 NCI-CTCAE v 5.0; however,&#xD;

             equal to 2 AEs not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with&#xD;
             the safety monitoring requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to study drug components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PRGN-2012 is an agent with unknown&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with PRGN-2012, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with PRGN-2012. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
