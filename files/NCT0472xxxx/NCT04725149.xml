  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the dose-response effects of 10-day tart cherry product consumption (0, 30 ml,&#xD;
      and 60 ml) on knee extensor isometric strength 24-h and 48-h after muscle damaging exercise&#xD;
      and to elucidate the mechanisms of action for TC supplementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Montmorency cherry supplementation has been shown to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects that can be beneficial for improving recovery from exercise. However, the&#xD;
      investigator is currently not aware of how tart cherry polyphenol supplementation produces&#xD;
      these effects. This study aims to determine the dose-response effects of 10-day tart cherry&#xD;
      product consumption (placebo, 30 ml, and 60 ml Montmorency tart cherry concentrate in a 500&#xD;
      ml beverage) on knee extensor isometric strength 24-h and 48-h after muscle damaging exercise&#xD;
      on supplementation Day 8; on enhancing recovery of other measures of muscle function (single&#xD;
      leg eccentric and concentric force development and single leg jump height) and muscle&#xD;
      soreness; on reducing markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in plasma, muscle and&#xD;
      urine; on inducing signaling in muscle via the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2&#xD;
      (Nrf2) pathway to upregulate endogenous antioxidant enzymes in muscle; on inhibiting muscle&#xD;
      cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also aims to identify and establish the molecular mechanisms of action through&#xD;
      which tart cherry polyphenols exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Oxidative&#xD;
      stress and inflammatory signaling in primary human myogenic cells will be assessed by&#xD;
      incubating primary human myogenic cells (commercial cell line) in sera derived from 6&#xD;
      participants consuming 8-day placebo vs. 60 ml/day Montmorency tart cherry concentrate&#xD;
      supplement. Subjects are permitted to participate in both the molecular mechanism of action&#xD;
      part of the study (Part A, no exercise component) and the damaging exercise muscle recovery&#xD;
      part of the study (Part B).&#xD;
