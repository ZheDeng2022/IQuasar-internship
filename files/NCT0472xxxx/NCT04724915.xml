    <time_frame>Postoperatively at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The change for the following patient reported outcome measures will be evaluated (compared to preoperatively): Forgotten Joint Score. The score is a percentage score from 0 to 100, 0 representing extreme problems and 100 representing no problems.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alignment</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative and postoperatively at 6 weeks and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Coronal alignment on xrays. The lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) will be evaluated. This is the angle between the mechanical femoral axis and the line between the distal articular surface of the femur. Additionally the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) will be evaluated. This is the line between the condylar surface and the mechanical axis of the tibia on a coronal radiograph.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee laxity anteroposterior</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative and postoperatively at 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Sagittal knee laxity will be evaluated with stress examination. Sagittal knee laxity will be measured with an anteroposterior laxitymeter (GENOUROB; CE Marked). With a standardized setup, anteroposterior laxity can be obtained by measuring the anteroposterior deviation from the neutral position with up to 300 Newton of force.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee kinematics in 3D after squat, knee flexion/extension, stair ascend and descend.</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperatively at 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Knee kinematics in 3D obtained with fluoroscopy. Patients will be asked to perform squats, a flexion/extension movement, ascend and descend stairs. 3D motion of the prosthesis components can be obtained by projecting the 3D file of the prosthesis components onto the fluoroscopy images.</description>
