  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a significant and expanding health problem, and no FDA&#xD;
      approved treatments are currently available. Persons with posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) may use cannabis to help control symptoms. Relief from PTSD insomnia, nightmares,&#xD;
      anxiety, and preoccupying thoughts have been reported as troublesome symptoms targeted by&#xD;
      cannabis users. Risks from cannabis use by individuals with PTSD have been reported. Chronic&#xD;
      use of cannabis can lead to tolerance, requiring increased use for symptom relief, and&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms upon stopping. CUD is more frequent and severe in those with PTSD than&#xD;
      those without. Many symptoms of cannabis withdrawal overlap with troubling symptoms of PTSD&#xD;
      and thus may be interpreted as a relapse of PTSD symptoms. Those attempting to reduce or stop&#xD;
      cannabis use may experience cannabis withdrawal symptoms including insomnia and distressing&#xD;
      dreams, anxiety, irritability, and/or excessive sweating that they may misattribute to&#xD;
      re-emerging or untreated PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive brain adrenaline activity is arguably the best-described neurobiological&#xD;
      contribution to the pathophysiology of PTSD. Prazosin, a drug that blocks the negative&#xD;
      effects of brain adrenaline, has demonstrated effectiveness in robustly reducing PTSD-related&#xD;
      nightmares and sleep disturbance in active duty Servicemembers and recently discharged combat&#xD;
      Veterans in most, but not all, clinical trials, as well as in civilians with non-combat&#xD;
      trauma. Clinically, the investigators have observed that several patients with PTSD using&#xD;
      cannabis to treat insomnia and/or trauma-related nightmares and wanting to reduce their&#xD;
      cannabis use were able to achieve reduction or cessation of cannabis use once they were&#xD;
      treated with an effective dose of prazosin. Therefore, we have wondered if prazosin may&#xD;
      provide sufficient treatment of PTSD symptoms otherwise targeted by cannabis, supporting&#xD;
      those individuals' efforts to reduce cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label pilot study aims to study the feasibility of prazosin as a treatment for CUD&#xD;
      in individuals with or without comorbid PTSD, and to evaluate if additional research on a&#xD;
      larger scale is warranted.&#xD;

      This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility of prazosin as a treatment for CUD in&#xD;
      individuals with or without comorbid PTSD, and to evaluate if additional research on a larger&#xD;
      scale is warranted. In particular, the investigators will evaluate their ability to recruit&#xD;
      and retain individuals with CUD, evaluate their ability to quantify cannabis use and&#xD;
      associated clinical outcomes, and objectively measure cannabis use in context of a clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the investigators have ample experience recruiting Veterans and non-Veterans with&#xD;
      and without PTSD for prazosin clinical trials of similar duration, they have never recruited&#xD;
      treatment-seeking CUD participants. Treatment studies in cannabis users are known to have&#xD;
      approximately 30% drop out rate, and thus gaining experience in recruitment and retention is&#xD;
      critical prior to investment in larger studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Assess the feasibility of recruitment and retention of participants for a&#xD;
      clinical trial using prazosin as a treatment of CUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 20 treatment seeking individuals with CUD (10 with and 10&#xD;
      without PTSD) for 12-week open label treatment of prazosin. Given their experience conducting&#xD;
      studies in Veterans and non-Veterans with and without PTSD and/or alcohol use disorder (AUD)&#xD;
      achieving 61-83% retention at end of treatment, the investigators anticipate that prazosin&#xD;
      will be well tolerated in the study population. Participants will be asked to provide&#xD;
      qualitative assessments of treatment acceptability, or reasons for early termination for&#xD;
      those who drop out of the study before end of treatment, so that these issues can be&#xD;
      addressed in future study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Assess the feasibility of quantifying cannabis consumption by subjective&#xD;
      self-report and objective urine and blood testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of cannabis use is complex and not standard within the field. Due to the&#xD;
      multiple routes of cannabis self-administration, variable cannabinoid concentration in&#xD;
      cannabis products, and variable tolerance and pharmacokinetics across cannabis users, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to gain experience in quantifying cannabis use by self-report and&#xD;
      objective testing, as these measures will directly affect their outcome assessments expected&#xD;
      in a subsequent clinical trial design. The investigators will assess amount and frequency of&#xD;
      cannabis used by self-report (i.e., typical grams consumed per day, number of sessions per&#xD;
      day of use), tracked with regular semi-quantitative urine tests and validated by quantitative&#xD;
      blood and urine testing at selected time points. Self-reported cannabis use will be assessed&#xD;
      by the Quantification of Cannabis Consumption (QCC), a brief questionnaire designed and&#xD;
      preliminarily tested by the investigators, and the timeline follow back (TLFB). Symptoms of&#xD;
      CUD and cannabis withdrawal will be assessed with validated self-report measures.&#xD;
      Semi-quantitative urine tests will provide a relatively inexpensive and rapid means of&#xD;
      testing cannabis use. These measures will be compared against less frequent and fully&#xD;
      quantitative urine and blood analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS).&#xD;
      If self-report and semi-quantitative urine tests are consistent with those from LC/MS, then&#xD;
      they will be utilized in subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims: The investigators will explore if prazosin administration is well tolerated&#xD;
      and is associated with a reduction of cannabis withdrawal symptom severity and/or cannabis&#xD;
      use. As there are no effective treatments for CUD, a reduction of cannabis use by at least&#xD;
      20% from baseline to end of treatment will be considered meaningful enough to warrant future&#xD;
      study. In comparison, rates for attaining negative urine tests in two recent medication&#xD;
      trials paired with contingency management or psychotherapy were 22% and 29%, respectively&#xD;
      (with identical rates in placebo and treatment groups). Adverse events will be monitored and&#xD;
      compared their frequencies to that experienced in prior studies of prazosin conducted by the&#xD;
      investigators as an exploratory outcome. Additional exploratory outcomes include the&#xD;
      comparison of cannabis use throughout the study between those with and without PTSD, and the&#xD;
      reduction of PTSD-related nightmares in the PTSD group.&#xD;
