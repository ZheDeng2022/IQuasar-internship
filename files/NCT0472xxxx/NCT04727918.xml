  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      European guidelines recommend the use of cold snare polypectomy (CSP) for removal of&#xD;
      diminutive colorectal polyps (DCP)(5 mm or less). However, for DCP &lt; 4 mm cold biopsy forceps&#xD;
      (CBF) may be optional. Moreover, CBF remains the endoscopist's technique of choice for polyp&#xD;
      resection and CSP is associated with a failure of specimen retrieval for histology in up to&#xD;
      6.8% of cases. In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the efficacy of CSP with CBF&#xD;
      for removal of DCP in routine colonoscopy&#xD;

    <measure>The primary objective of the study is to compare CBF and CSP in terms of efficacy. The primary end-point is the rate of histological complete resection by anatomopathological examination.</measure>

    <description>Complete histological resection was defined as the absence of visualized residual polyp after saline irrigation as well as negative biopsies of the polypectomy site</description>

Endoscopists with a minimal experience of at least 50 CBF and CSP performed the polypectomies CSP : The CSB procedure will be performed using a 9 mm cold snare (Exacto ® Life Partners). One to two mm of normal surrounding mucosa will be ensnared around the base of the polyp, followed by mechanical excision without electrocautery</description>
