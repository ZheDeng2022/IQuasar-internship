  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraocular surgery could induce vitreous degeneration and posterior vitreous detachment&#xD;
      (PVD). Vitreomacular interface (VMI) abnormalities usually are caused by abnormal PVD,&#xD;
      vitreoschisis and partial-thickness PVD. Furthermore, the PVD could induce the peripheral&#xD;
      break. The incidence of peripheral break and epimacular membrane (EMM) after pneumatic&#xD;
      retinopexy were 11.7% and 4-11%, respectively. Although multiple intravitreal anti-vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections induced PVD of 5.6%, but peripheral break&#xD;
      was reported as only 0.67%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common intraocular surgery is cataract surgery. From the literature review, many&#xD;
      methods were used to detect the PVD after phacoemulsification. The former studies used&#xD;
      indirect ophthalmoscopy and ocular ultrasound for diagnosis of PVD. The later studies used&#xD;
      the optical coherence tomography (OCT) for PVD detection. The OCT device had higher&#xD;
      effectiveness in evaluation of the posterior segment, then it can detect&#xD;
      post-phacoemulsification PVD more and early than previous studies. Ivastinovic et al&#xD;
      demonstrated 59.2% of patients had PVD at 1 month after phacoemulsification, and increased up&#xD;
      to 71.4% at 3 months. The incidence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) after&#xD;
      phacoemulsification is gradually increased with time. The accumulative risk of RRD was&#xD;
      increased from 0.27% at 1 year to 1.27% at 20 years after phacoemulsification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trabeculectomy is one of the intraocular surgery. Although the volume of intraocular fluid&#xD;
      use during the trabeculectomy was much less than used during phacoemulsification,&#xD;
      trabeculectomy also could induce the PVD and it's sequelae such as VMI abnormalities. Because&#xD;
      the baseline visual acuity of glaucoma patients who were indicated for trabeculectomy usually&#xD;
      quite poor, so the sequelae of PVD can cause more visual loss. The incidence of PVD after&#xD;
      trabeculectomy has never been published before and nowadays no standard guideline for retinal&#xD;
      examination or screening after surgery. Furthermore, Tsukahara et al introduced wide-field&#xD;
      OCT-based PVD classification. The new OCT device with higher technology will be useful in PVD&#xD;
      detection.&#xD;
