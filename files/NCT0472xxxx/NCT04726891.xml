  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed research is to conduct a pilot study to test the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of a home-based exercise intervention (SMART-HEALTH). The primary purpose&#xD;
      of the pilot study is to assess the feasibility of intervention delivery (Aim 1), the&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention by participants (Aim 2) and estimate effect sizes for a&#xD;
      future trial (Aim 3).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project aims to address low adherence to exercise interventions among people&#xD;
      with SCI. Specifically, we will conduct a 12-week pilot study of a SMART design using a&#xD;
      telehealth-delivered intervention previously developed for people with mobility disability as&#xD;
      the primary intervention strategy. This intervention, Movement-to-Music (M2M), has been&#xD;
      previously packaged as a collection of videos disseminated through an app on a weekly&#xD;
      schedule. M2M has been shown to effectively improve physiological outcomes among people with&#xD;
      a neurological disability, including SCI. Data collection will include accelerometer-based&#xD;
      measurement of physical activity and sleep during the intervention, a 3-day physical activity&#xD;
      recall, and assessment of physiological (e.g., grip strength) and psychosocial factors (i.e.,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety) collected before and after intervention. Social Cognitive Theory has&#xD;
      been used successfully in past studies to improve many health behaviors. Thus, it will be&#xD;
      utilized into SMART-HEALTH as the following constructs: self-efficacy, self-regulation,&#xD;
      social support, and outcome expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of individuals with SCI will be randomized to 4 weeks or 8 weeks of M2M with social&#xD;
      networking support for the first treatment stage. Depending on adherence, they will either&#xD;
      continue with the intervention received in the first treatment stage or be randomized a&#xD;
      second time. Specifically, participants with high adherence (40 or more minutes) will&#xD;
      continue M2M with social networking support, while those with low adherence (less than 40&#xD;
      minutes) will be randomized to an augmented arm that includes individualized behavioral&#xD;
      coaching or to an arm that switches to M2M Live. The second treatment stage will last until&#xD;
      the participant has completed a total of 12 weeks on the program. The social networking&#xD;
      support, individualized behavioral coaching, and M2M Live sessions will be completed through&#xD;
      secure videoconferencing on the mobile health platform, which will allow a singular location&#xD;
      for tracking intervention activity. All security features of the integrated videoconferencing&#xD;
      software will be used, including passwords and waiting rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M2M. In the first treatment stage, all participants will receive M2M as the evidence-based&#xD;
      home exercise intervention. M2M is provided in the form of an exercise routine that includes&#xD;
      aerobic and strength training set to music. Each week the participants will receive a set of&#xD;
      exercise videos, which they will be asked to complete 3 times during the week. Exercise&#xD;
      videos begin with a low dose of minutes, approximately 10 to 15 minutes for a total of 40&#xD;
      minutes for the week, and increase by 3-5 minutes each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Networking Support. In the first treatment stage, all participants will also receive&#xD;
      social networking support. This includes group discussions, facilitated by project staff&#xD;
      trained by the PI in behavioral coaching, about barriers to exercise encountered in the prior&#xD;
      week and potential solutions. Sessions will be held weekly in the first month, bi-weekly in&#xD;
      the second month, and once in the last month. The group will also be able to communicate&#xD;
      through the mobile health platform via features such as messaging, posting, commenting, and&#xD;
      liking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual Behavioral Coaching. Some participants with sub-optimal adherence in the first&#xD;
      treatment stage will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in the second treatment&#xD;
      stage. Half of these participants will receive M2M plus social networking support augmented&#xD;
      with individualized behavioral coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M2M Live. The remaining half of participants with sub-optimal adherence in the first&#xD;
      treatment stage will switch to another M2M-based home exercise intervention, M2M Live. This&#xD;
      involves one-on-one tele-exercise training with an M2M instructor. During the first week of&#xD;
      M2M Live, the participant will set a schedule to meet with the M2M instructor 3 times a week&#xD;
      for an exercise session.&#xD;

    <description>Some participants with sub-optimal adherence in the first treatment stage will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in the second treatment stage. these participants will receive M2M plus social networking support augmented with individualized behavioral coaching. Individualized behavioral coaching involves a weekly coaching session to improve self-regulatory skills based on prior and individualized exercise prescription. The exercise prescriptions are determined by the coach and individual based on their current activity level and a 4-week goal. An example of tailoring the exercise prescribed involves setting a goal of completing the exercise routine one time for the upcoming week instead of three times. The coach will be trained in motivational interviewing to help the participant modify their exercise habits.</description>
