  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the newborn's first bath with a cleaning&#xD;
      product and only water on the barrier function of the skin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies in the literature on the effects of newborn bath types on the effects of body&#xD;
      temperature on newborn crying times, on the effects of newborn behavior and stress, the views&#xD;
      and practices of mothers with newborn babies on baby bathing, and the effects of bath types&#xD;
      on the umbilical cord in term babies, and the effects of bath products on newborns. It seems&#xD;
      that there are studies done. However, although studies on the effect of the cleaning product&#xD;
      used in the first bath of late preterm and term newborns on the skin barrier are limited in&#xD;
      number for term newborns, there are almost no studies for late preterm newborns. The&#xD;
      hypotheses of this study are as follows; 1. In late preterm and term newborns, the first bath&#xD;
      with cleaning product protects the newborns' Transepidermal Fluid Loss better than the first&#xD;
      bath with only water. 2. In late preterm and term newborns, the first bath with cleansing&#xD;
      product keeps the skin pH levels of newborns at a more optimal level compared to the first&#xD;
      bath with only water.&#xD;

    <description>Among the outcome criteria, the skin barrier function will be evaluated first. Skin barrier function will be evaluated by measuring Transepidermal Water Loss (TESK). To measure transepidermal water loss, it will be measured by closed chamber evaporation using VapoMeter SWL-2 ™ (Delfin Technologies Ltd).</description>

    <description>In the secondary outcome measure of the research, results related to the skin pH level will be shown. Skincheck HI 98109 ™ will be used to measure these results.</description>

    <description>Late preterm and term newborns, whose informed consents are obtained by their parents to participate in the project, will be given their first baths according to the intervention group they are assigned to. Before the first bath / after birth, preterm newborns in all groups will be wiped only once with a clean towel without removing the vernix caseosa. Newborns who were bathed before the application of the study will be excluded from the study. As the most appropriate time for bath time, 30 minutes after the end of the feeding and treatment of the newborns, the bath application will be made at any time between 9 pm and 3 pm.</description>
