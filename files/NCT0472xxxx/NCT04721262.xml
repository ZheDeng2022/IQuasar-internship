    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of using Ferumoxytol as a&#xD;
      contrast agent on a low field strength, portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system.&#xD;
      Participants receiving Ferumoxytol as part of routine clinical care for iron deficiency&#xD;
      anemia will be recruited and scanned on the Hyperfine MRI system before and after their&#xD;
      clinically scheduled intravenous infusion. Resultant images will be compared to assess signal&#xD;
      intensity changes generated by the presence of Feromoxytol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ferumoxytol is a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) preparation that was&#xD;
      originally designed as an MRI contrast agent, but later received FDA approval as a treatment&#xD;
      for iron deficiency anemia. Contrast agents alter MR images by changing tissue magnetic&#xD;
      relaxation constants such as T1 and T2 (or T2*). Gadolinium-based contrast agents decrease T1&#xD;
      values, causing increased signal on T1-weighted images. At low field strength, T1 values are&#xD;
      already very short so a further decrease may provide little contrast. At typical field&#xD;
      strengths, Ferumoxytol strongly decreases T1 and also T2 (and T2*) values, increasing signal&#xD;
      on T1-weighted images and (conversely) decreasing signal on T2-weighted images. This T2-based&#xD;
      contrast mechanism may be maintained at lower field strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with iron deficiency anemia are commonly prescribed Ferumoxytol periodically as part&#xD;
      of their standard clinical care. Multiple studies have characterized the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of Ferumoxytol in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia. Patients prescribed Ferumoxytol&#xD;
      for iron-deficiency anemia typically include otherwise healthy women with heavy menstrual&#xD;
      periods, patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and patients with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
      Such patients make ideal candidates for characterizing the effects of Ferumoxytol on novel&#xD;
      imaging devices by obviating a medically unnecessary injection of the contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast agents play a key role in diagnosing and managing numerous diseases. Ferumoxytol has&#xD;
      been used to image a variety of pathologies and organs, including tumors and inflammation in&#xD;
      the brain, liver, pancreas, and prostate. In addition to the different magnetic relaxation&#xD;
      properties described above, Ferumoxytol has a higher molecular weight and prolonged blood&#xD;
      pool period compared to typical gadolinium-based agents, facilitating imaging vasculature&#xD;
      prior to the contrast agent leaking into the extravascular tissue. This has been exploited at&#xD;
      higher field strengths and may be particularly advantageous for low field imaging that&#xD;
      requires longer scan times. Ferumoxytol iron particles are taken up through the&#xD;
      reticuloendothelial system and added to physiologic iron stores, rather than being excreted&#xD;
      through the kidneys, resulting in increased plasma half-life while also avoiding concerns&#xD;
      related to impaired renal function that sometimes arise with other contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hyperfine device is a newly developed MRI unit that has multiple potential advantages&#xD;
      over standard CT or MRI including portability, easier upkeep, open design, and ease of use.&#xD;
      Unlike CT, the Hyperfine device does not use moving parts or X-rays to generate images.&#xD;
      Unlike routine MRI, the Hyperfine device uses two permanent magnets with open space between&#xD;
      and around them, rather than a super-cooled superconducting magnetic tube. In contrast to CT&#xD;
      and routine MRI, the device can be wheeled from place to place and moved into position with&#xD;
      the patient remaining on a gurney or hospital bed. Relative to routine MRI, the device uses a&#xD;
      very low magnetic field strength of 64 mT compared to 1.5 T or 3 T, making it safer for&#xD;
      patients or environments with medical devices having metallic components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard images of different types are obtained on the Hyperfine device at the push of a&#xD;
      button on an attached touch pad. Imaging protocols include those for anatomical depiction&#xD;
      such as balance steady-state free precession (bSFFP), T1-weighted (T1W) gradient echo (GRE),&#xD;
      and fast low-angle shot (FLASH) as well as imaging methods focused on the detection of&#xD;
      pathology and tissue damage such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid attenuated&#xD;
      inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted (T2W) fast spin echo (FSE). However, it is not&#xD;
      known if existing contrast agents can provide effective contrast in the Hyperfine low-field&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Ferumoxytol as a&#xD;
      contrast agent in low-field MRI scanners. Patients who are already receiving Ferumoxytol as a&#xD;
      treatment for iron deficiency anemia will be scanned before and after Ferumoxytol infusion.&#xD;
      Degree of contrast enhancement in intravascular and extravascular compartments including the&#xD;
      cerebral vasculature and the brain parenchyma will be the primary end-point for the study.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in MRI signal intensity (contrast enhancement) produced by the presence of the Ferumoxytol contrast agent will be quantified by co-registering brain MRI studies obtained before and after administration of Ferumoxytol and determining the ratio of signal intensity values between the two sets of images (post-Ferumoxytol/pre-Ferumoxytol) in regions of interest placed separately over brain parenchyma or vascular structures. Based on the magnetic properties of Ferumoxytol, this contrast ratio is expected to be greater than one for T1-weighted scans and less than one for T2- or T2*-weighted scans.</description>
