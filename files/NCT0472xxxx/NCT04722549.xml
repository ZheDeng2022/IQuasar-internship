  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of butyrate on psychobiological processes are examined in a sample of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an interventional triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design with 2&#xD;
      arms (placebo, butyrate). Healthy male participants adhere to a low-fiber diet for the&#xD;
      duration of the study (11 days). At the baseline study visit, measurements are taken in the&#xD;
      lab, including biological samples and psychophysiological measurements. Participants then&#xD;
      consume placebo or butyrate for 1 week and revisit the lab on day 11 for a second measurement&#xD;
      of the outcomes of interest. Specifically, we investigate the effect of colonic butyrate&#xD;
      administration on affective processing, including stress sensitivity and fear-related&#xD;
      processes (e.g. extinction learning). Volunteers also respond to questionnaires in relation&#xD;
      to mood and GI symptoms, and provide biological samples (saliva, blood, and faecal samples)&#xD;
      for analysis of cortisol levels, circulating short chain fatty acids and serum BDNF, and&#xD;
      faecal SCFA, respectively.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress sensitivity (cortisol)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 1 year and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Induction of cognitive, physical, and social stress using Maastricht Acute Stress Test. Stress hormone cortisol is quantified by gathering multiple saliva samples throughout the stress induction and recovery during both pre-intervention and post-intervention visit.</description>

    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 1 year and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Induction of cognitive, physical, and social stress using Maastricht Acute Stress Test. Participant rate how much stress, discomfort, and pain they feel on a 10-cm visual analogue scale, with higher values indicating greater stress, discomfort, and pain. This is done prior to stress induction, in the middle, and at the end at both pre- and post-intervention visits.</description>
