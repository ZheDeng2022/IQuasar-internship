  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cancer patients, the integration between anticancer therapies and palliative care is of&#xD;
      fundamental importance. In this context, telemedicine can improve the quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      of chronic patients through self-management and remote monitoring solutions. This approach&#xD;
      can favor the effectiveness of the treatment and therapeutic adherence. Of note, telemedicine&#xD;
      can also be applied to the management of cancer pain. In the advanced stages of cancer&#xD;
      disease, pain is one of the most obvious and most disabling symptoms. Consequently, proper&#xD;
      pain management has a significant impact on the QoL, the ability to withstand treatment, and&#xD;
      the recovery of patients. On the other hand, given the complexity of cancer pain, the main&#xD;
      obstacle to its proper management is the lack of adequate measurement methods. Although in&#xD;
      recent years a great deal of effort has been made in the direction of automatic pain&#xD;
      assessment, both concerning the creation of datasets and the development of classification&#xD;
      algorithms, the literature is lacking regarding the automatic measurement of pain in the&#xD;
      setting of cancer patients. Observation by experienced clinical staff and self-assessment by&#xD;
      patients could be useful for obtaining the ground truth and, in turn, for training automatic&#xD;
      pain recognition systems.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the entire duration of the study, patients will remain under the care of the Early&#xD;
      Palliative Care and Simultaneous Care Outpatient team of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori,&#xD;
      Fondazione Pascale, at home. Pain and other symptoms will be managed according to the good&#xD;
      clinical practice and patients will receive assistance in agreement to the routine medical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following devices will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Software&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Instrumentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Assessment Tools: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer&#xD;
           Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), Daily Pain Diary, 0-10 numeric&#xD;
           rating scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be divided into three main Work Packages (WPs), dedicated respectively to&#xD;
      the creation of the IT infrastructure to support acquisitions (WP1), the patient data&#xD;
      collection campaign (WP2), and the development of machine learning algorithms for automatic&#xD;
      pain recognition (WP3). The application of the devices and verification of correct&#xD;
      functioning will be carried out at the patient's home by the IT staff involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP1 - The system consists of three main components: the server, with the attached database,&#xD;
      the application for mobile devices, also responsible for managing data acquisition from&#xD;
      physiological signal acquisition devices, and the desktop application, used by the clinical&#xD;
      staff to monitor the progress of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mobile application will have the role of interfacing directly with the patient and&#xD;
      acquiring biometric data from wearable devices. Specifically, the following signals will be&#xD;
      acquired: heart rate, body temperature, non-invasive blood pressure, and galvanic skin&#xD;
      response (GSR). The heart rate will be obtained through a wearable device (Garmin Vivosmart&#xD;
      4) while the body temperature, the non-invasive blood pressure, and the GSR will be acquired&#xD;
      by an external device (a BITalino platform).To further validate the accuracy of the algorithm&#xD;
      that will deal with pain detection, patients will also be given a QoL questionnaire (EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-C30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to acquire the ground truth of the data, the patient will be asked to provide&#xD;
      feedback on the level of pain, both at certain intervals of time during the day, and in case&#xD;
      of acute pain episodes. This feedback can be based on NRS and multimedia strategies (e.g.,&#xD;
      videos). Patients will fill out a daily pain diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP2 - The campaign will include a preliminary acquisition phase aimed at testing the IT&#xD;
      infrastructure. For obtaining an adequate inter-subject and intra-subject variability, it&#xD;
      will be necessary to enroll at least 40 patients, acquiring data for 10-14 days. Thus, the&#xD;
      data collection campaign will be conducted for about 6 months. Each subject will use the&#xD;
      mobile application and sensors for 2 weeks. Data will be acquired using simultaneously data&#xD;
      collection bundles (application, sensors, and any mobile device). Upon enrolment and at the&#xD;
      end, EORTC QLQ-C30 will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP3 - The objective is the development of algorithms able to predict the level of pain&#xD;
      perceived by the patient. Having a considerable amount of labelled data available, the system&#xD;
      will learn from the examples.&#xD;
