  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test an investigational fabrication system for transtibial&#xD;
      prostheses. This fabrication method will be tested for comfort and function to determine&#xD;
      feasibility of use for amputees in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the need for high quality and affordable prosthetic technology in developing&#xD;
      countries, the investigators have developed a simplified socket fitting protocol using&#xD;
      expandable rigid foam. The foam is formed by mixing small amounts of two liquid components,&#xD;
      which typically expands to several times its original volume.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Millions of amputees in low-income nations lack access to prosthetic care. Conventional&#xD;
      socket fabrication is complex, and the need for prosthetists is far greater than the&#xD;
      throughput of existing clinician training programs. The first step in fitting a prosthetic&#xD;
      limb is to fabricate the socket, which fits over the residual limb and acts as the interface&#xD;
      between the residual limb and the prosthesis. The socket is the most custom component of the&#xD;
      prosthetic system and must be comfortable to wear, easy to clean, and durable enough to&#xD;
      withstand years of day-to-day use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple and low-cost methods for socket fabrication and fitting would improve access to&#xD;
      prosthetic care and could give many people in need their first opportunity to use a&#xD;
      prosthesis. We have developed an easy-to-follow method that allows us to cast the limb in&#xD;
      less than 30 minutes and finish the socket in 90 minutes, making it a practical choice for&#xD;
      socket fitting in busy clinical settings, and where users are unable to return for multiple&#xD;
      fittings. We have submitted a provisional US patent for our socket fabrication method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that our novel method of fabrication for a low cost prosthesis can produce a&#xD;
      device that has appropriate suspension, a comfortable interface, and requires little long&#xD;
      term follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>A pre-made 3D printed cylinder used as an outer shell is selected for each subject based on their measurements. The space between the residual limb and the outer shell will be filled with an expanding polyurethane foam (Foam IT 8, Smooth On Inc.) that conforms to the residual limb and bonds with the outer shell to form a strong and lightweight socket. The foam forms a smooth surface against the protective sheath; the socket is fully formed once the foam has hardened to the 3D printed cylinder.&#xD;
A prefabricated supracondylar suspension cuff made of Dacron or nylon, or a commercially available suspension sleeve may be will be applied to the prosthetic socket to aid in suspension. Commercially available components, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) transtibial polypropylene component system will be attached to the bottom of the socket to allow the patient to ambulate in the prosthesis.</description>
