      &lt;Study Objectives&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the efficacy of Sitravatinib and Tislelizumab combination in biliary tract&#xD;
      cancer patients who have failed to 1st-line chemotherapy but no more than 2 lines of prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see the safety of Sitravatinib and Tislelizumab combination in biliary tract cancer&#xD;
      patients who have failed to 1st-line chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Rationale&gt; sitravatinib and tislelizumab may elicit greater antitumor activity, as&#xD;
      sitravatinib is predicted to enhance several steps in the cancer immunity Cycle that may&#xD;
      augment the efficacy of tislelizumab. First, the antitumor activity of sitravatinib may&#xD;
      promote the release of tumor antigens. Second, inhibition of the split kinase receptors&#xD;
      VEGFR-2 and KIT may decrease the number of Tregs and MDSCs, thus promoting the expansion and&#xD;
      migration of antitumor cytotoxic T cells, and their infiltration into tumor tissue. Third,&#xD;
      sitravatinib may reverse the immunosuppressive effects within the tumor microenvironment that&#xD;
      are mediated by the TAM receptors through inhibition of MERTK, resulting in an increased&#xD;
      number of M1- versus M2-polarized macrophages and release of IL 12, IL-6, and TNF. These&#xD;
      downstream effects enhance CD8+ T-cell activation, and through the inhibition of AXL, promote&#xD;
      increased antigen presentation through termination of the Toll-like receptor dependent&#xD;
      inflammatory response in dendritic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In biliary tract cancer, this sitravatinib and tislelizumab combination has not been tested&#xD;
      so far. In this protocol, we will test sitravatinib and tislelizumab combination in advanced&#xD;
      biliary tract cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;hypothesis&gt; Selective receptor tyrosine kinases inhibit key molecular and cellular pathways&#xD;
      strongly implicated in checkpoint inhibitor resistance and therefore represent reasonable&#xD;
      strategies to enhance or restore antitumor immunity when combined with anti-PD-1 or&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Study design&gt; This is open-label, phase II study enrolling advanced BTC patients who have&#xD;
      failed to 1st-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive sitravatinib 120 mg orally once daily in combination with&#xD;
      tislelizumab 200 mg IV once every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
