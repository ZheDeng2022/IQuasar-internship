  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment modality for many&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. Morbidity and mortality rates have declined drastically over the&#xD;
      years, secondary to improvements in both transplant techniques and pharmacotherapies,&#xD;
      including immunosuppressants, anti-infectives, analgesics and other supportive care&#xD;
      medications. Despite advances in patient care, toxicities associated with HCT (e.g.,&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infection, pain, anxiety, depression, mucositis,&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting) continue to pose challenges in patient care and have a significant impact on&#xD;
      quality of life. (QOL). A recent study demonstrated subjects randomized to intensive&#xD;
      supportive care had a clinically significant improvement in their QOL during hospitalization&#xD;
      and up to 3 months post-transplant compared to those receiving standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further follow up evaluations have evaluated the impact of focused palliative care/symptom&#xD;
      management on QOL metrics - inclusive of Edmonton Symptom Assessment surveys (ESAS). In other&#xD;
      malignant settings, i.e. solid tumor, ESAS has been noted as an effective measure of symptoms&#xD;
      control and the utilization of this assessment is linked to positive outcomes. The American&#xD;
      Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has designated QOL as the second most relevant metric for&#xD;
      post-transplant patient care behind survival, making the optimization of supportive care&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy a clinically relevant subject to investigate. Pharmacogenetics (PGx) uses an&#xD;
      individual's genetic factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to personalize&#xD;
      therapy or dose selection. SNPs encode drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and targets&#xD;
      that can significantly impact drug efficacy and toxicity. With the growing complexity of both&#xD;
      antineoplastics and supportive care, oncologists have less time to manage each subject's&#xD;
      myriad of supportive care concerns by trial and error. Suboptimal management of symptoms&#xD;
      compromises potential benefits from cancer therapy, disrupts clinic workflow, increases&#xD;
      emergency room visits, and affects both patient satisfaction and reimbursement. Genetic&#xD;
      variation is well documented across the human genome and affects a subject's response to&#xD;
      medications regarding efficacy and toxicity. The genome is quickly becoming a pragmatic tool&#xD;
      that can assist oncologists and other providers in optimizing supportive care for subjects&#xD;
      with cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a pharmacist-driven precision&#xD;
      medicine service guided by HCT clinical pharmacists and Specialty Pharmacy pharmacists using&#xD;
      preemptive pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing will identify drug-gene interactions relevant to the&#xD;
      supportive care of HCT subjects. This approach to care may improve symptom management and QOL&#xD;
      as interpreted via ESAS in adult HCT subjects treated at our institution. With the experience&#xD;
      of past studies and a customized genetic panel, the investigators will genotype subjects&#xD;
      prior to transplant and identify actionable drug-gene pairs and utilize these to direct&#xD;
      supportive therapies. To date no studies have highlighted the significance of incorporating&#xD;
      preemptive PGx testing to personalize therapy selection and dosing into the management of&#xD;
      adult HCT subjects as a means of improving QOL and symptom management. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      estimate the frequency of subjects undergoing PGx testing who receive at least one drug/dose&#xD;
      selection or modification based on their test results during the study period (from admission&#xD;
      for HCT to HCT D100). Secondarily the investigators will measure improvement in aggregate and&#xD;
      individual scores on the ESAS survey and will further use the ESAS in its totality to assess&#xD;
      the impact of PGx-guided care as compared to pre-implementation/non-PGx driven strategies&#xD;
      through aggregate ESAS scores, individual ESAS scores, and differences between HCT admission&#xD;
      (or baseline) and HCT Day 30 scores before and after the intervening program. In the&#xD;
      outpatient setting the investigators will utilize planned medication reconciliation (with PGx&#xD;
      guidance) by Specialty Pharmacy Service pharmacists to adhere to PGx-recommendations and&#xD;
      capture insight into the implementation of this program to share with other practitioners.&#xD;
      The implementation of this study will personalize pharmacotherapy, improve symptom management&#xD;
      and QOL in adult HCT subjects treated at our institution, and offer guidance globally in&#xD;
      supporting the role of the pharmacist in pharmacogenomics (PGx) and management of HCT&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
