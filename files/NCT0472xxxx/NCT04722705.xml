  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scar site was divided into 3 sites; combined IPL/fractional Er:YAG laser treatment site,&#xD;
      fractional Er:YAG laser treatment site and untreated control site. At baseline, three lesions&#xD;
      were randomized to IPL / fractional Er:YAG laser combination therapy site, fractional Er:YAG&#xD;
      laser treatment alone site, and untreated control site. The laser treatment was conducted&#xD;
      total three sessions, immediately at suture removal (baseline), 4 weeks after suture removal&#xD;
      and 8 weeks after suture removal. The evaluation of scar site was conducted 3 months later&#xD;
      after last treatment (20 weeks after suture removal).&#xD;

    <description>The POSAS observer consists of following 6 items: vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, surface area, relief, pliability. Each item was evaluated on a scale from 1 (normal skin) to 10 (worst scar). Finally, the POSAS total score was calculated as the sum of six items, ranging from 6 to 60.</description>
