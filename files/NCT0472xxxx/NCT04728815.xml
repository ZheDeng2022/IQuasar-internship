  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among college students and suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      suicide-related behaviors are a frequent presenting problem at college counseling centers&#xD;
      (CCCs), which are overburdened. Studies show that some students respond rapidly to treatment,&#xD;
      whereas others require considerably more resources. Evidence-based adaptive treatment&#xD;
      strategies (ATSs) are needed to address this heterogeneity in responsivity and complexity.&#xD;
      ATSs individualize treatment via decision rules specifying how the type and intensity of an&#xD;
      intervention can be sequenced based on risk factors, response, or compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this multisite study is to investigate the effectiveness of four adaptive&#xD;
      treatment strategies (ATSs) to treat college students who report suicidal ideation when first&#xD;
      seeking services at their college counseling center This multisite study will enroll&#xD;
      moderately to severely suicidal college students in the &quot;emerging adulthood&quot; phase (ages&#xD;
      18-25) seeking services at CCCs. This Sequential Multi-Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART)&#xD;
      will have two stages of intervention. In Stage 1, 700 participants from four CCCs will be&#xD;
      randomized to 4-8 weeks of: 1) a suicide-focused treatment - Collaborative Assessment and&#xD;
      Management of Suicidality (CAMS) or 2) Treatment as Usual (TAU). Sufficient responders to&#xD;
      either intervention will discontinue services/be stepped down. Non-responders will be&#xD;
      re-randomized to one of two Stage 2 higher intensity/dosage intervention options for an&#xD;
      additional 4-16 weeks: 1) CAMS (either continued or administered for the first time) or 2)&#xD;
      Comprehensive Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which includes individual therapy, skills&#xD;
      group, and phone/text coaching for the clients and peer consultation for the counselors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll moderately to severely suicidal college students in the &quot;emerging adulthood&quot;&#xD;
      phase (ages 18-25) seeking services at CCCs. Forty-four participants (N=44) from four CCCs&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of three treatments delivered via a hybrid model: (1) a&#xD;
      suicide-focused treatment - Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) for&#xD;
      4-8 weeks (n=16); (2) Treatment as Usual (TAU) for 4-8 weeks (n=16); or (3) Comprehensive&#xD;
      Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for 16 weeks (n=12), which includes individual therapy,&#xD;
      skills training, phone/text coaching for the clients, and peer consultation for the&#xD;
      counselors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sufficient responders to CAMS or TAU will discontinue services/be stepped down after 4-8&#xD;
      weeks. Non-responders to CAMS or TAU will be re-randomized to one of two higher&#xD;
      intensity/dosage intervention options for an additional 8 weeks of treatment: (1) CAMS&#xD;
      (either continued or administered for the first time) or (2) Comprehensive DBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the feasibility study, we will also enroll 12 CCC counselors (3 per site) who will serve&#xD;
      as study counselor participants and periodically complete measures focused on the experience&#xD;
      of counselors working with suicidal college students.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>We will participant de-identified data (linked only by GUID) with the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA). The NDA is an informatics system and research data repository developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to share research data. The NDA provides the infrastructure to store, search across, and analyze various types of data. In addition, The NDA provides longitudinal storage of a research participant's information generated by one or more research studies. In other words, the NDA is able to associate a single research participant's genomic, imaging, clinical assessment and other information even if the data were collected at different locations or through different studies. By doing so, the NDA gives researchers access to more data than they can collect on their own, making it easier and faster for researchers to gather, evaluate, and share research information from a variety of sources.</ipd_description>
