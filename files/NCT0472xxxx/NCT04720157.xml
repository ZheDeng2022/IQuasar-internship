      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in&#xD;
      combination with Standard of Care, versus Standard of Care alone, in adult male patients with&#xD;
      mHSPC. In this study, the SoC is defined as a combination of Androgen Receptor Directed&#xD;
      Therapy + Androgen Deprivation Therapy. Approximately 1126 patients will be randomized in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this international, open-label, prospective, phase III study, where approximately 1126&#xD;
      patients with treatment na√Øve or minimally treated PSMA-positive mHSPC will be randomized in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio to receive Standard of Care (SoC) with or without the radioligand 177Lu-PSMA-617.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the combination of 177Lu-PSMA-617&#xD;
      + SoC improves rPFS over that obtained by administration of SoC alone in mHSPC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be stratified according to the following three factors: disease volume&#xD;
      (high v low), age &gt;= 70 years (yes/no), and on Previous or planned treatment (prostatectomy&#xD;
      or radiation) to primary (prostate) tumor (yes/no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: approximately 50 months. screening period: after signing ICF, patients will&#xD;
      be assessed for eligibility and will be scanned with 68Ga PSMA-11 to identify PSMA expression&#xD;
      status. Following completion of all required screening procedures and verifying participant&#xD;
      eligibility, the participant will be randomized via the interactive response technology (IRT)&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 45 days of LHRH agonist/antagonists is allowed prior to ICF signature. If patient&#xD;
           did not start the ADT prior randomization, ADT should start as soon as possible and&#xD;
           ideally no later than 2 weeks after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 45 days of ARDT is allowed prior ICF signature. If patient did not start the ARDT&#xD;
           prior randomization, ARDT should start as soon as possible and ideally no later than 2&#xD;
           weeks after randomization. Patients will received ARDT as per label instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Standard of Care (SoC) with or&#xD;
      without the radioligand 177Lu-PSMA-617.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the investigational arm (i.e. SoC+177Lu-PSMA-617): Patients will&#xD;
      receive SoC as per label instructions, after randomization, if not started earlier and in the&#xD;
      time frame allowed by the protocol. Patients must begin 177Lu-PSMA-617 dosing within 14 days&#xD;
      after randomization or as soon as possible after the product is received. 177Lu-PSMA-617 is&#xD;
      administered at the dose of 7.4 GBq (+/- 10%), once every 6 weeks (+/- 1 week) for a planned&#xD;
      6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the control arm will begin receiving SoC as per label instructions&#xD;
      after randomization, if not started earlier and in the time frame allowed by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of rPFS will be assessed by a centralized blinded image review committee&#xD;
      (i.e., BIRC) using radiographic images provided by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end of treatment (EOT) visit will be performed when participants permanently discontinue&#xD;
      study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients randomized to the SoC alone (i.e., control) arm experience radiographic&#xD;
      progression (the rPFS event) as confirmed by BIRC, they will be allowed to cross-over to&#xD;
      receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 +/- SoC per the discretion of the treating physician. If cross-over to&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA-617 is selected, then 177Lu-PSMA-617 will be administered with the same&#xD;
      dose/schedule as participants who were initially randomized to receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 as&#xD;
      described above. Study cross-over participants for whom 177Lu-PSMA-617 is discontinued must&#xD;
      have a second End of Treatment (EOT2) visit performed =&lt; 7 days and enter the Post-treatment&#xD;
      Follow-up .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Follow-Up (Safety, Efficacy):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment discontinuation, all participants will be followed for safety with a 30-day&#xD;
      safety follow-up visit (FUP) as well as longer term safety follow-up assessments for a period&#xD;
      of approximately 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who discontinue study treatment without having progressive disease confirmed by&#xD;
      BIRC, will continue to be assessed for efficacy (efficacy follow-up) during the&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up period until the occurrence of their BIRC-confirmed radiographic&#xD;
      disease progression (rPFS) event , or if the total number of protocol-defined rPFS events has&#xD;
      occurred triggering the primary analysis, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study treatment discontinuation, or post-treatment follow-up period discontinuation,&#xD;
      the participant's status will be collected every 90 days (via phone calls) as part of the&#xD;
      survival follow-up. Every effort should be made to comply with the survival follow-up&#xD;
      schedule and ensure collection of participant survival. The survival follow-up and the study&#xD;
      will end when the number of OS events required for final OS analysis will be reached.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Patients must have evidence of PSMA-positive disease as seen on a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT&#xD;
             scan, and eligible as determined by the sponsor's central reader&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have documented metastatic disease to bone and/or soft tissue/visceral&#xD;

          1. Patients with rapidly progressing tumor that requires urgent exposure to taxane-based&#xD;
             chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any systemic anti-prostate cancer therapy (with the exception of the drugs listed on&#xD;
             inclusion criteria 11), including chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors, immunotherapy or&#xD;
             biological therapy (including monoclonal antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Other concurrent cytotoxicity chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radioligand therapy, or&#xD;
             investigational therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Previous treatment with any of the following within 6 months of randomization:&#xD;
             Strontium-89, Samarium-153, Rhenium-186, Rhenium-188, Radium-223, hemi-body&#xD;
             irradiation. Previous PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy is not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ongoing participation in any other clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of other investigational drugs within 30 days prior to day of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments or its excipients or to drugs of&#xD;
             similar chemical classes&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Transfusion for the sole purpose of making a subject eligible for study inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with CNS metastases that are neurologically unstable, symptomatic, or&#xD;
             receiving corticosteroids for the purpose of maintaining neurologic integrity.&#xD;
             Patients with epidural disease, canal disease and prior cord involvement are eligible&#xD;
             if those areas have been treated, are stable, and not neurologically impaired. For&#xD;
             patients with parenchymal CNS metastasis (or a history of CNS metastasis), baseline&#xD;
             and subsequent radiological imaging must include evaluation of the brain (magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) preferred or CT with contrast).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Diagnosed with other malignancies that are expected to alter life expectancy or may&#xD;
             interfere with disease assessment. However, patients with a prior history of&#xD;
             malignancy that has been adequately treated and who have been disease free for more&#xD;
             than 3 years are eligible, as are patients with adequately treated non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer. Note: Patients with a history of CNS metastases&#xD;
             that have received prior therapy and are neurologically stable, asymptomatic and not&#xD;
             receiving corticosteroids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Concurrent serious (as determined by the Principal Investigator) medical conditions,&#xD;
             including, but not limited to, uncontrolled infection, known active hepatitis B or C,&#xD;
             or other significant co-morbid conditions that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             would impair study participation or cooperation. Participants with an active&#xD;
             documented COVID-19 infection (any grade of disease severity) at time of informed&#xD;
             consent may be included only when completely recovered (in accordance with local&#xD;
             guidance) and had no symptoms for at least 28 days before the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. No active clinically significant cardiac disease defined as any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NYHA class 3/4 congestive heart failure within 6 months prior to ICF signature&#xD;
                  unless treated with improvement and echocardiogram or MUGA demonstrates EF &gt; 45%&#xD;
                  with improvement in symptoms to class &lt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History or current diagnosis of ECG abnormalities indicating significant risk of&#xD;
                  safety for participants in the study such as: Concomitant clinically significant&#xD;
                  cardiac arrhythmias, e.g. sustained ventricular tachycardia, complete left bundle&#xD;
                  branch block, high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block (e.g., bifascicular block,&#xD;
                  Mobitz type II and third degree AV block)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of familial long QT syndrome or known family history of Torsades de&#xD;
                  Pointes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiac or cardiac repolarization abnormality, including any of the following:&#xD;
                  History of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, or coronary artery bypass&#xD;
                  graft (CABG) within 6 months prior to ICF signature&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of somatic or psychiatric disease/condition that may interfere with the&#xD;
             objectives and assessments of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Symptomatic cord compression, or clinical or radiologic findings indicative of&#xD;
             impending cord compression&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any condition that precludes raised arms position&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Concurrent bladder outflow obstruction or unmanageable urinary incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking study&#xD;
             treatment and for 6 months after stopping study treatment. A condom is required for&#xD;
             all sexually active male participants to prevent them from fathering a child AND to&#xD;
             prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner. In addition,&#xD;
             male participants must not donate sperm for the time period specified above. If local&#xD;
             regulations deviate from the contraception methods listed above to prevent pregnancy,&#xD;
             local regulations apply and will be described in the ICF&#xD;
