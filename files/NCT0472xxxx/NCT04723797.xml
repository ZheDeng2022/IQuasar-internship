    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a 6 weeks physical activity program on&#xD;
      burnout risk in secondary school teachers. Also, the difference between the effects of&#xD;
      moderate en vigorous-intensity physical activity will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the increased risk of burnout among secondary school teachers, effective interventions&#xD;
      are needed. Physical activity may play a big role in preventing and/or reducing burnout.&#xD;
      Therefore the purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of physical activity on&#xD;
      the risk of burnout in secondary school teachers. The participants in the intervention group&#xD;
      will be asked to perform a specific physical activity program (including running and/or&#xD;
      cycling at a moderate or vigorous intensity) for 6 weeks. The control group will be asked to&#xD;
      keep their lifestyle as it was prior to the study. To assess the effect of this activity&#xD;
      program, the participants will have to fill in a questionnaire at three time points. Lastly,&#xD;
      the participants have to fill in an activity diary every day, enabling to assess intervention&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;

    <measure>Burnout risk</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing the burnout risk by using the Burnout assessment tool (BAT). It consist 34 items scored on a 5-Point likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 always. The greater the total score, the more the participant is in risk of a burnout.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery need</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing the recovery need by using the Short Inventory to Monitor Psychosocial. hazards (SIMPH). This survey consists of 5 questions with the answer options 'yes' or no'. A score of 3 times 'yes' out of 5, is an indication of a possible increased need for recovery at work.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of perceived exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effort and exertion will be measured by using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale. The borg scale ranges from '6' to '20' and is highly correlated with the heart rate. A borg scale of 10 corresponds to a heart rate of 100bpm in a healthy adult.</description>
