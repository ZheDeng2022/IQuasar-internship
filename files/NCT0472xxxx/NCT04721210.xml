  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of this study is that transcranial magnetic neuromodulation can correct&#xD;
      the symptoms of hypersensitivity and bladder pain. The investigators assume that under the&#xD;
      influence of transcranial magnetic stimulation, both the subjective state of patients&#xD;
      assessed by standardized questionnaires and the objective parameters assessed by invasive and&#xD;
      non-invasive urodynamic studies will be improved. In this study, two protocols for magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation of the supplementary motor area (SMA) will be compared with each other and with&#xD;
      placebo. The investigators expect to determine the dependence of the therapeutic effect on&#xD;
      the applied stimulation protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that the use of the magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      method SMA in patients with symptoms of bladder hypersensitivity and bladder pain will help&#xD;
      to reduce the clinical and urodynamic signs of these pathological conditions.&#xD;

    <measure>VAPS change score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 12, 24, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VAPS is a continuous scale in the form of a horizontal or 10 cm (100 mm) long and located on it with two extreme points &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;the strongest pain that can be imagined</description>

    <measure>OAB-Q SF change score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 12, 24, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individual participant change score on the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire short-form (OAB-q SF) will be compared between the two cohorts by student's t-test. The OAB-q SF is utilized to assess the impact of OAB symptoms on the patient's life, and has been shown to be responsive to reductions in urinary urgency, frequency and incontinence during transvertebral magnetic neuromodulation therapy. The OAB-q SF questionnaire consists of 19 items divided into a 6-item symptom severity (SS) scale and a 13-item health-related quality of life (HRQL) scale, with both scales ranging from 0 to 100. For the OAB-q SS scale a higher score indicates worse symptom severity while for the OAB-q HRQL scale a higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 12, 24, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) consists of 14 questions: 7 questions assessing anxiety and 7 questions assessing the presence of depression.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change baseline of micturition episodes per day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 12, 24, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients should document how many times they go to the restroom during the day and at night, as well as the loss of urine in stressful situations (coughing, sneezing, laughter, squatting, weightlifting, walking, running), changing liner or absorbent and episodes of urgency and urgency-incontinence. The journal shall be held for a consecutive period of 24 hours, for a minimum of three consecutive days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of urodynamic parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 12, 24, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoints were evaluated using invasive and non-invasive urodynamic studies: uroflowmetry, filling cystometry, and pressure/flow studies. Invasive urodynamic studies will be performed using a transurethral catheter with 3 lumen transurethral catheter in the bladder and a balloon catheter installed in the vagina or rectum to measure abdominal pressure. The rate of filling the bladder is 30 ml/min in the patient's sitting position on the uroflowmetric chair.</description>

Navigation will be carried out through the use of the international system &quot;10-20%&quot;. The threshold of motor response will be determined by stimulating the motor area of the legs with the intensity of stimulation necessary to trigger a motor response with an amplitude of more than 50 mv.</description>
