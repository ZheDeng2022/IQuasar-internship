      The goal of this project is to strengthen residual corticospinal tract (CST) connections&#xD;
      after partial injury using combined motor cortex and spinal cord stimulation to improve arm&#xD;
      and hand function after spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, the investigators will test the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) with transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic cervical SCI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For people with cervical SCI, regaining hand function is their highest priority. Most SCIs&#xD;
      are motor incomplete, and even when complete, there is often significant amounts of spared&#xD;
      spinal cord white matter. The goal of this project is to strengthen residual corticospinal&#xD;
      tract (CST) connections after partial injury using combined motor cortex and spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation to improve arm and hand function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team's research in rats, which has been refined in over a decade of study, demonstrates&#xD;
      that brain and spinal cord stimulation fully restores motor skills in rats after CST injury.&#xD;
      Most significant for the population of people living with SCI, this approach is effective in&#xD;
      the chronic phase of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators translated this electrical stimulation protocol into one that can&#xD;
      be rapidly translated into people using non-invasive techniques. In rats, combined electrical&#xD;
      intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) of motor cortex with transcutaneous spinal direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (tsDCS) activates the cervical spinal cord. This protocol, which is&#xD;
      administered only 30 minutes a day for 10 days, causes large-scale sprouting of CST&#xD;
      connections and full recovery of forelimb function. Thus, by combining brain and spinal cord&#xD;
      electrical stimulation in rodents with corticospinal system injury durable CST axonal&#xD;
      sprouting, strengthening of CST connections, and recovery is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, the investigators intend to bring this promising therapeutic approach to&#xD;
      humans with cervical SCI. The team will study people with chronic, motor incomplete, SCI to&#xD;
      test the safety and feasibility of this approach. The investigators' approach is non-invasive&#xD;
      and, if shown to be effective, can be rapidly integrated into current clinical practice to&#xD;
      help restore hand function in people with chronic SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo four stimulation sessions of 4 hours or less. Outcomes focus on&#xD;
      safety and neurophysiological transmission. The first session is used to determine the target&#xD;
      muscle, optimal scalp site for TMS stimulation, assess cervical tsDCS tolerability, and&#xD;
      measure maximal contraction force of the fingers, wrist, and elbow. The second through fourth&#xD;
      sessions will assess the acute tolerability and effects of tsDCS with different intensities&#xD;
      and electrode configurations in a randomized order. Each session will test a different&#xD;
      electrode configuration and will be divided into two stages. The first stage will randomly&#xD;
      deliver three 5-minute blocks of tsDCS at different randomized intensities (100%, 66% and 0%&#xD;
      (sham) of tolerated intensity, as determined in Session 1) and assess changes in&#xD;
      corticospinal and spinal excitability in response to TMS and peripheral nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (PNS) of the target muscle. The second stage will assess the acute effects of 20-minutes of&#xD;
      tsDCS delivered at two thirds the maximal tolerability on TMS- and PNS-evoked responses and&#xD;
      performance of a motor task. Safety and tolerability will be closely monitored at all times.&#xD;
