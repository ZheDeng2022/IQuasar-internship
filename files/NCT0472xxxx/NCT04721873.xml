  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20-40% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are obese. The investigators&#xD;
      have demonstrated that obesity adversely impacts disease course in patients with UC, leading&#xD;
      to higher risk of persistently active disease, surgery, hospitalization, and treatment&#xD;
      failure, particularly in biologic-treated patients. Intentional weight loss is effective in&#xD;
      improving disease outcomes in patients with inflammatory arthritis, but there is limited data&#xD;
      on its impact in UC. While dietary interventions for weight loss have limited efficacy and&#xD;
      endoscopic bariatric interventions may be too invasive in patients with UC with active&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, pharmacological weight loss with a highly effective oral agent may&#xD;
      be a novel strategy to induce weight loss and augment the efficacy of biologic therapy in UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators are conducting a pilot, phase 2A, 22-week, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial of phentermine-topiramate in obese patients with active UC&#xD;
      starting on a new biologic agent (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to (1) evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      phentermine-topiramate, and (2) to assess the impact of pharmacological weight loss on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, inflammatory burden and biologic trough concentration in patients with UC.&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that phentermine-topiramate will be safe, effective, and well&#xD;
      tolerated in patients with UC, and weight loss would achieve higher rates of clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical remission, and higher biologic trough concentration.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be randomized to either once-daily, oral phentermine-topiramate 15-92mg or placebo, in a 1:1 fashion, for 22 weeks, with clinic visits with an obesity medicine specialist, for intensive counseling for diet and lifestyle intervention. All patients will be dose-titrated within the first 4 weeks, starting at phentermine-topiramate 3.75-23mg, or placebo. Dose titration will be performed as follows 3.75-23mg x 1 week --&gt; 7.5-46mg x 1 week --&gt; 11.25-69mg x 1 week --&gt; 15-92mg. Patients who experience side effects would undergo slower titration, and dose would be down-titrated and capped at highest tolerated dose.</description>
