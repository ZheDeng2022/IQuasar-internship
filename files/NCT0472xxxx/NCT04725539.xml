  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mountain sport activities as for example hiking or skiing may involve the risk of adverse&#xD;
      health events especially in older people not accustomed to the specific mountain sport at&#xD;
      altitude or people with pre-existing health issues. Increased activation of the sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system and abrupt changes in heart rate and blood pressure are thought to trigger&#xD;
      these adverse effects. Preventive measures include regular physical activity (i.e. training)&#xD;
      and adequate medical treatment. Hypoxia pre-adaptation (e.g., pre-adapt one night at moderate&#xD;
      altitude) and pre-conditioning (e.g., intermittent hypoxia (IH) training), which was shown to&#xD;
      lead to some favorable sympathetic nervous system, ventilatory and metabolic adaptations and&#xD;
      additionally exerts anti-inflammatory action, could be hypothesized of being a further&#xD;
      preventive measure. The aim of this research project is to investigate whether intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia pre-conditioning or sleeping one night at altitude (i.e., current recommendation&#xD;
      before practicing mountain leisure sports in the elderly) is able to increase oxygen&#xD;
      saturation during passive hypoxia exposure and during simulated hiking and skiing at&#xD;
      altitude. Additionally, it is aimed to investigate whether such procedure reduces the&#xD;
      physiological responses (i.e., heart rate, its variability and blood pressure (including&#xD;
      baroreflex sensitivity) responses as well as metabolic, ventilatory, inflammatory and redox&#xD;
      responses) during these activities.&#xD;
