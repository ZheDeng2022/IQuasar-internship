    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the incidences of psychiatric symptoms (example,&#xD;
      hallucinations), somnolence and sudden onset of sleep, dyskinesia, and retinal&#xD;
      degeneration-related events during treatment with Equfina in participants with parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (including participants with hepatic impairment).&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The numbers of participants based on the types of ADRs and AEs will be calculated. Number of participants with serious ADRs and serious AEs will be calculated. The numbers of participants based on the types of serious ADRs and serious AEs will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Incidence Rate of ADRs Based on Baseline Characteristics of the Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Factors affecting safety will be investigated. Investigation for any association with various factors are to be performed employing appropriate analytical methods (example, logistic regression analysis). The factors include: gender, age, inpatient/outpatient status, duration of the disease, severity of Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr scale), presence/absence and details of psychiatric symptoms, severity of hepatic impairment, comorbidities, presence/absence of surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease, presence/absence of comorbid retinal pathology, history of drug allergy, presence/absence of pregnancy/breast-feeding (for females only), and history of smoking.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease After the Start of Treatment with Equfina</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Parkinson's disease motor examination will be performed using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III, motor signs of parkinson's disease during &quot;ON&quot; time will be evaluated. It contains following items: (1) speech, (2) facial expression, (3) tremor at rest, (4) action or postural tremor of hands, (5) rigidity, (6) finger taps, (7) hand movements, (8) pronation-supinational movements of hands, (9) leg agility, (9) arising from chair, (10) posture, (11) gait, (12) postural stability, (13) body bradykinesia and hypokinesia. Each item is rated on a 5-point likert scale of 0 to 4: 0=normal, 1=slight, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe. Higher the score the greater will be the severity.</description>
