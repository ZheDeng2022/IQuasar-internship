      In laparoscopic cholecystectomy method, Insufflation of CO2 in abdominal cavity causes&#xD;
      positioning of the diaphragm upwards, a decrease in lung's volume and its compliance, an&#xD;
      increase in the airway resistance, mismatch between the atelectasis and the ventilation&#xD;
      perfusion. Although there are numerous studies in laparoscopic surgery, only a few of them&#xD;
      investigate the effects of laparoscopic surgery on the cardiopulmonary and the respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics. The investigator aimed To examine the effects of pressure-controlled and&#xD;
      volume-controlled ventilation modes on cerebral oximetry and blood gases in laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy operations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the laparoscopic methods have been introduced to the surgical operations, laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy has become the golden standard in gall bladder surgical treatments. In this&#xD;
      method, carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneum method is used to achieve the desired surgical&#xD;
      and visual conditions. Alongside the advantages of the Laparoscopic cholecystectomy method&#xD;
      (e.g. shortening the patient's length of stay at the hospital, minimal postoperative pain and&#xD;
      rapid recovery), it has various intraabdominal pressure related systemic disadvantages .&#xD;
      Insufflation of CO2 in abdominal cavity causes positioning of the diaphragm upwards, a&#xD;
      decrease in lung's volume and its compliance, an increase in the airway resistance, mismatch&#xD;
      between the atelectasis and the ventilation perfusion. Various ventilation strategies have&#xD;
      been introduced to increase arterial oxygenation, functional residual capacity (FRC), and the&#xD;
      lung compliance. Recent studies; demonstrates that pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      is superior to volume-controlled mechanical ventilation in providing arterial and tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are numerous studies in laparoscopic surgery, only a few of them investigate&#xD;
      the effects of laparoscopic surgery on the cardiopulmonary and the respiratory mechanics.&#xD;
      Several experimental and clinical studies describe that the cardiovascular effects of the&#xD;
      high intraabdominal pressure and the CO2 insufflation is complex. In fact, the results are&#xD;
      linked to the studied patients' population, the lung's position and its volume. As it is&#xD;
      known in laparoscopic surgeries, the oxygenation in cerebral tissue decreases as the&#xD;
      intraabdominal pressure increases. At present, bispectral index (BIS), electroencephalography&#xD;
      (EEG), auditory evoke potential (AEP) (and several others) and functional NIRS (fNIRS) are&#xD;
      used to measure cerebral oxygenation and anaesthetic depth. NIRS monitorisation makes use of&#xD;
      the combined effects of the transmission, the reflection, the dispersion, and the absorption&#xD;
      of light. It can also measure the oxygen saturation in tissues that does not have pulsatile&#xD;
      circulation. The investigator aimed To examine the effects of pressure-controlled and&#xD;
      volume-controlled ventilation modes on cerebral oximetry and blood gases in laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy operations.&#xD;
