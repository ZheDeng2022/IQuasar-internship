      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and the efficacy of an hydrogel (double&#xD;
      cross-link microgel - DXM) injection into the intervertebral disc (IVD) space in patients&#xD;
      with painful lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD) over 24 to 48 weeks.&#xD;

      After being informed of the study and the potential risks, all patients matching the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and who have given their written consent will undergo a gel injection at&#xD;
      day 0 after a period of screening of up to 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, they will be followed-up for a variable period according to the cohort :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  first cohort of 5 patients with only one disc to be treated will be followed during 48&#xD;
           weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  second cohort of 5 patients with 2 discs to be treated will be followed during 36 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  third cohort of 10 patients with 1 or 2 discs to be treated will be followed during 24&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an adaptative-design, interventional, open-label, single-arm trial performed at a single centre in France.&#xD;
3 cohorts will be sequentially initiated according to the DSMB review of the safety parameters :&#xD;
The safety primary endpoints of each cohort will be assessed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) at Day 42 post-injection to provide safety oversight on the patients and guidance on initiating the study on the next cohort.&#xD;
Patients will be injected at day 0 and will be followed-up for a variable period according to the cohort.&#xD;
As the first enrolled cohort, the 1L cohort will have the longest follow-up (48 weeks) and will attend 9 visits.&#xD;
The second cohort (2L) will have a shorter follow-up period (36 weeks) attend the same visits except for V9, which will not be done.&#xD;
The third cohort (1-2L) will will have the shorter follow-up period (24 weeks) and will attend visits 1 to 7 except for V4, which will not be done.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient exposed to a medical device and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this medical device.&#xD;
An AE can therefore be any unintended disease or injury or clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, users or other persons whether or not considered related to the investigational medical device.&#xD;
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that:&#xD;
led to a death, injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function;&#xD;
led to a serious deterioration in health of the subject, that either resulted in: a life-threatening illness or injury, or a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness&#xD;
led to foetal distress, foetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.</description>

    <description>The ODI score is based on a self-completed questionnaire of 10 items to measure a patient's permanent functional disability. It is a well-recognised, gold standard orthopaedic score devised in 1980 and which still remains the best and most reliable measure of the overall impact of spinal disease associated with low back pain and any interventions patients may receive. It has been repeatedly used for natural history studies, cohort studies, and for many device and surgery interventions. It is reproducible, reliable and responsive to therapeutic interventions.</description>

    <description>DXM hydrogel is a pH responsive Double Cross-Linked microgel based on single internally cross-linked microspheres (comprising a methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate copolymer)&#xD;
The DXM gel is injected into the intervertebral disc (IVD) space via a standardised procedure similar to the routinely-performed Discography procedure. The disc approach described in the discography procedure has been reported to allow the injection of a solution in the centre of the disc. The injection of the gel takes about 2 min.</description>
