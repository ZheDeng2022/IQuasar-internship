  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies may be born appropriately grown for gestational age (AGA, &gt;10th centile) or small for&#xD;
      gestational age (SGA, &lt;10th centile). Babies who are SGA and have evidence in utero of&#xD;
      vascular compromise using antenatal doppler indices are classified as having fetal growth&#xD;
      restriction (FGR). Babies with FGR are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adult&#xD;
      life. Increased arterial stiffness and intima-media thickness are thought to mediate this&#xD;
      risk in adults. It is not known how early in life these changes can be robustly detected. In&#xD;
      addition, very little is known generally about how babies' hearts and arteries change in&#xD;
      structure and function over the first year of life, whether affected by SGA or not. This&#xD;
      study aims to understand if there are differences in cardiac and arterial structure and&#xD;
      function between babies born AGA or SGA. Within the group of SGA babies, the study team will&#xD;
      investigate whether FGR and maternal pre-eclampsia influence these measurements. The effects&#xD;
      gestational age on these parameters will be studied within all groups: half of the babies&#xD;
      recruited will be &lt;32 weeks gestational age (GA), and half will be ≥32 weeks GA. Study&#xD;
      participants will have further measurements at 3-6 months of life to assess if cardiac and&#xD;
      arterial structure and function change in babies over the first year of life. The study team&#xD;
      will use the Vicorder device to measure arterial stiffness, and assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      using this device in neonates. The Vicorder will also be used to measure cardiac output. The&#xD;
      feasibility and validity of this device for this purpose will be investigated (Vicorder is&#xD;
      not validated for cardiac output measurement in infants). Vicorder cardiac output results&#xD;
      will be compared to echocardiography and bioimpedence technology (using the NICaS monitor).&#xD;
      The study team will use ultrasound for arterial structure measurements of the carotid artery&#xD;
      and aorta.&#xD;
