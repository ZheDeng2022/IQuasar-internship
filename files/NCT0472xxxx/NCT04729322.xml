    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of fecal microbiota transplant and re-introduction of&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) in treating anti-PD-1 non-responders with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplants contain the normal bacteria and viruses found in fecal (stool) material.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Giving pembrolizumab or nivolumab with fecal microbiota transplants may help&#xD;
      to control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab or nivolumab in conjunction with fecal&#xD;
      microbiota transplant (FMT) from PD-1 responding mismatch-repair deficiency (dMMR) colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (CRC) patients for treatment of PD-1 non-responding dMMR CRC patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive metronidazole orally (PO) every 8 hours (Q8H) on days -14 to -8 and then&#xD;
      vancomycin PO every 6 hours (Q6H) and neomycin PO Q6H on days -8 to -6. Patients then undergo&#xD;
      colonoscopic FMT on day -5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are then assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Patients also receive fecal microbiota transplantation capsule PO on days 1, 8, and 15&#xD;
      of cycle 1. Beginning in cycle 2, patients receive fecal microbiota transplantation capsule&#xD;
      PO on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 6 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients&#xD;
      also receive fecal microbiota transplantation capsule PO on days 1 and 8 of cycles 1-2.&#xD;
      Beginning in cycle 4, patients receive fecal microbiota transplantation capsule PO on day 1&#xD;
      of every other cycle. Cycles repeat every 14 days for up to 6 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 24&#xD;
      weeks for up to 3 years.&#xD;
