  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease and essential tremor are chronic movement disorders for which there is no&#xD;
      cure. When medication is no longer effective, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is recommended.&#xD;
      Standard DBS is a neuromodulation method that uses a simple monophasic pulse, delivered from&#xD;
      an electrode to stimulate neurons in a target brain area. This monophasic pulse spreads out&#xD;
      from the electrode creating a broad, electric field that stimulates a large neural&#xD;
      population. This can often effectively reduce motor symptoms. However, many DBS patients&#xD;
      experience side effects - caused by stimulation of non-target neurons - and suboptimal&#xD;
      symptom control - caused by inadequate stimulation of the correct neural target. The ability&#xD;
      to carefully manipulate the stimulating electric field to target specific neural&#xD;
      subpopulations could solve these problems and improve patient outcomes. The use of complex&#xD;
      pulse shapes, specifically biphasic pulses and asymmetric pre-pulses, can control the&#xD;
      temporal properties of the stimulation field. Evidence suggests that temporal manipulations&#xD;
      of the stimulation field can exploit biophysical differences in neurons to target specific&#xD;
      subpopulations. Therefore, our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of complex pulse shapes&#xD;
      to reduce side effects and improve symptom control in DBS movement patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study had three stages. In the first stage, a wide range of investigatory pulse shapes in&#xD;
      a small number of patients. The effect of the pulses on the therapeutic window will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 will perform a short-term chronic evaluation in a larger number of patients of the&#xD;
      complex pulse shape selected as most interesting from stage 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ET patients will first be assessed after 3 hours of the cathodic or complex pulse&#xD;
           (double-blind design).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD patients will only be assessed after 1 week of each pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 will then focus on long-term evaluation (upto 2 years). Outcomes: see stage 2.&#xD;
