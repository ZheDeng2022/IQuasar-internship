    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts many aspects of life, including the loss of volitional&#xD;
      movement and involuntary control of bodily functions; both crucial functional recovery&#xD;
      priorities for this population. Mobility impairments and secondary complications limit an&#xD;
      individual's ability to exercise, a behavior known to have wide-ranging functional and health&#xD;
      benefits. This trial will investigate whether activity-based therapy (ABT), using a robotic&#xD;
      exoskeleton, can change the strength of signals from the brain that control volitional&#xD;
      movement, leading to improvements in standing and seated balance as well as other important&#xD;
      involuntary bodily (i.e. cardiovascular, urinary tract, bowel and sexual) functions. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to determine whether these improvements can be augmented with the addition&#xD;
      of non-invasive transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (TCSCS). This therapy has been shown&#xD;
      to re-awaken dormant spinal circuits. In this randomized controlled trial, TCSCS with ABT,&#xD;
      using robotic-assisted gait training (three sessions/week for twelve weeks), will be compared&#xD;
      to ABT+SHAM in individuals with chronic motor-complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Those in the&#xD;
      ABT+SHAM group will be given the option to complete an ABT+TCSCS open-label follow-up. Before&#xD;
      and after training, the following outcomes will be assessed by validated methods:&#xD;
      corticospinal excitability, motor function, and seated and standing balance (Hypothesis 1 -&#xD;
      Motor Function); severity and frequency of blood pressure instability, urinary tract, bowel,&#xD;
      and sexual dysfunctions (Hypothesis 2 - Autonomic Functions); and general health (Hypothesis&#xD;
      3 - Quality of Life). This collaborative project is between consumers with SCI and&#xD;
      clinicians/scientists with expertise in SCI care (kinesiologists, physiotherapists,&#xD;
      physiatrists, sexual health clinicians). Compared to ABT alone, the investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that ABT+TCSCS will result in superior improvements in motor and autonomic functions in&#xD;
      individuals with SCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe disorder resulting in not only in motor deficits (i.e.&#xD;
      paralysis) but also a myriad of autonomic dysfunctions (i.e. urinary tract/bowel/sexual&#xD;
      impairments and blood pressure instability). The restoration of motor as well as autonomic&#xD;
      functions remains among the top priorities for individuals with SCI. Individuals with SCI&#xD;
      develop cardiovascular (CV) disease at a younger age and at greater rates than individuals&#xD;
      without injury. Both low levels of physical activity and profound blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      instability, commonly experienced by individuals with injuries at or above the sixth thoracic&#xD;
      level, likely explains the heightened risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurogenic lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction impacts over 90% of individuals with SCI.&#xD;
      This dysfunction leads to vesico-ureteral-renal reflux, urinary tract infections, bladder&#xD;
      stone formation, and impaired renal function - ultimately leading to significant disease&#xD;
      burden and poorer health-related quality of life. Bowel function is also significantly&#xD;
      compromised after SCI, presenting as constipation, impaired colonic motility and loss of&#xD;
      volitional control resulting in episodes of fecal incontinence - predisposing an individual&#xD;
      to increased risk of long-term complications. Over 60% report that bowel dysfunction&#xD;
      adversely impacts quality of life. Lastly, severe impairments in sexual function following&#xD;
      SCI include erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders/ anejaculation in men and reduced&#xD;
      vaginal lubrication in women, with both sexes experiencing orgasmic difficulties or&#xD;
      anorgasmia as well as alterations in sexual drive and sexual satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity-based therapy (ABT) is a common and an effective means to improve walking function&#xD;
      post-injury and can facilitate general health maintenance; this includes an enhancement of&#xD;
      neural BP control, as well as bladder, bowel, and sexual functions. The more recent&#xD;
      development of robotic-assisted gait training (e.g. Lokomat) in contrast to labor-intensive&#xD;
      manually assisted therapeutic strategies also reduces the load on therapists and health care&#xD;
      expenditures. The Lokomat is a computer-controlled rehabilitation system for walking that&#xD;
      consists of a pair of robotic legs to which an participant's thighs and legs are strapped.&#xD;
      This device provides full assistance for the legs to go through the motion of walking with&#xD;
      hip and knee motors. An over-head harness system holds the participant's body-weight above&#xD;
      the treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromodulation, potentially activating isolated spinal cord neuronal circuitry, has received&#xD;
      significant recognition in recent years as a promising approach to target various&#xD;
      neurological dysfunctions. The immense therapeutic potential of epidural spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation demonstrates mitigation of spasticity in individuals with motor-incomplete&#xD;
      injuries. Moreover, this stimulation improved standing ability, ability to generate rhythmic,&#xD;
      locomotor-like limb movements, and restored voluntary control of functional movements in&#xD;
      individuals with motor-complete injuries. Our past exciting and ground-breaking pilot work&#xD;
      highlights the capacity for TCSCS to modulate spinal circuits (An Autonomic Neuroprosthesis:&#xD;
      Noninvasive Electrical Spinal Cord Stimulation Restores Autonomic Cardiovascular Function in&#xD;
      Individuals with Spinal Cord Injury. J Neurotrauma. 2018;35(3):446- 451.&#xD;
      doi:10.1089/neu.2017.5082). To administer TCSCS, small adhesive electrodes are placed on the&#xD;
      skin around the spinal cord and hips. The electrodes are connected to a machine that&#xD;
      generates a small electric current. After turning the machine on, the participant may feel a&#xD;
      small electric current under the electrodes, though it should not elicit any pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite literature supporting the benefits of TCSCS and ABT, the effects of pairing TCSCS&#xD;
      with ABT is largely unknown. These therapies are adaptable, non-invasive, and relatively&#xD;
      affordable, with the potential to simultaneously benefit both motor and autonomic functions.&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trials are needed to better validate these interventions for clinical&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor paralysis and autonomic dysfunctions have been identified as a major priority for&#xD;
      recovery by individuals with SCI. Addressing these dysfunctions may ultimately translate to&#xD;
      improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The use of ABT with non-invasive and&#xD;
      adaptable TCSCS has the potential to reduce CV disease risk factors and other autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunctions in this at-risk population.&#xD;

    <description>Using the Lokomat exoskeleton by Hocoma, all participants (both arms) will train 3 times per week for 12 weeks with a target to reach 20 minutes of balance training and 30 minutes of gait training in each session.&#xD;
For balance training, participants will be asked to attempt to stand to the best of their ability without relying on the Lokomat's structural support. Sensors built into the Lokomat will capture pressure the participant is applying to the joints and provide visual feedback for how much they are relying on the device for support. Will be done in 5-minute bouts with 1-minute rest inbetween.&#xD;
For gait training, the Lokomat will provide participants with the complete walking assistance, but level of body weight support and speed of walking will be adjusted to allow the person to bear as much weight as possible while maintaining proper stance limb kinematics.</description>
