      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the baseline muscle mass as a predictive biomarker of&#xD;
      treatment response in patients with recurrence or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      head and the neck (SCCHN) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body composition including sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass), sarcopenic obesity, and&#xD;
      mioesteaosis has been well reported to be an independent predictors of mortality, toxicity,&#xD;
      and complications in cancer patients with different locations and treatments. However, there&#xD;
      are currently no data on impact of body composition and the oncological outcomes in SCCHN&#xD;
      patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) due to recurrence or metastasic&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
