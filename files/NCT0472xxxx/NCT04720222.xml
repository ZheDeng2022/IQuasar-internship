  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an explorative, monocentric, feasibility study to evaluate the detectability of the&#xD;
      bladder in healthy subjects by ultrasound monitoring with the early prototype of a future&#xD;
      bladder sensor, which is intended for use for an individual suffering from urinary&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation with healthy subjects (defined as subjects without&#xD;
      urological problems or lower urinary tract symptoms, assured by pre-defined inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria) is to collect raw measurement data of the urinary bladder region of&#xD;
      volunteers with the TENA-PROTO1, in multiple postural positions to evaluate the detectability&#xD;
      of the bladder in the intended users and to determine the position criteria for the (future)&#xD;
      ultrasound sensor on the lower abdomen. Secondarily, this clinical investigation aims to&#xD;
      collect data on the adhesive and supportive belt used to fix the transducer assembly to the&#xD;
      lower abdomen by the subject. Furthermore, safety of the subjects will be continously&#xD;
      documented such as adverse events (AE) and device deficiencies (DD); AEs, Adverse Device&#xD;
      Events (ADE), Severe Adverse Events (SAE), Severe Adverse Device effects (SADE),&#xD;
      Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects (USADE) and DDs.&#xD;
