      Traditional management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) relies on the prompt&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common bacterial infections and a&#xD;
      leading cause of death globally since many patients deteriorate into sepsis and organ&#xD;
      dysfunction. Traditional management relies on the prompt administration of antimicrobials&#xD;
      that target the most common causative pathogens namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma&#xD;
      pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Although there was some&#xD;
      hesitancy in the former guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and&#xD;
      of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) to suggest a clear-cut role of macrolides for the&#xD;
      management of CAP, the new guidelines published by the ATS in 2019 clearly suggest for the&#xD;
      management of all cases of CAP either treated as out-patients or as in-patients with a&#xD;
      combination of β-lactam with macrolides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shift in the position of ATS expressed in the 2019 guidelines is coming from the growing&#xD;
      body of evidence that the addition of a macrolide in the treatment regimen of CAP is&#xD;
      accompanied by considerable survival benefit. This finding is mainly coming from the&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of observational clinical studies in CAP. Results were also supported&#xD;
      by the meta-analysis of these studies . Superiority coming from the macrolide use is mainly&#xD;
      shown in cases of severe CAP i.e. situations with pneumonia severity index (PSI) greater than&#xD;
      2 that are most commonly caused by S.pneumoniae. The proposed benefit of macrolides is coming&#xD;
      from their anti-inflammatory mode of action. This statement generates two main questions: a)&#xD;
      what an anti-inflammatory mode of action consists of in the clinical setting; and b) is this&#xD;
      a common property for all macrolides? Although it is easy to suggest that an antimicrobial&#xD;
      modulates immune responses in vitro, it is extremely difficult to prove this in vivo. The&#xD;
      main hurdle is coming from the fact that it is difficult to decipher to what extent clinical&#xD;
      benefit is coming from the antimicrobial effect per se and to what extent this is due to&#xD;
      modulation of the immune responses. In other terms, an anti-inflammatory effect is better&#xD;
      shown in infections caused by pathogens that do not belong to the antimicrobial spectrum of&#xD;
      macrolides. Our group has conducted two large scale randomized clinical trials (RCTs) where&#xD;
      clarithromycin was co-administered intravenously along with β-lactams in either patients with&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens or&#xD;
      patients with severe Gram-negative infections like acute pyelonephritis, intraabdominal&#xD;
      infections and primary Gram-negative bacteremia. The total number of patients enrolled in&#xD;
      both studies was 800 and isolated pathogens did not belong to the antimicrobial spectrum of&#xD;
      macrolides. Addition of clarithromycin provided overall survival benefit after 90-days in&#xD;
      patients with VAP (57% survival versus 40% of placebo-treated comparators). Mortality by&#xD;
      septic shock after 28-days was also considerably decreased in patients with severe&#xD;
      Gram-negative infections (53.1% versus 73.1% of the comparators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these findings point towards an anti-inflammatory mode of action of clarithromycin,&#xD;
      they do not necessarily imply that a survival benefit similar to Gram-negative infections&#xD;
      will apply in CAP. There is only one RCT to test the anti-inflammatory effect of&#xD;
      clarithromycin in patients with CAP. This RCT was designed for non-inferiority and randomized&#xD;
      patients were allocated into single β-lactam treatment or the combination with oral&#xD;
      clarithromycin. The primary endpoint was clinical instability after seven days. Contrary to&#xD;
      what investigators were expecting this was shown in 41.2% of non-macrolide treated patients&#xD;
      and 33.6% of macrolide-treated patients (p: 0.070). It may be argued that if the study was&#xD;
      powered for superiority, the study primary endpoint would have shown benefit from the&#xD;
      addition of clarithromycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent publication coming from the research network of the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group&#xD;
      (HSSG) 130 patients with CAP were treated with a combination of β-lactam and clarithromycin.&#xD;
      They were compared with another 130 patients treated with a combination of β-lactam and&#xD;
      azithromycin, with 130 patients treated with respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy and with&#xD;
      130 treated with β-lactam monotherapy. The study has a case-matching design and selection of&#xD;
      cases of the three comparator groups were based on the group of patients treated with&#xD;
      clarithromycin. Matching selection criteria were severity as assessed by the severity score&#xD;
      of SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment), APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health&#xD;
      evaluation), PSI and CCI (Charlson's comorbidity index) and type of β-lactam. The 28-day&#xD;
      mortality of the four groups was 20.8%, 33.8%, 32.3% and 36.2% respectively, showing a&#xD;
      profound survival benefit with the intake of clarithromycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above analysis, it seems likely that an RCT that proves the attenuation of the&#xD;
      high inflammatory burden of the host with CAP after addition of clarithromycin in the&#xD;
      treatment regimen is missing. The need for this RCT is outscored in the recent guidelines of&#xD;
      ATS . Such a type of RCT should take into consideration the SOFA score of the patients, the&#xD;
      presence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), the existence of elevated&#xD;
      procalcitonin (PCT) in serum and the outcome of patients infected by macrolide-resistant&#xD;
      S.pneumoniae. SOFA score is nowadays proposed as the sine qua non for severity. PCT more than&#xD;
      0.25 ng/ml is widely accepted as an index of systemic inflammation in the event of CAP to&#xD;
      such an extent that decrease more than 80% or to levels lower than 0.25 ng/ml can be used as&#xD;
      an index of therapy withdrawal. In such an RCT rapid resolution of the high inflammatory&#xD;
      burden of the host should be highlighted in the achievement of the early treatment response&#xD;
      of CAP after 72 hours that is recently appointed by the Food and Drug Administration and the&#xD;
      European Medicines Agency as the primary endpoint goal of CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an RCT that is aiming to prove that addition of oral clarithromycin to a β-lactam&#xD;
      rapidly attenuates the high inflammatory burden of the host in CAP.&#xD;
