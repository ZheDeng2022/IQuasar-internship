&#xD;
          -  Subjects must give their signed and dated written informed consent (in English) to&#xD;
             participate prior to commencing any study-related activities and must be willing to&#xD;
             comply with study procedures, study restrictions, study protocol, and return for the&#xD;
             required assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of either non-childbearing potential or of child-bearing potential who&#xD;
             commit to consistent and correct use of at least one highly effective or two effective&#xD;
             forms of contraception starting at least 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit and for&#xD;
             at least 30 days post last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Generally healthy subjects with mild controlled asthma for 2 years at Screening Visit&#xD;
             according to the Global Initiative for Asthma criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, neurologic,&#xD;
             hepatologic, endocrinologic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, autoimmune,&#xD;
             hematological, or metabolic disease other than asthma, which in the opinion of&#xD;
             Investigator may either put the subject at risk or influence the results during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin prick test to other perennial allergens (i.e., mold, dog with â‰¥ 3 mm&#xD;
             wheal compared to negative control). Subjects with seasonal allergy symptoms that&#xD;
             occur or are anticipated to occur during the study should result in subject exclusion&#xD;
             or rescheduling until the subject is out of the allergy season.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any relevant pulmonary disease within 1 year prior to dosing at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
