      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic or abdominal surgeries are followed by a shorter or longer period of immobilization&#xD;
      and after major surgery there is a higher risk of developing cardiorespiratory complications.&#xD;
      To prevent these complications, the patient is encouraged to change position and exercise in&#xD;
      bed, get out of bed as early and as much as possible after the operation and to breathe with&#xD;
      or without aids. There is no general definition of early mobilization and may start within a&#xD;
      few hours to a few days after surgery. There is currently a lack of knowledge nationally and&#xD;
      internationally about when the mobilization starts and what it contains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients also receive breathing training in connection with the surgery. There is&#xD;
      currently no consensus on which method is preferable for which groups of patients. There are&#xD;
      similarities and differences in practice in the world regarding postoperative breathing&#xD;
      training. There are studies that have mapped practice after primarily thoracic surgery but&#xD;
      also abdominal surgery. However, there are no studies that have mapped when the prescribed&#xD;
      breathing training starts after different types of operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to map when mobilization and breathing training starts after&#xD;
      abdominal and thoracic surgery and what is then performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The study will be carried out as a quality follow-up with mapping of practice.&#xD;
      Patients ≥ 18 years of age who are undergoing a planned or acute open, keyhole or&#xD;
      robot-assisted surgery, who are extubated and who breathe spontaneously will be included.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are completed plastic, trauma, orthopedic or transplant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The material will be recruited from Swedish university hospitals and county hospitals for 20&#xD;
      days of surgery (Monday through Thursday) for five consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical benefit The study will mean that clinical practice is presented which, with regard&#xD;
      to mobilization, is the first study ever that will present when this takes place and what is&#xD;
      done and, with regard to breathing training, the first that shows when this training is&#xD;
      initiated.&#xD;
