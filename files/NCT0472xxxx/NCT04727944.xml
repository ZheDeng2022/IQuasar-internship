  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The whole body's voluntary movements are controlled by the brain. One of the brain areas most&#xD;
      involved in controlling these voluntary movements is the motor cortex and it is often viewed&#xD;
      as the primary 'output' region of the neocortex. Motor cortical activity in the beta&#xD;
      frequency range (13-30Hz) is a hallmark signature of healthy and pathological movement, but&#xD;
      its behavioral relevance remains unclear. Such uncertainty confounds the development of&#xD;
      treatments for diseases of movement which are associated with pathophysiological beta&#xD;
      activity, including Parkinson's, therefore furthering understanding on the behavioral&#xD;
      significance of activity in this range is now vital. Recently, it has become apparent that&#xD;
      oscillatory beta activity actually occurs in discrete transient bursts, and that the&#xD;
      summation of short-lasting, high-powered bursts of activity only appear to be sustained&#xD;
      oscillations when averaged over multiple trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will use neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques such as&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI). All of these techniques have been identified as non-invasive techniques. By applying&#xD;
      these methods, we will be able to analyze beta burst activity in order to determine how beta&#xD;
      bursts influence naturalistic motor behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to get a better understanding of the role of motor-related beta&#xD;
      activity during the preparation and generation of reach and grasp actions. These findings may&#xD;
      inform novel treatments for pathophysiological disorders characterized by aberrant beta&#xD;
      signaling, utilizing causal manipulation of the neural circuits implicated in the generation&#xD;
      of beta activity. This project also has expected methodological repercussions. It will make&#xD;
      it possible to validate the use of individualized head-casts worn during MEG acquisition for&#xD;
      the study of the cortical control of naturalistic actions, and to create new analysis tools&#xD;
      that allow an increase in the spatial resolution of MEG data.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Reach and grasp tasks in healthy participants using MEG technique (Experiment 1)</intervention_name>
    <description>Human participants will perform reach and grasp movements to various objects (e.g. a cube, sphere, or rod) driven either by perceived action affordances, or instruction cues. A rotating carousel will be used to present subjects with various objects affording different types of grasps (e.g. a precision pinch, a whole hand 'power' grasp, or a tripod grasp).&#xD;
Prior to the experiment, subjects will be tested outside the scanner by asking them to grasp each object as they would naturally to ensure that each object elicits the expected grasp type. Subject-specific, 3D-printed head-casts will be created based on high resolution MRI scans from each subject, and worn by subjects during the MEG experiment (Experiment 1) to reduce within-session head movement associated with reaching and grasping.</description>
