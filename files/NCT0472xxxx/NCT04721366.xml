  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to learn if velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV) improves growth and&#xD;
      symptoms in participants under 5 years old with Gaucher disease. Symptoms will be checked&#xD;
      with blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about collecting data available in the participant's medical record as well as&#xD;
      data from each participant's ongoing treatment. No study medicines will be provided to&#xD;
      participants in this study. The study sponsor will not be involved in how participants are&#xD;
      treated but will provide instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the participants start the study, they will visit the study clinic every 6 months after&#xD;
      their first visit.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any event that results in: death; life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; a congenital anomaly/birth defect or a medically important event. AEs include SAEs, non-serious AEs.</description>
