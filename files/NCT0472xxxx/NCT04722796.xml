      To compare supra-annular sizing and THV implantation technique (Hangzhou solution) versus&#xD;
      annular sizing and THV implantation technique (control group) in bicuspid aortic stenosis&#xD;
      (AS) patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with self-expanding&#xD;
      valves (SEVs): a randomized superiority trial&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a favorable alternative for&#xD;
      severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) patients from low to high surgical risk. BAV patients&#xD;
      treated with TAVR had similar 30-day mortality as well as stroke and new pacemaker&#xD;
      implantation rates compared to TAV subjects, but carried higher risk of moderate/severe PVL,&#xD;
      conversion to surgery and device failure. Event rates significantly decreased with the use of&#xD;
      new-generation devices, but TAVR still showed better procedural results in TAV compared to&#xD;
      BAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical experience in China suggests bicuspid aortic valves and heavy calcium burden are&#xD;
      more common among TAVR candidates. Morphological characteristics at supra-annular structure&#xD;
      (from annulus to the level of sinotubular junction) are quite complex in bicuspid AS,&#xD;
      especially concomitant with heavily calcified leaflets. Because only two leaflet hinge points&#xD;
      provide the definition of the annulus plane, current CT-based annulus measurements might not&#xD;
      be accurate under these circumstances. From previous single center clinical practice, &quot;waist&#xD;
      sign&quot; above the annulus during balloon aortic valvuloplasty in TAVR was often observed in&#xD;
      patients with bicuspid AS, indicating that the supra-annular structure may serve a key role&#xD;
      in anchoring the THV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we developed a balloon based supra-annular sizing strategy (Hangzhou Solution) for&#xD;
      SEV implantation in bicuspid AS. From our single center experience, the device success rate&#xD;
      and pacemaker implantation rate were relatively low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare supra-annular sizing and THV implantation technique&#xD;
      (Hangzhou solution) versus annular sizing and THV implantation technique (control group) in&#xD;
      bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement&#xD;
      (TAVR) with self-expanding valves (SEVs).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Six-Minute Walk Test is a submaximal exercise test that entails measurement of distance walked over a span of 6 minutes. The 6-minute walk test distance (6 MWD) provides a measure for integrated global response of multiple cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal systems involved in exercise.</description>
