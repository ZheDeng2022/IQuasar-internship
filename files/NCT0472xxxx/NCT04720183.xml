        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age (extremes included), on the date of&#xD;
             signing the informed consent form (ICF). Females should be of non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) c421C/C genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judged to be in good health by the investigator based upon the results of a medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and&#xD;
             fasting clinical laboratory safety tests, available at screening and prior to the&#xD;
             first sulfasalazine administration. Bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and&#xD;
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) must be no greater than 1.5x upper limit of normal&#xD;
             range (ULN). Other clinical laboratory safety test results must be within the&#xD;
             reference ranges or test results that are outside the reference ranges need to be&#xD;
             considered not clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This list only contains the key inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the investigational product (IP) (GLPG3970), or&#xD;
             sulfasalazine, or sulfa drugs, or to their ingredients, or history of a significant&#xD;
             allergic reaction to IP or sulfasalazine ingredients as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serology for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             (HCV) or history of hepatitis from any cause with the exception of hepatitis A that&#xD;
             was resolved at least 3 months prior to first dosing of sulfasalazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or a current immunosuppressive condition (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having any illness, judged by the investigator as clinically significant, in the 3&#xD;
             months prior to first dosing of sulfasalazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or sequelae of gastrointestinal, liver, kidney (estimated glomerular&#xD;
             filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;=90 mL/min/1.73 m2, using the Chronic Kidney Disease&#xD;
             Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula) or other conditions known to interfere&#xD;
             with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow acetylator genotype.&#xD;
