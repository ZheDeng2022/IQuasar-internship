  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a high rate of recurrence (60 to 70%) and&#xD;
      progression (20 to 30%) to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local immunotherapy (intra-vesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) following transurethral&#xD;
      resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT)) reduces significantly the risk of recurrence and&#xD;
      progression as compared to observation or to intra-vesical chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic immunotherapy with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) or Programmed cell Death 1&#xD;
      (PD1) inhibitors has shown major efficacy in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have progressed on platinum-based regimens of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, or even in front line setting. In the field of NMIBC, immunotherapy using PD-L1&#xD;
      or PD1 inhibitors is under investigation but the frequency of PD-L1 expression has rarely&#xD;
      been precisely described in the different subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the expression of PD-L1 by different&#xD;
      types of NMIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to characterize the immune contexture of NMIBC.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to characterize the immune contexture of NMIBC. The immunological&#xD;
      contexture of NMIBC in comparison with normal bladder tissue and invasive bladder cancer will&#xD;
      be deciphered. The objective is to determine immune signatures associated with response or&#xD;
      relapse/progression, with and without immune treatments in NMIBC.&#xD;
