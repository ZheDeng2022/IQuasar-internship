  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind study of PIPE-307 or placebo in normal healthy subjects.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three parts: Part 1 will be a Single Ascending Dose (SAD)&#xD;
      study enrolling approximately 48 subjects for a total duration of 6 weeks. Part 2 will be a&#xD;
      Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study enrolling approximately 24 subjects for a total duration&#xD;
      of 7 weeks, and part 3 will be a selected SAD cohort in a fed state to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      food on the bioavailability of PIPE-307, enrolling approximately 8 subjects from a selected&#xD;
      SAD cohort for a duration of 6 weeks.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blind study of PIPE-307 or placebo given as single and multiple&#xD;
      escalating doses in normal healthy subjects. The study will be conducted in three parts: Part&#xD;
      1 will be a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study enrolling approximately 48 subjects for a total&#xD;
      duration of 6 weeks. Part 2 will be a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study enrolling&#xD;
      approximately 24 subjects for a total duration of 7 weeks, and part 3 will be a selected SAD&#xD;
      cohort in a fed state to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of PIPE-307,&#xD;
      enrolling approximately 8 subjects from a selected SAD cohort for a duration of 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by periodic measurement of vital signs, physical examinations,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, blood laboratory analyses and occurrence of adverse events (AE).&#xD;

    <description>Cogstate tests have been designed, developed and validated to both identify and measure cognitive impairment, and to track or monitor cognitive changes. The tasks use novel visual and verbal stimuli to ensure assessment is cultural-neutral and not limited by a participant's level of education.</description>
