  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an in-vivo study to investigate the bioequivalence of generic tacrolimus and its&#xD;
      reference listed drug (RLD). The objective of this study is to investigate the bioequivalence&#xD;
      of generic Tacrolimus and RLD in healthy male and non-pregnant, non-lactating female&#xD;
      volunteers under fasting conditions. The outcome of this study will help further&#xD;
      understanding about pharmacokinetic (PK) performance of tacrolimus in a healthy volunteer&#xD;
      population and improve review standards for bioequivalence of narrow therapeutic index (NTI)&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, randomized, open-label, fully replicate crossover, four-period, two-&#xD;
      treatment, two-sequence, bioequivalence study to investigate the bioequivalence of generic&#xD;
      tacrolimus and its reference listed drug (RLD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), has been widely used in solid organ and bone&#xD;
      marrow transplants for more than two decades. Calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase,&#xD;
      is instrumental for signal transduction for activation of T cell and B cell, which in turn&#xD;
      cause production of autoinflammatory cytokines such as such as interleukin 2 (IL- 2), tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). CNIs prevents the&#xD;
      dephosphorylation and translocation of various factors such as the nuclear factor of&#xD;
      activated T-cells (NF-AT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells&#xD;
      (NF-κB), thereby inhibiting the signal transduction responsible for growth and proliferation&#xD;
      of activated T cells and expression of autoinflammatory cytokines. This mechanism of action&#xD;
      results in immunosuppression and prevents organ rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, therapeutic drug monitoring is required for tacrolimus since the range between&#xD;
      tacrolimus therapeutic and toxic tacrolimus whole blood concentrations is narrow and some&#xD;
      toxicities are serious and/or irreversible. The objective of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      bioequivalence of generic Tacrolimus and RLD in healthy male and non-pregnant, non-lactating&#xD;
      female volunteers under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of this study will help further understanding about pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      performance of tacrolimus in a healthy volunteer population and improve review standards for&#xD;
      bioequivalence of narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs.&#xD;
