      This study aims to identify factors affecting dialysis recovery time and the relation between&#xD;
      dialysis recovery time and quality of life in hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis is defined as the diffusion of molecules in solution across a semipermeable membrane&#xD;
      along an electrochemical concentration gradient. The primary goal of hemodialysis (HD) is to&#xD;
      restore the intracellular and extracellular fluid environment that is characteristic of&#xD;
      normal kidney function. In addition to diffusion, solutes may pass through pores in the&#xD;
      membrane by means of a convective process driven by hydrostatic or osmotic pressure gradients&#xD;
      a process called ultrafiltration. During ultrafiltration, there is no change in solute&#xD;
      concentrations; its primary purpose is the removal of excess total body water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue is a well-known and frequent symptom in HD patients with a reported association with&#xD;
      the decrease in health-related quality of life commonly found in this population. The&#xD;
      prevalence of fatigue ranges from 60% to as high as 97% in patients on long-term renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy. Despite this fact, health care providers are still unaware of both its&#xD;
      presence and severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical assessment of fatigue in dialysis patient can be somehow difficult for the&#xD;
      treating physicians. Patients usually show diversity in their recovery from fatigue. However,&#xD;
      early recognition is essential because a number of treatable causes can be easily identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-HD fatigue is a common incapacitating symptom affecting renal population. It is defined&#xD;
      as a feeling of exhaustion that regularly follows each dialysis procedure. Uremia-related&#xD;
      factors such as anemia, nutritional deficiency and enhanced inflammatory state could possibly&#xD;
      lead to post-HD fatigue. In addition, the HD procedure itself including the efficiency of HD&#xD;
      session, type of dialyzer and ultrafiltration rate are potential exacerbating factors for&#xD;
      post-HD fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods have been proposed as a way to assess post-HD fatigue with the &quot;time to&#xD;
      recover (minutes) from HD&quot; being one of them. Lindsay et al. assisted patients' responses to&#xD;
      the single open-ended question, &quot;How long does it take you to recover from a dialysis&#xD;
      session?&quot;.Lindsay et al. found that post hemodialysis recovery time is an important indicator&#xD;
      for patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a critically important outcome for patients with&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The National Quality Forum selected the Kidney Disease&#xD;
      Quality of Life Short-Form survey (KDQOL™-36) as the tool of choice for assessing this&#xD;
      outcome in adult patients with ESRD; assessment is required within 4 months of initiating&#xD;
      dialysis, and annually thereafter. This 36-question survey instrument was published in 2000.&#xD;
      The KDQOL™-36 contains 5 subscales: the Physical Component Summary(PCS), Mental Component&#xD;
      Summary (MCS), Burden of Kidney Disease (BKD), Symptoms and Problems of Kidney Disease&#xD;
      (SPKD), and Effects of Kidney Disease (EKD). The first 2 subscales are a general measure of&#xD;
      HRQOL, whereas the last 3 assess issues specific to patients with ESRD or earlier stages of&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease.(15) The Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 36 (KDQOL-36)&#xD;
      provides accurate estimate for fatigue severity and was previously used in HD population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although post-HD fatigue commonly exists in dialysis patients, it is usually underestimated&#xD;
      by physicians. For this reason, appropriate and early identification of symptoms and&#xD;
      associated factors might improve the patient's quality of life. Extending the research in&#xD;
      this area will certainly be of great value to HD population.&#xD;
