    <textblock>
      Healthy for Two, Healthy for You (H42/H4U) is an innovative evidence-based&#xD;
      pregnancy/postpartum health coach intervention that is remotely-delivered (phone coaching&#xD;
      using motivational interviewing, web-based platform, mobile phone behavioral tracking). The&#xD;
      aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to embed H42/H4U into Johns Hopkins prenatal&#xD;
      care clinics that serve a racially and economically diverse population, leveraging existing&#xD;
      staff as trained health coaches to test its effectiveness and implementation. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that women in the H42/H4U arm will have lower gestational weight&#xD;
      gain and lower rates of gestational diabetes, without an increase in low birth weight&#xD;
      infants, and that implementation into the investigators' prenatal care clinics will be&#xD;
      feasible and scalable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite two decades of public health efforts to combat obesity, rates continue to rise and&#xD;
      racial disparities persist. There is an urgent need to re-focus obesity prevention efforts&#xD;
      onto young adults, particularly reproductive age women. 23% of women (vs. 13% of men) gain&#xD;
      ≥20 kg from age 18 to 55 years, with the highest weight gain in African American women who&#xD;
      gain &gt; 1kg/year. Importantly, weight gain of ≥20 kg is associated with development of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (DM), other obesity-related comorbidities and greater mortality. For women who&#xD;
      become pregnant, pregnancy provides an important opportunity for obesity and DM prevention,&#xD;
      as excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and pregnancy complications [e.g. gestational&#xD;
      diabetes (GDM)], increase future DM risk. Promoting healthy GWG through behavioral&#xD;
      interventions may prevent these pregnancy complications, but importantly has great potential&#xD;
      for long-term, sustainable benefits to prevent postpartum weight retention (PPWR) and future&#xD;
      obesity and DM, in women and the women's children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the publication of the LIFE-Moms consortium's results, there is now strong evidence from&#xD;
      efficacy trials showing that limiting GWG is achievable and associated with improved exercise&#xD;
      and dietary behaviors. Several notable research gaps and next steps have emerged from the&#xD;
      LIFE-Moms' studies, which the investigators address in this pragmatic trial. Because these&#xD;
      studies were designed to test the efficacy of behavioral weight management on GWG,&#xD;
      interventions were resource intensive (i.e. in-person counseling and with limited online and&#xD;
      mobile technologies), without a focus on program implementation and sustainability in routine&#xD;
      prenatal care settings and lacking intervention in the vulnerable postpartum period. To&#xD;
      address these critical evidence gaps and reduce obesity associated with the&#xD;
      pregnancy/postpartum periods, the next step is to integrate and test an evidence-based&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention in pregnancy and postpartum that utilizes remote delivery of&#xD;
      counseling, enables self-monitoring by patients using mobile and online technologies and&#xD;
      supports obstetric providers and clinics to optimize care for women at high risk for obesity&#xD;
      and future DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' experienced team created and tested Healthy for Two / Healthy for You&#xD;
      (H42/H4U). H42/H4U is an innovative evidence-based pregnancy/postpartum health coaching&#xD;
      intervention that is remotely-delivered (phone coaching using motivational interviewing +&#xD;
      web-based platform + mobile phone behavioral tracking). The aim of this R18 pragmatic&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to embed H42/H4U into prenatal care clinics that serve a&#xD;
      racially and economically diverse population, leveraging existing staff as trained health&#xD;
      coaches and community health workers (CHWs), to test its effectiveness and implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that women in the H42/H4U arm will have lower GWG and lower&#xD;
      rates of GDM, without an increase in low birth weight infants, and that implementation into&#xD;
      the investigators' prenatal care clinics will be feasible and scalable. The investigators&#xD;
      will rigorously test this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Test the effectiveness of H42/H4U integrated into prenatal care compared with Usual&#xD;
      Care among 380 pregnant and postpartum women enrolled from 6 prenatal clinics on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Primary outcome: GWG (37 week minus baseline pregnancy [≤15 week gestation] weight) B.&#xD;
      Maternal secondary outcomes: Proportion with excessive GWG; GDM incidence; PPWR at 6 months&#xD;
      after delivery C. Infant secondary outcomes: Weight at birth, 4 and 6 months. D. Other&#xD;
      outcomes: Maternal health behaviors (diet, physical activity, breastfeeding); Maternal&#xD;
      wellness (depression, sleep and stress)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Assess organizational factors that impact the implementation of the intervention into&#xD;
      prenatal care clinics, including costs of intervention delivery and provider and staff&#xD;
      satisfaction to inform future dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Provider and staff perspectives, including satisfaction, workflow barriers and potential&#xD;
      for sustainability, using qualitative semi-structured interviews (n=15 at baseline and end of&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Cost analysis to assess intervention delivery costs and the return on investment (ROI) of&#xD;
      H42/H4U.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will advance a potentially powerful, prenatal care-based strategy to reduce&#xD;
      obesity in young adult childbearing women and thereby the intergenerational effects on the&#xD;
      women's children. The investigators' interdisciplinary team brings together engaged academic&#xD;
      and community-based obstetricians, the investigators' health system's population health&#xD;
      program and researchers with experience in developing, testing and implementing behavioral&#xD;
      interventions in both pregnant and non-pregnant adults in real world settings to enable wide&#xD;
      dissemination. Ultimately, the investigators' goal is to design and produce an effective and&#xD;
      scalable behavioral strategy, integrated into clinical practice that will: 1) reduce&#xD;
      excessive GWG and its associated pregnancy complications, 2) reduce future obesity, DM and&#xD;
      other obesity-related complications in mothers and the mothers' children, and 3) ensure high&#xD;
      quality care delivery that prevents obesity and DM through a population health approach to&#xD;
      prenatal care.&#xD;
