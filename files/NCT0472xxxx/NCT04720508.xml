      In this study we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess serum miRNA-373, miRNA-425-5p expression in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore their correlations with breast cancer clinicopathological documented data&#xD;
           including staging, grading and tumor receptors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer worldwide with estimated 2.3 million new&#xD;
      cases and 685000 deaths in 2020. In women, breast cancer accounts for one in 4 cancer cases&#xD;
      and one in 6 cancer deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Egypt, BC is the most common cancer among females accounting for 32.0% of all cancers in&#xD;
      women according to the data of the National Cancer Registry Program of Egypt . 22038 Egyptian&#xD;
      females breast cancer new cases were estimated to be in 2020 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important risk factors for breast cancer include female gender, age (30 years old&#xD;
      and older), positive family history for breast cancer , and familial genetic mutations,&#xD;
      including mutations in the breast cancer A1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2 genes. Furthermore, women with&#xD;
      a history of breast cancer are more likely (20-25%) to develop microscopic cancer in the&#xD;
      opposite breast. A positive history for cancer in the endometrium, ovaries, or colon, as well&#xD;
      as radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, was shown to increase the risk of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for diagnosis of breast cancer is histopathology. Several tumor markers&#xD;
      have been suggested for the evaluation and management of breast cancer including estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone receptors (ER/PR), which are used for the assessment of susceptibility to&#xD;
      hormone treatment, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is used to&#xD;
      assess the susceptibility to trastuzumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the rapid development of medical technology, strategies such as surgery, medication and&#xD;
      radiotherapy can help a lot to reduce mortality rate. Though clinical intervention at early&#xD;
      stage can greatly improve prognosis, many BC patients are asymptomatic until disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, effective screening methods are in great demand for the early detection of BC. In&#xD;
      clinical practice, many screening strategies have been widely used, such as mammography,&#xD;
      breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these strategies are far from being perfect because of over-diagnosis,&#xD;
      false-positive inconsistent results and potential radiation injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core needle aspiration can help establish the diagnosis, but the procedure is invasive and&#xD;
      not suitable for routine use .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, novel non-invasive screening methods of high sensitivity and specificity are&#xD;
      needed to assist the early diagnosis of BC .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microribonucleic Acids (microRNAs) are a large subgroup of noncoding RNAs made up of 18-25&#xD;
      nucleotides. MicroRNAs regulate gene expression after transcription. They have a&#xD;
      multifunctional role, as they can perform either as oncogenes by repressing their target&#xD;
      tumor suppressor genes, or as tumor suppressors through inhibiting the expression of their&#xD;
      target oncogenes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown that miRNAs played important roles in nearly all biological&#xD;
      processes and their aberrant expression was associated with many diseases including cancers.&#xD;
      Stable existence of miRNAs in peripheral blood circulation revealed that they could be&#xD;
      promising noninvasive biomarkers for cancer detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For BC, more and more circulating miRNAs (ie, miRNA-373, miRNA-425-5p) are emerging as&#xD;
      potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In breast cancer miRNA-425-5p was found elevated and predicted a poor prognosis for the&#xD;
      patients, and its role in BC highlight a new research points for diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MiRNA-373 Circulating level has been reported as a potential biomarker of lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis and its expression has been linked to promoting migration and invasion of breast&#xD;
      cancer cells. It has also been reported that correlations between decreased miRNA-373&#xD;
      expression and BC relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, findings often differed from each other due to different experiment design, study&#xD;
      cohorts or disease status.&#xD;
