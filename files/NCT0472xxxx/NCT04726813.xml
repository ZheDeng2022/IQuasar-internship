      The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of a self-guided Internet-delivered&#xD;
      intervention for coping with ADHD. The secondary aim is to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      individual adaptation of the intervention on adherence, satisfaction and clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD in adulthood, with an estimated prevalence of 2 - 3 %, is associated with challenges in&#xD;
      daily life functioning. The availability of evidence-based psychological interventions for&#xD;
      adults with ADHD is poor. Interventions delivered over the Internet might help to increase&#xD;
      the availability of effective psychological interventions for this group. The primary aim of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the efficacy of a self-guided Internet-delivered intervention for&#xD;
      coping with ADHD. The secondary aim is to investigate the effects of individual adaptation of&#xD;
      the intervention on adherence, satisfaction and clinical outcomes. A minimum of 118&#xD;
      participants with a self-reported ADHD diagnosis will be included in the study. In phase 1 we&#xD;
      will conduct a randomized controlled trial with two arms, 1) self-guided Internet-delivered&#xD;
      intervention for coping with ADHD (N=59), 2) self-guided online psychoeducation (control&#xD;
      group, N= 59), with a 3 month follow-up. After 3 months the second phase of the study starts.&#xD;
      In this phase (II) the control group participants will receive an adaptive version of the&#xD;
      Internet-delivered intervention. This includes adaptation of the order of the modules to the&#xD;
      individual participant needs, with the use of rule-based and machine-learning based&#xD;
      adaptation. Clinical outcomes in both phases are inattention, hyperactivity, quality of life&#xD;
      and stress. Uptake, usage, adherence and satisfaction will be explored. Repeated measurers&#xD;
      are at baseline, weekly during the intervention period, post-intervention and 3 months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
