      During Phase I, disguised SoundEar noise devices will be used to record the noise levels in&#xD;
      the operating rooms on Labor and Delivery during Cesarean births. Survey data will be&#xD;
      acquired from physicians, nurses, and patients to determine if the sound in the operating&#xD;
      rooms during surgery impacted the stress levels of those involved. An educational&#xD;
      intervention will then be held for the physicians and nurses, and Phase II will involve&#xD;
      having the SoundEar devices exposed. When the sound level reaches a distracting level, the&#xD;
      light on the device will change to bright red. Surveys will be collected to determine if&#xD;
      there is a difference in the stress levels if and when the noise level in the operating room&#xD;
      is decreased during cesarean births.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For noise measurement and visual feedback, a SoundEar III device will be used. The SoundEar&#xD;
      is the most studied and supported AV device maker in medical literature, with option of&#xD;
      recording and providing visual feedback, designed specifically to &quot;create awareness about&#xD;
      noise&quot;. The device measures the environmental sound continuously and is also able to provide&#xD;
      visual feedback indicating the actual sound level and has been extensively studied for uses&#xD;
      in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technical specifications of the device are as follows: frequency range 20Hz to 16kHz and&#xD;
      scope of measurement of 45dB(A) (similar to bird calls) to 115dB(A) (a sound level that can&#xD;
      be encountered at a live rock music venue). The system provides optical feedback in 3&#xD;
      categories: green light (acceptable noise level), orange light (noise level is near the&#xD;
      limit) and red light (noise level has exceeded the limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The L&amp;D ORs will be equipped with a sound measurement feedback device mounted on the wall&#xD;
      visible from the foot end of the operating table. Noise recording can be conducted&#xD;
      continuously for 24 hours a day, and downloaded, stored and analyzed weekly. The recorded&#xD;
      sound level data can be time-matched with corresponding operations during time stamps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into 4 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a baseline validated Weinstein Noise Sensitivity questionnaire (WNS-6B) for&#xD;
      subjective noise sensitivity will be collected for all potentially included primary resident&#xD;
      surgeons9 as the variability in noise annoyance/disturbance is often best explained by&#xD;
      individual subjective noise sensitivity than true noise level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 1, over a 4-6 month period, we will measure noise decibel level with the noise meter&#xD;
      continuously with the optical feedback function concealed and pair this with all scheduled&#xD;
      and unscheduled C-sections in the L&amp;D OR. The surgical team members will not specifically be&#xD;
      told that data is being collected for a study, but the SoundEar devices will be visible to&#xD;
      the surgical team during this phase. We will then plan to collect brief scale questionnaires&#xD;
      on a visual analog scale adapted from Engelmann, et al. for all included study cases from the&#xD;
      primary resident surgeon, the circulating RN and the patient regarding perceived noise level,&#xD;
      stress level and overall experience. . Health care team members will serve as their own&#xD;
      nested controls and thus the questionnaires will be de-identified and paired with a unique&#xD;
      study ID number generated for each participant---- please note that the first page will only&#xD;
      ask for the respondent's name and the questionnaire on the second page will not contain&#xD;
      identifying information with the intention of removing the respondents name after their&#xD;
      unique identifier has been transcribed to the questionnaire. These cases will serve as nested&#xD;
      controls with each provider submitting a response serving as their own baseline control&#xD;
      during statistical analysis and will be able to be linked to operative details and patient's&#xD;
      chart from date and time noted for the delivery by the respondent. No identifying patient&#xD;
      information will be collected on any of the paper questionnaires. Details about: case length,&#xD;
      number of attendees in the operating room, blood loss, intraoperative complications, NICU&#xD;
      involvement, NICU admission, maternal and neonatal length of stay, postoperative&#xD;
      complications, readmissions, and reoperations will be obtained from the patient's chart in a&#xD;
      prospective manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patients who consents to be in the study will complete one questionnaire. The patient&#xD;
      will be informed that we are recording the noise levels in the OR during their surgery, and&#xD;
      that we are studying the impact of noise levels in the OR on patient and physician stress&#xD;
      levels and surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of the questionnaires are included with this application. The primary RN will also&#xD;
      record the case type (scheduled, unplanned, urgent, or emergent), date and case start and&#xD;
      stop time for time stamp reference, number of staff members in the L&amp;D OR and pertinent&#xD;
      pediatric outcome data (APGAR, gestational age, NICU admission) in his/her portion of the&#xD;
      survey. These cases will serve as &quot;controls&quot; and baseline noise data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two week washout period will then be planned during which no data will be collected. A&#xD;
      difference in noise reduction of 3dB(A) is an important noise level reduction level as it&#xD;
      represents a 50% reduction in perceived noise levels. A power calculation can be performed&#xD;
      after phase 1 to calculate needed cases to demonstrate a statistical difference in noise&#xD;
      reduction with intervention. From the literature, with an average decibel level of roughly 60&#xD;
      dB, and S.D. of 10 dB, 87 cases would be required to demonstrate statistical significance at&#xD;
      80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 2, the visual feedback function will be activated on the noise meters. Providers&#xD;
      will be aware of the introduction of the device but receive no formal noise reduction&#xD;
      education or knowledge that a study is being conducted in this phase. A threshold of ≤60dB(A)&#xD;
      is generally accepted as an &quot;acceptable&quot; level and ≥65dB(A) as an excessive noise level based&#xD;
      on the system providers recommendations and per results from previous studies in the medical&#xD;
      literature. Optical feedback can then be accordingly activated in these 3 ranges (green light&#xD;
      ≤60dB(A), orange light from 60-65dB(A), red light ≥65dB(A)). Similarly, we will collect&#xD;
      overall noise data continuously during phase 2 and pair this with all scheduled and&#xD;
      unscheduled C-sections in the L&amp;D OR with questionnaire data collected for comparison to the&#xD;
      pre-intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis, surgeons and RN team members will be compared in nested control&#xD;
      manner from the preintervention to postintervention time periods with planned sub-analysis of&#xD;
      &quot;high-responders&quot; and &quot;low-responders&quot; from results of their previously obtained subjective&#xD;
      WNS-6B questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After data collection for phase 2, a phase 3 and 4 intervention period may be planned with&#xD;
      intervening washout periods. These phases will take place after a 2 week formal education&#xD;
      program on noise reduction, combined with the visual feedback function first disabled and&#xD;
      then enabled with similar recording of continuous noise decibel level and survey data. The&#xD;
      purpose of phase 3 and 4 will be in comparing outcomes from simple introduction of the device&#xD;
      versus combined education program on noise awareness. The noise awareness program will also&#xD;
      include a prompt that incorporation of noise reduction efforts are ongoing during&#xD;
      preoperative time out. Initial sub-analysis of phase 1&amp;2 data should be planned for&#xD;
      evaluating efficacy of the visual feedback device alone at improvement in noise outcomes&#xD;
      (manuscript #1). Surgical and pediatric outcomes data will also be measured during all time&#xD;
      periods for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the intervention is successful at improvement in surgeon stress or patient outcomes, the&#xD;
      AV feedback noise meters may be considered for long term adoption into the L&amp;D ORs and future&#xD;
      investigation of effectiveness in the Labor and Delivery Room (LDR) during vaginal births&#xD;
      could be planned.&#xD;
