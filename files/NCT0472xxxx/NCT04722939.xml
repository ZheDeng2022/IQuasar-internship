    <textblock>
      Introduction. Initiation of acute kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is common in critically&#xD;
      ill adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and is associated with increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. KRT has been linked to poor neurocognitive outcomes, leading to a&#xD;
      reduced quality of life, as well as increased utilization of healthcare resources. Adults&#xD;
      initiated on dialysis in the ICU may be particularly at risk of neurocognitive impairment, as&#xD;
      survivors of critical illness are already predisposed to developing cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
      and cognitive dysfunction over the long-term relative to healthy controls. Regional cerebral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (rSO2) may provide a critical early marker of long-term neurocognitive&#xD;
      impairment in patients in this population. The INCOGNITO-AKI study aims to understand&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation in patients undergoing KRT, either continuous or intermittent, in the&#xD;
      ICU. These findings will be correlated with long-term cognitive and functional outcomes, as&#xD;
      well as structural brain pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis. 108 patients scheduled to undergo treatment for acute kidney injury&#xD;
      with KRT in the Kingston Health Sciences Centre ICU will be recruited into this prospective&#xD;
      observational study. Enrolled patients will be assessed with intradialytic cerebral oximetry&#xD;
      using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Delirium will be assessed daily with the Confusion&#xD;
      Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and delirium severity quantified as&#xD;
      cumulative CAM-ICU-7 scores. Neurocognitive impairment will be assessed at 3- and 12-months&#xD;
      after hospital discharge using the Kinarm and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Structural brain pathology on MRI will also be measured at&#xD;
      the same timepoints. Driving safety, adverse events, and medication adherence will be&#xD;
      assessed at 12-months to evaluate the impact of neurocognitive impairment on functional&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination. This study has been approved by the Queen's University Health&#xD;
      Sciences and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board (Approval number:&#xD;
      DMED-2424-20). Results will be presented at critical care scientific conferences and a lay&#xD;
      summary will be provided to patients and families in their preferred format.&#xD;

    <description>Anonymized and de-identified MRI scans will be processed using MIPAV55 v.7.3.0 and Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) v.5.0 medical image processing programs. Scans will be corrected for intensity non-uniformity and transformed into a common image space to adjust for variations in head size and orientation. Skull stripping will be performed. Automated and semi-automated techniques will be used to determine whole-brain volumes from T1-weighted images for analysis of macrostructural brain integrity, as well as FA and MD measures from diffusion-weighted images for analysis of microstructural brain integrity. Brain volumes will be corrected for total intracranial volume to account for head size. Reasons for non-completion of MRI scanning will be recorded. Patients will be used as their own controls over time using a within-subjects design.</description>
