&#xD;
               -  Recent (within the previous 8 months before Screening) evidence of hypothalamic&#xD;
                  injury on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosis of craniopharyngioma or other non-malignant brain tumor affecting the&#xD;
                  hypothalamic region; AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has undergone surgery ≥6 months and ≤8 years before Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has either unilateral hypothalamic lesions (at least 6 subjects) or bilateral&#xD;
             hypothalamic lesions (at least 7 subjects), as assessed by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Although the intention of the study is to enroll at least six patients with&#xD;
             unilateral hypothalamic lesions, the Sponsor may decrease the required number during&#xD;
             the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 6 to 28 years, inclusive, at time of enrollment. (A maximum of 5 subjects between&#xD;
             the ages of 6 and 12 will be enrolled in the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obese, defined as a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 for subjects ≥16 years of age or BMI ≥99th&#xD;
             percentile for age and gender for subjects 6 to &lt;16 years of age based on the US&#xD;
             Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented increase in BMI (change from pre-surgery baseline in BMI z-score ≥0.25)&#xD;
             either during the first 6 months following surgery or within 1 year before surgery AND&#xD;
             still present at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 6 months after the end of post-tumor treatment, including chemotherapy,&#xD;
             surgery, or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If male or a female of child-bearing potential, agrees to use a highly reliable form&#xD;
             of contraception throughout the study and for 90 days following the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Highly reliable acceptable forms of contraception include hormonal (ie, oral,&#xD;
             implantable, or injectable) AND single-barrier method (ie, condom), or an Intrauterine&#xD;
             Device (IUD) AND single-barrier method (ie, condom) or vasectomy/vasectomized partner.&#xD;
             True abstinence is acceptable only if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status&#xD;

             post-menopausal for at least 12 months, or delayed pubertal development and failure to&#xD;
             achieve menarche, do not require contraception during the study. Younger female&#xD;
             subjects who are not sexually mature will be assessed for Tanner Staging and advised&#xD;
             accordingly. Females who begin the study having failed to reach Tanner Stage 5 or&#xD;
             achieve menarche, but do so during the study, will be counseled on pregnancy and&#xD;
             contraception, and will immediately be treated as a female of child bearing potential&#xD;
             for the remainder of the study, with the required pregnancy test at all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to communicate well with the Investigator, understand and comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study, and understand and sign the written informed consent, or,&#xD;
             for subjects aged &lt;18 years, a parent/legal guardian that can sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If receiving hormone replacement therapy (ie, thyroid hormones, glucocorticoids,&#xD;
             growth hormone or other medications known to affect metabolism or weight/body&#xD;
             composition), the dose of such therapy has remained stable for at least 2 months prior&#xD;
             to Screening. (Changes in dose of ≤15% may be permissible, with the Sponsor's&#xD;
             approval.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for study participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent intensive (within 2 months) diet and/or exercise regimen with or without the&#xD;
             use of weight loss agents (including herbal medications) that has resulted in &gt;3%&#xD;
             weight loss. These subjects may be reconsidered approximately 1 month after cessation&#xD;
             of such intensive regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any medication that is approved to treat obesity (eg, orlistat, lorcaserin,&#xD;
             phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion) within 3 months before the first&#xD;
             setmelanotide dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may be used up to the dose&#xD;
             approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (eg, liraglutide up to a daily dose of&#xD;
             1.8 mg) as long as (1) it is not being prescribed for the treatment of obesity, (2)&#xD;
             the dose has been stable for at least 3 months prior to enrollment, (3) the subject&#xD;
             has not experienced &gt;3% weight loss during the previous 3 months, AND (4) the subject&#xD;
             intends to keep the dose stable throughout the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of severe psychiatric disorders (eg, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,&#xD;
             personality disorder), or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) within the previous 2 years,&#xD;
             or Screening Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9/PHQ-A score ≥15, or any suicidal&#xD;
             ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS during Screening, or lifetime history of suicide&#xD;
             attempts, or any suicidal behavior in the last month.&#xD;

             severe enough to interfere with the study and/or confound the results. Any subject&#xD;
             with a potentially clinically significant disease should be reviewed with the Sponsor&#xD;
             to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30mL/min during Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant dermatologic findings relating to melanoma or pre-melanoma skin lesions&#xD;
             (excluding non-invasive basal or squamous cell lesion), determined as part of a&#xD;
             comprehensive skin evaluation performed by the Investigator during Screening. Any&#xD;
             concerning lesions identified during Screening will be biopsied and results known to&#xD;
             be benign prior to enrollment. If the pre-treatment biopsy results are of significant&#xD;
             concern, the subject is not eligible for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or close family history (parents or siblings) of skin cancer or melanoma (not&#xD;
             including noninvasive, infiltrative basal or squamous cell lesion), or subject history&#xD;
             of ocular-cutaneous albinism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any clinical study with an investigational drug/device within 3&#xD;

          -  Previously enrolled in a clinical study involving setmelanotide or any previous&#xD;
             exposure to setmelanotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with once daily (QD) injection regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, breastfeeding or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous history of weight loss surgery, eg, gastric bypass or gastric banding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment that, in the Investigator's opinion, precludes participation to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is, in Investigator's opinion, otherwise not suitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
