  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical performance and safety in total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty using HLS implants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is planned to collect prospective and retrospective data from a continuous and exhaustive&#xD;
      series of patients in a French center where Total Knee Arthroplasty with HLS prosthesis is&#xD;
      performed routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients treated with HLS KneeTec (cemented, non-cemented or hybrid versions) implant&#xD;
      will be included. All eligible patients seen in consultation and who agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study should be included, systematically and consecutively, since the initiation of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected retrospectively for HLS I, II, Evolution and Noetos® implants, and&#xD;
      when prospectively for cementless, cemented and hybrid HLS KneeTec prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgery visit data will be collected at 1-y , 3-y , 5-y, 10-y FU visits per protocol&#xD;
      then up to the latest FU visit available.&#xD;
