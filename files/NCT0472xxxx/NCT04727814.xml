      Water exchange (WE) improves adenoma detection rate (ADR) but missed polyps occur due to&#xD;
      human limitations. Computer-aided detection (CADe) improves polyp detection and can overcome&#xD;
      human omissions, but a limiting factor is feces and air bubbles related false alarms (FA). WE&#xD;
      provides salvage cleansing and can potentially reduce FA. The investigators compared the&#xD;
      additional polyp detection rate (APDR) and false alarm rate (FAR) by CADe between WE and air&#xD;
      insufflation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in women and the third in&#xD;
      men. Early detection and removal of the colon polyps (cancer precursors) reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of CRC. However, interval colon cancers still occur within 3-5 years after colonoscopy among&#xD;
      patients of colonoscopists with low adenoma detection rate (ADR), defined as the proportion&#xD;
      of patients with at least one adenoma. ADR was widely variable, suggesting that some adenomas&#xD;
      were missed. Twenty six percent of adenomas were missed during tandem examination reported in&#xD;
      a recent meta-analysis. Missed adenomas accounted for about 58% of interval cancers. Adenomas&#xD;
      are more likely to be missed in the right colon than in other segments because of their flat&#xD;
      morphology and hiding behind the accentuated folds and curvatures. Innovations in colonoscopy&#xD;
      to increase ADR and decrease adenoma miss rate (AMR) hold the potential to reduce interval&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consensus statements in a recent modified Delphi review confirmed water exchange (WE) as&#xD;
      a standardized insertion method produced less insertion pain, better bowel cleanliness and&#xD;
      higher ADR than gas insufflation. It is characterized by infusing water to guide insertion in&#xD;
      an airless lumen and almost simultaneous suctioning of the infused water during insertion,&#xD;
      aiming at near-complete removal of the infused water and debris upon cecal intubation.&#xD;
      Although an RCT with tandem examination showed WE significantly decreased right colon adenoma&#xD;
      miss rate (rAMR) compared with CO2 insufflation (18.0% [33/183] vs. 34.6% [62/179], P =&#xD;
      0.0025), a considerable percentage of polyps in the right colon were still overlooked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence has made&#xD;
      remarkable progress, and an increasing number of publications showed improved polyp detection&#xD;
      rate (PDR) and ADR using computer-aided detection (CADe). CADe can detect polyps overlooked&#xD;
      by the colonoscopist due to human limitations of inattention or inexperience. However, one&#xD;
      major drawback of current CADe systems is false alarms (FAs), or false positives (FPs).&#xD;
      Usually triggered by bubbles and fecal debris, FAs might distract the endoscopists with&#xD;
      potential unfavorable effect on ADR. One study reported a FP rate of up to 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an overview on applying deep learning algorithms and WE in colonoscopy to improve adenoma&#xD;
      detection, the authors noted that WE could enhance the performance of artificial intelligence&#xD;
      (CADe) by improving bowel cleanliness and thus the exposure of polyps. In a follow-up review,&#xD;
      the authors reported that artificial intelligence might mitigate operator-dependent factors&#xD;
      that limited the potential of WE, while WE might provide the platform to optimize the&#xD;
      performance of artificial intelligence by increasing bowel cleanliness and improving&#xD;
      visualization, Therefore, the strengths of WE and artificial intelligence may complement the&#xD;
      weaknesses of each other to maximize adenoma detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of our recently completed studies compared right colon ADR evaluated by a blinded&#xD;
      endoscopist using either air insufflation or WE for insertion, with all the colonoscopies&#xD;
      video recorded (NCT02737514). We developed and applied a CADe system to detect the polyps in&#xD;
      the videos. The current report is a proof of principle study to test the hypothesis that WE&#xD;
      could yield a significantly higher additional PDR (APDR) and reduce false alarms rate (FAR)&#xD;
      as compared to air insufflation in the right colon.&#xD;
