  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder (BED) shows prominent circadian features that suggest a delay in&#xD;
      circadian phase, and preliminary evidence shows binge eating may be responsive to&#xD;
      chronobiological interventions, implicating a circadian system dysfunction in its&#xD;
      pathophysiology. What remains lacking, however, is comprehensive knowledge of the&#xD;
      characteristics of circadian system dysfunction in BED, and whether this dysfunction&#xD;
      represents a therapeutic target in BED. There is therefore a critical need to characterize&#xD;
      circadian system dysfunction in BED, and evaluate it as a potential therapeutic target.&#xD;
      Without such information, the understanding on the role of the circadian system in BED and&#xD;
      its potential as a new therapeutic target will remain limited.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the research strategy will be to characterize circadian system&#xD;
      dysfunction in BED and its potential as a therapeutic target. The central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      a circadian system dysfunction (phase delay) plays a role in the pathophysiology of BED, and&#xD;
      that advancing the circadian phase will improve BED symptoms. To attain the overall&#xD;
      objectives, the following specific aims will be pursued in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1) To characterize circadian system dysfunction in BED (Phase 1). Circadian&#xD;
      system function will be evaluated in 80 adult (18 to 50yrs) obese subjects, 40 with BED and&#xD;
      40 without BED as a control group matched by age, body mass index (BMI), and gender, during a&#xD;
      two-week observational phase. Based on preliminary data, the working hypothesis is that DLMO&#xD;
      (the primary outcome measure) and secondary circadian parameters (i.e., locomotor activity&#xD;
      acrophase) will occur later in the BED group compared with the control group, and a later&#xD;
      circadian phase will be associated with worse BED clinical features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2) To evaluate circadian phase as a predictive biomarker for response to a&#xD;
      chronobiological intervention and evidence of circadian system target engagement in BED&#xD;
      (Phase 2). A mechanistic clinical trial with a 4-week double-blinded, randomized,&#xD;
      sham/placebo controlled study design will evaluate the effect of a combination of morning&#xD;
      lights+Melatonin/placebo on the circadian system and eating behavior on 40 BED subjects that&#xD;
      complete phase 1. Subjects will be randomized to receive a combination of morning lights at&#xD;
      usual wake time + Melatonin(3mg) or placebo (3hr before DLMO). Based on preliminary data, the&#xD;
      working hypothesis is that a chronobiological intervention will induce a greater DLMO advance&#xD;
      (primary outcome measure), greater decrease in binge eating days/week (secondary outcome&#xD;
      measure), and change in exploratory metabolic outcomes. In addition, a later baseline DLMO&#xD;
      (secondary outcome) will predict change in binge eating days/week and metabolic parameters in&#xD;
      response to a chronobiological intervention.&#xD;
