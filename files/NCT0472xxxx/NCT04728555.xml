  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Radiotherapy (RT) can be stressful and challenging for children exposed to a&#xD;
      highly technical environment with large radiation equipment and immobilization devices. A&#xD;
      pedagogical digital game about RT has been developed. Children who have received RT&#xD;
      participated in work-shops and contributed with their experiences and suggestions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To explore whether the intervention with a pedagogical digital game facilitate&#xD;
      understanding, choice of distraction, creation of a sense of calmness and self-efficacy prior&#xD;
      to and during RT and to describe the children's and the parents experiences and use of the&#xD;
      game as a pedagogical tool. Further, to investigate feasibility in terms of reach, usability&#xD;
      and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A feasibility and prospective waiting list control design is planned by recruiting 60&#xD;
      children (5-14 years) and their parents, for randomization into two groups. The first group&#xD;
      will receive the game five days before start of RT. All children will have standard&#xD;
      information one day before RT. The second group will have access to the game three days after&#xD;
      start of treatment. The effects of the game will be investigated before and during RT and&#xD;
      between groups as they receive the game at different time. Children will answer&#xD;
      questionnaires about self-assessed anxiety, understanding of the procedure, distraction&#xD;
      strategies, self-efficacy to remain motionless. Statistical comparative and correlational&#xD;
      analyses will be calculated. Interviews will be performed with 12 children and 24 parents.&#xD;
      Changes and further development of the game will be implemented based on the results of the&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The game can support children to undergo RT and be used nationally to prepare&#xD;
      for RT. Thus all children receive similar information regardless of where they live, and&#xD;
      contribute to increased knowledge, autonomy, reduce fear and anxiety. In the long term, the&#xD;
      use of anesthesia could decrease for children.&#xD;

      Data Collection and procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to the game for children randomized to the first group: Four to six days before start&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires to all children: Questions about state and trait anxiety, and radiotherapy&#xD;
      before the information meeting with the oncology nurse, one day before the start of&#xD;
      treatment, at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire to parents: Questions about state and trait anxiety before the information&#xD;
      meeting with the oncology nurse at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information meeting with all children and their parents: Information about radiotherapy by&#xD;
      oncology nurse at baseline Questionnaires to all children: Questions about state anxiety and&#xD;
      radiotherapy on treatment day one and three.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to the game for children randomized to the second group: Day three after start of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire to all children: Questions about state anxiety on treatment day six and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire to all children: Questions about the digital game one week after access to the&#xD;
      game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Game logs: Collection of game logs one week after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview of 12 children and 24 parents: Within four weeks after end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power: A power of 0.80, an alpha value of 0.05 and a size-effect of 0.5 provided an&#xD;
      estimation of 26 participants in each group. Thirty participants are planned in case of&#xD;
      dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Comparative and correlational statistical analyses.&#xD;
