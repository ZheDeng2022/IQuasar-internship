    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, prospective one arm study to explore the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Avatrombopag in non-severe aplastic anemia. Patients meeting the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria would be recruited. Treatment of Avatrombopag would be started with&#xD;
      20mg/day. The dosage would be increased by 20 mg/day every 2 weeks if the platelet count&#xD;
      remains less than 20×10e9/L and reduced if the platelet count reaches over than 150×10e9/L.&#xD;
      The dosage could range from 20mg/week to 60mg/day. All patients would receive treatment for&#xD;
      at least 6 months except that the platelet &lt;20×10e9/L at the dosage of 60mg/day for 4 weeks&#xD;
      or the platelet ≥200×10e9/L at the dosage of 20mg/week for 2 weeks. The hematological&#xD;
      response rate and safety will be recorded and compared at every month after starting the&#xD;
      study treatment. The patients would be followed up for at least 6 months.&#xD;
