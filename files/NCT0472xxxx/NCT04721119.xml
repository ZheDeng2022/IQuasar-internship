  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is one of the most commonly performed&#xD;
      surgeries amongst young orthopedic surgery patients. Optimal post-operative pain control&#xD;
      helps to reduce the opioid burden and to improve the patient's experience. Regional&#xD;
      anesthesia, such as the femoral nerve block (FNB) and adductor canal block (ACB), are&#xD;
      commonly used for post-operative pain control after surgery. The ACB has replaced the FNB.&#xD;
      This is because the ACB targets the femoral nerve, while avoiding the numbing effects on&#xD;
      quadricep muscle strength that make it difficult to move the leg. Another form of pain&#xD;
      control is local infiltration anesthesia (LIA), which directly blocks pain in the knee.&#xD;
      Similar to the ACB, it avoids the numbing effects on the quadricep muscle.This can help&#xD;
      improve patient safety and experience by reducing risks of falls and allowing the patient to&#xD;
      move earlier. This can also be associated with decreased time in the hospital and decreased&#xD;
      costs. Technically, it is less complex and can be done the shorter period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to refine the pain management technique following anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament surgery. More specifically, the aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of LIA alone, and a LIA-ACB combination on post-operative pain and thigh muscle&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
