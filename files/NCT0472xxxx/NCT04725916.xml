  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized, controlled, unblinded, interventional feasibility study to&#xD;
      evaluate if showering with post operative drains in place leads to an increase in&#xD;
      complications. The patients included in the study will be those undergoing breast reductions&#xD;
      and panniculectomies at Geisinger Medical Center. The patients will be randomized post&#xD;
      operatively into one of two groups: 1) patients instructed to shower with drains in place,&#xD;
      and 2) patients instructed not to shower while they have drains in place.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized, controlled, unblinded interventional feasibility trial&#xD;
      evaluating the post-operative outcomes of surgical patients undergoing breast reduction or&#xD;
      panniculectomy procedures. Approximately 100 eligible subjects will undergo their surgical&#xD;
      procedure according to standard clinical guidelines. Unless clinically contraindicated, study&#xD;
      surgeons will maintain consistent use of 10 Flat drains for all study participants to prevent&#xD;
      any sampling bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after surgery is completed, the study investigator will randomize the subject&#xD;
      into one of the 2 study arms. The randomization scheme will control for procedure type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not be blinded. The randomization assignment will be communicated to the care&#xD;
      team and documented in the subject's electronic medical record to ensure that appropriate&#xD;
      post-operative instruction is provided to the subject. Subjects will be notified of their&#xD;
      study arm assignment at the time they receive their post-operative discharge instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both arms will complete a questionnaire related to quality of life&#xD;
      post-operatively, as well as daily bathing specifics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following statistical methods will be used for the aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Collect and describe information related to outcome measures in addition to study data&#xD;
      including number eligible, response rates, adherence/compliance rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be provided for all study enrollment data, compliance information&#xD;
      as well as data collected throughout the study including outcome measures and responses from&#xD;
      the satisfaction survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the surgical site complication rate of post-operative patients with drains&#xD;
      who shower versus those who do not shower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complication rates between the two study arms will be compared using chi-squared tests,&#xD;
      although these comparisons will not be conclusive since the study isn't powered to assess&#xD;
      equivalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To compare patient post-operative satisfaction for those who shower versus those who&#xD;
      do not shower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient post-operative satisfaction between the two study arms will be compared using&#xD;
      chi-squared tests, although these comparisons will not be conclusive since the study isn't&#xD;
      powered to assess differences.&#xD;
