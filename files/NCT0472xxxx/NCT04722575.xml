      Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant treatment with target therapy and immunotherapy given in&#xD;
      combination or sequence may have an anti-tumour activity and may reduce the risk of relapse&#xD;
      in patients with high-risk resectable melanoma (stage III B / C / D and oligometastatic stage&#xD;
      IV).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma represents a considerable health burden and an ongoing area of unmet need in&#xD;
      oncology. Despite melanoma accounts for only 1% of diagnosed skin cancers, it is the cause of&#xD;
      most skin cancer-related deaths. Until recently, limited effective treatment options were&#xD;
      available to patients with advanced melanoma. Historically, response rates to conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy and immunomodulation therapy (interleukin-2 or interferon-Î³) have been reported&#xD;
      at approximately 5-19%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and target therapy improve outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with high-risk resectable melanoma. It has recently been demonstrated that treatment with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant targeted therapy (dabrafenib and trametinib) is associated with a&#xD;
      high pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and improved outcomes over surgery alone.&#xD;
      However, treatment with ICB has not been well studied in the neoadjuvant setting, despite&#xD;
      preclinical studies suggesting that neoadjuvant administration of ICB is associated with&#xD;
      improved survival and enhanced anti-tumour immune responses compared to the same therapy&#xD;
      administered in the adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of neoadjuvant trials is the availability of blood and tumour tissue samples&#xD;
      before and after systemic therapy for the conduct of novel mechanistic and biomarker studies&#xD;
      in the circulation and the tumour microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective neoadjuvant clinical trials with targeted (dabrafenib/trametinib combo) or&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic agents (nivolumab alone or nivolumab/ipilimumab combo) and combinations are&#xD;
      now running in a subgroup of highrisk melanoma patients with pooled overall promising&#xD;
      preliminary results of high rates of pathologic complete responses (pCRs, 30-50%) and early&#xD;
      data of positive correlation between pCR and relapse-free survival. Based on the available&#xD;
      results to date, we aim to conduct a randomized, noncomparative phase II trial to define the&#xD;
      role of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant target and immunotherapy, given in combination or sequence,&#xD;
      in patients with high risk surgically resectable melanoma.This approach has the potential to&#xD;
      define whether neoadjuvant treatment has antitumour activity and whether it reduces the risk&#xD;
      of relapse after surgery.&#xD;
