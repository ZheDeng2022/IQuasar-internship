  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multisite study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and plasma concentration of&#xD;
      Nalfurafine Hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablet in the treatment of refractory&#xD;
      pruritus in maintenance hemodialysis patients, and to bridge the efficacy data from Japan&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a bridging study. when selecting the subjects, the most appropriate&#xD;
      pruritus medication for the subjects was used first.Then, subjects with &quot;existing&#xD;
      treatment-resistant&quot; pruritus will continue to receive basic pruritus treatment if the&#xD;
      corresponding treatment is not sufficiently effective, and the experimental drug or placebo&#xD;
      will be added to this treatment to evaluate the effectiveness.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Variation in VAS of Nalfurafine Hydrochloride versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 38(+1) days</time_frame>
    <description>The Variation = the mean of the daily maximum VAS value during the observation period before administration(D8-14) - the mean of the daily maximum VAS value during the administration period (D25-31). Only the days on which the VAS values were recorded during the day and night were evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Variation in pruritus scores based on the Hsie-Kawashima pruritus severity assessment method</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 38(+1) days</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus scores were assessed during the observation period before administration(D8-14) and administration period (D25-31), and only the days when pruritus scores were recorded during the day and night were evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Variation in nocturnal pruritus scores based on the Hsie-Kawashima pruritus severity assessment method (improvement of pruritus-induced sleep disorders).</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 38(+1) days</time_frame>
    <description>After calculating the mean values of nocturnal pruritus scores during the observation period before administration(D8-14) and administration period (D25-31), the variation was calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement degree of VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 38(+1) days</time_frame>
    <description>The average VAS value of the observation period before administration (D8-14) and the average VAS value of the administration period (D25-31) were calculated, and the improvement degree was determined as very effective, effective and ineffective according to the variation of the average VAS value.</description>
