    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for elective abdominopelvic laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia&#xD;
      were included. Rocuronium was used for the neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and the level of NMB&#xD;
      was monitored with train-of-four (TOF) measurements. The participants from whom informed&#xD;
      consent had been received were allocated to two groups according to the agent used for&#xD;
      reversal of NMB, sugammadex, or neostigmine. The ECG recordings of the subjects were followed&#xD;
      with a rhythm Holter device throughout the procedure until the postoperative 12th hour.&#xD;
      Additionally, preoperative and immediate postoperative 12-lead ECGs were evaluated for&#xD;
      corrected QT calculations and QT dispersion. Proarrhythmogenicity was assessed with QT&#xD;
      related measurements. The documented arrhythmic events on the Holter monitoring were&#xD;
      designated as clinical end-points.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty consecutive patients, to whom an elective abdominopelvic surgery under general&#xD;
      anesthesia was planned, were included in the study. Participants were allocated to two groups&#xD;
      considering the agent to be used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade by&#xD;
      closed-envelope randomization. Neostigmine was used for this purpose in Group N, while&#xD;
      sugammadex was used in Group S. Demographic features including hypertension, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, presence of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and previous arrhythmia were&#xD;
      noted. Body mass index was calculated with the Du Bois method. In the operation room, heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure, body temperature, arterial oxygen saturation, and TOF ratio were&#xD;
      recorded. General anesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol; and&#xD;
      maintained by remifentanil and sevoflurane. In Group N, 50 mcg/kg neostigmine and 20 mcg/kg&#xD;
      atropine were used for NMB reversal. In Group S, reversal was achieved by the administration&#xD;
      of sugammadex at a dose of 2 mg/kg. QT interval was measured in leads DII or V5 and adjusted&#xD;
      to the heart rate by the Bazzett formula. QTc values at the baseline and postoperative ECGs&#xD;
      were recorded and presented with milliseconds. An increase of over 60 ms in QTc interval or a&#xD;
      postoperative measurement over 500 ms were assumed to be distinctly abnormal. QT dispersion&#xD;
      was calculated by extracting the minimum QT length from the maximum QT length in 12-lead ECG.&#xD;
      In rhythm holter monitoring, minimum and mean heart rates and specific arrhythmic events were&#xD;
      recorded. In the heart rate variability analysis, the standard deviation of the interbeat&#xD;
      intervals of normal sinus beats (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences&#xD;
      between normal heartbeats (rMSSD) were calculated. The following events were designated as&#xD;
      clinical end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pause (no waves on ECG recording at least for 3 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant bradycardia (sinus bradycardia persisted at least for 30 seconds with a rate&#xD;
           below 50 beats/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-grade atrioventricular block (2nd-degree Mobitz Type II or 3rd degree)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supraventricular tachycardia (sudden onset tachycardia with narrow QRS complexes&#xD;
           persisted over 30 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial flutter or fibrillation (sustained over 30 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequent premature ventricular beats (≥30 beats/hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any ventricular tachycardia (wide QRS complexes)&#xD;
