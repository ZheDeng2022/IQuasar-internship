      The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the 677C→T polymorphism in the&#xD;
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene on blood pressure (BP) during pregnancy, and&#xD;
      to examine the effect of intervention with riboflavin, alone or in combination with&#xD;
      5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), as a non-drug approach for managing BP in pregnancy in&#xD;
      women with the variant TT genotype. In addition, we aim to examine the effect of maternal&#xD;
      supplementation with riboflavin, alone or combined with 5-MTHF, on BP in the offspring in&#xD;
      early infancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double-blind randomized controlled trial in pregnant women will be conducted.&#xD;
      Women with a singleton pregnancy who are in their first trimester will be recruited from&#xD;
      antenatal clinics in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Women interested in the&#xD;
      study will provide informed consent, complete a screening questionnaire and will provide a&#xD;
      buccal swab to collect DNA to screen for the MTHFR 677C→T polymorphism. Women with multiple&#xD;
      pregnancies, a previous NTD-affected pregnancy and those who are taking medication&#xD;
      interfering with B-vitamin metabolism will be excluded from participation in the study. At&#xD;
      approximately the 16th gestational week (GW), those with the variant TT genotype and&#xD;
      age-matched heterozygous women (CT genotype) will be randomised to receive riboflavin (5&#xD;
      mg/day) alone, or in combination with 5-MTHF (400µg/day), or placebo, until the end of&#xD;
      pregnancy. A non-fasting blood sample will be collected for biomarker assessment of B-vitamin&#xD;
      status and other relevant variables from each participant before intervention and at the 36th&#xD;
      GW. At the same time points, anthropometric and BP measurements will be taken. Women will&#xD;
      also complete a health and lifestyle questionnaire and a 4-day dietary record. Samples of&#xD;
      cord blood, umbilical cord and placenta will be collected after delivery and anthropometric&#xD;
      parameters of the newborns will be retrieved postpartum. Maternal and infant BP will be&#xD;
      measured 2-4 months after birth. In parallel with the intervention trial, age-matched&#xD;
      pregnant women who do not carry the variant gene (CC genotype) and have not been randomized&#xD;
      to treatment, will be monitored in order to control for any changes associated with normal&#xD;
      pregnancy in the study outcome measurements. In the pilot phase, the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the study procedures and treatment will be evaluated for clarification of&#xD;
      the sample size and refinement of the study protocol.&#xD;

      The overall aim of this study is to investigate the role of a common genetic polymorphism in&#xD;
      folate metabolism, MTHFR 677C→T, on blood pressure (BP) during pregnancy and the impact of&#xD;
      B-vitamin supplementation as a non-drug approach for the management of BP in pregnancy in&#xD;
      women with variant TT genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate BP in relation to MTHFR 677C→T polymorphism in pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the response of BP during pregnancy to supplementation with riboflavin&#xD;
           (5mg/d) alone, or in combination with 5-MTHF (400μg/d), targeted at women with the TT&#xD;
           genotype;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the effect of maternal supplementation with riboflavin (5mg/d) alone, or in&#xD;
           combination with 5-MTHF (400μg/d), on BP of the offspring at 2-4 months after birth in&#xD;
           relation to this polymorphism;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the study procedures to inform for the&#xD;
           required sample size and refinements of the study protocol (pilot phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BP will be higher in women with the TT genotype compared to those with CT and CC&#xD;
           genotype;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Targeted supplementation with riboflavin during pregnancy will prevent the greater&#xD;
           increase in BP observed in TT women compared to women with CC or CT genotypes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Supplementation with riboflavin in combination with 5-MTHF maybe more effective in&#xD;
           preventing the greater increase in BP observed in TT women compared to women with CC or&#xD;
           CT genotypes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Maternal supplementation with riboflavin, alone or riboflavin in combination with&#xD;
           5-MTHF, will influence the BP of newborns with TT genotype. In non-supplemented mothers,&#xD;
           newborns with the TT genotype will have higher BP compared to newborns with CC and CT&#xD;
           genotype. In supplemented mothers no genotype differences in newborns will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In advance of their first antenatal appointment, participants will receive a participant&#xD;
      information sheet from their obstetrician and those who are interested in the study will be&#xD;
      referred by the staff at antenatal clinics to the OptiPREG research team. At baseline,&#xD;
      pregnant women will provide a signed informed consent. Women with a singleton pregnancy who&#xD;
      are in their first trimester of pregnancy will be eligible to take part in the study.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be: a high-risk pregnancy; a previous neural tube defect&#xD;
      (NTD)-affected pregnancy or being the first degree relative of a woman who had a pregnancy&#xD;
      affected with an NTD, or are themselves a sufferer of an NTD; use of medication known to&#xD;
      interfere with B vitamin metabolism (Chloramphenicol, Methotrexate, Metformin, Sulfasalazine,&#xD;
      Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Primidone, Triamterene, Barbiturates). Those women who are eligible&#xD;
      to take part in the study will provide at baseline a buccal swab to collect DNA for MTHFR&#xD;
      genotyping, a non-fasting blood sample, and will have BP measured, along with weight and&#xD;
      height measurements and will complete a health and lifestyle questionnaire and a 4-day food&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 16th gestational week (GW), women with the TT genotype will be matched for age and&#xD;
      systolic BP to women with the CT and CC genotypes. Although the primary purpose of the&#xD;
      OptiPREG trial is to examine the effect of riboflavin intervention on BP in women with the TT&#xD;
      genotype, those with the CT genotype will be also randomised to intervention (in a parallel&#xD;
      trial). The purpose of this arm of the trial (in the CT genotype group) will be to identify&#xD;
      any potential foetuses with the TT genotype so that their BP, and the impact of maternal B&#xD;
      vitamin intervention, can be investigated. Within each genotype group (TT and CT), women will&#xD;
      be stratified by systolic BP and age and will be randomized to receive 5 mg/day riboflavin,&#xD;
      alone or in combination with 5-MTHF at 400µg/day, or placebo, until the end of pregnancy. In&#xD;
      order to encourage maximal compliance, participants will be contacted regularly and provided&#xD;
      with supplements in blister packs every 6 weeks during the intervention, and will be asked to&#xD;
      return the blister packs; the number of unused capsules will be recorded to monitor&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second appointment will be organised at approximately the 36th GW when participants will&#xD;
      provide a second non-fasting blood sample, will have BP and weight measurements taken and&#xD;
      will provide information regarding any changes in health status, lifestyle and medication&#xD;
      usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following delivery, cord blood sample will be collected; dimensions and the weight of&#xD;
      placenta will be measured, and placenta samples will be collected, together with a small&#xD;
      section of the umbilical cord. The weight and length of the newborn, as well as the type of&#xD;
      delivery and any complications in late pregnancy and birth will be retrieved from the mothers&#xD;
      records postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel with the TT and CT women on intervention, age-matched pregnant women with the CC&#xD;
      genotype (not on intervention) will be monitored at the same time points (8-15 GW; 36 GW) in&#xD;
      order to control for any changes in BP and other study outcome measurements associated with&#xD;
      normal pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother-child pairs will be visited at home when the baby is 2-4 months old. Weight, length&#xD;
      and BP of the infant will be measured, and a buccal swab will be taken for MTHFR genotyping.&#xD;
      Maternal BP and weight will be measured and mothers will be asked to provide information on&#xD;
      health and lifestyle, infant feeding practice and health status.&#xD;
