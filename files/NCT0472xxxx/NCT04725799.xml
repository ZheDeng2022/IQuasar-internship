      The objective of this research is to determine the most informative variables for detecting&#xD;
      exercise, acute stress and sleep, identify select sensors that report these variables, and&#xD;
      develop the algorithms to detect the occurrence of exercise, stress and sleep, to&#xD;
      discriminate them and to determine their characteristics. Research is needed to identify&#xD;
      which wearable devices report the most informative and predictive variables of exercise,&#xD;
      acute stress and sleep with desired precision and accuracy, determine the best location to&#xD;
      wear them for collecting reliable and informative data, and to distill accurate knowledge&#xD;
      from data reported by wearable sensors. Data and their interpretation should be informative&#xD;
      for various types of physical activities, stages of sleep, and types and intensities of acute&#xD;
      stress, and concurrent occurrence of these factors. The investigators will use several&#xD;
      devices (chest band, wristband and skin patches) to collect data and evaluate their&#xD;
      information content and contribution to improvement of glucose concentration prediction, best&#xD;
      locations for collecting accurate and reliable information by conducting clinical and&#xD;
      free-living experiments at-home to assess the contributions of the wearable device in&#xD;
      improving the accuracy of glucose concentration prediction and the performance of the&#xD;
      multivariable artificial pancreas.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The focus of the proposed work is to determine the most informative variables for meals,&#xD;
      exercise, acute stress and sleep (MESS), identify select sensors that report these variables,&#xD;
      and develop the algorithms to detect the occurrence of MESS, to discriminate them and to&#xD;
      determine their characteristics. Research is needed to identify which wearable devices report&#xD;
      the most informative and predictive variables of MESS with desired precision and accuracy,&#xD;
      determine the best location to wear them for collecting reliable and informative data, and to&#xD;
      distill accurate knowledge from data reported by wearable sensors. Data and their&#xD;
      interpretation should be informative for various types of physical activities, stages of&#xD;
      sleep, and types and intensities of acute stress, and concurrent occurrence of MESS factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first year of the research, the investigators will use several devices to collect data&#xD;
      and evaluate their information content and contribution to improvement of serum glucose&#xD;
      prediction, best locations for collecting accurate and reliable information, and their&#xD;
      acceptance by users. In the second year of the project, we will select a single wearable&#xD;
      device, conduct additional clinical and free-living experiments at-home to assess the&#xD;
      contributions of the information from the wearable device selected in improving the accuracy&#xD;
      of glucose prediction and the performance of the multivariable AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the proposed research are to determine the most informative variables and&#xD;
      sensor locations to capture reliable and accurate information that complement glucose&#xD;
      concentration measurements (CGM) and to develop algorithms to determine the presence of&#xD;
      exercise, stress or sleep at any given time for estimating glucose concentrations and making&#xD;
      control decisions by a multivariable artificial pancreas system. The proposed research will&#xD;
      be conducted by achieving the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To systematically perturb the MESS factors within standardized experiments in the laboratory&#xD;
      and at home for analyzing their effects and interactions on glucose concentrations; to&#xD;
      identify the most informative and reliable measurement approaches (i.e. types of wearable&#xD;
      sensors and locations on body) for discriminating MESS factors; to develop quantitative&#xD;
      relations that identify the type and features of specific MESS activities, to develop&#xD;
      algorithms to detect the presence of specific MESS activities, identify them, and predict&#xD;
      glucose concentrations with recursive models in real time (for future integration with&#xD;
      adaptive AP control systems); and to evaluate the performance of the multivariable models&#xD;
      with data from wearable devices and CGM in closed-loop control with AP during exploratory&#xD;
      clinical experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place over a period of 3-4 weeks for a total of 6 study visits. The&#xD;
      subjects will be continuously monitored using CGM (DEXCOM [US G5 PLATINUM]); 3 activity of&#xD;
      the following activity monitor(s); (Empatica E4, BiostampRC™, Equivital™ Life Monitor) and&#xD;
      Actigraph throughout the night. In addition, the subjects will use a sleep monitor (Zmachine®&#xD;
      Insight &amp; Insight+ Model DT-200 and Zephyr Bioharness) throughout the 3-week period. Subjects&#xD;
      will come in for a study visit 3 times during the first week during which the investigators&#xD;
      will measure the subjects' oxygen capacity and muscular strength during a peak exercise&#xD;
      stress test (peak V02) and a test of maximal muscle strength (1-RM), respectively. The&#xD;
      results of this testing will establish a baseline from which we can calculate the intensity&#xD;
      of submaximal aerobic and resistance exercise bouts. The next 3 study visits will occur over&#xD;
      the following 3-4 weeks. During this time the subjects will perform activities that produce&#xD;
      physiological and psychological stress alone, in combination or proximal to each other. Women&#xD;
      will have a urine pregnancy test before each day of data collection. In addition, the&#xD;
      subjects will perform a number of physical activities at home that will be scheduled with the&#xD;
      research assistant. The research assistant will telephone the subjects periodically and have&#xD;
      the subjects perform stressful activities, such as mental challenges.&#xD;
