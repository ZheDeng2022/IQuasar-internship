    <textblock>
      Western medicine, as to disease detection, is based on histological pathology and organ&#xD;
      anatomy, therefore biochemistry and medical imageology were developed to determine the&#xD;
      location and mechanism of the sickness. Chinese medicine, in the other way around, follow the&#xD;
      harmony between man and nature, creating four ways of diagnosis, namely looking, listening,&#xD;
      questioning and pulse feeling, which evaluate the physiological homeostasis by the yin-yang&#xD;
      of qi and blood, further judging the energy exchange between individual and the universe.&#xD;

      Western medicine, as to disease detection, is based on histological pathology and organ&#xD;
      anatomy, therefore biochemistry and medical imageology were developed to determine the&#xD;
      location and mechanism of the sickness. Chinese medicine, in the other way around, follow the&#xD;
      harmony between man and nature, creating four ways of diagnosis, namely looking, listening,&#xD;
      questioning and pulse feeling, which evaluate the physiological homeostasis by the yin-yang&#xD;
      of qi and blood, further judging the energy exchange between individual and the universe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse sound provides perfect detection of disease in Chinese medicine. Hence we plan to&#xD;
      digitalize the pulse sound for a better interpretation of the sickness. According to past&#xD;
      studies of pulse sound from radial artery, the lower frequency is below 25Hz, which falls&#xD;
      into the detection range of Messener's corpuscles (2-80Hz), which are located intensively in&#xD;
      index and middle fingers. However, radial artery is relative thinner and the pulse sound is&#xD;
      not easy to target by the microphone, not to mention the interference from artery sclerosis.&#xD;
      To this end our research group developed Phonocardiac spectrometry (PCS) to replace the&#xD;
      traditional pulse instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since heart beats continuously, we hypothesize that each organ is regularly sending the&#xD;
      signal back to heart, which modulate the contraction and beating of heart, reflecting&#xD;
      different state of each organ. Heart is just like the commander of an orchestra band, who can&#xD;
      direct the rhythm and style of the band by the music score and instruments. Once the&#xD;
      instrument is damaged, the commander (heart) also adjusts himself. PCS can easily locate the&#xD;
      pulse sound, and directly detect and analyze the cardiac spectrum. The real-time state in&#xD;
      heart-organ axis can be readily monitored, recorded and investigated by PCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary analysis focuses on patients with liver and pancreatic cancers. The results&#xD;
      demonstrate the different pattern of cardiac spectrum between patients and normal people,&#xD;
      which can be further sorted by disease types. By applying PCS measurement and the novel&#xD;
      algorithm calculation to various diseases, we aim to build up a novel platform for disease&#xD;
      screening or even diagnosis.&#xD;
