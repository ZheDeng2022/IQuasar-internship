  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab is approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric cancer.&#xD;
      The recent study showed that HER2 overexpression or amplification is noted about 5-15% of&#xD;
      total biliary tract cancer patients and have shown efficacy in small basket trials. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in the combination of&#xD;
      mFOLFOX for gemcitabine+cisplatin refractory biliary tract cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study is designed to see whether trastuzumab-pkrb+FOLFOX is active as 2nd or&#xD;
      3rd line treatment for HER2-positive biliary tract cancer patients.&#xD;
