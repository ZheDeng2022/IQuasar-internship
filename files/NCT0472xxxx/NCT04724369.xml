  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study evaluating the positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical 18F-mFBG as an&#xD;
      imaging agent for confirming or excluding the presence of neuroblastoma&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Phase 3, multi-center, open-label study designed to assess the use of&#xD;
      18F-mFBG PET imaging in subjects with known or presumed neuroblastoma. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will have either histopathologically established diagnosis of neuroblastoma or a presumed&#xD;
      diagnosis based on signs, symptoms, physical examination, imaging findings, and laboratory&#xD;
      and genetic test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will only be administered 18F-mFBG if they have undergone or are scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo a 123I-mIBG or 18F-FDG scan within 30 days of the date of the 18F-mFBG scan. Subjects&#xD;
      should not have received any chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy between the clinical&#xD;
      and 18F-mFBG imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-mFBG PET studies and clinical 123I-mIBG scans will be evaluated off-site by 3 independent&#xD;
      radiologists and/or nuclear medicine physicians who are blinded to all subject information.&#xD;
      Blinded readers will record whether findings on 18F-mFBG and 123I-mIBG scans are consistent&#xD;
      with presence of neuroblastoma (Disease +) or absence of disease (Disease -).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject-level diagnostic performance will be assessed on the basis of positive and negative&#xD;
      percent agreement (PPA and NPA) between the blinded 18F-mFBG scan interpretations and disease&#xD;
      status (+ or - for neuroblastoma) as independently assessed by an Expert Panel of pediatric&#xD;
      oncologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy analyses will compare PPA and NPA between 18F-mFBG and 123I-mIBG&#xD;
      interpretations provided by the blinded readers.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. a) An established diagnosis of neuroblastoma based on unequivocal histopathology from&#xD;
             tissue obtained at any time prior to enrolment in the trial; OR b) A presumed&#xD;
             diagnosis of neuroblastoma based on signs, symptoms, physical examination, imaging&#xD;
             findings, and laboratory and genetic test results, including individuals in whom&#xD;
             therapy has already been empirically initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has undergone or is scheduled to undergo evaluation of neuroblastoma&#xD;
             disease status, including at least one functional imaging study (123I-mIBG or&#xD;
             18F-FDG), within 30 days prior to the date of 18F-mFBG imaging, with no interval&#xD;
             therapy between such evaluation and investigational drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability of subject or subject's legal guardian to understand and sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document, including, for subjects age 7-17, an assent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject was previously entered into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject is pregnant, breast feeding, or menarchal and unwilling to use effective&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. The subject has a history or suspicion of significant allergic reaction or anaphylaxis&#xD;
             to any components of the 18F-mFBG imaging agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject is unable to lie flat or remain still for approximately 30 minutes to&#xD;
             allow performance of a PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject uses medications that are known to interfere with uptake of NET-dependent&#xD;
             agents and these medications cannot be safely withheld 24 hours before study&#xD;
