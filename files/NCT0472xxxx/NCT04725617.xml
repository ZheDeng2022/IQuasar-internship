  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use a parallel group, randomized controlled trial to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of a 13-week personalized approach to reducing smoking intervention versus a second&#xD;
      approach using a different health intervention on smoking cessation, healthy sleep metrics,&#xD;
      and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in a sample of 200 treatment-seeking smokers who are&#xD;
      adults living with HIV (ALHIV). To enroll in the study, treatment-seeking ALHIV smokers will&#xD;
      undergo phone and in-person study eligibility assessments, including a history, physical&#xD;
      examination, screening laboratory tests, and an overnight in-home objective sleep assessment.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects (N=200) will be randomized to the 13-week Approach 1 (N=100) or Approach 2&#xD;
      (N=100) condition. All subjects will receive a 12-week course of varenicline (beginning in&#xD;
      week 2) and 8 individual 15-minute smoking cessation counseling sessions [weeks 1, 2, 3&#xD;
      (target quit date), 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]. At each in-person counseling session, 30-45 minutes of&#xD;
      Approach 1 or Approach 2 counseling will be provided as well. While receiving varenicline,&#xD;
      liver function tests will be monitored at least monthly, and blood pressure at each study&#xD;
      visit for safety reasons. Study measures are collected at all time points including EOT (week&#xD;
      13), and 6-month follow-up (6MFU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking among adults living with HIV (ALHIV) is a significant public health&#xD;
      problem, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality in this population. Existing smoking&#xD;
      cessation interventions are not sufficient, as success rates are relatively low. Poor sleep&#xD;
      is more prevalent among smokers, more prevalent among ALHIV, can be caused by smoking&#xD;
      cessation attempts, predicts relapse to former smoking patterns, and represents a parallel&#xD;
      pathway to morbidity including increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) among ALHIV. Thus,&#xD;
      unhealthy sleep may make smoking cessation more difficult and increase cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      and other poor health conditions in ALHIV. The proposed study will supplement an&#xD;
      empirically-supported smoking cessation program (8-session, 13-week counseling program with&#xD;
      varenicline) with a pre-determined behavioral health approach to reducing smoking&#xD;
      intervention developed for smokers. The investigators will test the efficacy of behavioral&#xD;
      health approach 1 versus behavioral health approach 2 as an active comparator. The&#xD;
      investigators will also explore the impact of smoking cessation and changes in sleep on&#xD;
      changes in inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Approximately 400 ALHIV&#xD;
      treatment seeking smokers who have no history of sleep disorders will be screened (through&#xD;
      history, physical examination, laboratory studies and an overnight sleep test) to identify&#xD;
      200 eligible subjects to randomize to Intervention Approach 1 versus Intervention Approach 2.&#xD;
      All participants will concurrently receive standard smoking cessation treatment including&#xD;
      counseling and 12-weeks of varenicline. Screening and treatment sessions will take place at&#xD;
      the University of Arizona's Clinical and Translational Sciences Research Center, which is&#xD;
      well equipped with private examination rooms and phlebotomists. Successful smoking cessation&#xD;
      will be assessed at end of therapy (13 weeks) and again 6 months later by self reports,&#xD;
      carbon monoxide breath test, and urine cotinine, a stringent objective marker of tobacco use.&#xD;
      Sleep will be assessed through sleep diaries, questionnaires and actigraphy (activity sensors&#xD;
      worn on the wrist). Other markers of CVD risk including lipids, 24 hour blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring, and HgbA1C, and biomarkers (IL-6, hsCRP, TNFalpha,ICAM-1, VCAM-1, sCD14, D-dimer)&#xD;
      will be determined at baseline, end of therapy, and 6 months follow up. Cognitive function&#xD;
      will be assessed through N-Back (uses images), Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), Abstract&#xD;
      Matching (AM), and Matrix Reasoning Task (MRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the impact of this work will be to transform clinical guidelines for the&#xD;
      treatment of nicotine dependence, as well as to provide insights into mechanisms by which&#xD;
      improved sleep enhances tobacco cessation.&#xD;
