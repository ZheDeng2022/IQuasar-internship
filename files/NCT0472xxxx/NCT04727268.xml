    <textblock>
      This study will collect genetic and clinical information of junctional epidermolysis bullosa&#xD;
      (JEB) patients. Computer analysis will be performed on genetic mutations found in these&#xD;
      patients and this will be correlated with their clinical characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a rare genetic skin disease where genetic defects&#xD;
      in skin proteins result in extensive blistering in response to mild mechanical stress.&#xD;
      Patients are often affected at birth or from early childhood, and suffer from varying degrees&#xD;
      of severity depending on the specific mutations that they have and the proteins that are&#xD;
      affected. This ranges from severe widespread blistering and death within the first few years&#xD;
      of life, to minimal localised blistering and survival to adulthood. Diagnosis is confirmed by&#xD;
      genetic testing, and this is often used to predict the likely clinical course. However, it is&#xD;
      not always straightforward to make accurate predictions from genetic information, as our&#xD;
      understanding of these proteins and mutations at the molecular level is currently incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this project is to systematically collect genetic and clinical data of&#xD;
      junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) patients and to explore whether there are any&#xD;
      relationships between participants' genetic defects and the severity of disease. This will&#xD;
      help in establishing links between genetic defects and clinical characteristics, which is&#xD;
      essential for accurate prognostication, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also aim to develop pipelines for analysis of how mutations may affect&#xD;
      corresponding protein structure and function using computer prediction tools. This will&#xD;
      improve our understanding of how these proteins function, and could partly explain the&#xD;
      variation in disease severity of patients with this condition. It could also lead to&#xD;
      identification of important regions of the protein, which could be investigated further in&#xD;
      subsequent studies.&#xD;
