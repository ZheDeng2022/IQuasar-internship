  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Develop new real-world evidence indicators of worsening and improving asthma. Scientists will&#xD;
      measure (1) steps per day, (2) duration and intensity of exercise per day, (3) sleep duration&#xD;
      and the number of awakenings per night using Fitbit activity trackers. Scientists will&#xD;
      measure asthma symptoms using a once-monthly custom survey delivered to participant&#xD;
      smartphones via Twilio. Scientists may measure rescue medication use and adherence to&#xD;
      maintenance medications using digital inhaler devices. Scientists will correlate the above&#xD;
      measures to participant-reported significant asthma exacerbations (SAEs), lung function&#xD;
      (FEV1), and standardized surveys (i.e. the asthma control test (ACT) and global evaluation of&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness (GETE)(4)) collected in clinic every 3 months. Coordinators will&#xD;
      record any medication changes or reported medication side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine response to omalizumab therapy. After participants are placed on omalizumab therapy&#xD;
      as part of standard medical care, scientists will determine whether and how real-world&#xD;
      evidence can be used to gauge responses to omalizumab. Then, scientists will determine which&#xD;
      features, or combination of features, are the best indicators of disease control in the real&#xD;
      world.&#xD;

    <description>A protocol-defined asthma exacerbation was defined as worsening of asthma symptoms requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids for 3 or more days; for participants receiving long-term oral corticosteroids, an exacerbation was a 20 mg or more increase in average daily dose of oral prednisone (or a similar dose of another systemic corticosteroid). The rate of protocol-defined asthma exacerbations, normalized by subject-time at risk and computed over the 24 observation or 52-week treatment period in each treatment group.</description>
