  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1a, first in human study in which healthy adult participants who are&#xD;
      considered to be at low-risk for HIV infection and are seropositive for cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
      will receive two doses of VIR-1111 or placebo. These participants will be assessed for&#xD;
      safety, reactogenicity, tolerability and immunogenicity. There is an optional long-term&#xD;
      follow-up study that would lengthen study participation for up to 3 years post-first dose.&#xD;
