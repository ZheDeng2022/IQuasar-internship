Patients with primary lower extremity varicose veins were treated with endovenous microwave therapy using Microwave Ablation Therapy Apparatus. Ultrasound examination and questionnaire survey（AVVQ and VCSS) were performed at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment,drug use and adverse events were recorded to assess complications and target lesion closure rate.</description>
