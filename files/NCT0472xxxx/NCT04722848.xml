  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, open-label, multicenter, phase III study for adult de novo Ph+ ALL&#xD;
      patients based on the combination of Ponatinib with Blinatumomab. The control arm will be&#xD;
      represented by a chemotherapeutic scheme combined with Imatinib for patients aged 18-65 and&#xD;
      by Imatinib plus age-adjusted chemotherapy for elderly patients (&gt;65 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive the experimental or control arm. If patients in&#xD;
      the control arm do not achieve a CHR and/or MRD negativity, after the sixth consolidation&#xD;
      cycle (week 20), a crossover to receive Blinatumomab is planned. Likewise, if patients in the&#xD;
      control arm develop an ABL1 mutation at any time of treatment, they will switch to&#xD;
      experimental arm. HLA typing will be performed immediately after diagnosis in both arms for&#xD;
      patients aged up to 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 2 cycles of Blinatumomab in the experimental arm and after consolidation in the&#xD;
      control arm, patients aged 18-65 will be stratified for transplant allocation.&#xD;

    <description>Patients aged 18-65 will receive Ponatinib at the dose of 45 mg/day for the first 22 days and then will reduce the dose to 30 mg (depending on the morphologic and molecular response), whereas patients older than 65 years will start Ponatinib at 30 mg/day, in order to avoid TAEs. Patients will continue treatment with Ponatinib up to day 70 (10 weeks of treatment), except for disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal from study. Thereafter:&#xD;
Patients will receive Blinatumomab (minimum 2 cycles, up to a maximum of 5).&#xD;
Patients not achieving a CHR after 2 cycles of Blinatumomab will go off-study. After the 2 cycles of Blinatumomab patients aged 18-65 will be stratified for transplant allocation</description>
