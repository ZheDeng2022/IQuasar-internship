  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leaders in organizations must handle organizational complexity and adversity as part of their&#xD;
      position and profession. Work-related risk exposure is associated with perceived stress, low&#xD;
      engagement, and mental health issues. However, not all leaders exposed to risk experience&#xD;
      adverse outcomes, and one possible explanation might be their psychological ability to adapt&#xD;
      to the organizational turbulence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engaged and Resilient is a research project for leaders in private and public organizations.&#xD;
      The overall objective is to improve human health and performance, more specifically, to&#xD;
      promote psychological and mental health by enhancing the resilience capacities to face&#xD;
      adversity and adapt to the organizational environment. The Engaged and Resilient intervention&#xD;
      is a flexible training program for leaders implemented as a 20-week program on-site.&#xD;

      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves program development, implementation, and evaluation of resilience training&#xD;
      by a randomized controlled research design. The participant will be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group to receive the resilience training program &quot;Engaged and Resilient&quot; or a&#xD;
      wait-list control group to receive the resilience training conducted by internal educated&#xD;
      trainers following the post-intervention measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post measures include mental health, flourishing, perceived stress, resilience (two&#xD;
      scales), and work-related performance. The training effects will be measured after each&#xD;
      training session on a 4-point scale to create knowledge about the specific resilience&#xD;
      promoting factors and the implementation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention project will consist of a didactic component, including an internal trainer&#xD;
      education for the Management/HR and more specific for the participants (leaders):&#xD;
      Psychoeducation, psychological skill-building training, and ongoing homework exercises to&#xD;
      support the implementation of resilience strategies within the organizational context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a flexible (co-customized, co-implemented) resilience training program for&#xD;
           leaders in organizations structured as thee general resilience factors with specific&#xD;
           training sessions within each&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To implement a resilience intervention for leaders in public and private Danish&#xD;
           organizational environments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate outcome effects on human health and performance. Primary in terms of&#xD;
           mental health and well-being, and secondary in perceived stress, resilience,&#xD;
           work-related performance, and sick-leave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide evidence of specific resilience factors promoting positive mental health and&#xD;
           well-being longitudinally (20 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create knowledge about the implementation and change process by ongoing participant&#xD;
           evaluation of the specific training sessions&#xD;

    <description>Engaged and Resilient is a 3-phase program addressing the promotion of psychological resilience strategies for leaders.&#xD;
To implement resilience training as a strategic and ethical intervention in the organization, stakeholders from Management/HR will be involved in the final design of the training program based on local institutional data, and the baseline measure result. Local training sessions will be selected from a bag-log of resilience skills structured by three general resilience factors.&#xD;
To support ownership and internal sustainability, internal trainers will be educated on how to train the resilience skills in the program.&#xD;
The Engaged and Resilient program consists of 20 short-term sessions for leaders based on cognitive and positive psychology.</description>
