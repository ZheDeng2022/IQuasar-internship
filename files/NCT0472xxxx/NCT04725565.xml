    <textblock>
      Oncologists are increasingly using genomic sequencing to diagnose and optimize care for their&#xD;
      patients. A consequence of this technology is its capacity to detect a patient's risk for&#xD;
      thousands of current and future conditions or diseases. Guidelines recommend doctors allow&#xD;
      patients to choose which results they wish to receive before ordering the test. It is not&#xD;
      feasible to counsel patients on the thousands of possible results because of the limited&#xD;
      clinical resources and genomics expertise. Decision aids (DAs) can fill this gap, however&#xD;
      there are no DAs to guide patients' decisions about results from genomic sequencing. A DA&#xD;
      prototype was developed (GenomicsADvISER.com), the first DA of its kind. This study will&#xD;
      transform the DA prototype into an interactive, adaptable and patient-centred digital&#xD;
      decision support tool (Genetics ADvISER) via user-centred design methods. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Genetics ADvISER in an RCT with patients being&#xD;
      offered results from genomic sequencing. Results of this trial will be used to establish&#xD;
      whether the Genetics ADvISER is effective to use in practice. This could fill a critical&#xD;
      clinical care gap, improve health outcomes and service use by reducing counselling burden as&#xD;
      well as overuse, underuse and misuse - concerns of policy makers seeking to address the&#xD;
      triple aims of health care.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Genomic sequencing (GS) is a driver of precision oncology. Oncologists are&#xD;
      increasingly using tumour GS for precision oncology care, which is often times accompanied by&#xD;
      germline GS on normal control tissue. One complex feature of this technology is its capacity&#xD;
      to generate incidental findings (IF). Guidelines recommend doctors inform patients of their&#xD;
      incidental GS results. Yet there are limited tools to communicate the scope and implications&#xD;
      of the thousands incidental results available to help guide patients' decisions about which&#xD;
      results they wish to learn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE: There are limited decision support tools in genetics. Despite the long-standing&#xD;
      practice of medical genetics, there are relatively few decision support tools for genetic&#xD;
      testing and very few that have been rigorously evaluated. Even fewer decision support tools&#xD;
      exist on possible results from genomic sequencing; existing tools target pediatric contexts,&#xD;
      focus on genomic sequencing education-only or on the return of results; they do not cover all&#xD;
      possible results with decision support to simulate genetic counselling, limiting their use&#xD;
      and applicability in clinical care. Thus, there are no decision support tools to guide&#xD;
      patients about all results available from genomic sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness of the Genetics ADvISER vs standard genetic counseling&#xD;
      (GC) with patients receiving incidental findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Use of the Genetics ADvISER will reduce patients' decisional conflict &amp; anxiety,&#xD;
      improve patient knowledge, satisfaction with decisions and preparedness for decision-making&#xD;
      when selecting IF compared to GC alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1: RCT to evaluate the Decision Aid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a mixed method, non-blinded randomized controlled superiority trial. We will&#xD;
      evaluate whether use of the Genetics ADvISER followed by Genetic Counsellor (GC) reduces&#xD;
      decisional conflict compared to GC alone in a RCT. As a part of this trial, patients will&#xD;
      receive results from exome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult cancer patients who have had GS for their cancer (but did not receive&#xD;
      incidental findings) or adult patients who have had a negative genetic panel test and may&#xD;
      eligible for GS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: The primary outcome is decisional conflict; the study requires 64 patients/arm (128&#xD;
      total) to detect the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.3 using the&#xD;
      Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), assuming a standard deviation of 0.6, an alpha of 0.05&#xD;
      (two-sided) and power of 0.8. Participants will be consecutively randomized and allocated&#xD;
      from an existing list of eligible subjects using a computer-generated randomization in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio with random permuted blocks of varying sizes. Patients from each clinic will be&#xD;
      randomized separately to ensure we have an even distribution of this population in both arms&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants in the intervention arm will use the Genetics ADviSER to learn&#xD;
      about GS, select which results they would like to receive and to receive their GS results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: Participants in the control arm will speak with a genetic counsellor to learn about&#xD;
      GS, select which results they would like to receive and to receive their GS results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and measures: The primary outcome is decisional conflict, assessed via the validated&#xD;
      Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) consistent with the ODSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Knowledge, measured using an established questionnaire assessing benefits&#xD;
      and limitations of genome sequencing and a set of internally developed knowledge questions on&#xD;
      IF; Satisfaction with decision-making, measured using the Satisfaction with Decision scale&#xD;
      and the Preparation for Decision Making scale; Anxiety, measured using the state subscale of&#xD;
      the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. All sessions will be recorded to assess the length of GC&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Analysis: The analysis of outcomes will follow the intention-to-treat approach.&#xD;
      Mean scores for decisional conflict, satisfaction with and preparation for decision-making,&#xD;
      knowledge of IF and GC session length will be compared using a t-test. Anxiety, knowledge of&#xD;
      sequencing benefits and sequencing limitations scores will be assessed by summing the number&#xD;
      of correct responses to the questions, and compared adjusting for baseline score using&#xD;
      analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The primary time points of comparison will be (T1) for the&#xD;
      control versus (T2) for the intervention group. Secondary exploratory analyses will examine&#xD;
      the impact that the decision aid had alone (T1), without the addition of follow-up GC at T2&#xD;
      and at T3, after participants have received their IF on decision conflict, knowledge,&#xD;
      anxiety, satisfaction and preparation with decision-making. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      used to describe participants' demographic characteristics (age, sex, education, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2: Qualitative study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the utility the of the Genetics ADvISER and incidental results via&#xD;
      qualitative interviews with participants. After the study is completed, a subset set of&#xD;
      participants (n = 40) will be selected to participate qualitative portion of the study.&#xD;
      Participants approached to complete the qualitative portion of the study will determined by&#xD;
      purposeful sampling, in order to get mix of participants across a range of experiences and&#xD;
      demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Analysis: The qualitative analyses will draw on grounded theory. Open coding,&#xD;
      constant comparison and axial coding will be used to identify common and divergent themes to&#xD;
      characterize the entire dataset. Interviews will consider participants' socio-demographic&#xD;
      factors that may influence their informational and decisional needs as well as how they&#xD;
      engage with genetic information and participate in shared decision making. Two researchers&#xD;
      will code transcripts independently; consensus on codes will be reached through discussion.&#xD;
      Validation methods may include triangulation and member checking. In keeping with qualitative&#xD;
      methodology, data analysis will occur in conjunction with data collection. On-going analysis&#xD;
      will inform the development of progressive iterations of the interview guides.&#xD;
