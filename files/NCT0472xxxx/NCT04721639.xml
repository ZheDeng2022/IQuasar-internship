  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Randomized Controlled trial is designed to observe the effect of Sphinx Yoga (Salamba&#xD;
      Bhujangasana) on low back pain and variation in the associated physiological parameters that&#xD;
      help explain the beneficial effects of yoga, among healthcare providers of Karachi Pakistan.&#xD;
      Healthcare providers with LBP (determined as per the baseline assessment) will be recruited&#xD;
      and Substance P and Beta Endorphins will be assessed at baseline and after 3 months. The&#xD;
      subjects with LBP will be determined based on the scores of the Oswestry Low Back Pain&#xD;
      Disability Questionnaire, Numerical Pain Rating (NPR) scale, Roland Morris Disability&#xD;
      Questionnaire (RMDQ) and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) work subscale. Subjects&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly allotted to intervention and control groups.&#xD;
      The study outcomes will be monitored in subjects of both groups at baseline and after 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up (post-interventional).&#xD;

      Plan of work&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of eligibility &amp; Enrollment: HCPs experiencing LBP as per the eligibility&#xD;
           criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Assessment: All the variables, i.e. Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability&#xD;
           Questionnaire, World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL), Roland Morris&#xD;
           Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and Sadaf Stress Scale (SSS), Substance-P and Beta&#xD;
           Endorphins will be measured at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization &amp; Allocation: Eligible consenting subjects will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
           the experimental or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Assessment: All the outcome measures observed at baseline will be re-assessed&#xD;
           after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical Analysis: Pre &amp; post-analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study will be conducted as a Randomized Controlled trial at a primary&#xD;
      healthcare setting. The participant eligibility will be assessed using a pre-screening&#xD;
      questionnaire including components of disability questionnaires. Based on the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, consenting HCPs will be recruited and randomized into two groups i.e. Group A&#xD;
      (experimental) including participants who will receive the intervention and Group B (control)&#xD;
      receiving no intervention. The study outcomes will be monitored among participants of both&#xD;
      groups at baseline and post-intervention (3-month follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Healthcare providers with LBP will be recruited with no restriction for&#xD;
      ethnicity or race. The participants from diverse socio-cultural backgrounds will be&#xD;
      considered eligible if they meet the inclusion criteria. The study objective will be&#xD;
      explained and participants will be invited to participate based on their free-will.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Size The required sample size for the two study groups with α = 0.05 and (1- α) =&#xD;
      0.80, was estimated to be 49 in each group i.e. the total sample size was 98 for two groups.&#xD;
      The sample size calculator provided by the UCSF CTSI was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After assessing the eligibility the participants will be randomly allocated in&#xD;
      the ratio of 1:1 to the study groups (experimental and control). The randomization sequence&#xD;
      will be computer-generated. After acquiring the basic information, a unique code will be&#xD;
      assigned to each of the study participants which will then be mentioned in their Performa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions • The experimental intervention: The Group A participants will be intervened&#xD;
      with Sphinx Yoga therapy which will take place in a conserved therapy center of Koohi Goth&#xD;
      Hospital. This stretching exercise session will take place in the afternoon and for a&#xD;
      duration of 10 minutes followed by 30 minutes therapy session five times per week (total 12&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The control intervention: Group B participants won't be receiving any intervention and&#xD;
      provided with the usual care.&#xD;

    <description>Sphinx Pose Yoga is among the best beginner Yoga Poses that relieve Lower Back Pain. It extends the back gently and activates muscles along the spine. The subject will be asked to lay down on their stomach with feet set hip-width apart, the elbows positioned under the shoulders, and the legs held together. The chin should be pointing towards the floor. Next, the subject is required to pull up the kneecaps, squeezing the thighs and buttocks, pressing the pubic bone into the floor and dropping shoulders back away from the neck and pushing the chest forward. In this position, the subject is asked to breathe and hold the pose for two to six breaths. By the end, the subject will be required to exhale, bringing the elbows to the sides and slowly lowering the chest and head to the floor.</description>
