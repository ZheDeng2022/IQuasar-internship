  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal models of Kabuki syndrome have showed a reversal of the cognitive phenotype with&#xD;
      ketogenic diet. Modified Atkins diet is safer and easier tolerated than full ketogenic diet&#xD;
      and still has the histone deacetylase inhibition believed to be responsible for the cognitive&#xD;
      improvement. This study aims to examine a small number of adults with Kabuki syndrome before&#xD;
      and after 12 weeks on a modified Atkins diet to determine if there is any cognitive&#xD;
      improvement and if the diet can be tolerated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Consented participants will participate in an initial 2 day study visit. These participants&#xD;
      will undergo cognitive and neurobehavioral testing and also will have baseline labs drawn and&#xD;
      will meet with a Johns Hopkins nutritionist trained in modified Atkins diet for education.&#xD;
      The labs are standard of care for diet initiation to rule out contraindications to the diet.&#xD;
      Participants and/or their caregivers will keep a daily diet log and will be asked to download&#xD;
      the free Carb Manager application onto their smartphone. They will send the logs and data&#xD;
      back weekly. Participants will be given urine ketone strips and asked to use and record in&#xD;
      their diet log twice weekly. Participants will have blood and urine samples collected locally&#xD;
      every 3 weeks and sent back to study team to measure Beta-hydroxybutyrate, metabolic studies&#xD;
      and methylation. Participants will return to Baltimore at the end of 12 weeks for a one day&#xD;
      visit to repeat the cognitive assessment protocol, neurobehavioral measures, and repeat the&#xD;
      initial and follow up lab tests.&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DNA Methylation analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 weeks for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measure genome-wide methylation signature in blood of participants. To obtain genome-scale methylation measurements, bisulfite treated DNA from patient blood samples will be processed on the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip at the Johns Hopkins SNP Center in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip measures DNA methylation levels at 485,512 loci across the genome. The array data will then be analyzed to get the proportion of methylation at a given CpG site from 0 to 1. These will be logit transformed to create M-values. Kabuki syndrome is known to have a unique signature methylation profile (determined by M-values across loci) that can be detected in blood. This genome wide DNA methylation will be done every 3 weeks to determine whether this signature changes with dietary therapy.</description>
