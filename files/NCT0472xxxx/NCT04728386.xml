    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effect of 2% curcumin solution versus 2.5% sodium hypochlorite&#xD;
      as irrigating solutions in necrotic mandibular molars in terms of postoperative pain and&#xD;
      antibacterial effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      patients with necrotic mandibular molars will be selected&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnostic procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Personal information (name, age, gender, address and phone number), full medical&#xD;
                and dental histories using schematic charts will be obtained from all patients&#xD;
                participating in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of chief complaint will be obtained in the dental history chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical and radiographic evaluation for each tooth included in this study will be&#xD;
                recorded. The tooth will be examined for presence of extensive caries or pulp&#xD;
                exposures. Soft tissue examination and tooth mobility evaluation will be done by&#xD;
                percussion and palpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Extraoral examination will be performed by visual inspection of the face and neck&#xD;
                and palpation for any swollen lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each tooth will be evaluated for sensitivity using electric pulp tester. Diagnosis&#xD;
                will also be confirmed by the absence of bleeding after access cavity preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Final Diagnosis: Mature mandibular asymptomatic necrotic molars with normal&#xD;
                periapical radiographic appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The operator will explicitly explain the trial steps to the patients, and an&#xD;
                informed consent will be signed by patients who accept enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain scale chart will be given to each patient to rate his /her pain level before&#xD;
                endodontic treatment as preoperative reading using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endodontic procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All the performed steps of root canal treatment will be included in the chart of&#xD;
                endodontic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The tooth will be isolated with rubber dam to maintain aseptic field, after&#xD;
                isolation the tooth and surrounding field will be disinfected by a protocol using&#xD;
                3% hydrogen peroxide and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite before and after coronal access&#xD;
                cavity preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The initial sample S1 will be collected from root canals before preparation using&#xD;
                sterile paper points. Each root canal will be dried with 3 sterile paper points&#xD;
                ISO# 15 which will be left inside the root canal for 1 minute each with pumping&#xD;
                movements to generate a suspension with bacteria of the main pulpal area.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The paper points will be immediately placed in sterile test tubes containing&#xD;
                reduced transport medium of thioglycolate and sent to the Microbiology Laboratory,&#xD;
                Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University for microbiologic processing to be cultured&#xD;
                within one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Root canals will be mechanically prepared in a crown-down approach using ProTaper&#xD;
                Universal NiTi files in an X-Smart endodontic motor according to the manufacture&#xD;
                instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The canals will be thoroughly irrigated between every two subsequent files using 2&#xD;
                ml of 2.5% NaOCl using a side vented needle (gauge 29) to control the possibility&#xD;
                of irrigant apical extrusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After complete root canal preparation all canals will be flushed with 17 % EDTA&#xD;
                followed by sterile saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Random allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  According to the randomization sequence, after complete root canal preparation&#xD;
                patients will be assigned to one of 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Intervention Group (G1): each canal will be flushed using 5 ml of curcumin&#xD;
                     solution in a plastic syringe with a side vented needle (gauge 29) inserted 1&#xD;
                     ml shorter than the working length.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Comparator Group (G2): each canal will be flushed using 5 ml of 2.5% sodium&#xD;
                     hypochlorite in a plastic syringe with side vented needle (gauge 29) inserted&#xD;
                     1 ml shorter than the working length.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After flushing the canals with each irrigating solution all canals will be flushed&#xD;
                with 10 ml sterile saline and the final sample S2 will be collected in the same&#xD;
                manner as S1 using sterile paper points ISO # 30/0.02 or # 40/0.02, corresponding&#xD;
                to the size of the master apical file F3 or F4, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Root canals will be dried using ProTaper paper points. The root canals will be&#xD;
                obturated using the modified single cone technique with resin based root canal&#xD;
                sealer and ProTaper gutta-percha cones size F3 or F4 according to the size of the&#xD;
                final finishing file, together with auxiliary cones ISO # 25/0.02.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After obturation, a cotton pellet will be placed in the pulp chamber and the access&#xD;
                cavity will be sealed with a temporary filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients will be asked to record their postoperative pain level on Numerical&#xD;
                Rating Scale (NRS) at 8, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
