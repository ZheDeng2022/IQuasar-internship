  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of EDDY and manual dynamic activation&#xD;
      (MDA) techniques on postoperative pain (PP) associated in retreatment. Ninety patients&#xD;
      scheduled for retreatment were treated at one visit. After the single visit retreatment&#xD;
      procedure, the patients were divided into two groups (n = 45) on the basis of the need for&#xD;
      additional irrigation activation procedures (EDDY and MDA). The patients' post-treatment pain&#xD;
      levels were asked to rate the intensity of their pain on a 10-point numerical rating scale&#xD;
      (NRS) at 12th, 24th, 48th, and 72th hours and 7 days.&#xD;

      The sample size was based on pilot study data that indicated that 38 patients would be&#xD;
      sufficient for each group (type I alpha error = 5%, effect size = 0.7, power = 80%). To&#xD;
      compensate for possible dropouts during the treatment and/or follow-up periods, 45 patients&#xD;
      were assigned to each group.The study protocol was approved by the Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt&#xD;
      University Ethical Board of Clinical Trials and Non-interventional Research (2019-549).The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healthy individuals aged 18 to 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Devital mandibular premolar teeth with asymptomatic periapical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Teeth with initial root canals filled 2-4 mm short of the apex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Premolar teeth with periapical radiolucency (PAI 3-4) [12] detected by radiographic&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Coronal restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Teeth on which root canal treatment had been performed in the researcher's hospital at&#xD;
           least 4 years prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The use of drugs, such as analgesics, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics, for pain and&#xD;
           infection control in the previous 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A history of susceptibility or adverse reactions to any drugs or materials used in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Teeth with open apexes and resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Teeth with post-core restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Vertical root fractures and teeth on which surgery had been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pregnancy and breastfeeding. A participant voluntary consent form was obtained from each&#xD;
           patient. Ninety patients were numerically coded in computer environment by someone who&#xD;
           was not included in the study for randomization (www.random.org)A single clinician&#xD;
           performed retreatment on each of the 90 teeth during a single visit. A 27-gauge dental&#xD;
           injector (Set Inject; Set Medical Instruments, Istanbul, Turkey) was used to anesthetize&#xD;
           the patients with a solution of 40 mg Articain and 0.006 mg/mL epinephrine (Ultracain DS&#xD;
           Forte; Aventis, Istanbul, Turkey). Old restorations and caries were removed, and on the&#xD;
           basis of the straight-line principle, round diamond burs were used to create access&#xD;
           cavities under rubber dam isolation. All subsequent treatment procedures were performed&#xD;
           under rubber dam isolation, and 3.5× (Zumax Sle Loupe) magnification was used. When&#xD;
           necessary, the cervical margin was elevated with composite resin to ensure the&#xD;
           continuity of the isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gutta-percha and sealer were removed with hand files and ProTaper retreatment (Dentsply&#xD;
      Maillefer) files. No solvent was used. The working length was calculated with a ProPex Pixi&#xD;
      apex locater (Dentsply Maillefer). Periapical radiography allowed for the calculation of the&#xD;
      working length and confirmation of the removal of the previous canal filling. Root canals&#xD;
      were enlarged to be ProTaper Universal F3 (30/0.9). A lubricant (Glyde File Prep, Dentsply&#xD;
      DeTrey, GmbH, Konstanz, Germany) was used between each file to prevent the rotary files from&#xD;
      getting stuck in the root canal. A total of 20 mL 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) irrigation&#xD;
      solution (Werax, Izmir, Turkey) was used for each treatment. For all teeth, the final&#xD;
      irrigation was performed with 5 mL 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution&#xD;
      (Werax, Izmir, Turkey) for 1 minute. After the retreatment procedure, the patients were&#xD;
      divided into two groups on the basis of the additional irrigation activation procedures with&#xD;
      6 mL 2.5% NaOCl (n = 45). Information on which irrigation activation methods to use was not&#xD;
      given to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First group (manual dynamic activation): A final rinse with 6 mL 2.5% NaOCl was done&#xD;
      performed after shaping, using a ProTaper Universal F3 (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues,&#xD;
      Switzerland) gutta-percha up and down movements to as 1 mm short from the working length for&#xD;
      1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second group (EDDY): A 28 mm long polyamide tip with 25.04 taper was adapted to TA-200&#xD;
      (Micron, Tokyo, Japan) and operated at 6,000 Hz, the maximum speed setting. It was placed in&#xD;
      the canal 2 mm shorter than the working length. Next, 6 mL 2.5% NaOCl was administered to the&#xD;
      canal in three 20-second activation-nonactivation cycles (2 ml/20 seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The root canals were dried with paper points (Dentsply, Sirona). The working length was&#xD;
      reached with ProTaper Universal F3 gutta-percha (Dentsply, Sirona), and tug-back was taken.&#xD;
      The gutta-percha was covered with a sealer (AH Plus; Dentsply, Sirona), and root canal&#xD;
      fillings were performed with a single-cone technique. After the completion of the root canal&#xD;
      filling procedures, the residual materials were removed with a heat source. A resin composite&#xD;
      (3M, ESPE) was used for the coronal restorations. Occlusal reduction was performed on all the&#xD;
      teeth included in the study. No antibiotics or analgesics were prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient questionnaire The postoperative follow-up and evaluation of the cases were performed&#xD;
      by a researcher who had no knowledge of the study group. A 10-point numerical rating scale&#xD;
      (NRS) was introduced to the patients, and they were asked to rate their post-treatment pain&#xD;
      by telephone after 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. The antibiotics and analgesics were questioned.&#xD;
      The patients were called for clinical examination 1 week later. Palpation and percussion&#xD;
      sensitivity in the treated teeth was determined on the basis of the patients' perceptions of&#xD;
      pain. All percussion tests were performed by the same operator to ensure standardization. The&#xD;
      measurement values were based on the 10-point NRS. The pain scores were placed into the&#xD;
      following four categories: 0 = none, 1-3 = mild, 4-6 = moderate, and 7-10 = severe.&#xD;
