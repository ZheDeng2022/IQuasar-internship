  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, multi-center, randomized controlled study of&#xD;
      80 Parkinson's disease patients with gait and balance disorders in which 40 patients will be&#xD;
      treated with serious games, in addition to their usual care, for 12 months and 40 patients&#xD;
      will be treated with their usual care during this period. This study will be conducted in 4&#xD;
      centers, all of which are expert in the management of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, each patient in the &quot;Intervention-Rehabilitation through Toap Run&quot; group&#xD;
      will have to complete 2 to 3 sessions per week at home with the serious game &quot;TOAP RUN&quot; using&#xD;
      the Kinect® system for 1 year.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, multi-center, randomized controlled study of&#xD;
      80 Parkinson's disease patients with gait and balance disorders in which 40 patients will be&#xD;
      treated with serious games, in addition to their usual care, for 12 months and 40 patients&#xD;
      will be treated with their usual care during this period. This study will be conducted in 4&#xD;
      centers, all of which are expert in the management of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, each patient in the &quot;Intervention-Rehabilitation through Toap Run&quot; group&#xD;
      will have to complete 2 to 3 sessions per week at home with the serious game &quot;TOAP RUN&quot; using&#xD;
      the Kinect® system for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is a medical-economic endpoint: the difference in incremental&#xD;
      cost-utility ratio at 12 months between the 2 groups of patients. Costs will be assessed at&#xD;
      inclusion, at the end of 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints include clinical and&#xD;
      neurophysiological assessments, focusing on gait and balance disorders, as well as cognition&#xD;
      and emotional state. An imaging study for patients included in the Paris-ICM center is also&#xD;
      planned to study the effects of serious game rehabilitation on brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will be free to use SG at the end of the intervention.&#xD;
