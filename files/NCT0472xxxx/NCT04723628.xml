      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of telephone counseling based on the&#xD;
      Information, Motivation, Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM) on self-management and HbA1c. This study was conducted with a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. This study, between January 2019 and September 2019 were conducted in&#xD;
      endocrine clinic. A total of 63 patients (31 interventions, 32 controls) diagnosed with T2DM&#xD;
      were included. The intervention group received 45-60 minutes of patient training based on the&#xD;
      Information, Motivation and Behavioral Skill Model (IMB). A weekly short reminder message and&#xD;
      a two-weekly phone call were made and a total of 12 weeks of follow-up was conducted. As a&#xD;
      result, there was a statistically significant difference between pre-test HbA1c, weight and&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure (p&lt;0.05). Also, after three months of follow-up, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      self-management and self-management perceptions were significantly higher in the intervention&#xD;
      group (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;

    <description>Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the most widely used measure of glycemic control. A blood test was used to obtain HbA1c.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Type 2 Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The lowest score obtainable from the scale is 20, and the highest is 100. In the general evaluation of the scale according to the total mean score obtained based on the mean scores of all the subscales, those below the mean score are accepted as low self-efficacy and those above the mean score are accepted as high self-efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is an individual assessment scale consisting of 16 items to investigate the relationship between diabetes self-management and diabetes control in glycemic control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale (PDSMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The minimum score which can be obtained from the scale is 8 and the maximum score is 40. A higher total score obtained indicates a better awareness by the person of diabetes management.</description>

    <description>Then, each patient was given 45-60 minutes of individual instruction. The patient training content was prepared based on the Knowledge, Motivation and Behavioral Skills Model (IMB). A total of 12 weeks of follow-up was performed with a weekly short reminder message and a two-weekly phone call. The research data were collected again at the end of 12 weeks.</description>
