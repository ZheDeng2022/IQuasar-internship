    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to assess the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in patients&#xD;
      with COPD qualified for In-hospital pulmonary rehabilitation program&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), manifested by coughing, shortness of breath,&#xD;
      sputum production, wheezing and reduced physical performance, is one of the most frequently&#xD;
      diagnosed lung diseases. Anxiety and depression have been found to increase the number of&#xD;
      acute exacerbations and hospitalizations (thus reducing quality of life), weight, appetite,&#xD;
      sleep disorders, fatigue or loss of energy, lack of concentration, pessimism about the future&#xD;
      and suicidality. Anxiety has been estimated to occur in 21-96% and depression in 27-79% of&#xD;
      patients with COPD, values that are higher than for the general population or other chronic&#xD;
      diseases. Pulmonary rehabilitation leads to the improvement to the physical capacity and&#xD;
      overall fitness of the patients with COPD allowing restoration of independence in daily&#xD;
      functioning. Psychological support is required in order to reduce the negative psychological&#xD;
      symptoms related to both the pulmonary disease itself and the comorbidities. In the presented&#xD;
      study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of levels of depression, anxiety and stress in&#xD;
      patients with COPD qualified for In-hospital pulmonary rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program includes the following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation conducted in an outpatient care facility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5- time a week for 30 minutes a specific respiratory exercises- relaxation exercises for&#xD;
           breathing muscles, exercises to increase breathing, prolonged exhalation exercise, chest&#xD;
           percussion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5- time a week for 20-30 min training on a cycle ergometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5- time a week for 30 minutes a fitness and respiratory exercises - coordination and&#xD;
           balance exercises, stretching exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  relaxation training by Schultz. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions&#xD;
           that last around 15 minutes. During each session, the practitioner repeats a set of&#xD;
           visualisations that induce a state of relaxation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen-item scale scoring from 0 to 3 for each item. The first seven items relate to anxiety (HADS-A), and the remaining seven items relate to depression (HADS-D). The global scoring ranges from 0 to 42 with a cut-off point of 8/21 for anxiety and 8/21 for depression. The higher the score, the greater anxiety or depression symptoms. HADS will be performed at the beginning and after four weeks of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) is a 27-item scale scoring from 1 to 5 for each item. 21 items examine the level of stress in the area of emotional tension, external stress and intrapsychic stress, and 6 items refer to the lie scale. The global scoring for perception of stress ranges from 21 to 105 with a cut-off point of 60 for high level of perceived stress. The higher the score, the greater the sense of stress. PSQ will be performed at the beginning and after four weeks of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test measures the distance a patient is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a firm, flat surface. The aim is for the patient to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The patient is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spirometry Test</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is asked to take the deepest breath they can, and then exhale into the sensor as hard as possible, for as long as possible, preferably at least 6 seconds. It is sometimes directly followed by a rapid inhalation, in particular when assessing possible upper airway obstruction.</description>
