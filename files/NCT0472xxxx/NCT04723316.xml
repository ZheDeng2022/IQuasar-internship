  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of TARGET National is to establish a national framework to offer molecular&#xD;
      profiling of circulating tumour DNA and/or tumour tissue (optional) to patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid cancers referred to any of the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres (ECMCs) across the&#xD;
      UK, in order to help decision making for allocation to molecularly targeted experimental&#xD;
      cancer treatments. Patients will be allocated treatment using a national Molecular Tumour&#xD;
      Board to find the most suited therapies based on their molecular profiling results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to recruit up to 6,000 patients with advanced solid tumours across 5 years&#xD;
      and proposes to collect blood samples, archival tumour tissue and fresh tissue (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data may also be used for future development of predictive cancer biological markers, the&#xD;
      design of clinical trials involving new or existing drugs, discovery of new genetic targets&#xD;
      and exploring how resistance to specific anticancer agents arises in patients to help improve&#xD;
      future cancer treatment management.&#xD;

      Blood samples will be collected for ctDNA analysis and germline DNA analysis Tissue samples&#xD;
      will be collected for next generation sequencing. Whilst the focus of the study is on next&#xD;
      generation sequencing of circulating tumour DNA, the study is not restricted to these&#xD;
      analyses. Other tests may be performed, including, but not restricted to:&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, FISH, PCR if such analyses complement the panel of aberrations that may&#xD;
      help select a relevant trial of an experimental therapeutic for participating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh tumour may also be used for in vitro (i.e. organoids) and/or in vivo experiments (mouse&#xD;
      models) (optional) if patients provide their consent. These crucial experiments will improve&#xD;
      our understanding of the biology of cancer and will lead to identification of new potential&#xD;
      targets for cancer patients, facilitate drug screening and will inform of mechanisms of drug&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, analyses may be varied and alter over time as technologies evolve.&#xD;

        Potential study participants will be identified from patients with advanced solid cancer&#xD;
        who have been referred for consideration of early phase clinical trials in ECMCs across the&#xD;
        UK. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria and provide fully informed written consent&#xD;
        will be enrolled into the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients with confirmed histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced solid cancer&#xD;
             who have been referred to any of the ECMCs in the UK AND considered fit enough to&#xD;
             receive an experimental therapeutic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Availability of archival tumour sample (if tumour profiling is required)&#xD;

             with past/resolved Hepatitis B infection (defined as having a negative HBsAg test and&#xD;
             a positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] antibody test) are&#xD;
             eligible. Patients with a history of Hepatitis C infection are eligible only if&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis is negative for HCV RNA at least 6 months&#xD;
             after completing treatment for Hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known current COVID19 positive (by PCR) or active symptoms for COVID19. Routine&#xD;
             testing for COVID19 is not required. Patients with past infection who have fully&#xD;
             recovered may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are unable to provide fully informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients not considered eligible by the investigator for early phase clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients currently receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy (due to potential impact on&#xD;
             ctDNA analysis), unless patient has clear evidence of progression on hormone-based&#xD;
             therapies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A minimum of 3 weeks is required post&#xD;
             completion of other systemic anti-cancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of any medical, psychological, familial or sociological condition that, in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion, will hamper compliance with the study protocol and&#xD;
             follow-up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Bleeding diathesis (patients' on anticoagulation are permitted to enter the trial if&#xD;
             anticoagulation can be safely managed to enable fresh tumour biopsies and blood&#xD;
             sampling).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Conditions in which research biopsies or blood sampling may increase risk of&#xD;
             complications for the patients and/or investigator&#xD;
