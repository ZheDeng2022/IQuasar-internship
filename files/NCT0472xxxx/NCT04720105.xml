      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effect of Duobrii® (halobetasol&#xD;
      propionate 0.01%/tazarotene 0.045% lotion, HP/TAZ) on plaque type psoriasis of the hands&#xD;
      and/or feet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plaque type psoriasis of the hands and/or feet affects approximately 3-4% of patients with&#xD;
      psoriasis. It is characterized by well-defined erythematous desquamative plaques located on&#xD;
      the palms and soles, which may be limited to acral involvement or occur in combination with&#xD;
      generalized psoriasis. Psoriasis that affects the hands and/or feet has a profound impact on&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL) as it contributes to more physical disability and discomfort than&#xD;
      patients with other forms of psoriasis, such as difficulty walking or using the hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, psoriasis of the hands and/or feet is generally considered a therapeutic&#xD;
      challenge because the thicker stratum corneum reduces the penetration of topical treatment&#xD;
      agents. Systemic treatments (retinoids, psoralen-ultraviolet A [PUVA], methotrexate,&#xD;
      cyclosporine, and biologic therapy) have shown limited efficacy on psoriasis in acral areas.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, patients with hand and/or foot involvement often have too low of body surface&#xD;
      area (BSA) to participate in clinical trials for new psoriasis treatments, resulting in&#xD;
      limited studies among this sub-population and no clear treatment algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high unmet need for an effective treatment for psoriasis of the hands and/or feet has&#xD;
      been addressed in recent years with the development of new medications for generalized&#xD;
      psoriasis that may also be effective in treating disease localized to acral areas. In 2015,&#xD;
      two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group phase 3 studies were conducted to&#xD;
      assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of lotion containing a combination of&#xD;
      halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ). The study population was&#xD;
      subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The study results found that treatment success&#xD;
      (defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline Investigator Global Assessment score&#xD;
      and a score of clear or almost clear) was achieved in around 40% of subjects by week 8, with&#xD;
      substantial reductions in affected BSA, improvement in QoL, and a significant reduction in&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These phase 3 studies did not include a sub-analysis of the effect of HP/TAZ on psoriasis of&#xD;
      the hands and/or feet. Given that topical steroids and topical retinoids are separately&#xD;
      recommended as treatment options for psoriasis of the hands and/or feet, an agent that safely&#xD;
      combines these medications - and that has demonstrated safety and efficacy in generalized&#xD;
      psoriasis - offers a potential treatment for psoriasis of the hands and/or feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study described in this protocol is to evaluate the effect of HP/TAZ on&#xD;
      plaque type psoriasis of the hands and/or feet after 24 weeks of daily treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, given the impact of this variant of psoriasis on QoL and the relative lack of&#xD;
      currently available treatment options, this study will also evaluate the impact of HP/TAZ&#xD;
      treatment on patient-reported QoL measures and treatment satisfaction scoring.&#xD;
