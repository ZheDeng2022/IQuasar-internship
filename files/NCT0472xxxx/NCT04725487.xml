  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate if a standard integration programme in combination with a social&#xD;
      and health promoting intervention can increase health and well-being among refugee families&#xD;
      and influence success with education and employment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased health and well-being can lead to stronger motivation and ability to get involved&#xD;
      in education or employment and thereby improve integration of refugee families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of various social and health promoting&#xD;
      activities such as physical activity workshops, community gardening, entrepreneurship&#xD;
      training, MindSpring course, family excursions and language education on health, well-being,&#xD;
      social relations and success with job and education. Increased success with self-sufficiency&#xD;
      can support action competence and play a key role in the integration process. Outcome&#xD;
      measures are based on self-reporting, biological measures and municipal registry data.&#xD;

    <measure>The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale - 7 items (WEMWBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>WEMWBS is a validated measure of mental well-being and contains seven questions (a shortened version of the WEMWBS - 14 items). The scoring range for each item is from 1- 5, and the total score is from 7-35. The seven items have superior scaling properties to the 14 items, and mean raw scores are therefore transformed to metric scores using a standard conversion table.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in self-reported health</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>General health is assessed based on a question on self-reported health in the SF-12 questionnaire (a 12-Item short form health survey). SF 12 is a short version of the generic questionnaire SF 36 that measures health-related quality of life in the past four weeks.&#xD;
Scoring range is between 1-5 points. Mean score is calculated at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in self-reported social relations</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social relations are assessed based on five questions from the National Health Profile Survey (used in the Danish National Health Survey) in combination with one self-formulated question regarding contact with family members, friends, colleagues, neighbors and friends from social medias. Scoring range is between 1-5 points. Mean score is calculated at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.</description>
