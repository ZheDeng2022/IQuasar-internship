  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of limiting treatment time with acalabrutinib and&#xD;
      obinutuzumab in people who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma (SLL). The researchers want to find out whether stopping the study drugs when the&#xD;
      cancer responds to the treatment, followed by a period of observation in which no treatment&#xD;
      is given, is better than, the same as, or worse than the usual approach. A usual treatment&#xD;
      for CLL and SLL is to give the study drugs continuously until the cancer progresses, even if&#xD;
      the disease is in remission. But when people receive these drugs for long periods of time,&#xD;
      they can have serious side effects and their cancer can become resistant to treatment.&#xD;
