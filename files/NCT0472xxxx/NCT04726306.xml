    <textblock>
      This validation study investigates the diagnostic precision and accuracy when grading otic&#xD;
      barotrauma using two alternative gradings systems including the TEED and the OGS grading&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two alternative grading systems used to grade otic barotrauma. They include the&#xD;
      Teed Score (TEED) and the O'Neill Grading System (OGS). Teed has been utilized more&#xD;
      extensively but has been found to have limitations among clinicians. The OGS is an&#xD;
      alternative grading system with less classification categories than the Teed utilizes. The&#xD;
      OGS system is tied directly to treatment decision making, specific to the respective grading&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilize a sample of clinical examiners/observers who will independently grade&#xD;
      120 digital color photos of actual patient tympanic membranes with and without evidence of&#xD;
      eustachian tube dysfunction and middle ear barotrauma including variable stages or grades of&#xD;
      otic barotrauma. They will use the TEED chart as a reference in selecting the appropriate&#xD;
      TEED for each of the photos. Simultaneously they will also utilize the OGS chart as a&#xD;
      reference in selecting the appropriate OGS grade for each of the photos. The grading will be&#xD;
      conducted by physicians, nurses, and technicians. This will allow for comparisons at varying&#xD;
      provider levels. The comparisons will be made using the kappa statistics across the&#xD;
      disciplines. This will allow comparison between observed agreement, and expected agreement&#xD;
      due to chance for all reviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is no difference in diagnostic precision and accuracy when grading otic barotrauma&#xD;
      between examiners/observers using either the TEED or OGS grading systems.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and middle ear barotrauma (MEB) are the two most common&#xD;
      complications of clinical hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBO2T) though these disorders can&#xD;
      present in many other settings. There are currently two alternative systems used to grade&#xD;
      otic barotrauma in patients: the Teed Score (TEED) and the O'Neill Grading System (OGS). The&#xD;
      TEED is the most commonly used grading system originally described in 1944 and contains five&#xD;
      grades based on a single physician examination (1). There have been modifications to the TEED&#xD;
      over the years included six grades, hence the TEED as modified by Macfie and Edmonds is&#xD;
      commonly known as the Modified TEED Scale (2, 3). The TEED is not specific for the evaluation&#xD;
      and treatment of middle ear barotrauma in patients undergoing HBO2T, pilots or airline&#xD;
      passengers, soldiers exposed to explosive ordinance, recreational scuba divers, individuals&#xD;
      driving to altitude, swimming injuries due to free diving to depths without equalization,&#xD;
      loud sound pressure injuries, but rather to submariners practicing submarine escape training&#xD;
      (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otoscopy is commonly performed on all patients who present with these complaints and to&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygen patients prior to treatment. Though it is often again performed on patients&#xD;
      presenting for follow-up and to hyperbaric patients after having completed treatment or those&#xD;
      having difficulty equalizing middle ear pressure during the compression and/or decompression&#xD;
      phase of the hyperbaric treatments. Although the results from these otoscopic examinations&#xD;
      are used to determine the diagnosis and proper course of treatment for the ETD or MEB, the&#xD;
      TEED may not correlate with the consistency of diagnosis, the clinical approach to relieving&#xD;
      symptoms, or the definitive course of treatment for the otic barotrauma (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OGS is a simplified classification system of ETD and MEB limiting the evaluation to three&#xD;
      grade levels as opposed to six levels using the modified TEED (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature Review&#xD;
&#xD;
      A background search using PubMed without any restrictions on study type, date, language,&#xD;
      country of origin, was carried out and no validation studies of either the TEED or the OGS&#xD;
      grading system could be found. No studies comparing either of the two systems for consistency&#xD;
      or uniformity of diagnoses were discovered or available for retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      We attempt to determine if the OGS and TEED can be used by all physicians including those&#xD;
      seeing patients for suspected barotrauma in the community setting and the medical&#xD;
      professionals who routinely see patients undergoing clinical hyperbaric oxygen treatments;&#xD;
      hyperbaric physicians, nurses, and technologists, in order to determine if (1) both systems&#xD;
      yield consistent results regardless of the system used for grading barotrauma and (2) will&#xD;
      there be consistent results among the various professionals (physicians vs nurses vs. CHT's)&#xD;
      performing the otoscopic evaluation. The goal of this study is to determine if using either&#xD;
      the OGS or TEED will provide consistent and uniform results in grading barotrauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Question and Research Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there a difference in precision and accuracy when scoring and grading ETD and MEB in&#xD;
      patients between clinical staff members based on the type of scoring/grading system used?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is no difference in precision or accuracy when grading ETD and MEB between&#xD;
      examiners using either the TEED or the OGS grading systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ha: There is a difference in precision and accuracy when grading ETD and MEB between&#xD;
      examiners using either the TEED or the OGS grading system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is no difference in diagnostic precision and accuracy when grading ETD and MEB&#xD;
      based on training level of examiners using either the TEED or the OGS grading system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ha: There is no difference in diagnostic precision and accuracy when grading ETD and MEB&#xD;
      based on training level of examiners using either the TEED or the OGS grading system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients photographed between March of 2013 and June of 2019 that developed symptoms&#xD;
      undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy were selected and deidentified. This involved retrieving&#xD;
      all documented photographic images of ETD and MEB to score/grade the degree of otic&#xD;
      barotrauma. These patients all had baseline photographs taken of the external ear canal and&#xD;
      tympanic membrane as part of the pre-treatment standardized protocol in our department.&#xD;
      Baseline photographs (normal) are included in the retrieved images. The photographs were&#xD;
      initially screened and any images that were blurry to the degree that rendered&#xD;
      scoring/grading impossible were excluded. Images considered interpretable despite blurring or&#xD;
      partial obstruction due to cerumen or hair were included. This was done to maximize the use&#xD;
      of photos that reflect the varying quality of images encountered in everyday clinical&#xD;
      treatment conditions using otoscopy. Physicians were chosen in the pediatric and adult&#xD;
      settings in a variety of fields including those in a hyperbaric clinical setting. The&#xD;
      candidate physicians, hyperbaric nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants were&#xD;
      not limited to any specialty, however at the technician level the study was limited to those&#xD;
      working in the hyperbaric medicine setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will review and independently grade a total of 120 otoscopic photos of&#xD;
      tympanic membranes taken between March 2013 through June 2019. The photos include normal and&#xD;
      abnormal images representing tympanic membranes with all levels of Eustachian tube&#xD;
      dysfunction or middle ear barotrauma following hyperbaric pressurization that required a hold&#xD;
      due to patient subjective ear symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photo images were taken from actual hyperbaric patients seen at our facility with the&#xD;
      exception of 10 photos. The 10 photographs included from outside sources were necessary to&#xD;
      ensure inclusion of all stages of otic barotrauma including severe stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the study will be provided with instructions regarding the study both&#xD;
      verbally and in writing. The study participants will have various levels of professional&#xD;
      clinical training and will include physicians, nurses, and technologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will use the modified TEED placard commonly used in hyperbaric centers as a&#xD;
      reference in selecting the appropriate TEED score for each of the photos. Simultaneously,&#xD;
      they will utilize the OGS placard as a reference in selecting the appropriate OGS grade for&#xD;
      each of the photos. The grading will be conducted by hyperbaric physicians, nurses, and&#xD;
      hyperbaric technicians (CHT's).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TEED will be used without the benefit of a baseline photo, which was not required when&#xD;
      this system was developed in 1944 and subsequently modified. The OGS system will be used&#xD;
      initially without the use of a baseline photo, this is similar to the intended use of the&#xD;
      TEED. The OGS system will subsequently be graded separately with the benefit of a comparison&#xD;
      baseline photo in accordance with the intended use in hyperbaric treatment centers. Baseline&#xD;
      photos could be obtained in other clinical settings beyond hyperbaric treatment settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three levels of comparison of precision and accuracy in using these two scales.&#xD;
      The first comparison will evaluate the consistency displayed using each grading system (TEED&#xD;
      and OGS) independently without the knowledge of the baseline status of the tympanic membrane&#xD;
      prior to trauma. The second level of comparison will evaluate both grading systems for&#xD;
      precision and accuracy as compared to each other. The third level of comparison will have the&#xD;
      reviewers compare a baseline photo of the patient's tympanic membrane taken prior to&#xD;
      hyperbaric treatment and pressurization to the post treatment traumatic photo and provide an&#xD;
      OGS grade as the OGS was intended to be used in hyperbaric patients or in other settings&#xD;
      where an available baseline photo may be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will include the use of a kappa statistic for comparison between observed&#xD;
      agreement and expected agreement for each of the scoring/grading systems comparing&#xD;
      examiners/observers reviewing the images (5). The Fleiss kappa statistic will be used for&#xD;
      comparison since 3 or more examiners observers will score and grade the photo images (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of the kappa statistics with respect to scoring/grading system used, and level&#xD;
      of training will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses de-identified archived photos of external ear canals and tympanic membranes. A&#xD;
      protocol was submitted to the IRB and approved prior to the conduct of this study.&#xD;
