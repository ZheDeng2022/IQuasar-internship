  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on an&#xD;
      indispensable component: the ability to translate evidence-based interventions into routine&#xD;
      clinical practice on a broad scale and with fidelity to the intervention components so they&#xD;
      can have a maximum public health effect. However, there are critical barriers that prevent&#xD;
      such translation, including a lack of trained clinicians, competing priorities in busy EDs,&#xD;
      and incompatibility between requirements of evidence-based interventions (such as completing&#xD;
      telephone coaching with patients after the ED visit) and the workflow and infrastructure&#xD;
      typically present in most EDs. The proposed new intervention will address these barriers by&#xD;
      building a suite of technologies that will make it easier to implement the Emergency&#xD;
      Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (ED-SAFE), an evidence-based suicide&#xD;
      intervention targeting perceived social support, behavioral activation and impulse control,&#xD;
      revolutionizing the field's ability to scale and implement this intervention and acting as a&#xD;
      model for efforts to implement other existing and emerging suicide interventions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TASCS will be the first health information technology designed to enable flexible&#xD;
      delivery of the ED-SAFE intervention components with strong fidelity and with responsiveness&#xD;
      to the conditions and barriers present in most EDs. This will include an integrated approach&#xD;
      to delivering components usually completed during the ED visit, such as personalized safety&#xD;
      planning, as well as those completed after the visit, such as coaching to foster mental&#xD;
      health treatment engagement. This R34 addresses both patient and implementation outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will use persona development, an innovative human computer interaction approach, to&#xD;
      ensure the TASCS is intimately informed by end users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will optimize the TASCS in a small field test in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3, modeled after a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation design, will gather data on&#xD;
      usability, acceptability, and implementation of the TASCS ED App using a randomized&#xD;
      experiment (n=45) of three modalities: (1) On site (n=15), (2) Telehealth (n=15), and (3)&#xD;
      Self-administered (n=15). For 3 months post-discharge, all participants will receive coaching&#xD;
      calls, facilitated by the Post-ED Clinician App, and will have access to the Post-ED Patient&#xD;
      and Family App. The intervention is intended to decrease suicidal ideation and behavior by&#xD;
      improving perceived social support, increasing behavioral activation, and improving&#xD;
      suicide-related impulse control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building a comprehensive suite of integrated enabling technologies to address ED-SAFE&#xD;
      translation barriers will not only improve ED-SAFE intervention adoption, it will provide a&#xD;
      road map for how to do the same for other suicide interventions, both existing and those yet&#xD;
      to be developed, maximizing impact on the field.&#xD;

    <measure>Suicide attempt (binary)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Suicide Attempt is based upon participant response to &quot;Actual Suicide Attempt&quot; question within the &quot;Suicidal and Self-Injury Behavior&quot; subsection of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The question is a yes/no with a &quot;checking of the box&quot; selection meaning yes, Actual Suicide Attempt and blank/unchecked means no, no Actual Suicide Attempt&quot;. The timeframe applied will be past three months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicidal ideation (binary, ordinal)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Presence (yes/no) and severity (a score of 0 being no ideation, least severe, 5 being intent and plan, most severe) of suicidal ideation within the past week and past three months as measured by the 'Suicidal Ideation (Most Severe)' subsection of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral activation (continuous)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral activation as measured by the Drive subscale of the Behavioral Activation Scale, part of the BIS/BAS Scale. This Drive subscale has a minimum score of 4 and maximum of 16, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived social support (continuous)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived social support as measured by the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ-15). This scale has a minimum score of 15 and maximum of 105, with a higher score representing lower perceived social support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicide-related impulse control (continuous)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Suicide-related impulse control will be assessed the Recent Impulsivity Scale, a two-item scale (&quot;How strong was the impulse (urgent need) to plan or to act in any suicidal way?&quot;; &quot;How difficult was it for you to suppress or to restrain the impulse to plan or to act in any suicidal way?&quot;) on a five-point scale from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Extremely&quot;. The instrument has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 8, with a higher score representing a worse outcome.</description>
