  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The availability of antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV-1 infection has led to a reduction&#xD;
      in morbidity in patients with chronic HIV infection. However, cART does not eliminate HIV-1&#xD;
      that persists as a latent infection in cellular reservoirs. Usually, HIV viremia rapidly&#xD;
      rebounds if antiretroviral therapy is interrupted. Consequently, HIV infected individuals&#xD;
      must commit to expensive, life-long therapies and must tackle problems associated with&#xD;
      chronic infection and uninterrupted cART, including continuous clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      monitoring, drug toxicities, and chronic immune activation/inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is an emerging interest in developing safe and affordable curative&#xD;
      strategies that would eliminate the need for lifelong therapy. However, to date only&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has shown results in&#xD;
      decreasing the HIV-1 reservoirs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IciStem Consortium (www.icistem.org) has assembled the largest and most exhaustive&#xD;
      observational cohort for the study of HIV reservoir dynamics in allo-HSCT HIV+ individuals&#xD;
      with severe hematological malignancies worldwide. Within the cohort, only individuals&#xD;
      transplanted with a donor with thw CCR5A32 mutation have shown signs of HIV remission. On the&#xD;
      other side broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have shown the potential to control HIV&#xD;
      infection. This study intends to evaluate if the allo-HSCT combined with the additional&#xD;
      application of bNAbs is effective to control HIV replication.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of highly effective, convenient, and well-tolerated combination&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV-1 infection has substantially reduced AIDS-related&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. However, cART does not eliminate HIV-1 that persists as a latent&#xD;
      infection in cellular reservoirs, including resting memory CD4+ T cells, leading to an&#xD;
      underlying raised state of immune activation and subsequent immune senescence. Of note, HIV&#xD;
      viremia rapidly rebounds if antiretroviral therapy is interrupted. Consequently, HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals must commit to expensive, life-long therapies and must tackle problems associated&#xD;
      with chronic infection and uninterrupted cART, including continuous clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      monitoring, drug toxicities, and chronic immune activation/inflammation. Therefore, there is&#xD;
      an emerging interest in developing safe and affordable curative strategies that would&#xD;
      eliminate the need for lifelong therapy while improving the health of infected subjects and&#xD;
      reducing the risk of viral transmission to uninfected individuals. So far, allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only intervention to date that&#xD;
      systematically reduces HIV-1 reservoirs to undetectable levels regardless of the CCR5Δ32&#xD;
      donor status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IciStem is a prospective observational project to investigate cases of allo-HSCT in&#xD;
      HIV-1-infected individuals and their putative remission. Over the last few years, the IciStem&#xD;
      Consortium (www.icistem.org) has assembled the largest and most exhaustive observational&#xD;
      cohort for the study of HIV reservoir dynamics in allo-HSCT HIV+ individuals with severe&#xD;
      hematological malignancies worldwide. 39 individuals have already been transplanted and&#xD;
      followed up in the IciStem cohort and subsequent undetectable HIV reservoirs in blood and&#xD;
      tissues have been described in those with 100% chimerism while still on antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment (ART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed analysis of CCR5wt allo-HSCT cases within the IciStem cohort has provided insights&#xD;
      on additional factors such as conditioning regimen, total body irradiation, graft versus host&#xD;
      disease, and viral tropism that contribute to eradication of the potentially infectious viral&#xD;
      reservoir in addition to the lack of a functional CCR5 receptor. Allo-HSCT has proved a&#xD;
      profound effect on the HIV reservoir. So far, only participants with homozygous CCR5Δ32&#xD;
      mutation have shown signs of HIV remission whereas participants without the CCR5Δ32 mutation&#xD;
      had a delayed rebound during ATI. bNAbs have shown the potential to control HIV infection.&#xD;
      Consequently, the combination of allo-HSCT with these antibodies is one of the aims of the&#xD;
      study by which new cases of HIV remission might be achieved in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last 48 months IciStem has generated a prospective observational cohort of 39&#xD;
      cases of allo-HSCT in HIV-positive participants with severe hematological malignancies in 21&#xD;
      clinical sites in 9 countries (Europe and Canada). Those 39 cases (from the 45 registered)&#xD;
      have been followed up with continuous sample collection and high-resolution state of the art&#xD;
      virological and immunological analysis. A summary of preliminary studies and achievements is&#xD;
      listed below&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nine transplants involved CCR5Δ32/Δ32 donors, and 18 involved CCR5wt donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean post-HSCT follow-up is 1656 days, with 18 participants alive in active follow-up (4&#xD;
           transplanted with CCRΔ32/Δ32 donor); 13 IciStem participants are beyond the 2nd year&#xD;
           post-HSCT, respectively. From those, 8 are out of immune suppression and with&#xD;
           minimal-undetectable HIV latent reservoirs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Five participants from the IciStem Cohort are currently suitable to enter in the first&#xD;
           ITATI approach within the IciStem core. Those 5 participants have no detectable&#xD;
           replication competent HIV reservoir in presence of cART and have been followed up for&#xD;
           the longest time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutically intervention for these participants will be an analytical treatment&#xD;
      interruption with additional application of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that&#xD;
      recently have been described as safe and effective to control HIV replication in infected&#xD;
      participants. The rationale for application of these bNAbs during the treatment interruption&#xD;
      of the IciStem participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To help prevent viral rebound in absence of cART, due to their proven capacity to&#xD;
           potently and durably suppress any possible residual HIV replication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To rapidly eliminate a cell producing virus via mechanisms such as ADCC (Antibody&#xD;
           dependent cellular cytotoxicity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To facilitate the development of a broad CTL (Cytotoxic T lymphocytes) response&#xD;
           sufficient to maintain remission, as demonstrated in macaques/SHIV studies (Nishimura,&#xD;
           2017)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To protect the individuals from a putative viral rebound with a safe system, as bNAbs&#xD;
           application has few side effects and rarely causes adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To achieve a highly specific targeting and inhibition of HIV to avoid massive overall&#xD;
           bystander activation of the immune system that in effect could lead to a higher chance&#xD;
           of HIV reinfection of activated CD4+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite cART has substantially reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality, HIV reservoirs&#xD;
      are still present and represent a key concern currently for HIV remission. This fact has&#xD;
      resulted in a chronicity of HIV infection, leading to emotional disturbances and&#xD;
      psychological burden associated with this perpetuation of the disease in the daily living. In&#xD;
      the setting of HIV eradication trials, analytical interruption of antiretroviral therapy is a&#xD;
      requirement to investigate HIV remission, control, and potential viral rebound. However,&#xD;
      discontinuation of cART is linked to psychological issues that should be considered in the&#xD;
      setting of HIV cure trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stopping cART may lead to variable clinical detriments. Those detriments may induce&#xD;
           worry and psychological distress, which can not only worsen the quality of life, but&#xD;
           also cause an instability of the emotional status. At the same time, that breakdown of&#xD;
           the emotional system may influence the clinical status. Even when clinical consequences&#xD;
           are not manifested or self-perceived, beliefs about unfavorable health-related results&#xD;
           and desperation for HIV remission may arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interrupting cART may increase the risk to infect other people. Those who discontinue&#xD;
           cART may not be willing therefore to put their sexual partners at risk. Even after&#xD;
           deciding to participate and to interrupt cART, they may develop worries and fears about&#xD;
           infecting others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This sort of HIV remission trial comprises a very specific collective of people. People&#xD;
           who have suffered from a hematologic medical complication indicative for stem cell&#xD;
           transplantation and have survived this severe health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This fact already indicates an impacted emotional status (without even considering the&#xD;
      ITATI). Besides, specifically in the current study, additional medical strategies will be&#xD;
      applied. Those interventions will be new for the participants (i.e., immune therapy) and will&#xD;
      require multiple additional medical appointments. Those characteristics add complexity to the&#xD;
      psychological management during the participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the reasons presented, the participants' psychological predisposition to ITATI and&#xD;
      the participation in the study and the emotional status will be monitored carefully&#xD;
      throughout the trial. This will be managed at 2 levels: first by continuous assessment of the&#xD;
      emotional status and second by offering emotional support whenever required, especially&#xD;
      considering the cessation of cART and initiation of the immune therapy.&#xD;
