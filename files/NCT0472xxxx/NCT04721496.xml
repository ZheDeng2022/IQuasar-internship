    <textblock>
      Investigation of power and speed in relation to the increasing instability in a group of&#xD;
      untrained athletes and a group of expert athletes. In this way, the effectiveness of unstable&#xD;
      training for different types of athletes can be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that as instability increases there is a gradual decrease in power and&#xD;
      speed of execution, but not too relevant in the expert group.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength training using devices that induce varying degrees of instability is widely&#xD;
      practiced in numerous contexts and has been credited with benefits in prevention,&#xD;
      rehabilitation and general health. Several studies have found a progressive decrease in power&#xD;
      as the degree of instability increases. However, it is not known how mildly unstable&#xD;
      situations are affected, nor are the differences between trained and untrained subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of different degrees of&#xD;
      instability on power and speed of execution in a push-up or arm-bottoms exercise, in trained&#xD;
      and untrained subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum power (MP) and mean power (BP), and maximum speed (MV) and mean propulsive speed (VA)&#xD;
      of push-up were analyzed in 44 subjects, 24 untrained (176.38±5.35 cm, 76.38±6.85 kg, 2.5±1.5&#xD;
      months experience) and 20 trained (178.45±5.91 cm, 83.4±21.56 kg, 15.5±5.3 months&#xD;
      experience), under six conditions of increasing instability: 1) stable, 2) device in&#xD;
      suspension: rings, 3) monopodal, 4) device in suspension: TRX®, 5) with hands-on Bosu® and 6)&#xD;
      with hands-on TRX® and feet on Bosu®.&#xD;
