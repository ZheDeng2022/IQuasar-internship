    <textblock>
      This project aims to assess the short-term effectiveness and responsiveness of a home-based&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program (reabilitAR) in patients with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD). It is also an aim to establish the minimal clinically important&#xD;
      differences for PR in patients with COPD for a novel incremental step test (exercise capacity&#xD;
      outcome measure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at hospitals. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, and comorbidities;&#xD;
      vital signs and peripheral oxygen saturation; symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue); lung function;&#xD;
      functional capacity; exercise capacity; the impact of the disease, balance, and cognitive&#xD;
      function will be collected before the reabilitAR program. Additionally, health care&#xD;
      utilization will be registered. Then, patients will be entered into the reabilitAR program&#xD;
      (12 weeks). The intervention consists in a strategic mixture of home visits and phone calls.&#xD;
      The program includes exercise training and the self-management educational program Living&#xD;
      Well with COPD. After 12 weeks all outcome measures will be reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the home-based approach will express benefits and reflect the concerns to&#xD;
      provide appropriate responses to the patient's needs by increasing access to PR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that hundreds of millions of people worldwide&#xD;
      are affected by chronic respiratory diseases (CRD), including chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD). Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an essential component in the management of&#xD;
      CRD with the aim to improve patients' exercise and functional capacity and psychological&#xD;
      condition with long-term adherence to health-enhancing behaviors, including exercise training&#xD;
      and self-management skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the well-known evidence, this service is mostly underutilized due to poor&#xD;
      accessibility, with only 1% of worldwide availability of PR services for COPD patients. Thus,&#xD;
      is important to undertake actions that improve access to and delivery of PR services for&#xD;
      suitable patients. One of the strategies in the international guidelines is the creation of&#xD;
      new models of programs, where a home-based approach is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to assess the short-term effectiveness and responsiveness of a&#xD;
      home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program (reabilitAR) in patients with COPD. It is also an&#xD;
      aim to establish the minimal clinically important differences for PR in patients with COPD&#xD;
      for a novel incremental step test (exercise capacity outcome measure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to recruit the maximum of patients with COPD via clinicians at hospitals. This&#xD;
      study will enroll adult patients with COPD according to the Global Initiative for Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be referred by pulmonologists, from medical consultation in hospitals and&#xD;
      clinics in Portugal. With the referral, it is expected that the medical doctor explains the&#xD;
      goal and benefits of PR. Eligible patients will be contacted by the reabilitAR team, for&#xD;
      additional questions and to begin the integration process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic, anthropometric, and comorbidities; vital signs and peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation; symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue); lung function; functional capacity; exercise&#xD;
      capacity; the impact of the disease, balance, and cognitive function will be collected before&#xD;
      the reabilitAR program. Additionally, health care utilization will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program consists in home visits for the exercise training and the self-management&#xD;
      sessions, and motivational phone-calls including the follow-up of the clinical condition, the&#xD;
      progression of exercise training, including a total of 14 home visits, with more visits in&#xD;
      the first two weeks of the program (4 visits). From the third week, one visit will be&#xD;
      replaced by a phone call, for a total of 10 phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 weeks all outcome measures will be reassessed.&#xD;
