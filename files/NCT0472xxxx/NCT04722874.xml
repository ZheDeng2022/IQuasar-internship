  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the adjunctive&#xD;
      effect of repeated low-level red-light therapy (RLRL) and orthokeratology (ortho-k) on myopia&#xD;
      control in ortho-k non-responders who have undergone ortho-k treatment but were still&#xD;
      experiencing fast myopia progression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia constitutes a major threat to personal health globally for its increased prevalence.&#xD;
      Moreover, its dose-related association with irreversible blindness complications such as&#xD;
      myopic macular degeneration have been demonstrated. It is crucial to look for effective ways&#xD;
      to control myopia in children to reduce risk of myopic pathologies in later life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthokeratology (ortho-k) is the first-line optical method in myopia control, resulting in&#xD;
      slowing axial elongation by 43-63%. However, results after ortho-k treatment vary among&#xD;
      individuals. Methods with more accurate efficacy and wider application to slowing down myopia&#xD;
      progression, especially for myopia with limited ortho-k response, are still urgently&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy is an innovative and non-invasive therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment for a variety of eye diseases. Our previous clinical study suggested RLRL could&#xD;
      effectively retard myopia progression without clinically observable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the adjunctive effect of RLRL and ortho-k on myopia&#xD;
      control in ortho-k non-responders using a multicenter randomized controlled trial design.&#xD;
      Ortho-k non-responders are defined as who have continuously undergone ortho-k treatment but&#xD;
      were still experiencing fast myopia progression. The subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either experimental group (RLRL and ortho-k) or control group (ortho-k). Their axial length&#xD;
      will be monitored over one year. Changes in axial length in the two groups will be compared.&#xD;
