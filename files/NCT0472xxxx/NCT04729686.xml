  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to continue progressing towards outpatient total hip arthroplasty (THA), methods to&#xD;
      adequately manage postoperative pain is of paramount importance. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to quantify the effectiveness of the pericapsular nerve block in total hip arthroplasty in&#xD;
      comparison to the fascia iliaca nerve block.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, controlled trial in adult subjects undergoing total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty that will receive one of two different nerve block regimens for pain management&#xD;
      as part of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective pain control after surgery for total hip replacement is a critical element in&#xD;
      patient recovery. Particularly, in the first few days, as majority of patients may experience&#xD;
      significant pain. Improved pain management after surgery contributes to better healing,&#xD;
      faster patient mobility, shortened hospital stays, and reduced healthcare costs. While pain&#xD;
      management is an important factor in total hip replacement, pain after surgery has yet to be&#xD;
      improved. Inadequate pain control can lead to delayed movement, thereby increasing the risk&#xD;
      for complications such as blood clots in the legs (deep venous thrombosis - blood clots in&#xD;
      your veins) with some patients developing blood clots in their lungs (pulmonary embolus). In&#xD;
      addition to pain medications after surgery, nerve blocks such as the femoral or fascia&#xD;
      iliaca, have been used as supporting therapy for pain management after a total hip&#xD;
      replacement. While these nerve blocks are used on a regular basis, they do have limitations&#xD;
      which can produce inconsistent results for pain control and use of pain medications after&#xD;
      surgery. With no clear superior nerve block for total hip replacement, a new nerve block,&#xD;
      called the pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block has emerged. It has demonstrated the ability&#xD;
      to prolong pain relief and decrease the use of pain medications after surgery. Therefore, a&#xD;
      randomized study comparing the PENG block to other blocks established within the anesthesia&#xD;
      community (e.g., fascia iliaca block) will allow for providers to understand the capabilities&#xD;
      this block has in the setting of a total hip replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to your normal standard clinical care, there will scheduled pre-operative,&#xD;
      operative, 2-week, and 4-6 week follow-up visits.&#xD;
