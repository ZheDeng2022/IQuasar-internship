  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trials investigates the side effects of olaparib and durvalumab and how well&#xD;
      it works in combination with carboplatin, etoposide, and/or radiation therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with extensive stage-small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) who have not received&#xD;
      treatment for their disease. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair&#xD;
      themselves, and they may stop growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and&#xD;
      etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      uses high energy sources to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving olaparib and&#xD;
      durvalumab together with carboplatin, etoposide, and/or radiation therapy may help treat&#xD;
      patients with ES-SCLC.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity and feasibility of sequential treatment with olaparib, thoracic&#xD;
      radiotherapy (TRT)/durvalumab, and olaparib/durvalumab for consolidation and maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in patients status post (s/p) chemoimmunotherapy for ES-SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of sequential treatment with olaparib, TRT/durvalumab, and&#xD;
      olaparib/durvalumab for consolidation and maintenance therapy in patients s/p&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy for ES-SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Perform a comparative analysis of patient clinical outcome according to tumor biomarkers&#xD;
      in circulating tumor cell (CTC), blood samples and tumor tissue, such as SLFN11 expression H-&#xD;
      scores and stratifying tumors as SLFN11 positive or negative on the basis of H-score &gt;= 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Perform a comparative analysis of patient clinical outcome according to immune biomarkers&#xD;
      in blood and tumor tissue, such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 22C3 pharmDx assay and&#xD;
      stratifying tumors as PD-L1 positive or negative on the basis of PD-L1 combined positive&#xD;
      score &gt;= 1% in patients treated with anti- PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Perform whole exome sequencing (WES) and methylation profiling on tumor samples and from&#xD;
      circulating-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) to evaluate whether tumor mutational burden&#xD;
      (TMB) or specific genomic alterations are associated with improved progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) with the trial regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Gene and protein expression of tumor tissue through ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and&#xD;
      Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Quantify pre-treatment, pre- and post-olaparib, post-TRT, and at progression levels for&#xD;
      blood-based biomarkers, such as cytokines associated with immune activation (e.g., STING&#xD;
      pathway cytokines, CXCL10 and CCL5) to establish correlations with PFS and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Using longitudinal blood samples (e.g. pre-treatment, pre- and post-olaparib, post-TRT,&#xD;
      and at progression), assess CTC number, CTC (single-cell) biomarker expression (such as&#xD;
      SLFN11 and PD-L1 expression), and immune profile of PBMCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIa. Correlate baseline expression or changes with PFS and OS. VII. Assess pre- and&#xD;
      post-olaparib, and at progression tumor tissue for immune markers, such as CD8+ T cells,&#xD;
      through multiplex IHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Assessment of single-cell biomarker expression on CTCs and tumor tissue (such as SLFN11&#xD;
      and PD-L1 expression) and immune profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIIIa. Correlate pre-treatment expression or changes with PFS and/or OS. IX. Generation of&#xD;
      CTC-derived and/or biopsy-derived xenograft models from individual patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMO-IMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1,&#xD;
      carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1, etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with response or stable disease (SD) after cycle 4 and are&#xD;
      candidates for TRT proceed to Induction. Patients that are not candidates for TRT proceed to&#xD;
      Single-Agent Maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION (WEEKS 13-14): Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-11&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNORADIATION (WEEKS 15-18): Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo consolidative TRT daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE (WEEKS 19 AND BEYOND): Patients without progressive disease receive durvalumab IV&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on day 1, and olaparib PO BID. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SINGLE-AGENT MAINTENANCE: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days, then every 3 months.&#xD;
