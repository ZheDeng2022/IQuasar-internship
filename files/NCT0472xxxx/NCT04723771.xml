    <textblock>
      Influenza is associated with an increased risk for serious illness, hospitalization and death&#xD;
      in pregnant women and young infants. The investigators estimated the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) in pregnant women and their infants in&#xD;
      2019-2020 influenza season. Women were activelly followed during the influenza season on a&#xD;
      weekly basis through telephone call in order to collect data about the onset of fever and/or&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms by them or their young infants. Polymerase chain reaction testing in&#xD;
      pharyngeal samples was offered to pregnant women and infants with influenza-like illness&#xD;
      (ILI). A total of 636 pregnant women and 474 infants were studied. A Bayesian beta-binomial&#xD;
      model was used.&#xD;

      Study period: Influenza 2019-2020 season&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators followed actively the pregnant women and their infants in order to collect&#xD;
      prospectively data on a weekly basis through phone calls during the entire influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ILI was defined as the sudden onset of symptoms and fever, malaise, myalgia or headache,&#xD;
           and cough, sore throat or shortness of breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARI was defined as the presence of at least one respiratory symptom, regardless of&#xD;
           fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Febrile episode was defined as the presence of fever only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever was defined as a temperature of 38.0 C in at least two measurements within 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diagnoses of pneumonia and AOM were accepted as reported by the physicians who&#xD;
           provided care to the women or their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2019-2020 QIV Vaxigrip-Tetra was used to vaccinate pregnant women.&#xD;
