  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse interstitial lung disease (PID) is the leading cause of death in systemic scleroderma&#xD;
      (SSc). Major progress has recently been made in its therapeutic management. Early diagnosis&#xD;
      is essential to optimize this management. Current diagnostic techniques are based on&#xD;
      high-resolution computed tomography on the thorax (HRCT) and pulmonary functional tests&#xD;
      (PFT). However, these explorations have their limitations. Thus, there is a need for new&#xD;
      techniques for a very early diagnosis of PID-SSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) is an innovative, easily accessible, non-irradiating, inexpensive&#xD;
      and painless tool. It is an emerging technique for the diagnosis of PID and has already&#xD;
      proven its sensitivity for the detection of interstitial damage, as defined by HRCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the PRECOSS study is to describe the prevalence of an ultrasound&#xD;
      interstitial syndrome in patients with SSc, free of PID-SSc (defined by the Goh criteria)&#xD;
      detectable by HRCT.&#xD;
