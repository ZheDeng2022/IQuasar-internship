      Six dyads, each consisting of a person with Parkinson's disease and their care partner, will&#xD;
      participate in a real-time online course called &quot;Poised for Parkinson's.&quot; The course will&#xD;
      meet twice per week via Zoom for eighteen 105-minute sessions. Outcome measures, including&#xD;
      surveys, interviews, balance, and motor performance, will be assessed the week before classes&#xD;
      begin and the week after classes end.&#xD;
