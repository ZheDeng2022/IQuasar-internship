  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to assess patient satisfaction after the surgery with a custom-made CE&#xD;
      marked implant (ORIGIN®) versus off-the-shelf (VANGUARD PS) device, and to document the&#xD;
      clinical and device performance outcomes of the ORIGIN System used in routine hospital&#xD;
      practice in a large patient cohort treatment of total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients receiving ORIGIN implants will experience a more natural feel&#xD;
      of the prosthesis during the first year after the surgery compared to patients receiving&#xD;
      VANGUARD implants (as measured with FJS), and slightly significant improvement at the&#xD;
      following interval of 2 years. The overall patient satisfaction is expected to be improved&#xD;
      after 2 years follow-up. It is also supposed that the overall patient satisfaction is&#xD;
      expected to be higher with ORIGIN PS than with VANGUARD PS treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ORIGIN® PS and VANGUARD® PS are total knee prostheses, intended to be used in primary Total&#xD;
      Knee Replacement Arthroplasty (TKA). With the ORIGIN® PS implant being customized&#xD;
      individually made (CIM) fitting a patient's anatomy, a more natural reconstruction of knee&#xD;
      kinematics is anticipated and ultimately a higher patient satisfaction and lower revision&#xD;
      rate are envisioned. To date literature providing data about CIM TKA is still scarce. A study&#xD;
      assessing kinematics after TKA found that CIM TKA more closely resembled natural knee&#xD;
      kinematics when compared to standard off-the-shelf (OTS) TKA. This resemblance allows for a&#xD;
      more natural femoral rollback during knee flexion, the authors found. CIM TKA demonstrates&#xD;
      knee kinematics more similar to a normal knee studying tibiofemoral kinematics using mobile&#xD;
      fluoroscopy in vivo. Furthermore, CIM TKA has shown to provide a more accurate tibial fit and&#xD;
      rotation, when compared to several standard TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective review of 621 TKA patients, 307 with CIM TKA and 314 with conventional&#xD;
      implants, demonstrated a decreased estimated blood loss, decreased length of stay, decreased&#xD;
      range of motion, and no discernible difference in surgical or tourniquet time. Albeit, the&#xD;
      differences found were not deemed clinically relevant, the study underlined the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the CIM TKA technique. Patients who received CIM TKA had lower transfusion rates&#xD;
      and fewer adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four year data from the UK National Joint Registry showed a cumulative percent revision rate&#xD;
      of 0.5% for CIM TKA versus a cumulative percent revision rate of 1.9% for all TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While all this data is encouraging, randomized controlled studies and assessments of patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes are missing. Therefore, the current study aims to close this knowledge gap&#xD;
      and provide Level I evidence for CIM TKA by comparing the two TKA Prostheses mentioned above&#xD;
      and to evaluate their clinical performance and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, comparative, randomized, double arm, monocentric, observational,&#xD;
      post-market study. The study is performed in Germany, in the University Medical Center of&#xD;
      Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz (UMC-Mainz).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is stated that 140 subjects implanted with either the ORIGIN PS or VANGUARD PS System will&#xD;
      be included upon eligibility assessment. Subjects will be followed at one and two years after&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will occur at the time of the medical examination. It is assumed that the&#xD;
      subjects' treatments and follow-up visits will be performed per standard of the&#xD;
      investigational site in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that enrollment will take approximately 18 months. As each implanted&#xD;
      subject is to be followed for two years, the estimated study duration is approximately 48&#xD;
      months, excluding the time required for preparing the final report. (A loss of approximately&#xD;
      10% is expected at the end of the study)&#xD;
