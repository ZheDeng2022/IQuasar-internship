      This research study will assess what doses of Sacituzumab Govitecan and Enfortumab Vedotin&#xD;
      can be safely combined in the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs in this investigational combination are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enfortumab Vedotin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sacituzumab Govitecan&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, open-label, nonrandomized phase I trial testing the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy as well as defining the appropriate dose for future studies of Sacituzumab Govitecan&#xD;
      and Enfortumab for people with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) progressing on&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy and PD1/L1 inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Enfortumab Vedotin for the treatment&#xD;
      of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) (bladder cancer). The FDA has not approved&#xD;
      Sacituzumab Govitecan for metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) (bladder cancer) but it has&#xD;
      been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved Sacituzumab Govitecan to treat a type of&#xD;
      breast cancer at this time. Sacituzumab Govitecan has appeared promising in patients with&#xD;
      bladder cancer that has spread and works by a different mechanism than Enfortumab Vedotin.&#xD;
      Therefore, the researchers believe that combining these 2 drugs may control the cancer better&#xD;
      than each drug does on its own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done through testing different combinations and checking for serious side&#xD;
      effects; if there are no serious side effects a different dose combination will be explored.&#xD;
      Once the best combination has been determined, the study will look to see how effective (how&#xD;
      well the drug works) it is in slowing down the growth of metastatic urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      (mUC) progressing on platinum-based chemotherapy and PD1/L1 inhibitors and define the most&#xD;
      appropriate level of the drugs to use for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment, and safety&#xD;
      follow-up visits, in addition to general health status follow-up after study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they do not have serious side&#xD;
      effects and their disease does not get worse. However, the duration may vary depending on how&#xD;
      long the treatment works to control the cancer and how someone's body tolerates the side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunomedics, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing&#xD;
      funding for the research study, tests required for research purposes only, and the study drug&#xD;
      Sacituzumab Govitecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that up to 24 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

             (MRI) as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1&#xD;
             criteria). Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered&#xD;
             measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth&#xD;
             control or be surgically sterile or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course&#xD;
             of the study through 6 months after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not&#xD;
             been free from menses for &gt;2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of SG and EV on the developing human fetus are unknown. Women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of SG administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

        will not be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating. Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because SG and EV have potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with EV or SG, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had a prior anti-cancer biologic agent within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
             (C1D1) or have had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation&#xD;
             therapy within 2 weeks prior to C1D1. Subjects participating in observational studies&#xD;
             are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy that are not&#xD;
             resolved to Grade 1 or baseline that could impose serious risk for complications&#xD;
             before administration of study drug agent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If subjects received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately&#xD;
                  from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;

             therapy on trial (Cycle 1 Day 1 [C1D1]), or subjects with surgically-cured tumors with&#xD;
             low risk of recurrence are allowed to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;

             drug and all neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline, have no evidence of new or&#xD;
             enlarging brain metastases, and are taking ≤20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent.&#xD;

                  ventricular fibrillation), high-grade atrioventricular block, or other cardiac&#xD;

                  that is well controlled with antiarrhythmic medication); history of QT interval&#xD;
                  prolongation&#xD;
&#xD;

             clarification)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the Investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, may be likely to confound study interpretation or prevent completion of study&#xD;
             procedures and follow-up examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High dose systemic corticosteroids (≥20 mg of prednisone or its equivalent) are not&#xD;
