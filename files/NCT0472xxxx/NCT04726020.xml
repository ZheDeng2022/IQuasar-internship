  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lacking adherence to guidelines on prevention and treatment of different chemotherapy,&#xD;
      targeted therapy, and immunotherapy induced toxicities is the reason why there are a&#xD;
      potential incidence and duration increase of adverse events. It is clear the need of a&#xD;
      collateral effect early recognition for an adequate clinical management and for limiting&#xD;
      their intensity and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is the need for a multicentre randomized clinical study in specific therapeutical&#xD;
      settings (chemotherapy, target therapy, immunotherapy) assessing the impact of planned and&#xD;
      ongoing patients' monitoring by nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NICSO study foresees patient enrolment that is in adjuvant chemotherapy for breast&#xD;
      cancer, colon, and lung; that is in chemotherapy or immunotherapy or with targeted therapy.&#xD;
      Moreover, this working assesses toxicity differences (but also of QoL, number of PS access or&#xD;
      non-planned medical examinations, number of hospitalization and number of recovery days) in&#xD;
      patients that carried out a toxicity prevention and cure standard therapy in comparison with&#xD;
      the standard assessment to which is added a periodic nursing phone intervention.&#xD;

      The lacking adherence to guidelines on prevention and treatment of different chemotherapy,&#xD;
      targeted therapy, and immunotherapy induced toxicities is the reason why there are a&#xD;
      potential incidence and duration increase of adverse events. It is clear the need of a&#xD;
      collateral effect early recognition for an adequate clinical management and for limiting&#xD;
      their intensity and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better toxicity management can have a positive impact on a correct treatments&#xD;
      dose-intensity. Scientific community debate on toxicity assessment ways and means is still&#xD;
      open. The most debated questions concern:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician and/or patient reporting adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nurse role in the adverse events assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How much assessment methods (assessment frequency, who's involved in adverse events&#xD;
           monitoring) means for:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time spent with toxicity and intensity reduction;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment adherence. Some literature evidence is avaiable and support the need of&#xD;
                intensive monitoring of patients in terms of adverse events. However, there is the&#xD;
                need for a multicentre randomized clinical study in specific therapeutical settings&#xD;
                (chemotherapy, target therapy, immunotherapy) assessing the impact of planned and&#xD;
                ongoing patients' monitoring by nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centric, randomized, open comparative study design, between a planned and&#xD;
      consecutive monitoring nurse intervention in addition to the chemotherapy toxicity prevention&#xD;
      and cure standard therapy package insert (chemotherapy, target therapy, immunotherapy), and&#xD;
      the only use of the cancer therapy toxicity prevention and cure standard therapy package&#xD;
      insert (chemotherapy, target therapy, immunotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves All the patients with a solid tumor on treatment with adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy or receiving target therapy or immunotherapy for the first time in their cancer&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study design will last 24 months. Patient recruitment will last 18 months from the&#xD;
      beginning of the study. The study period will be 4 months for the group on treatment with&#xD;
      immunotherapy and target therapy and at least 6 months for the group on treatment with&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy. The study could be interrupted when there is a therapy withdrawal&#xD;
      because of cancer progression, severe toxicity or for the informed consent for withdrawal, or&#xD;
      because of death. If there is a temporary interruption or a treatment withdrawal period,&#xD;
      patients still are in under monitoring, according to their group. The study will end with the&#xD;
      end of the planned period monitoring, which is the last call to the enlisted patients.&#xD;
