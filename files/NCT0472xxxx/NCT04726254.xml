      The IMPACT Registry seeks to fill some of the gaps associated with the clinical use of CBD&#xD;
      (cannabidiol) and other cannabinoid formulations including THC and others. The overarching&#xD;
      goal of this Registry is to rapidly advance research and understanding of the use of&#xD;
      cannabis, in the clinical community setting, when it is utlized to manage the symptoms of&#xD;
      cancer treatment and other underlying health issues. These symptoms include nausea,&#xD;
      neuropathy, and sleeplessness and chronic pain.&#xD;

      The IMPACT Registry seeks to fill some of the gaps associated with the clinical application&#xD;
      of CBD (cannabidiol) and other cannabinoid formulations including THC and others. It will&#xD;
      also serve as a platform for discovery, whereby observations of patient symptoms, specific&#xD;
      cannabis formulations, delivery methods and clinical outcomes, become the source of more&#xD;
      in-depth research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMPACT Registry is a prospective observational Registry documenting utility and patient&#xD;
      experience for patients seeking to use therapeutic cannabis medicaments as a means of symptom&#xD;
      relief and management related to various diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted symptoms and conditions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleeplessness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poor Appetite&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Menopausal symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be recorded includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic demographics of patients using cannabis-based medicaments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease diagnoses and symptoms for which patients are seeking management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cannabinoid formulation, chemical composition, amount (in milligrams), dose and&#xD;
           utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) using, where possible, validated measures of sleep,&#xD;
           pain, appetite, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician and patient utilization of these data to manage prescription medication&#xD;
           recommendations and usage, including discontinuation of opiates or reduction in use of&#xD;
           opiates after initiation of cannabis-based medicaments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall impact on clinical or patient treatment plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this Registry is to provide a platform for physicians and patients to&#xD;
      collaborate on cannabis research and advance the understanding of the application of&#xD;
      cannabinoids for symptom relief associated with various medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients greater than or equal to 21 years of age seeking to use CBD or other cannabis&#xD;
      formulations, where legal, will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected in the normal course of a patient's visit and follow up are entered. This is&#xD;
      an observational study; no specific patient interventions are required. Patients must have&#xD;
      requested a cannabis-based medicament and recommendation from their provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at various time points, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the time patients first request and are recommended cannabis medicaments&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At various recommended and voluntary time points, collected via PRO surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When patients return to their providers during the course of normal clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must sign a paper or electronic informed consent form prior to their prospective&#xD;
      data being entered into the Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All demographic, diagnostic, cannabis formulation and follow up data will be entered by&#xD;
      participating providers. Consented patients will record compliance with recommendations,&#xD;
      usage and symptom relief. They will be asked to take symptom specific surveys, if applicable.&#xD;
