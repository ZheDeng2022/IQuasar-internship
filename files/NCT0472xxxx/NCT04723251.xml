  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a positive psychology&#xD;
      intervention, The Gratitude Gallery, for increasing gratitude in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that participants will find the activity feasible and acceptable and&#xD;
      complete the intervention as directed. The project also hypothesizes that those that complete&#xD;
      the intervention will show an increase in self-reported gratitude, as well as a decrease in&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and depression.&#xD;

    <description>Number of participants that are eligible for the study compared to the number of patients that are enrolled. The higher the ratio of participants enrolled the higher acceptability.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of the The Gratitude Gallery</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 21 days (days of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants that complete 15 of the 21 intervention days will be considered to be feasible.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the level of reported gratitude as measured by the Gratitude Questionnaire - 6 (GQ-6).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to day 60</time_frame>
    <description>This is a six question, self-reported survey designed to assess individual differences in the proneness to experience gratitude in daily life. The GQ-6 uses a 7-point Likert scale with responses that range from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Questions 3 and 6 are reverse scored. A higher total score indicated higher levels of gratitude.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in positive and negative affect as measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to day 60</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS scale is a 20 item mood scale measuring the two primary dimensions of mood. Responses on a 5-point Likert Scale range from &quot;very slightly or not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;. Positive affect and negative affect questions are grouped and scored separately. The PANAS has been shown to be sensitive to short-term fluctuations in mood in addition to showing stability over a longer (2-month) time period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in General Life Satisfaction - Fixed Form B from the NIH Toolbox</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to day 60</time_frame>
    <description>This is a brief 5-item questionnaire which can be administered to adults over the age of 18. It uses a 7-point Likert scale with responses that range from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The scores for each question are added to create a raw score. This raw score is then converted to a T-score using a conversion table which represents the mean of the United States population.</description>

    <measure>Changes in sleep quality using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance - Short Form 4a</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to day 60</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment consists of 4 items which measure sleep quality and sleep disturbances using a 5 point likert scale ranging in value from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating greater sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to day 60</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, self-administered questionnaire that scores each of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria for depression on a scale from 0 to 3. Response options include &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;several days&quot;, more than half the days&quot; and &quot;nearly every day&quot;. It is a validated measure of depression severity. Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in anxiety symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to day 60</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a self-reported questionnaire that assesses for the seven core symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and severity. Response options include &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;several days&quot;, more than half the days&quot; and &quot;nearly every day&quot;. GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut-points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>
