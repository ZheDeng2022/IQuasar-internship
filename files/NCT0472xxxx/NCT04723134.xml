    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a twelve-week single-center, randomized, double-blind evaluation of&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of a folic acid wound treatment (FAWT) versus Placebo in the&#xD;
      promotion of healing of chronic (greater than 4-weeks), early stage diabetic foot ulcer&#xD;
      (ES-DFU) wounds (PEDIS-Grade 1 or 2 Depth - wound above fascia without exposed muscle, tendon&#xD;
      or bone). Study wound areas will be between 1.0 and 12.0 cm-square.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronic, non-healing DFU is a serious and common complication of diabetes. Chronic DFU&#xD;
      complications are among the most frequent diabetes-related diagnoses for hospitalization and&#xD;
      the leading cause of diabetes-associated lower limb amputations. Increased levels of the&#xD;
      tumor suppressor protein p53 in wound keratinocytes from non-healing DFUs suggests increased&#xD;
      cell death due to significant (p&lt;0.05) transcription factor activation. Treatment with high&#xD;
      dose folic acid (5mg/day) correlates to improved healing in ES-DFU wounds, perhaps by&#xD;
      improving folate/methionine metabolism which provides support for DNA repair, the generation&#xD;
      of reductive equivalents and regulates DNA methylation, an important epigenetic regulator of&#xD;
      p53 transcription activity. Folinic acid calcium salt (calcium folinate) is the bioactive&#xD;
      metabolite of folic acid that does not require reduction by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).&#xD;
      In this study, FAWT (2.5-percent by weight) is provided by compounding 1.25-gms of folinic&#xD;
      acid calcium salt with 50-gms of the Placebo (Plurogel Burn and Wound Dressingâ„¢, Medline&#xD;
      Industries, Inc.). Experimental studies of topical folinic acid demonstrate significant&#xD;
      improvements in wound healing parameters with decreased cellular markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      increased active signaling of tissue repair. Topical administration of FAWT removes the&#xD;
      potential for the adverse impact of high blood folate levels observed with oral high dose&#xD;
      folic acid, that could include an increase in the occurrence of sub-classes of colon or&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that during a twelve-week evaluation period FAWT may provide&#xD;
      significant (p&lt;0.05) improvements, as compared to Placebo, in the rate of healing and&#xD;
      complete closure (re-epithelialization) of chronic ES-DFU wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two phases: Screening and Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Phase (first 4 weeks) is designed to determine if male and female Veterans&#xD;
      selected as study participants are eligible to proceed to the Treatment Phase of the study.&#xD;
      This phase consists of screening assessments that will include evaluation of the rate of&#xD;
      study wound closure while the participants receive standard of care (SOC) therapy, including&#xD;
      off-loading. SOC treatment will include wound cleansing and sharp debridement, fluorescent&#xD;
      surveillance of wounds for microbial colonization and the management of infections.&#xD;
      Participants observed with greater than 50-percent wound area reduction at the end of 4-weeks&#xD;
      will be excluded from entering the Treatment Phase. Those observed with less than 50-percent&#xD;
      wound area reduction and who continue to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      allowed to enter the Treatment Phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Phase (12 weeks) will continue with assessments of the eligibility of the&#xD;
      remaining study participants. Thirty study participants (n=30) selected after the four-week&#xD;
      Screening Phase will be randomly assigned to either the FAWT or Placebo group of fifteen&#xD;
      subjects each (n=15). Study participants and the treating staff members will be blinded to&#xD;
      the treatment (FAWT or Placebo) being provided to each participant. During the Treatment&#xD;
      Phase subjects will be evaluated every two weeks. These evaluations will include the&#xD;
      collection of selected blood chemistries, assessment of ulcer wound healing, wound&#xD;
      measurements and microbial surveillance using digital imaging. Paired marginal wound tissue&#xD;
      biopsies (3-mm) will be obtained during two points of the Treatment Phase: 1) at the&#xD;
      beginning of the Treatment Phase and 2) following the complete closure of the wound or after&#xD;
      twelve weeks of Treatment. Study evaluations of the wound will continue until the wound is&#xD;
      closed or at twelve weeks, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any SC who is pregnant or breast feeding, will not be allowed to enroll, or continue,&#xD;
             in the study, as pregnancy or breast feeding may impact the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with DFU-wounds less than 1cm-square or greater than 12cm-square will be&#xD;
