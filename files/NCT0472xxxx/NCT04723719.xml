  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 72% of adolescents with ADHD portray sleep problems. The most common sleep difficulties&#xD;
      in adolescents with ADHD are initial insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, non-restorative or&#xD;
      restless sleep. These difficulties seem to be causally related to increased ADHD symptom&#xD;
      impairment, oppositional and depressive symptomatology, and functional impairments in daily&#xD;
      life, resulting in a vicious circle of sleep problems and impairment. Thus, reducing sleep&#xD;
      problems is an important intervention target. However, to date there is no evidence-based&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral sleep treatment available. Sleep-focused treatments need adaptation&#xD;
      towards this developmental phase/disorder for effectiveness, as ADHD and sleep problems are&#xD;
      bi-directional. Therefore, a blended treatment targeting the core deficits integrating&#xD;
      motivational interviewing, planning skills and sleep interventions is needed. Thus, the aim&#xD;
      of this project is testing the short and 3 months follow-up effectiveness of the blended CBT&#xD;
      sleep intervention in adolescents with ADHD.&#xD;
