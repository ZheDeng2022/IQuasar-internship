      This study is a 12-week open-label, prospective, observational study to assess how subjects&#xD;
      with chronic mechanical back pain respond to cannabidiol (CBD)&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Purpose: To Assess the Response to Cannabidiol (CBD) Oil in Subjects with Chronic Mechanical&#xD;
      Back Pain (MBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Cannabis use provides many patients with significant low back pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Mechanical back pain is a condition affecting around 30% of the general adult&#xD;
      population. It is the second most common reason to see a family physician and the most common&#xD;
      reason patients end up on work disability. Long term chronic pain is associated with mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders in a lot of patients, which suggests that a successful plan for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic pain must also consider the treatment of possible co-existing&#xD;
      psychiatrist conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the change in pain measured by 0 to 10 point visual analogue scale (VAS) for&#xD;
      patients with chronic mechanical back pain treated with CBD oil&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      52 patients with pain severity ≥4/10 on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for at least 3 months who&#xD;
      have decided to take CBD oil (up to 50 mg SL BID) to manage their symptoms will be recruited&#xD;
      to participate. As per standard of care, patients will be encouraged to keep baseline doses&#xD;
      of analgesics (if any) stable for the first 6 weeks of the study to monitor their response to&#xD;
      CBD oil. Analgesic medications will be allowed to be adjusted between weeks 6 to 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be assessed at baseline, week 6, and week 12 for a total of 3 virtual&#xD;
      visits. Patients will be asked to fill out online questionnaires and a medication diary to&#xD;
      assess effectiveness and compliance. Safety will also be assessed throughout the study.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to report any adverse events (AEs) at study completion or earlier if&#xD;
      they decide to withdraw. In addition, they will be provided a phone number to PerceiveMD&#xD;
      where they can report any serious adverse events (SAEs) in between scheduled visits. Patients&#xD;
      will be instructed to report any SAEs within 24 hours. PerceiveMD will then communicate this&#xD;
      to one of the Investigators the same day. All adverse reactions will be recorded in the study&#xD;
      electronic medical record (EMR), InputHealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be measured in all enrolled patients who are dispensed drug.&#xD;
      Patient data will be collected using online electronic questionnaires generated through&#xD;
      InputHealth and stored within InputHealth. Patient data will additionally be collected at the&#xD;
      time of their virtual visits with the Investigator(s) at PerceiveMD. This data will be&#xD;
      recorded and stored within InputHealth. For descriptive summaries, the mean, sample size (n),&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), median, minimum (min), and maximum (max) will&#xD;
      be calculated for continuous variables. For categorical variables, frequency and percentage&#xD;
      in each category will be provided. Change from baseline value will be calculated at each&#xD;
      visit. No imputation will be made for missing values. Pain VAS, modified Oswestry Low Back&#xD;
      Pain Disability, and GAD7 will be compared between groups, with mean values and 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval provided. Percentage of patients with 30% and 50% improvement in pain VAS&#xD;
      will also be assessed. Change in analgesic medication dose and use will be analyzed and&#xD;
      reported. Based on the extent of missing data, additional analyses may be conducted (e.g.&#xD;
      last observation carried forward (LOCF), non-responder index) as a sensitivity analysis to&#xD;
      support the primary analysis&#xD;

        1. This study will be based out of PerceiveMD, a clinic with expertise in CBD therapy.&#xD;
             Patients will be approached for enrollment at rheumatology, physiatry, and pain&#xD;
             clinics as well as PerceiveMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Baseline screening visit and follow will be done online using a PIPA/PIPEDA compliant&#xD;
             video or audio conference. Prospective patients are those who have decided to take CBD&#xD;
             oil for the treatment of MBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Flyers will be given to health care providers at rheumatology, physiatry, and pain&#xD;
             clinics as well as PerceiveMD. Flyers will also be directly available to patients at&#xD;
             these locations and they can contact Dr. Lim if they would like to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prospective patients will be identified using the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
