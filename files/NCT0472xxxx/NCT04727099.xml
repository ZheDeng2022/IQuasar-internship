    <textblock>
      This study is intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PicoWay™ Laser System&#xD;
      for its intended uses: clearance of benign pigmented lesions and improvement in appearance of&#xD;
      wrinkles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the PicoWay™ Laser System for its intended uses: clearance of benign pigmented lesions and&#xD;
      improvement in appearance of wrinkles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 eligible participants will be enrolled at up to five (5) sites. Participants will&#xD;
      receive up to 6 treatments to the face and/or off-face locations with treatment intervals of&#xD;
      4 weeks +/- 2 weeks. Participants will complete follow-up visits for clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      photography at 1 and 3 months after the final treatment. Total study duration is&#xD;
      approximately 12 months (up to 9 months for treatment and 3 months for follow up).&#xD;
