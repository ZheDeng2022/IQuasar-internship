  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HBM4003 in combination with Toripalimab. The expected duration of treatment for each subject&#xD;
      will vary according to the number of cycles completed; the number of cycles will depend on&#xD;
      whether the subject benefits from the treatment. The study consists of a 4-week screening&#xD;
      period, a 21-day treatment cycle (repeatable, depending on the presence/absence of clinical&#xD;
      benefit), EOT visit after discontinuation of treatment, and 2 follow-up visits 28 days (± 2&#xD;
      days) and 84 days (± 5 days) after the last study medication.&#xD;

      An open-label Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of HBM4003 combined with toripalimab in patients with advanced melanoma and other&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is composed of two part, part 1 will be approximately 31subjects and Part 2 will be&#xD;
      approximately 30 subjects.&#xD;
