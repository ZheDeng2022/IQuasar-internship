  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study. The primary aim is to assess the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis of Point of Care (POC) handheld&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiogram images (POC handheld echocardiogram) compared to the current&#xD;
      gold-standard of transthoracic echocardiogram images acquired and analysed by a British&#xD;
      Society of Echocardiography (BSE) accredited operator, using a standard echocardiogram&#xD;
      machine (standard TTE), for the diagnosis of Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction&#xD;
      (HFrEF), in patients referred from the community for investigation of suspected new Heart&#xD;
      Failure (HF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      1. Demonstrate that in comparison to using the current gold standard of BSE accredited&#xD;
           operator echocardiography within a HFDP, using AI enhanced analysis of POC handheld&#xD;
           echocardiography is accurate and safe. This has the potential to improve access to&#xD;
           timelier echocardiography in order to achieve earlier HF diagnosis and treatment, which&#xD;
           is known to delay/prevent progression to HF hospitalisation. It will also provide useful&#xD;
           information regarding the future feasibility of using AI enhanced analysis of POC&#xD;
           handheld echocardiography in the community, for investigation of people with suspected&#xD;
           new HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Facilitate the digitisation of an NHS Heart Failure diagnostic service in order to&#xD;
           standardise and improve the quality of data collection and clinical care provided within&#xD;
           the service.&#xD;

        864 participants, who have been referred for echocardiography to investigate a suspected&#xD;
        new diagnosis of HF, but who have not been able to undergo echocardiographic testing yet&#xD;
        due to additional barriers and delays to access imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, will be&#xD;
        recruited from the HF diagnostic pathway waiting list in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&#xD;
        between 1st December 2020 and 31st March 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study visits would normally be undertaken within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde hospitals.&#xD;
        For public health physical distancing compliance reasons, study visits will take place in&#xD;
        the NHS Louisa Jordan hospital (situated within the Scottish Exhibition and Conference&#xD;
        Centre), temporarily converted for NHS clinical use to manage demand vs capacity issues&#xD;
        during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

             investigators, may render the participant unable to understand, attend and/or undergo&#xD;
