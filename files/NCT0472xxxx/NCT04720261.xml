  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a personalized caplacizumab regimen based&#xD;
      on ADAMTS13 activity monitoring in adult acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP):&#xD;
      This study is a phase II, prospective, multicenter non-inferiority single-arm study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADAMTS13 activity will be evaluated on day 7 after the end of daily PE and every 7 days until&#xD;
      ADAMTS13 activity ≥ 20% is reached. In case of persistent severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (≤ 20%),&#xD;
      caplacizumab administration could be extended for a maximum of 58 days after the end of the&#xD;
      daily PE period and should be accompanied by an adjusted immunosuppressive therapy as needed.&#xD;
      This duration is in accordance with the HERCULES study protocol and its SmPC.&#xD;
