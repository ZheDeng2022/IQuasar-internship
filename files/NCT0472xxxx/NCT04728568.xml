      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for High Grade Meningioma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meningioma is one of the most common primary intracranial tumors, accounting for 13% to 26%&#xD;
      of all intracranial tumors. Although most meningiomas are benign tumors and can be cured by&#xD;
      surgical resection, more than 20% of WHO II (atypical) and about 3% of WHO III meningiomas&#xD;
      are more likely to have local recurrence after initial treatment , And the lifetime is poor.&#xD;
      The immunotherapy represented by PD-1 has achieved remarkable efficacy in the treatment of&#xD;
      solid tumors, but the application of PD-1 in recurrent meningioma is rarely reported. The&#xD;
      study found that the expression of PD-L1 mRNA and protein in high-grade meningioma cells&#xD;
      increased, and the total number of T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, was significantly&#xD;
      reduced, suggesting an inhibitory tumor immune microenvironment. Recent studies have shown&#xD;
      that giving patients anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy prior to conventional treatment can&#xD;
      improve the pathological response, enable the body to produce an enhanced and sustained&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune response, and form a tumor microenvironment conducive to immunotherapy.&#xD;
      Therefore, giving PD-1 antibody before surgery is a new idea for the treatment of&#xD;
      meningiomas. This project aims to investigate whether patients with recurrent meningioma will&#xD;
      change their immune function and prolong survival after preoperative PD-1 antibody treatment.&#xD;
      It is planned to use flow cytometry, multiple immunofluorescence histochemistry technology, T&#xD;
      cell receptor sequencing, etc to detect the changes in the patient's immune function before&#xD;
      and after treatment, observe the pathological remission rate of PD-1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment of recurrent meningioma, and identify potential response biomarkers,&#xD;
      and conduct in-depth discussions on this treatment plan to further determine the treatment&#xD;
      mode Clinical value and specific mechanism of action in order to improve the clinical&#xD;
      treatment level of patients with recurrent meningioma.&#xD;
