      Evaluation of a novel mobile application designed to estimate blood pressure&#xD;
      (systolic-diastolic and mean arterial pressure) based on collected optical signals on&#xD;
      patient's finger treated in intensive care unit patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the blood pressure values measured by a novel mobile&#xD;
      phone application ( camera of the smartphone will be obstructed by the patient's right index)&#xD;
      and the values measured by reference method used (the radial arterial line)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted in the intensive care unit at Erasme Hospital Brussels, Belgium will be&#xD;
      recruited and if they have an arterial line for at least two days&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OptiBP Application is a mobile application installed on a mobile phone which is a&#xD;
      non-invasive data-logger intended to acquire physiological data from patients. By applying&#xD;
      the patient's finger on a smartphone's camera, a movie is generated and transformed into&#xD;
      values of diastolic, mean and systolic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three measures will be taken (spaced by one minute) with both methods each hour for 5 hours&#xD;
      and this will be done for 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's blood pressure will be measured in parallel with the mobile application and&#xD;
      with the reference equipment (arterial line).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the values obtained by the two methods will be compared to confirm the reliability of&#xD;
      the data obtained with the novel mobile application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is therefore to compare blood pressure values as obtained by the analysis of the&#xD;
      data recorded by the OptiBP Mobile Application, against simultaneous measurements provided by&#xD;
      the arterial line (gold standard)&#xD;
