      This pilot and feasibility study will be first US study to determine if a magnetically&#xD;
      controlled capsule (MCC) can effectively visualize the anatomy of the stomach like a more&#xD;
      traditional upper endoscopy (EGD). This study is designed to enroll participants who have a&#xD;
      standard indication for an EGD and are also willing to get an MCC exam. The MCC is driven&#xD;
      actively by a clinician unlike prior capsule endoscopes that move passively by gravity or&#xD;
      peristalsis. Thus, a physician will be able to look more closely at areas of the stomach that&#xD;
      might be concerning and might need further evaluation and/or treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, upper endoscopy is frequently performed for a variety of symptoms&#xD;
      including heartburn, bloating, nausea, burping, and epigastric pain/burning. The prevalence&#xD;
      of these symptoms may provide as much as 25% of a gastroenterologist's office practice. In&#xD;
      general, the diagnostic yield of an EGD is low. Without alarm symptoms, as many as 70% of&#xD;
      procedures are negative for significant findings. One major indication is testing for H.&#xD;
      pylori for which EGD may be unnecessary, because H. pylori detection can be accomplished by&#xD;
      fecal antigen testing or breath testing as accurately as biopsy and less expensively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators believe there is an opportunity to improve the risk stratification of patients&#xD;
      that undergo endoscopy through the use of MCC. Our primary hypothesis is that MCC allows for&#xD;
      visualization of the stomach of symptomatic patients referred from the emergency department,&#xD;
      urgent care, and primary care settings with clinical symptoms appropriate for endoscopy. A&#xD;
      prospective study is proposed to evaluate the feasibility, safety and accuracy of this novel&#xD;
      diagnostic modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is one of the most common medical procedures and indications&#xD;
      for epigastric pain, bloating, burning, heart-burn, excessive belching, nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      anemia, and weight loss. Access to EGD is limited by the cost, the need for an endoscopy&#xD;
      specialist and the need for anesthesia. Lack of access to an EGD is a health disparity&#xD;
      associated with increased gastric cancer mortality-to-incidence ratio. A novel approach to&#xD;
      visualization of the upper GI tract is needed to increase access to care and improve&#xD;
      diagnostic capabilities. Magnetically controlled capsule (MCC) is the first wireless&#xD;
      ingestible capsule endoscope that is able to be directed by operator to visualize all&#xD;
      anatomic areas of the stomach (NaviCamâ„¢, AnX Robotica). This study will be the first US study&#xD;
      to examine the feasibility of using MCC in patients with relevant symptoms to the stomach.&#xD;
      The goal is to ascertain if the diagnostic capabilities of the MCC compared to EGD are&#xD;
      comparable for symptomatic patients who have clinical indications for an EGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCC offers potential advantages over traditional EGD including the ability to be performed 24&#xD;
      hours a day without sedation and to be performed without an endoscopist. In addition, the MCC&#xD;
      is less invasive, does not cause discomfort, and enables the patient to pursue normal daily&#xD;
      activities after the procedure. Non-specialist physicians can administer the MCC and&#xD;
      interpretation can be done in real-time or asynchronously by GI specialists. The MCC may&#xD;
      impact decisions regarding the need for hospitalization, the need for additional diagnostic&#xD;
      testing such as biopsy, the need for additional therapeutic interventions such as endoscopic&#xD;
      hemostasis and polypectomy, and the need for further risk stratification of disease. The&#xD;
      eventual work-flow may be similar to that of many current diagnostic tests such as radiologic&#xD;
      examinations. This ability to transmit images could become especially important in rural&#xD;
      communities or in communities that have limited access to a gastroenterologist or surgeon.&#xD;
      Incorporation of the MCC into current practice could follow a trajectory similar to that of&#xD;
      point-of-care ultrasonography, an imaging modality in which non-radiologist physicians have&#xD;
      become increasingly skilled and for which indications continue to expand. The American&#xD;
      Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy states that credentials for capsule endoscopy should be&#xD;
      determined independently from other endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy,&#xD;
      or any other endoscopic procedure. The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy also&#xD;
      emphasizes sound medical training, appropriate patient selection, correct interpretation, and&#xD;
      continued medical management for these capsule endoscopists. Capsule endoscopy requires only&#xD;
      image interpretation and does not require procedural skill training associated with other&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures; therefore, ED physicians, urgent care physicians, primary care&#xD;
      doctors, and mid-level practitioners can meet these criteria with basic training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindications to the MCC are similar to contraindications for established capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy (CE) which has been performed safely in a variety of clinical settings. The only&#xD;
      absolute contraindication is intestinal obstruction. There is a low risk of non-natural&#xD;
      excretion of capsules estimated at less than 1 in 100. In general, the CE procedure poses&#xD;
      significantly less risk than traditional EGD, and multiple studies have shown that CE is well&#xD;
      tolerated in patients with acute symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost of the capsule is an important factor that may affect future use in the ED and&#xD;
      clinics. The use of MCC in the ED, urgent care and primary care can potentially lead to more&#xD;
      patients being safely managed in an outpatient setting. MCC may be especially cost-effective&#xD;
      if it reduces hospital admissions, need for anesthesia, missed work days or overall EGDs.&#xD;
      Future technological developments in the MCC may allow for operator to collect biopsy samples&#xD;
      and perform therapeutic functions.&#xD;
