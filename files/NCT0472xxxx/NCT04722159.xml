  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies on the impact of RDN on cardiovascular surrogate markers have shown a variety of&#xD;
      beneficial effects: RDN is associated with a decrease blood pressure (BP), left ventricular&#xD;
      mass (LVM), a reduction in aortic pulse-wave velocity and BP variability as well as an&#xD;
      increase in heart rate-recovery. Several of these aspects have been observed independently of&#xD;
      office BP response, and might be mediated by a direct modulation of the sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system. Moreover, several independent real - world registries have shown an association of&#xD;
      renal denervation and sustained blood pressure reductions of clinically relevant magnitude up&#xD;
      to 36 months of follow - up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether the sum of these effects may translate into an improvement of clinical outcomes&#xD;
      remains unclear and constitutes the primary subject of proposed registry based study.&#xD;

      Two registries interlinked by the Swedish personal identification number The Swedish Registry&#xD;
      for Renal Denervation: The Swedish Registry for Renal Denervation is an investigator -&#xD;
      initiated academic online database, developed by our group and supported by the Swedish&#xD;
      authorities. The registry contains 130 variables summarizing baseline patient&#xD;
      characteristics, procedural details, as well as follow - up data. The database contains&#xD;
      patient data from the seven Swedish university hospitals that have performed RDN since 2011&#xD;
      exclusively, thereby providing a nation-wide data set with a follow-up of up to five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swedish Primary Care Cardiovascular Database (SPCCD):&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPCCD comprises data from 75 000 patients diagnosed with hypertension collected at primary&#xD;
      care centres in the Stockholm and Skaraborg region during the time period 2001-2008. Patient&#xD;
      baseline characteristics may be derived from the individual electronic medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the incidence of the composite end-point of myocardial infarction, stroke,&#xD;
           heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients with resistant hypertension treated&#xD;
           with RDN as compared to conservatively treated resistant hypertensives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our hypothesis is that RDN treated individuals will show a lower event rate in regard to&#xD;
           the composite clinical end - point during the first 5 years of follow - up when compared&#xD;
           to conservatively treated individuals with resistant hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients fulfilling the criteria for resistant hypertension according to the criteria as&#xD;
      applied in the Swedish Registry for Renal Denervation (Office BP &gt;140/90 despite treatment&#xD;
      with at least three antihypertensive drugs) with a follow up period period of at least 5&#xD;
      years (SPCCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of this study is the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart&#xD;
      failure and cardiovascular death in patients with resistant hypertension having undergone&#xD;
      renal denervation (n = 300), compared to a control group of conservatively treated resistant&#xD;
      hypertensives from the SPCCD. The necessary information about the diagnose codes for the&#xD;
      events relevant for the primary end - point is made possible through the unique Swedish&#xD;
      personal identification number and available through the Swedish population based registries&#xD;
      for both the case - and control - group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to adjust for differences in the baseline variables age, sex, diabetes, coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, heart failure, baseline blood pressure, duration of hypertension, number of&#xD;
      hypertensive drugs, we will perform a propensity score matched analysis which will be&#xD;
      performed in 1 : 3 fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential significance Despite the promising results of RDN in regard to several clinically&#xD;
      relevant surrogate markers, including blood pressure, there are no outcome data available in&#xD;
      the literature. Thus, the findings of this study may provide novel insights into the clinical&#xD;
      effects of renal denervation and assess whether the sum of the previously observed beneficial&#xD;
      effects may translate into an improved clinical outcome.&#xD;
