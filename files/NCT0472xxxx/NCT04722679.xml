  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a heart condition that causes an abnormal and fast heart rate. For&#xD;
      people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), this is caused by problems such as high&#xD;
      blood pressure and diabetes. NVAF happens more often in elderly people and can lead to&#xD;
      stroke, heart failure, and death. Doctors are currently able to give patients a type of&#xD;
      treatment called an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants work by making the blood thinner. They are&#xD;
      thought to help reduce the risk of stroke and death caused by NVAF. In this study,&#xD;
      researchers wanted to learn more about what elderly people think of taking anticoagulants&#xD;
      that do not have any vitamin K in them. These are called non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include up to about 150 Belgian men and women aged 75 years and over who have&#xD;
      NVAF and have been treated with NOACs. The study will also include about 10 doctors who have&#xD;
      treated these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, there will be no required tests or visits. Instead, patients will answer a&#xD;
      paper questionnaire about their use of NOACs. The researchers will ask the doctors questions&#xD;
      about how they treat their patients using NOACs. The main types of questions the researchers&#xD;
      will focus on are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient characteristics of the elderly with NVAF who are treated with NOACs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The level of fear of the elderly about bleeding while using a blood thinner and the fear&#xD;
           of stroke/thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The geriatrician's thoughts about using NOACs to treat NVAF in elderly patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those patient characteristics geriatrician's find most important when deciding on the&#xD;
           anticoagulation treatment in the elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information from this study will be collected between February and April 2021. But, the&#xD;
      whole study will take about 6 months to finish and is expected to end in July 2021.&#xD;
