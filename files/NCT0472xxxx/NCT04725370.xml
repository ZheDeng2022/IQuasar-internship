  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare types of and risk factors for cleft lip and palate in&#xD;
      a Guatemalan population to a United States population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Demographic, surgical, and cleft type data from US patients were gathered via chart review of&#xD;
      the electronic medical record. Data from Guatemalan patients was gathered orally from patient&#xD;
      caregivers in their native language. Consent was also given orally in the caregivers native&#xD;
      language. All data was de-identified prior to analysis.&#xD;
