    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to include currently available information from women with&#xD;
      severe postpartum haemorrhage (sPPH) who were treated with NovoSeven® and to examine whether&#xD;
      NovoSeven® may have affected the course of the PPH in these women, specifically the control&#xD;
      of bleeding. Data will be included from previous cohort studies from four countries: United&#xD;
      Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Denmark, and France.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective non-interventional cohort study of women with sPPH who were treated&#xD;
      with NovoSeven® or other standard of care. The analyses will be done utilising data that were&#xD;
      collected for other purposes in four countries. The data include four previously established&#xD;
      cohorts from the UK, France, Denmark and The Netherlands. In short, these population-based&#xD;
      studies collected data, using enhanced systems, from the medical records of the women who met&#xD;
      the case definition for each of the respective studies. Data are available from approximately&#xD;
      1260 (Netherlands, 39 exposed to NovoSeven®), 1655 (France, 18 exposed to NovoSeven®), 245&#xD;
      (DK, 28 exposed to NovoSeven®) and 162 (UK, 13 exposed to NovoSeven®) patients with&#xD;
      persistent PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding patient characteristics, concomitant treatment and outcomes in PPH&#xD;
      women treated with NovoSeven® is limited in many countries. The current study will therefore&#xD;
      include a description of women with PPH treated with NovoSeven®, or standard of care in each&#xD;
      of the four cohorts. This will also include an assessment of the comparability of the cohorts&#xD;
      and the overall rate of clinical outcomes in the study population. To aid in this assessment&#xD;
      propensity scores will be calculated and used to match the women with an event of sPPH&#xD;
      treated with NovoSeven® and those that are not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UK and Danish datasets were national and the datasets from Netherlands, and France were&#xD;
      from multiple regions. The TeMpOH-1 study in the Netherlands collected data from 75% of&#xD;
      national births. The EPIMOMS study in France collected data from six regions: Alsace,&#xD;
      Lorraine, Auvergne, Rhone-Alpes, Ile-de-France and Basse-Normandie and these regions&#xD;
      represented 18% of national births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data come from the below described cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denmark: The Danish data were identified and collected using the Danish Medical Birth&#xD;
      Registry (DMBR) and the Danish Trans-fusion Database (DTD). During the period 2001-2009,&#xD;
      women who had a birth identified in the DMBR and had transfused 10 or more units of red blood&#xD;
      cells (RBC) within 24 hours identified from DTD were included in study. The DMBR collects&#xD;
      information on all births in Denmark and this includes clinical and demographic data from&#xD;
      each birth. The DTD is a national database and contains information of the quantity and type&#xD;
      of blood products transfused and the time of each transfusion. Additional data were extracted&#xD;
      from the patient charts (Study II in the PhD thesis(PubMed ID 29510809)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      France: This study included data from the EPIMOMS study (PubMed ID 33423750). This is a&#xD;
      population-based study that prospectively identified cases of severe maternal morbidity from&#xD;
      6 regions in France: Alsace, Lorraine, Auvergne, Rhone-Alpes, Ile-de-France and Normandy.&#xD;
      Cases were identified for a year between 2012-2013 from 113 intensive care units and 118&#xD;
      maternity units. Selected maternal morbidities were identified by a local reporter in each&#xD;
      hospital. Data concerning demographics, previous medical history, current pregnancy, causes,&#xD;
      management and maternal and perinatal outcomes were collected from the patient charts of each&#xD;
      woman. Major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) was one of the severe maternal morbidities in the&#xD;
      EPIMOMS study. To be included as a MOH case, women had to be at least 22 weeks of gestation&#xD;
      or more and had to meet one of the following criteria: 1. ≥1500mls blood loss; 2. blood&#xD;
      transfusion ≥ 4 RBC; 3. uterine artery embolisation, ligation or compressive uterine sutures;&#xD;
      4. have an emergency peripartum hysterectomy; 5. Haemorrhage with organ dysfunction as per&#xD;
      EPIMOMS definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Netherlands: TeMpOH-1 was a national retrospective cohort study conducted between January&#xD;
      2011 and January 2013 in the Netherlands, which included 75% of all hospitals. Women were&#xD;
      identified using records from blood transfusion services and birth registries of&#xD;
      participating hospitals. Data were collected from medical records and included information&#xD;
      about previous medical history, current pregnancy, causes of haemorrhage, haematological&#xD;
      parameters, blood components, fluid resuscitation and surgical and medical management(PubMed&#xD;
      ID31730187 and 30784827). Women who experienced an obstetric haemorrhage and had received at&#xD;
      least one of the following were included: 1. four units or more of RBC ; 2. multicomponent&#xD;
      blood transfusion (RBC and fresh frozen plasma and/or platelet concentrates); 3. plasma in&#xD;
      addition to RBCs as a result of obstetric haemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      United Kingdom : Data from UK comes from a national surveillance system used to identify&#xD;
      cases of massive transfusion from consultant led obstetric units nationally in the UK.&#xD;
      Reporters were asked to complete a data collection form using the medical records of the&#xD;
      women. Data were collected anonymously. During the period between June 2013 to July 2014,&#xD;
      information on women who fulfilled the following criteria were included: 1. received 8 or&#xD;
      more units of RBC transfused within 24 hours ; 2. 20 or more weeks of gestation. The United&#xD;
      Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System was used to identify the patients&#xD;
      (https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/downloads/files/ukoss/forms/UKOSS-Major-Obstetric-Haemorrhage.pdf)&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be answered using propensity score matching to ensure&#xD;
      exchangeability between sPPH patients treated with NovoSeven® and those that were not across&#xD;
      data from the Netherlands, Denmark and France (if these are comparable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For exposed women: Time0 is defined as time of first administration of NovoSeven®. It occurs&#xD;
      x minutes after onset of sPPH. For every exposed woman, all unexposed and eligible women are&#xD;
      evaluated at this time=time0. The ones with similar propensity score are selected for&#xD;
      matching (up to four will be selected). Thus, for unexposed women (matched controls): Time0&#xD;
      is the timepoint used when they were selected for matching. It is equal to the period from&#xD;
      onset of sPPH to time of first administration of NovoSeven® for the patient for which they&#xD;
      are a matched control. In this way exposed and unexposed women are comparable because they&#xD;
      have similar propensity score at the same (specific) Time0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, the following approach will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Propensity score models and matching will be performed separately by country&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matching will be done within patients with the same delivery mode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pooling will be done after matching including all countries which allows formal analysis&#xD;
           - this will be the primary population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary analysis will be based on the pooled data - meaning there we will have 1&#xD;
           (primary) p-value for the primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup-analyses of the primary endpoint will be done by country - there we will have 1&#xD;
           (supportive) p-value per country&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propensity score matching will be performed to ensure comparability between women with an&#xD;
      event of sPPH being exposed to NovoSeven® with women with an event of sPPH that are not&#xD;
      exposed to NovoSeven at the matching timepoint. In this approach, the propensity score will&#xD;
      reflect the estimated probability of being administered with NovoSeven® during the course of&#xD;
      severe PPH. A propensity score for every woman with sPPH will be estimated by an appropriate&#xD;
      analytic model with NovoSeven® as the dependent variable. Covariates associated with&#xD;
      initiation of NovoSeven® administration will be included in a model to calculate propensity&#xD;
      scores. Characteristics considered to be potential confounders for the association between&#xD;
      use of NovoSeven® and the outcome or characteristics considered to be risk factors for the&#xD;
      occurrence of the primary outcome measure alone will be included as covariates in the&#xD;
      propensity score model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics that could be included as covariates are (not an exhausted list): gestational&#xD;
      age, multiple pregnancy, cause of PPH, volume of blood loss at time of intervention, and&#xD;
      haemostatic drugs used (other than NovoSeven®) that had already been applied at the time of&#xD;
      intervention. A matching algorithm for the propensity score will be used to match women with&#xD;
      an event of sPPH exposed to NovoSeven® with women with an event of sPPH that are not at that&#xD;
      timepoint. Women will be censored when they have been hysterectomised, dies, or stopped&#xD;
      having PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matching will be done by up to 1:4 with a calliper of 0.1. If this is not possible a calliper&#xD;
      of 0.2 will be used instead. The criteria for switching to 0.2 will be described in the SAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimand will address the relative effect of NovoSeven® compared to propensity score&#xD;
      matched controls on the occurrence of invasive procedures in women with an event of sPPH. The&#xD;
      five attributes of the estimand can be seen below. The estimand is defined from the following&#xD;
      five elements outlined in the ICH E9(R1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. The treatment conditions are NovoSeven® vs. propensity scored matched controls not&#xD;
      receiving NovoSeven®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. The treatment effect will be estimated for women with an event of sPPH defined by the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria in the four cohorts exposed to NovoSeven® and their matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. The treatment effect is assessed by the occurrence of invasive procedures within 20&#xD;
      minutes to 24 hours following time0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Intercurrent events will be handled by a hypothetical strategy or a treatment policy&#xD;
      strategy (further details in protocol Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. The treatment effect will be quantified by the odds ratio.&#xD;
