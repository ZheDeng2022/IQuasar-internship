      The purpose of this research is to examine if an experimental drug combination impacts the&#xD;
      survival rate of individuals with Leptomeningeal Metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves an experimental drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenvatinib&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib in&#xD;
      patients with leptomeningeal metastases from any solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenvatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment will last for up to 35 cycles (a cycle is 21 days long), or until the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or unacceptable side effects. Participants will be followed for up to 90&#xD;
      days after the end of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 19 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug combination to learn whether the drug&#xD;
      combination works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug&#xD;
      combination is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved pembrolizumab or lenvatinib for&#xD;
      this specific disease but each has been approved for other uses.&#xD;

             suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. No testing for HIV, Hepatitis B,&#xD;

             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is&#xD;
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required&#xD;
             unless mandated by local health authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment&#xD;
             (except for patients receiving letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, tamoxifen,&#xD;
             fulvestrant, trastuzumab, bisphosphonates, denosumab or ovarian suppression therapy).&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs).Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requires treatment with high dose systemic corticosteroids defined as dexamethasone&#xD;
             &gt;2mg/day or bioequivalent within 7 days of initiating therapy.&#xD;

             corticosteroids as described in Section 3.2.15, within three months of start of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe hypersensitivity (Grade 3 or higher) to pembrolizumab, lenvatinib, or any of&#xD;
             their excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior treatment with any treatment targeting VEGF-directed angiogenesis,&#xD;
             any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 agent, or with an agent directed to another&#xD;
             stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137).&#xD;
&#xD;

             degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g., carotid artery)&#xD;
             should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated&#xD;
             with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants having &gt; 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing unless a 24-hour urine&#xD;

             an optimized regimen of antihypertensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal malabsorption, gastrointestinal anastomosis, or any other condition&#xD;

             transplant requiring chronic immunosuppressant therapy necessary to prevent graft&#xD;
             rejection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Will need immediate local surgery or radiation for brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to undergo MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electrolyte abnormalities that have not been corrected.&#xD;

             than New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, unstable angina, myocardial&#xD;
