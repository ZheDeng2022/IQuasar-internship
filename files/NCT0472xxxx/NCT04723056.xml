  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined as having recurrent abdominal pain associated with&#xD;
      defecation or a change of bowel habits. The pathophysiology of IBS can be looked through the&#xD;
      biopsychosocial model of disease which is defined by the complex interplay between genetic,&#xD;
      cultural, environmental, and psychosocial factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of IBS is multifaceted and ranges from exercise to dietary restrictions, however,&#xD;
      psychological treatments to target the gut-brain axis such as cognitive-behavior therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) have also been shown to be an effective therapy, and aims to address the psychological&#xD;
      and environmental stressors that contribute to the symptoms. Therefore the purpose of the&#xD;
      study is investigate the effectiveness of Zemedy, a mobile application that enables the&#xD;
      digital delivery of a CBT program to people with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT has been shown to reduce the severity of intractable IBS symptoms by as much as 70%. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to learn whether the Zemedy mobile application is effective in the&#xD;
      reduction of IBS. This will be measured based on their IBS Symptom Severity Scores (SSS) at&#xD;
      week 8 compared to baseline.&#xD;
