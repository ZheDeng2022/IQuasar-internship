      Mothers 'perception of breastmilk insufficiency are important conditions affecting babies'&#xD;
      exclusively breastfeeding in the first six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was made to determine the effectiveness of structured education and follow-up in&#xD;
      the management of perceived breastmilk insufficiency among breastfeeding mothers. It was&#xD;
      tested the hypotheses that there are no differences between mothers who have been provided&#xD;
      with structured education and follow-up and those who have not received the education in&#xD;
      terms of initiating breastfeeding in the first one hour, breastmilk insufficiency&#xD;
      perceptions, the rate of exclusive feeding of breast milk to babies 0-2 months old, the&#xD;
      baby's amount of milk intake and weight gain.&#xD;

    <measure>The baby's amount of milk intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Postpartum 3rd-7th day</time_frame>
    <description>assessed using The Scoring System for Measuring a Baby's Intake of Breast Milk. This measurement tool was developed to assess the amount of breast milk a baby is fed. The form is made up of 5 sections: the baby's weight, state of satisfaction, frequency and characteristics of urination and defecation and the condition of the mother's breasts. This tool is filled by observation, measurement and interview. The tool rates each status on the basis of 0, 1 or 2, the highest possible total score being 10. A score of 8-10 indicates that the intake of breast milk is good, 0-7 indicates an insufficient intake.</description>

    <description>This structured educational material was developed by the authors on the basis of the literature. Interventions of the study were carried out in the 32nd-42nd week of pregnancy, 3rd-7th day postpartum, and at the 1st month. At first stage, a 15-20-minute education was given to the pregnant women in the study group in the breastfeeding room of the facility, educational booklets were distributed.
