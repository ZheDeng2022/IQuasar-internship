  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using the data obtained in a study carried out at the Hospital of Alcañiz (Teruel, Spain)&#xD;
      between February and July 2019, with a stabilometric platform and with movement sensors, the&#xD;
      investigators want to demonstrate that the rehabilitation works in those patients with&#xD;
      vertigo or dizziness of cervical origin. For this, the data obtained from that sample, which&#xD;
      was of 67 patients, will be analyzed in a pre-post rehabilitation treatment study,&#xD;
      objectifying whether the patients improved or not, both in terms of imbalance and cervical&#xD;
      pain, if any.&#xD;

      investigators want to demonstrate that the rehabilitation works in those patients with&#xD;
      vertigo or dizziness of cervical origin. For this, the data obtained from that sample, which&#xD;
      was of 67 patients, will be analyzed in a pre-post rehabilitation treatment study,&#xD;
      objectifying whether the patients improved or not, both in terms of imbalance and cervical&#xD;
      pain, if any. The 67 patients attended the rehabilitation consultation where, after taking&#xD;
      the anamnesis, they began to perform balance tests with a stabilometric platform and those&#xD;
      patients with associated neck pain, with cervical motion sensors. Treatment with conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy, electrotherapy or exercises at home was prescribed as appropriate to each one.&#xD;
      3 months later, the patients were examined again in consultation, using a new anamnesis, the&#xD;
      platform and the sensors. With the data obtained in said field work, carried out in 2019, the&#xD;
      present study aims to analyze the usefulness of rehabilitation treatment in vertigo.&#xD;
