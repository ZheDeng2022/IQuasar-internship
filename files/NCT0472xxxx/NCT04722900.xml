  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes is the most common complication during pregrancy. With a screening&#xD;
      between week 24 and 28 of gestation women with gestational diabetes can be identified and&#xD;
      treated. Treatment comprises modification of diet and in some cases taking medication. This&#xD;
      treatment lowers undesirable events like macrosomia or premature birth. However, unitl&#xD;
      gestational diabetes is diagnosed the fetus is exposed to increased intrauterine glucose&#xD;
      levels. The long-term effects of a well-managed gestational diabetes on the development of&#xD;
      the offspring is still not well understood. Therefore, the PREG - Offspring study&#xD;
      investigates several aspects of development in children from healthy and gestational diabetes&#xD;
      mothers until adulthood.&#xD;
