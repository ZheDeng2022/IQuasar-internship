  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of transarterial chemoembolization in treating&#xD;
      patients with uveal melanoma that has spread to the liver (liver metastases). Transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization involves the injection of a blocking agent (gelatin sponge, ethiodized oil)&#xD;
      and a chemotherapy agent (carmustine) directly into the artery in the liver to treat liver&#xD;
      cancers. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carmustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them&#xD;
      from spreading. transarterial chemoembolization with carmustine in combination with&#xD;
      ethiodized oil and gelatin sponge may help cause the tumors in the liver to shrink or&#xD;
      disappear.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy (clinical response) in terms of disease control rate (DCR)&#xD;
      (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) with chemoembolization&#xD;
      of hepatic metastases with 300 mg of carmustine (BCNU) in ethiodized oil in metastatic uveal&#xD;
      melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in uveal melanoma&#xD;
      patients with hepatic metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the toxicity of the above treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) by receiving an infusion of&#xD;
      carmustine dissolved in ethiodized oil and an injection of gelatin sponge. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for bilobar disease or once every 7 weeks (Q7W) for unilobar disease&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until maximum clinical&#xD;
      benefit is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 2&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
