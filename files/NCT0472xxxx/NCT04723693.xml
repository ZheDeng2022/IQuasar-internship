  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the real-life experience and impact of using emicizumab in a&#xD;
      cohort of patients with haemophilia and inhibitors, who were prescribed emicizumab as part of&#xD;
      the early access to medicine schema (EAMS),those who have been in clinical trials and those&#xD;
      now receiving emicizumab as part of routine haemophilia care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators also intend to capture the impact of emicizumab use on the lives of close&#xD;
      family members (parents/carers/children/partners/siblings). Each participant and his family&#xD;
      members will be deemed a study 'dyad'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, observational cohort qualitative research study to be conducted among&#xD;
      patients using emicizumab in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to allow English-speaking patients and their families to tell their own&#xD;
      life stories through narrative accounts. The narratives represent a true sharing of&#xD;
      experiences and therefore offers insight into how these patients and families cope with&#xD;
      haemophilia.&#xD;
