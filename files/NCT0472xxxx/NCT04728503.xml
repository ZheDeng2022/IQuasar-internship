  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study endeavors to implement a brief video-based mindfulness intervention within a&#xD;
      clinic setting for women undergoing pelvic examinations, in hopes of reducing state anxiety&#xD;
      and pain intensity during pelvic exams and improving overall exam satisfaction and likelihood&#xD;
      to return for follow-up exams. This will be a pilot study will take place the University of&#xD;
      Texas Southwestern (UTSW) Lowe Foundation Center for Women's Preventative Health Care. There&#xD;
      will be a treatment and a control arm, estimated 50 women per group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group.&#xD;
      Treatment group will receive a 5-minute mindful movement video-based intervention before&#xD;
      their previously scheduled pelvic exam. Control group will not receive the mindful movement&#xD;
      video-based intervention and will instead be given a handout about the benefits of&#xD;
      mindfulness to read prior to the pelvic exam. Control group will be given access to the&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention via an online link upon completion of participation in the study to&#xD;
      ensure they are provided the opportunity to benefit from mindfulness practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from a group of female patients at the Lowe Foundation Center&#xD;
      who have already been scheduled for an upcoming pelvic exam. Therefore the pelvic exam&#xD;
      procedure itself is standard of care, the experimental piece is the mindfulness intervention&#xD;
      before the pelvic exam - either the video, or the written educational materials depending on&#xD;
      whether participants are randomly assigned to the treatment or control group.&#xD;
