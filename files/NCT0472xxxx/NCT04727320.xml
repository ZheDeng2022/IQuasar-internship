  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective study. We signed an informed consent form with patients with&#xD;
      liver fibrosis and took tauroursodeoxycholic acid orally for half a year. After half a year,&#xD;
      liver biopsy was performed using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction, Western blotting method was used to determine the expression level of&#xD;
      fibrosis-related markers to verify the effect of taurodeoxycholic acid on patients with liver&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tauroursodeoxycholic acid is an effective component of bear bile, which has obvious curative&#xD;
      effects in the treatment of gallstones and liver diseases. In recent years, the research&#xD;
      field of tauroursodeoxycholic acid has been very active, and its chemical synthesis has also&#xD;
      attracted much attention. The usage is swallowing with water before going to bed at night. It&#xD;
      must be taken regularly, one capsule at a time (250mg), once a day. After 6 months of&#xD;
      continuous use, liver biopsy was performed after 6 months. Telling the patient to swallow&#xD;
      with water before going to bed at night. It must be taken regularly, one capsule at a time&#xD;
      (250mg), once a day. After 6 months of continuous use, liver B-ultrasound biopsy was&#xD;
      performed to observe the effect.&#xD;
