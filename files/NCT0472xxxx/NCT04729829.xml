    <textblock>
      This trial is a one-year, cluster-randomized, partially masked, controlled trial among&#xD;
      families living in rural, inland Timor-Leste. This trial aims to test and compare the effects&#xD;
      of two treatments, alone and in combination, on the frequency and volume of household fish&#xD;
      consumption in upland areas as a proxy for improved dietary diversity and micronutrient&#xD;
      intake. Treatment 1 is the installation of nearshore, moored fish aggregating devices (FADs)&#xD;
      to improve catch rates with existing fishing gears. Treatment 2 is social and behaviour&#xD;
      change (SBC) activities to promote fish consumption. Villages in inland communities will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive treatment 1, treatment 2, both treatments, or neither treatment. Some&#xD;
      households with one child under five will be recruited, and data will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline (prior to the rollout of the treatments) and endline. Our study will determine the&#xD;
      impact of an improved supply of fish, along with nutrition-oriented SBC activities, on the&#xD;
      fish purchasing and consumption practices of rural, inland households. Findings from this&#xD;
      study are urgently needed by small island developing states in order to make policy and&#xD;
      investment decisions on how best to improve households' diets using locally available,&#xD;
      nutrient-dense foods such as fish. Investments such as these are needed to break the cycle of&#xD;
      malnutrition.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The main treatment variable is a dummy variable that indicates to which of the four treatment arms a village was assigned. Our primary model is an unadjusted model. However, if we find that after unmasking, there are variables in the dataset that appear different by treatment arm, we may consider adjusting for confounders in the model.&#xD;
We will first estimate a parsimonious model with only the treatment dummies and the municipality fixed effects. Then we will control for additional baseline covariates. The control group is the no-FAD and no-SBC group. Intent to treat (ITT) will be estimated separately for midline and end line subsamples. However, we will compare the magnitude of impacts at midline and endline.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Each SBC treatment community will receive nutrition content and learning through savings groups. The group members will participate in skill-building activities that promote five key behaviours about fish nutrition and household decision making on fish consumption as part of facilitated discussions, interactive learning sessions, and a video-based facilitated dialogue. Increased fish consumption through SBC mass attendance events through marketing of fish vendors, interactive learning, and edu-tainment competitions promoting fish consumption. SBC will raise awareness of the benefits of eating fish as part of a balanced diet, with a particular focus on pregnant and lactating mothers, and children under 5 years of age.</description>

    <description>This is a moored line attached to buoys in coastal waters that attracts oceanic fish to it, to make it easier for small-scale fishers to catch them using their existing gear and boats. This FAD will work to increase the catch rate and hence, the availability of fish for sale in upland community markets.</description>
