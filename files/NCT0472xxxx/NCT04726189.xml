  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy of standard care versus standard&#xD;
      care combined with an early progressive exercise program in improving the function of the&#xD;
      tendon and leg muscles after non-surgical treated Achilles tendon rupture&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Achilles tendon rupture often results in long-term muscular deficits. Patients struggle&#xD;
      to return to work and sports with high load on the lower leg. Early functional rehabilitation&#xD;
      has shown good results, but research on resistance exercise is scarce and the reporting of&#xD;
      the specifics of the exercises are poor.&#xD;
