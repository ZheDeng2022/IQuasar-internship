      This study is an open-label, single-arm, phase I study of irinotecan liposome injection in&#xD;
      patients with advanced breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      efficacy and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan liposome injection in patients with advanced&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase I study with a dose-escalation phase (part 1) and a&#xD;
      dose-expansion phase (part 2). In part 1, patients will receive irinotecan liposome injection&#xD;
      (CSPC) at the initial starting dose until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dosages will&#xD;
      be escalated by certain increments in subsequent cohorts. Once the appropriate dose has been&#xD;
      established in part 1, patients will be enrolled into two expansion cohorts in part 2.&#xD;
