  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trabeculectomy and XEN45 gel stent implantation are glaucoma surgeries that creates an&#xD;
      aqueous humor (AH) shunt towards the subconjunctival space (filtration bleb). Once the AH&#xD;
      reaches the subconjunctival space, it is removed by different paths such as the trans-bleb&#xD;
      wall route. For this reason, the conjunctiva is considered an essential structure that may&#xD;
      condition the glaucoma filtering procedures outcomes. As part of the inflammatory response,&#xD;
      an unbalanced fibrosis during the postoperative period may lead to a bleb cavity scarring and&#xD;
      failure; for this reason, bleb massage and antifibrotic injections (i.e., 5-Fluoruracil) are&#xD;
      frequently required as part of the postoperative care of these procedures. There have been&#xD;
      described several risk factors, such as intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering medications,&#xD;
      previous surgical interventions or ocular surface disease that may predispose to an early&#xD;
      failure. These preoperative factors fail to aim to predict the surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, ocular biomarkers may overcome this limitation. There are promising studies that&#xD;
      have analyzed the role of in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), anterior-segment optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and conjunctival cytology impression as clinical tools that may&#xD;
      improve the filtration bleb assessment at a cellular level.&#xD;

      Detailed description Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conjunctival biomarkers may represent a predictive factor to determine the XEN45 and&#xD;
           trabeculectomy surgical success and outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cellular-based analysis may help to predict postoperative pro-fibrotic changes that&#xD;
           may lead to an early or mid-term surgery failure, and therefore it could help to improve&#xD;
           the postoperative care of the filtering bleb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the preoperative and postoperative conjunctival factors that may influence&#xD;
           in the surgical outcomes of XEN45 gel stent compared to trabeculectomy using in vivo&#xD;
           confocal microscopy, anterior segment optical coherence tomography and conjunctival&#xD;
           cytology impression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of XEN Gel stent and trabeculectomy to predict IOP, based on the&#xD;
           morphologic characteristics of the filtering bleb&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the needling rate during the postoperative bleb management and the potential&#xD;
           correlation to the pre and postoperative conjunctival changes and surgical success&#xD;
           outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Single-center, prospective, simple-blind study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes All the outcomes are measured pre and postoperative at each follow-up time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In vivo confocal microscopy images: goblet cells density, dendritic cell density and&#xD;
           stromal fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anterior segment optical coherence tomography: wall thickness and epithelium thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conjunctival cytology impression: dendritic cells, goblet cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraocular pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of IOP lowering medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of postoperative needling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Based on the most assessed outcome in glaucoma surgeries and the only&#xD;
      pilot study aiming to determine a similar outcome, to detect IOP differences between both&#xD;
      procedures that may reflect the surgical outcomes of both procedures and therefore reflect&#xD;
      the subconjunctival changes, accepting an alfa risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a&#xD;
      two-sided Student's T-test, 40 subjects are necessary in each group to recognize as&#xD;
      statistically significant a difference greater than or equal to - 13,38 mm Hg in IOP, with a&#xD;
      common standard deviation of 17%. A drop-out rate of 15% has been anticipated. If no drop-out&#xD;
      rate is considered, the number of needed subjects is 68 (34 per group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Single center, prospective, observational study of primary open angle glaucoma and&#xD;
      uncontrolled intraocular pressure, progression of the disease confirmed by visual field&#xD;
      examination that require either XEN gel stent implantation or trabeculectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medial records including ophthalmic procedures, other ocular diseases, intraocular&#xD;
           pressure while on treatment, target pressure, visual field, detailed description of the&#xD;
           optic disc, both preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glaucoma staging: peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, visual field (baseline, 3&#xD;
           moths and 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ocular biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In vivo confocal microscopy (baseline, 3 moths and 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conjunctival impression cytology (baseline, 3 moths and 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific case report form (CRF) was designed with all variables and data required for the&#xD;
      study, including potential complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery. Patients were assigned either to trabeculectomy or XEN stent implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trabeculectomy: the surgical technique is as follows: retro/peribulbar o subtenon's&#xD;
      anesthesia, superior corneal traction suture, phacoemulsification through 2.2 with in-the-bag&#xD;
      IOL implantation, a fornix-based conjunctival flap, sufficient but not excessive&#xD;
      cauterization, application mitomycin-C (MMC) 0,2 mg/ml for 2 minutes under the conjunctiva,&#xD;
      then MMC was washed out with 100 ml of saline solution, then a scleral flap (4x3 mm in the&#xD;
      trabeculectomy) is dissected. A sclerectomy with punch and peripheral iridectomy were&#xD;
      performed, and suture nylon 10/00 sutures was used to place 3 or 4 stiches in the scleral&#xD;
      flap&#xD;
&#xD;
      XEN gel stent: a clear cornea incision in the inferotemporal quadrant was performed,&#xD;
      injecting the XEN 45 device into the superonasal quadrant using an ab interno approach.&#xD;
      Approximately 15 min before inserting the implant, 0.1 ml of a MMC solution (0.01%) was&#xD;
      injected into the superior conjunctiva. Both stand-alone and combined phaco-glaucoma&#xD;
      procedures were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative treatment. All patients instilled ofloxacin antibiotic every 6 hours for 1&#xD;
      week, dexamethasone (every 2 hours for 1 month, every 4-6 hours on the second month and&#xD;
      tapered during the third month according to surgeon's instructions). Atropine was also used&#xD;
      when clinical finds recommended its use. Subconjunctival injections of anti-fibrotic agents&#xD;
      (5-FU) and/or bleb needling were allowed and performed at the discretion of the surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistics, including mean and standard deviation for normally distributed&#xD;
           variables and median and interquartile range for non-normally distributed variables,&#xD;
           previous checked using Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Logistic regression models to evaluate the correlation with preoperative and&#xD;
           postoperative factors and needling rate, surgical success (IOP &lt; 18 mm Hg), and ocular&#xD;
           biomarkers. The results will be reported as odds ratio (OR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the reported values will be considered statistically significant at two-tailed p&#xD;
           &lt;0.05&#xD;
