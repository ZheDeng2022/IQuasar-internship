  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to data from Global Cancer Statistics 2018, colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks second in&#xD;
      incidence and fifth in mortality among all cancers in China. The underlying neoplastic&#xD;
      progression from adenoma to CRC endures up to 10 years, providing an extended window for CRC&#xD;
      detection and screening. Currently, fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and colonoscopy are the&#xD;
      main diagnostic and screening methods for CRC in Chinese clinical practice. However, due to&#xD;
      low patients' compliance with colonoscopy and poor sensitivity of FOBT, a large proportion of&#xD;
      CRC could not be effectively diagnosed and treated at early stage. Therefore, noninvasive&#xD;
      fecal DNA detection approach with enhanced performance is urgently needed in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate effectiveness of the Human Multigene Methylation&#xD;
      Detection Kit (Fluorescent PCR) for auxiliary diagnosis of colorectal cancer. By assessing&#xD;
      the level of DNA methylation of certain genes in human stool, the test can indicate whether&#xD;
      cancerous and precancerous lesions exist in the areas of colon and rectum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multicenter clinical trial will be conducted using a single-blind method. Stool samples&#xD;
      provided by participants will be evaluated by Human Multigene Methylation Detection Kit&#xD;
      (Fluorescent PCR). The kit will be used to qualitatively detect methylation levels of&#xD;
      multiple genes in human stool samples in vitro by using Quantitative Methylation Specific PCR&#xD;
      (qMSP). The principle of the method is as follows. First, the target DNA in human stool is&#xD;
      extracted by magnetic bead-capture technology and then treated with sodium bisulfite. The&#xD;
      sequence of unmethylated DNA will be changed while that of the methylated DNA remains the&#xD;
      same after sodium bisulfite treatment. Subsequently, qMSP is employed to detect methylation&#xD;
      levels of target genes in addition to ACTB gene (a reference gene). Controls of ACTB gene&#xD;
      with and without methylation are tested simultaneously. Result of qMSP is dichotomized as&#xD;
      positive and negative based on Ct value obtained. The test result is then verified by Sanger&#xD;
      sequencing and compared with that from colonoscopy examination and pathology report. The main&#xD;
      evaluation indexes for test performance are sensitivity, specificity, consistency rate, kappa&#xD;
      coefficient.&#xD;
