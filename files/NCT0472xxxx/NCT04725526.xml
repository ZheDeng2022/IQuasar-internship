  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multipathological patients with complex health needs are responsible for the majority number&#xD;
      of avoidable hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion of mHealth interventions in the field of communication with the patient, the&#xD;
      reduction of health inequalities, the improvement in access to health resources, the&#xD;
      adherence to treatments and self-care of chronic diseases lead to an optimistic horizon .&#xD;
      However, there are few applications that demonstrate its effectiveness in these patients,&#xD;
      which is diminished when they are not based on evidence, nor are designed by and for users&#xD;
      with different levels of health literacy.&#xD;

      Objective: to evaluate the efficacy of an mHealth intervention, with respect to routine&#xD;
      clinical practice, to improve health literacy and self-management of the multiple&#xD;
      pathological patient with heart failure and complex health needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: the proposed mHealth intervention is more effective than usual clinical practice,&#xD;
      favoring health literacy and self-management of multiple pathological patients with heart&#xD;
      failure and complex health needs, so its use would be relevant as part of the assistance&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      efficacy of an mHealth intervention with two groups: a control group (routine clinical&#xD;
      practice) and an experimental group (routine clinical practice together with ad hoc designed&#xD;
      mHealth intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the design and content validation of the mHealth tool will be carried out,&#xD;
      evaluating its relevance and suitability.&#xD;
