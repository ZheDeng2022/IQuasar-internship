  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, Phase 1b, prospective, dose limiting toxicity (DLT)-clearing study, will&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of intravenously administered PROMITIL in combination with&#xD;
      FOLFOX in cancer patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic GI solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous clinical results, we hypothesized that the addition of PROMITIL to FOLFOX,&#xD;
      a treatment protocol consisting of oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine and commonly used to&#xD;
      treat gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, may enhance the overall efficacy of this&#xD;
      combination regimen while maintain a reasonable safety profile.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will undergo screening, conducted up to 21 days before start of treatment, and&#xD;
      receive 3 cycles of PROMITIL treatment, administered at four-week intervals, in combination&#xD;
      with FOLFOX, administered at two-week intervals. Thereafter, patients may continue treatment&#xD;
      with FOLFOX only, or with another regime at the investigator's discretion and will be&#xD;
      followed up until death. Patients will be successively assigned, in order of accrual, to be&#xD;
      concomitantly treated with PROMITIL and FOLFOX, at doses of PROMITIL meant to clear a dose of&#xD;
      this combination treatment from DLT. Six patients will be treated with an initial&#xD;
      DLT-clearing dose (Cohort 1). PROMITIL dose escalation from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2 will be&#xD;
      authorized after 5 or 6 Cohort 1 patients complete their first two cycles of combination&#xD;
      treatment with up to 1 DLT event reported for all 6 treated patients. If 2 or more Cohort 1&#xD;
      patients suffer from a DLT event in the first two cycles of treatment, 6 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled to Cohort -1 and treated with one dose level lower of PROMITIL. If 2 or more DLT&#xD;
      events occur in Cohorts 2 or -1, the study will be discontinued for these patients and only&#xD;
      patients in Cohort 1 will complete the study as planned. In any case, the total number of&#xD;
      evaluable patients in the DLT-clearing phase will be no more than 12.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There will be up to two cohorts, with six subjects per cohort. Eligible subjects will be consecutively assigned, in order of accrual, to receive three cycles of PROMITIL-FOLFOX treatment. Dosing regimens will begin with cohort 1 (PROMITIL dose of 1.6 mg/kg).Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) for the combination treatment will be considered cleared if fewer than two patients per cohort experience DLT events during the first two cycles of treatment. Dose escalation to cohort 2 (PROMITIL dose of 2mg/kg) will be authorized after 5 or 6 patients of cohort 1 have completed the second cycle with DLT detected in fewer than two patients. If ≥2 patients of Cohort 1 develop DLT, dose escalation will be halted and Cohort -1 (PROMITIL dose of 1.2 mg/kg) will be opened. Should ≥2 patients in Cohort -1 or Cohort 2 experience DLT events, the study will be discontinued.</intervention_model_description>
