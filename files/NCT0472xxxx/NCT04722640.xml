    <textblock>
      Approximately 80 patients affected by moderate to severe psoriasis will be screened for the&#xD;
      presence of LL37( and ADAMTSL5 autoreactive T-cells in their blood at Day 0. Patients whose&#xD;
      lymphocytes reacted with proliferation to LL37 or ADAMTSL5 will receive SKYRIZI (Risakizumab)&#xD;
      at Day 1, week 4, 16, 28, 40. LL37 and ADAMTSL5-specific T-cell responses will be evaluated&#xD;
      at Day 0, week 16, week 28 and week 52. Each patient will be followed for 52 weeks.&#xD;

                  Periodic abstinence (for example, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence just for the duration of a&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Two effective methods of contraception (such as male or female condoms with&#xD;
                       spermicide, diaphragms with spermicide or cervical sponges) will be used.&#xD;

                       Barrier protection methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not a&#xD;
                       reliable or acceptable method. Thus, each barrier method must include use of&#xD;
                       a spermicide. It should be noted that the use of male and female condoms as&#xD;
                       a double-barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high failure&#xD;
                       rate when these methods are combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Of note, 1 of the 2 methods of contraception may be a highly effective (less&#xD;
                       than 1% failure rate) method of contraception (such as, combination oral&#xD;
                       contraceptives, implanted contraceptives or intrauterine devices).&#xD;
