      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-restricted feeding (TRF) means that a person eats only during certain hours of the day.&#xD;
      In other studies, researchers have found that fasting can improve immune system function in&#xD;
      healthy people. They want to see if TRF has the same effect on people with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether TRF can change metabolism and decrease some markers of inflammation in the&#xD;
      blood of people with mild to moderate psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males ages 18 to 70 with mild to moderate active psoriasis, and healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and medicine review. They will have a&#xD;
      physical exam and blood tests. Their skin will be examined. They will have a nutritional&#xD;
      evaluation. Their resting energy expenditure will be measured. For this, a clear plastic&#xD;
      ventilation hood will be placed over the head for a short time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at the NIH Clinical Center for 4 1/2 days. They can watch TV, do work,&#xD;
      do schoolwork, and other quiet activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small sensor will be placed under participants skin to measure blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For part of the study, participants will be housed in a small room called a metabolic&#xD;
      chamber. They will wear a heart monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes each day at a comfortable speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 3 days, participants will eat all their daily calories between 8 am and 2 pm. They will&#xD;
      fast for the other 18 hours of the day. They can drink water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete mixed meal tests. They will drink a liquid meal for breakfast.&#xD;
      Then they will give blood samples via intravenous (IV) catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 5 days.&#xD;

      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously shown that fasting, and the caloric restriction mimetic nicotinamide&#xD;
      riboside (NR) confer anti-inflammatory effects on a broad array of circulating innate and&#xD;
      adaptive immune cells. Three major effects include fasting-mediated blunting of the NLRP3&#xD;
      inflammasome and of CD4+Th17 responsiveness, and of NR-induced downregulation of monocytic&#xD;
      type 1 interferon signaling. In parallel, dietary interventions including intermittent&#xD;
      fasting (IF- alternate day eating) and time-restricted feeding (TRF- for e.g. eating during&#xD;
      the first 6 hours after waking each day) reduce inflammatory and cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors. Animal studies suggest that pharmacologic mimics of dietary restriction are inferior&#xD;
      to dietary manipulations themselves. This discrepancy is postulated to be due to wide array&#xD;
      of biological responses evoked by the 'low levels of stress' (hormesis) evoked by IF or TRF&#xD;
      compared to the targeting of distinct biological pathways. Hence to advance our understanding&#xD;
      on the role of these dietary interventions on immune modulation in health and disease, a&#xD;
      pilot study is being planned to test the effect of TRF in subjects with mild to moderate&#xD;
      psoriasis compared to a matched healthy control population. For this pilot study we elected&#xD;
      to employ TRF over IF, as this will enable repetitive hormesis periods in a relative short&#xD;
      time span to compare TRF immunological signatures to conventional dietary intervals. This&#xD;
      initial study will be domiciled in the Clinical Center Metabolic Unit in collaboration with&#xD;
      NIDDK Investigators, to ensure complete adherence to the TRF in this initial proof of concept&#xD;
      study. Psoriasis has been selected as the disease comparator to the control group in this&#xD;
      initial study, as this is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that effects cardiometabolic&#xD;
      risk and is linked to both the NLRP3 inflammasome and Th17 inflammation.&#xD;
