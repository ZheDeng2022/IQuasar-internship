  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A reduction of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) commonly occurs during bronchoscopy and&#xD;
      may be associated with both respiratory and cardiac adverse events. The type of breathing&#xD;
      assistance that should be delivered to patients, in order to treat and/or to prevent acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure, during or after bronchoscopy, is not universally standardized; studies&#xD;
      comparing the impact of different respiratory supports on patient's outcome and on hospital&#xD;
      resource use are very few. the risk of respiratory failure rises according to the type of&#xD;
      procedure (i.e., increased risk with broncho-alveolar lavage and trans-bronchial lung biopsy)&#xD;
      and to the use of sedative drugs. Conventional oxygen therapy with nasal cannula, continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure and non-invasive ventilation are commonly applied during endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures. High flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) is a relatively novel device, still under-used in&#xD;
      the context of interventional pulmonology, providing an humidified air-oxygen blend up to 60&#xD;
      L/min. HFOT has been reported to be effective for the treatment of both hypoxemic and&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure. The investigators hypothesize that HFOT could be feasible&#xD;
      and safe in patients undergoing bronchoscopy under moderate sedation, affected by or at risk&#xD;
      of hypoxemic and/or hypercapnic respiratory failure.&#xD;
