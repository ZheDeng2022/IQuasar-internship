  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether combining the standard chemotherapy for head&#xD;
      and neck cancer with the immunotherapy drugs cetuximab and cemiplimab (the study drug) is a&#xD;
      safe treatment for head and neck cancer, and whether receiving this combination treatment&#xD;
      before surgery may allow participants to forgo the standard radiation treatment after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Six patients can be enrolled once the study has opened to the starting dose level. If 0-1 of the first 6 patients treated on study experience a DLT, then an additional 4 patients will be accrued to the study. If 0-2 of the 10 patients experience a DLT, then the combination will be deemed to be safe. If &gt;2 of the first 6 patients accrued or &gt;3 of 10 patients accrued experience a DLT, then patients will be treated at one dose level reduction.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, which will be evaluated by a description of observed adverse events by grades. All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version5.0. The regimen will be deemed safe and well tolerated if there are 2 or fewer DLTs out of 10 patients enrolled. A DLT is defined as any non-hematologic grade 3 or greater adverse event as defined by CTCAE v5.0 that is thought to be related to the addition of Cemiplimab to the combination of a platinum-doublet with cetuximab.</description>

If the pathologic stage following induction systemic therapy and surgery is ypT1-2N0 without the presence of adverse features that include positive margins or a combination of perineural invasion, vascular invasion, and a depth of invasion of &gt;0.5mm, adjuvant radiation will not be administered, consistent with the NCCN guidelines [2]. Otherwise, patients will receive adjuvant RT-based treatment with standard radiation techniques.</description>
