    <textblock>
      Cellulitis is the medical term for an infection of the skin, with symptoms including redness,&#xD;
      swelling, warmth, and pain. This group of symptoms is called inflammation, and is caused by&#xD;
      the body's immune system responding to the infection. Standard care for cellulitis is using&#xD;
      antibiotics to destroy the infection, but the inflammation can persist and cause a great deal&#xD;
      of pain. The hypothesis of this study is that adding a single dose of an oral steroid&#xD;
      (prednisone), which tempers the immune response, will reduce inflammation, reduce pain, and&#xD;
      speed recovery. This hypothesis will be examined by recruiting a group of patients with&#xD;
      cellulitis, and randomizing them to two sub-groups: one group will receive a dose of&#xD;
      prednisone, while the other group will receive a placebo. Neither group will know what they&#xD;
      received unless there is a problem. These subjects will be followed up at the 48 hour mark&#xD;
      and the 7 day mark, and will have their results compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be conducted in a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      randomized fashion using a convenience sample of 100 subjects who come to the ED with signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of cellulitis. Initial medical assessment will be made by an attending/senior&#xD;
      resident according with established clinical procedures, including the history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and vital signs. If by clinical assessment the patients meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, then they will be approached by a research associate for screening, informed&#xD;
      consent process, enrollment in the study, and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the subjects understand and sign the informed consent form, they will be randomized to&#xD;
      either the placebo group or treatment group. The EMCP pharmacy will be in charge of the&#xD;
      randomization process. Once randomized, a standard source document (see data management&#xD;
      section and appendix C for details) will be filled with information given by the subjects and&#xD;
      in their charts. While study medication is given (time zero), subjects will receive a Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS) to rate their pain upon initial presentation along with determination of&#xD;
      size of the cellulitic area. This will be done by determining the longest axis of the&#xD;
      cellulitic area and measuring it (in mm) from the most proximal/lateral end towards the most&#xD;
      distal/medial end, excluding any lymphangitic spread. The most proximal and distal area of&#xD;
      erythema will be outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the standard treatment of care for cellulitis will be circumscribed according to&#xD;
      already established protocols, the class of antibiotics and pain control that patients&#xD;
      receive will depend on their disposition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If discharged:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Antibiotic prescriptions will be TMP/SMX 160/800 mg (Bactrim DS), 2 pills PO BID and&#xD;
           Cephalexin 500 mg PO qid; if allergic, Clindamycin 300 mg PO QID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain control: during stay in the ED subjects will receive, according to their allergic&#xD;
           history and as long as the treating physician determines it is necessary to address the&#xD;
           pain, two tablets of either Percocet 5/325 mg,Vicodin 5/500 mg (if allergic to&#xD;
           Percocet), or Acetaminophen 500 mg as an only dose. Once discharged they will receive,&#xD;
           according to their allergic history and the physician's clinical judgement, a&#xD;
           prescription of 12 tablets of either Percocet 5/325 mg, Vicodin 5/500 mg (if allergic to&#xD;
           Percocet), Tylenol #3 300/30 mg, or Acetaminophen 500 mg, one tablet PO q6 and PRN for&#xD;
           pain. Pain medication must not include NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If admitted to observation unit: antibiotics will be IV Clindamycin 300 mg q6 hours; if&#xD;
      allergic, IV Vancomycin 1 g q12 hours should be given. For pain control: Morphine 4 mg IV q4&#xD;
      hours and PRN pain; if allergic, Dilaudid 1 mg IV q4 hours and PRN if pain. Pain medication&#xD;
      must not include NSAIDs. Once discharged, they will receive the same prescription as the&#xD;
      discharged group of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard of care described and any additional medications deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the attending physician that do not represent a confounding factor to the&#xD;
      study (NSAIDs, other antibiotics), subjects will also receive an additional pill which will&#xD;
      be either prednisone 60 mg or placebo. If the treating physician feels it is in the best&#xD;
      interest of the subject to break the protocol, the subject's participation in study&#xD;
      procedures will end. Data that has already been collected will be kept, and may be analyzed&#xD;
      separately. Once the subjects have received the study medications, they will follow their&#xD;
      dispositions (either be discharged or be admitted in the observation's unit). To assure&#xD;
      treatment compliance, the Research Associate will provide the subjects with antibiotics and&#xD;
      pain medication treatment corresponding to the first 48 hours. After this landmark, the&#xD;
      subjects will cover the rest of their treatment. Subjects will be instructed not to take any&#xD;
      medication outside the prescription during the length of the study. If the subjects take&#xD;
      NSAIDs during the first 48 hours, this could be considered a confounding factor. As such,&#xD;
      subjects who take NSAIDs within the first 48 hours will have their participation in study&#xD;
      procedures ended. Their already collected data will be kept and may be analyzed separately;&#xD;
      however, if they take NSAIDs after the 48-hour visit their study participation will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to return to the ED after 48 hours and bring the remaining&#xD;
      prescribed pain medications. They will meet a Research Associate for re-evaluation, which&#xD;
      will be done by using a VAS, measuring the cellulitic area, and assessing the degree of usage&#xD;
      of the prescribed pain medications. This second visit is not part of the standard of care so&#xD;
      patients won't be required to receive a formal evaluation by an ED doctor nor register in&#xD;
      triage. Financial compensation will be provided on completion of the 48 hour follow-up visit&#xD;
      for all patients. A seventh (Â± one) day follow-up call will be done to assess pain severity,&#xD;
      degree of symptomatic recovery and disappearance of the erythema, and need of additional&#xD;
      medical assistance.&#xD;
