      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Brain metastases are cancer cells that have spread to the brain from primary cancers in&#xD;
      other organs. These tumors can be removed surgically. However, researchers are trying to find&#xD;
      better ways to treat brain metastases. A new drug, GRN1005, has been designed to cross into&#xD;
      the brain and deliver the cancer treatment drug paclitaxel to treat tumors. Researchers want&#xD;
      to see how well GRN1005 works on brain metastases from breast or lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of GRN1005 in treating brain metastases from breast or&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have breast or lung cancer that has spread to the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Tumor tissue samples may also be collected. Imaging studies&#xD;
           will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have breast cancer will be divided into two groups. Those whose cancer&#xD;
           contains the HER2 protein will be treated with the drug Herceptin as well as GRN1005.&#xD;
           Those without HER2 will have only GRN1005.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have lung cancer will also have only GRN1005.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have two doses of GRN1005, each 3 weeks apart. On the day the&#xD;
           second dose of GRN1005 is given, participants will undergo surgery to remove the brain&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain metastasis is the most common intra-cranial tumor in adults with approximately 170,000&#xD;
      new cases being diagnosed in the United States annually. The incidence of brain metastasis is&#xD;
      increasing. Usually brain metastases of breast cancer occur after the diagnosis of systemic&#xD;
      metastases; but approximately 10 25% of patients with lung cancer have brain metastases at&#xD;
      diagnosis and another 40 50% develop them during the course of their disease. Multiple&#xD;
      factors are contributing to this increase: aging population, improved imaging techniques, and&#xD;
      improvement in the treatment of tumors leading to prolonged survival, thereby allowing the&#xD;
      emergence of brain metastases, with the brain being generally regarded as a sanctuary site&#xD;
      because of the blood brain barrier (BBB). Lung cancer and breast cancer are the leading tumor&#xD;
      types, accounting for approximately 50% and 15 - 20% of patients with brain metastases. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the ability of 18F-FLT to determine if amount of change in the uptake in&#xD;
      the brain metastases from breast and lung cancer after one dose of therapy with GRN1005,&#xD;
      correlates with intra-cranial response. FLT-PET utilizes a radiolabeled form of thymidine,&#xD;
      which is incorporated into DNA in proliferating cells. 18F-FLT uptake correlates better than&#xD;
      18F-FDG with proliferation, tumor progression, and survival. Because CNS uptake of FLT is low&#xD;
      in contrast to FDG, this makes it potentially useful in evaluating CNS metastases. We would&#xD;
      like to see which of these imaging modalities is superior in detection of brain metastases,&#xD;
      and monitoring response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine whether one cycle of therapy GRN1005 is associated with a change in FLTPET uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytologically-documented breast cancer (HER2 status must be known) or&#xD;
           NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of resectable brain metastases based on evaluation by neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one radiologically-confirmed and measurable metastatic brain lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pilot non-randomized trial with or without trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ten patients with resectable brain metastases from breast cancer and ten patients with&#xD;
           resectable brain metastases from NSCLC will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline imaging (brain tumor protocol MRI and DSC-PWI MRI, FLT-PET) 1-14 days prior to&#xD;
           first dose of GRN1005.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive 1 dose of GRN1005 on day 1 of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat FLT-PET imaging and MRIs will be done after 1 cycle of therapy and prior to&#xD;
           surgery, on day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the day of surgery, patients will receive a second dose of GRN1005 3 to 6 hours prior&#xD;
           to brain surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK studies will be done after each dose of GRN1005.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional extra-cranial tumor biopsies will be performed before and after GRN1005&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following surgery radiation therapy will be offered to patients as clinically indicated&#xD;
           per radiation oncologist s recommendation.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically-documented breast cancer (HER2 status must be known)&#xD;
             or NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of resectable brain metastases with or without prior radiotherapy. Patients&#xD;
             must be greater than 28 days from WBRT or SRS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of resectable brain metastases, as assessed by neurosurgical evaluation. A&#xD;
             brain tumor will be considered to be resectable for the purposes of the study if it is&#xD;
             located in the cerebrum or the cerebellum. Tumors that are located in deep brain&#xD;
             structures, including the medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and basal ganglia will be&#xD;
             considered non-resectable. The tumor must be solitary or, if not, accompanied by&#xD;
             another tumor on the same side of the brain that is also considered to be resectable&#xD;
             by the same criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one radiologically-confirmed and measurable metastatic brain lesion (greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 1.0 centimeters in the longest diameter) by Gd-MRI of the brain less&#xD;

             of the Philips Gemini TOF PET/CT is 4millimeters [FWHM, (full width half maximum)].&#xD;
             One cm is greater than 2 times this FWHM and it is anticipated that greater than 70%&#xD;
             of the actual activity in the lesion will be visualized (i.e. recovered). It is&#xD;
             expected that all lesions greater than or equal to 1 centimeters will have sufficient&#xD;
             FLT uptake. If no lesions on the baseline image are visualized on FLT PET/CT, then&#xD;
             post therapy FLT imaging will not be performed. These patients will be replaced.&#xD;

             (excluding alopecia) must have resolved to less than or equal to CTCAE v4.0 Grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed treatment with non-cytotoxic systemic drugs (e.g., targeted drugs) greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 14 days for small molecules and greater than or equal to 28 days for&#xD;
