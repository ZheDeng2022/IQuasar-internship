    <textblock>
      A prospective open randomized study conducted between July 1st 2008 and June 30th, 2009.&#xD;
      Included were children younger than 14 years with Complicated appendicitis randomly assigned&#xD;
      either to a single daily dose of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole or Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and&#xD;
      Metronidazole. The outcome variables compared were: maximum daily temperatures, overall&#xD;
      duration of fever, time return to oral intake, length of antibiotic therapy, results of&#xD;
      repeat WBC measure, general/intra abdominal complications, need for intra abdominal abscess&#xD;
      drainage, Length of stay and adverse reaction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was conducted at the Pediatric Surgery Department at HaEmek Medical Center, Afula,&#xD;
      Israel. Included were children age 1-14 years with complicated appendicitis that was defined&#xD;
      by one of the followings: 1. Demonstration by abdominal ultrasound and/or computed tomography&#xD;
      of appendix perforation and/or peri-appendicular abscess 2. Demonstration by abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound of free fluid, and signs of diffuse peritoneal irritation in the right lower&#xD;
      quadrant of the abdomen 3. At surgery performed for suspected non complicated appendicitis.&#xD;
      In a patient with perforate appendicitis that was diagnosed at surgery, appendectomy was&#xD;
      performed by one of the 4 senior pediatric surgeons on call at the time of the child's&#xD;
      admission. Exclusion criteria were: documented allergy to any of the study medications, acute&#xD;
      or renal insufficiency at admission, and severe septic shock at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic approach: After the diagnosis of complicated appendicitis was established,&#xD;
      patients were randomly assigned to therapy with either once daily of ceftriaxone and&#xD;
      metronidazole or ampicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole. Therapy was change to&#xD;
      piperacillin/tazobactam in patients who were still febrile at day 7-10 of the admission (if&#xD;
      not given before), based on the clinical situation, and in all febrile patients at 11 day of&#xD;
      the admission . All patients had also been treats after inclusion with pain control&#xD;
      medications, no oral food or fluid , and intravenous hydration as necessary. Nasogastric&#xD;
      tubes were not used routinely. On the fifth admission day patients who were stable, a&#xD;
      febrile, could tolerate diet and had Complete blood count within normal limits were&#xD;
      discharged home with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy for further 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up at the admission: CBC and renal and liver function tests were obtained before&#xD;
      starting the antibiotic treatment and repeated on day 4 in all patients. In the group treated&#xD;
      with AGM, serum trough gentamicin concentration was drawn before the fourth dose with normal&#xD;
      level considered as &lt; 2 mcg/ml. Other blood studies were performed based on the discretion of&#xD;
      the attending physician based on the patient's clinical status. For patients who were either&#xD;
      febrile or had leukocytosis, at day 5 of therapy abdominal ultrasound was obtained to assess&#xD;
      for the presence of an abscess. Patients in whom abscesses were delectated undergone per&#xD;
      coetaneous drainage (when possible). The original antibiotic regimen was either continued or&#xD;
      changed to piperacillin/tazobactam based on the clinical situation. Patients, in whom&#xD;
      appendectomy had not been done at admission, were readmitted for appendectomy at 6 weeks. All&#xD;
      patients had been followed for a year since the admission for signs of intra abdominal&#xD;
      complication such: repeat abscess formation, repeat admission, obstruction etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Data were recorded were: patient's age, weight, gender, maximum daily&#xD;
      temperature, duration of fever, results of complete blood count, renal and liver function&#xD;
      tests, gentamicin levels (where applicable), intra abdominal complications and duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization. The outcome variables included maximum daily temperatures for each of the&#xD;
      first 10 postoperative days, time to initial oral intake, length of hospitalization, length&#xD;
      of antibiotic therapy, abscess formation rate, need to change antibiotic regimen, wound&#xD;
      infection rate, and any abnormal findings during the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Since data in the literature show that there is no difference of the&#xD;
      length of stay in between the 2 regimens (in children with complicated appendicitis following&#xD;
      operation), and most studies included relatively low number of patients, no power analysis&#xD;
      was calculated. The difference between various parameters in the two treatment groups were&#xD;
      assessed by 2 independent sample T tests or Fisher exact tests for categorical data and 2&#xD;
      independent sample t test or the Mann Whitney test for continuous data. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics were calculated as mean Â± SD.&#xD;
