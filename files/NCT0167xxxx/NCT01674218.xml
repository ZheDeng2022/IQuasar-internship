  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, five-period&#xD;
      cross-over clinical study of PA-824 to evaluate the effect of PA-824 and of PA-824 plus&#xD;
      moxifloxacin on cardiac repolarization (QT/QTc interval duration) in a total of 75 healthy&#xD;
      male and female participants, aged 18 to 45 years. Moxifloxacin will be used as an active&#xD;
      control. Participants will be blinded to the treatments they will receive. The study consists&#xD;
      of a screening period up to 26 days; enrollment, 1 day; five in-patient treatment periods&#xD;
      consisting of an admission day (except in the first treatment period, when the pre-dose day&#xD;
      is the baseline), dosing day and two post-dosing days; an out-patient period of at least&#xD;
      three days and not more than 10 days between treatment periods; and a final visit 7 - 14 days&#xD;
      after discharge from the last treatment period.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, five-period&#xD;
      cross-over clinical study of PA-824 to evaluate the effect of PA-824 and of PA-824 plus&#xD;
      moxifloxacin on cardiac repolarization (QT/QTc interval duration) in healthy male and female&#xD;
      participants. Moxifloxacin will be used as an active control. Participants will be blinded to&#xD;
      the treatments they will receive. The study consists of a screening period up to 26 days;&#xD;
      enrollment, 1 day; five in-patient treatment periods consisting of an admission day (except&#xD;
      in the first treatment period, when the pre-dose day is the baseline), dosing day and two&#xD;
      post-dosing days; an out-patient period of at least three days and not more than 10 days&#xD;
      between treatment periods; and a final visit 7 - 14 days after discharge from the last&#xD;
      treatment period. During the study, the subjects will receive each one of the following five&#xD;
      treatments: Treatment A: PA-824 placebo and moxifloxacin placebo; Treatment B: PA-824 400 mg&#xD;
      plus moxifloxacin placebo; Treatment C: PA-824 1000 mg plus moxifloxacin placebo; Treatment&#xD;
      D: PA-824 placebo plus moxifloxacin 400 mg; Treatment E: PA-824 400 mg plus moxifloxacin 400&#xD;
      mg. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of single-dose administration of PA-824&#xD;
      400 mg and 1000 mg versus placebo on the QTcI interval. A total of 75 randomized (in order to&#xD;
      have at least 60 evaluable) healthy male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 45 years will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
