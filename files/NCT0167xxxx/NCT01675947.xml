  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will seek to enroll 50 persons who have central or non-central geographic atrophy&#xD;
      (GA) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). GA in treated eye must be&#xD;
      between 0.75 disk areas (DA) and 8 DA. Eligible participants will be randomly chosen to&#xD;
      receive one of the following treatments in the study eye:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A 20 μL (440 μg) intravitreal (IVT) injection of sirolimus, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A sham treatment (subconjunctival injection of lidocaine) Participants with two (2)&#xD;
           eligible eyes will have one eye randomly assigned to receive intravitreal sirolimus and&#xD;
           no sham in the fellow eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first injection will begin at Day 0, which may occur on the date of screening/enrollment&#xD;
      or up to two weeks following screening/enrollment visit, and every month thereafter. The&#xD;
      visit schedule is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A clinical evaluation, including safety measures, will occur monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vision will be measured at the screening/enrollment visit and at 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and&#xD;
           24 months after the first injection has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fundus autofluorescence will occur at screening/enrollment and at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
           months after the first injection has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fundus color photography and optical coherence tomography will occur at&#xD;
           screening/enrollment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the first injection has&#xD;
           occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal is to evaluate whether the persons receiving the sirolimus injections show a&#xD;
      slower worsening of geographic atrophy compared to the persons receiving the sham injections.&#xD;
      A secondary goal is to evaluate the impact of sirolimus on vision compared to the sham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: As of May 30, 2014, study injections were discontinued due to safety concerns. No&#xD;
      further enrollments will occur and follow-up will continue on all active study participants&#xD;
      on a quarterly basis. That is, on visits coinciding with 3 month intervals from date of&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>Immunosuppressive agent. Blocks the T-lymphocyte activation and smooth muscle and endothelial cell proliferation that occurs in response to antigenic and cytokine (interleukin IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15) stimulation through either Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-independent pathways. Sirolimus arrests cell cycle progression by direct interaction with two intracellular proteins (immunophilin FK binding protein 12 (FKBP-12) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a multifunctional serine-threonine kinase). In cells, sirolimus binds to FKBP-12, and the resulting sirolimus-FKBP-12 complex then binds to and inhibits mTOR.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 55 years of age or older. Prior participation in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study&#xD;
             2 (AREDS2) is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must understand and sign the protocol's informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have central or non-central geographic atrophy (GA) in at least one&#xD;
             eye. GA should be at least 0.75 disk areas (DA) in size but no more than 8 disk areas&#xD;
             (DA); approximately 2.54 mm2 is 1 DA. GA is defined as one or more well-defined,&#xD;
             usually more or less circular patches of partial or complete de-pigmentation of the&#xD;
             retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), typically with exposure of underlying choroidal&#xD;
             blood vessels. Even if much of the RPE appears to be preserved and large choroidal&#xD;
             vessels are not visible, a round patch of RPE partial de-pigmentation may still be&#xD;
             classified as early GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have a steady fixation in the study eye in the foveal or parafoveal&#xD;
             area and media clear enough for good quality photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have visual acuity between 20/25 and 20/200 in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants must be post-menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants with female partners capable of conceiving children will be required&#xD;
             to use contraception during the study and for four months after their last sirolimus&#xD;
             injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is in another investigational study other than AREDS2 and actively&#xD;
             receiving study therapy for geographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization (CNV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is unable to comply with study procedures or follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has evidence of ocular disease other than AMD in either eye that may&#xD;
             confound the outcome of the study (e.g., glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy with 10 or&#xD;
             more hemorrhages or microaneurysms, uveitis, pseudovitelliform macular degeneration,&#xD;
             moderate/severe myopia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received treatment for AMD, such as macular laser, photodynamic&#xD;
             therapy (PDT) or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy&#xD;
             injection. Or the participant received an IVT injection of any agent (e.g.,&#xD;
             triamcinolone) other than an anti-VEGF agent within the last four months prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment. Vitamin supplementation for AMD is not considered an exclusionary&#xD;
             criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had a vitrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is expected to need ocular surgery during the course of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has undergone lens removal in the last three months or Yttrium Aluminium&#xD;
             Garnet (YAG) laser capsulotomy within the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is on chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is on immunosuppressive medication or is immunosuppressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is on ocular or systemic medications known to be toxic to the lens, retina&#xD;
             or optic nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with a history of malignancy that would compromise the 2-year study&#xD;
             survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with a history of ocular herpes simplex virus (HSV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in&#xD;
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and glycemic&#xD;
             control).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer (other than a non-melanoma skin cancer) diagnosed within the past&#xD;
             five years that could be worsened by immunosuppression. (The risk of immunosuppression&#xD;
             must be determined by an oncology consultation prior to enrollment.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular or periocular inflammation or infection in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of active or inactive toxoplasmosis in the study eye.&#xD;
