    <textblock>
      We aim to compare the efficacy (diagnostic yield), ease of use, and technical success rates&#xD;
      of EUS guided 22 gauge fine needle aspiration to core biopsy in the evaluation of pancreatic&#xD;
      tumors. The experimental hypothesis is that FNA will have superior overall diagnostic yield&#xD;
      than core biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has been utilized for over a decade to evaluate&#xD;
      endo-luminal and adjacent tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In that time, EUS guided fine&#xD;
      needle aspiration (FNA) has emerged as the dominant means of tissue acquisition for&#xD;
      pancreatic mass lesions. FNA has several limitations, foremost of which is the absence of a&#xD;
      clear relationship between cellular elements and stroma which may be required for accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis. Additionally, EUS-FNA requires the assistance of an on-site cytopathologist for&#xD;
      optimal yield which limits its dissemination and increases its cost. A novel EUS histology&#xD;
      needle (EUS-FNB) is available in the 22 gauge diameter which may allow for more accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis without the need for on site cytopathology assistance. Aim: To prospectively&#xD;
      compare the diagnostic yield, number of needle passes, and ease of use of 22 gauge EUS-FNA&#xD;
      and EUS-FNB. Hypothesis: EUS-FNB is superior to traditional EUS-FNA with regard to all&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome measures. Methods: Patients scheduled for EUS evaluation of&#xD;
      solid pancreatic tumors will be screened for enrollment at either a preceding clinical&#xD;
      encounter or the morning of their scheduled procedure. English-speaking patients between the&#xD;
      ages of 18 and 90 with a predominantly solid (greater than 60%) mass lesion of the pancreas&#xD;
      will be considered for enrollment. Exclusion criteria include pregnancy, a predominantly&#xD;
      cystic lesion, and the presence of an uncorrectable coagulopathy. Patients will then undergo&#xD;
      both EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB for the collection of tissue specimens required for clinical care.&#xD;
      The results of the experimental approach (EUS-FNB) will be compared to the control approach&#xD;
      (EUS-FNA). Data collected for each procedure will include: instrument use order, number of&#xD;
      needle passes with each device, technical success of each device, complications, ease of use,&#xD;
      and the ultimate pathological diagnosis / diagnostic yield for each device. Each data&#xD;
      category will then be compared utilizing standard statistical tests including chi-squared,&#xD;
      Fishers' exact, or student's t test.&#xD;
