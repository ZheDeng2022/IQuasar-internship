  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and PK of oral codeine sulfate&#xD;
      in pediatric subjects with mild to moderate post-procedural pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible pediatric subjects will complete all screening procedures within 14 days before the&#xD;
      scheduled procedure. Screening will be permitted on the day of the procedure. At screening,&#xD;
      the subject's parent or guardian will provide written parental permission/informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study and subjects will provide assent (if required by the local&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board [IRB]) before any protocol-specified procedures or assessments are&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be inpatients, outpatients, or day-surgery patients at the study site who will&#xD;
      undergo procedures expected to result in at least mild to moderate post-procedure pain with&#xD;
      the day of the procedure noted as Day 0, and will be followed until discharge from the study&#xD;
      site.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has a parent or guardian providing written parental permission/informed consent, with&#xD;
             subject assent (if required by local IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is a child 2 years old through 17 years old, inclusive (at the time of informed&#xD;
             consent signing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has a routine pediatric procedure that is expected to cause at least mild to moderate&#xD;
             pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Is expected by the investigator to require a minimum of one (1) dose of oral codeine&#xD;
             for the treatment of mild to moderate post-procedural pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has the ability to read and understand the study procedures and has the ability to&#xD;
             communicate meaningfully with the study investigator and staff (if the subject is of&#xD;
             preverbal age or cannot read or communicate meaningfully, then the subject's parent or&#xD;
             guardian must meet this criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If female subject is of childbearing potential, she must have a negative urine or&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test result on the day of the scheduled procedure prior to the&#xD;
             procedure. In this population, female of childbearing potential is defined by the&#xD;
             onset of menarche, that is, menstruation, whether at irregular or regular intervals&#xD;
             (periods).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have vascular access to facilitate multiple blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is currently lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has significant medical disease(s), laboratory abnormalities, or conditions(s) that in&#xD;
             the investigator's judgment could compromise the subject's welfare, ability to&#xD;
             communicate with study staff, complete study activities, or would otherwise&#xD;
             contraindicate study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Weighs less than 10.5 kg. (see Table 4 Maximum Number of Doses of Study Drug by Weight&#xD;
             for details)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has weight ≤ 5th or ≥ 95th percentile for age based on CDC Growth Charts. (see&#xD;
             Appendix 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has received codeine, hydrocodone, morphine or oxycodone in any form in the previous&#xD;
             seven (7) days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has used opioids chronically (e.g., codeine, morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, or&#xD;
             hydromorphone) for &gt;7 calendar days within the previous 30 days before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to receiving oral opioid(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has an active enteral malabsorption disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has impaired liver function (e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ≥3 times the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal [ULN], or bilirubin ≥3 times ULN), known active hepatic disease (e.g.,&#xD;
             hepatitis), evidence of clinically significant chronic liver disease or other&#xD;
             conditions affecting the liver (e.g., chronic hepatitis) that may suggest the&#xD;
             potential for an increased susceptibility to hepatic toxicity with oral codeine&#xD;
             exposure. NOTE: Subjects with no previous history of liver function impairment may be&#xD;
             enrolled before results are available from screening laboratory samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has significantly impaired renal function or disease, as evidenced by an estimated&#xD;
             glomerular filtration rate (i.e., from creatinine levels using the Schwartz formula)&#xD;
             calculated to be less than one-third (1/3) of normal for the applicable age of this&#xD;
             study population. NOTE: Subjects with no previous history of kidney function&#xD;
             impairment may be enrolled before results are available from screening laboratory&#xD;
             samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Is undergoing a procedure as treatment for acute burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has a history of substance abuse or there is evidence of current substance abuse, in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has participated in an interventional clinical study (investigational or marketed&#xD;
             product) within 30 days before screening, or plans to participate in another clinical&#xD;
             trial in the next 30 days.&#xD;
