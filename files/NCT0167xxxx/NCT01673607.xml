  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune response at primary tumor has a major role in the prognosis of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC). Some studies suggest a prognosis value of cytotoxic T cell and memory T cells at&#xD;
      primary tumor greater than tumoral stage. There is no work in the literature that has&#xD;
      examined the prognosis value of the immune response in liver metastases. To study immune&#xD;
      cells (histology) and inflammatory response (cytokines) in liver metastases is a challenge to&#xD;
      understand the effectiveness of chemotherapy used in this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy used in liver metastases of colorectal cancer also have effects on&#xD;
      non-tumoral liver tumor and therefore can interfere with postoperative complications of&#xD;
      hepatic resection. Sinusoidal dilatation is present in 20% to 80% of patients who received&#xD;
      oxaliplatin before hepatectomy. Steatosis is frequently observed after administration of 5-FU&#xD;
      alone or in combination with irinotecan. This steatosis may also be accompanied by&#xD;
      inflammatory lesions (steatohepatitis), especially after administration of oxaliplatin or&#xD;
      irinotecan and is associated with increased postoperative mortality. The hepatic toxicity of&#xD;
      new biological agents is not well known (cetuximab and bevacizumab). The mechanisms of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced toxicities are currently unknown. The main objective is to analyze the&#xD;
      profile of the immune response in liver metastases of CRC and find the link with the&#xD;
      radiological response. Measurements will be made by quantitative RT-PCR on frozen liver&#xD;
      biopsies. Secondary objective is to seek a correlation between the histological lesions&#xD;
      induced by chemotherapy and non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis. The secondary endpoints&#xD;
      are rate of immune cells, histologic response (percentage of tumor necrosis), disease-free&#xD;
      survival, the non-invasive test of fibrosis, the chemotherapy-induced liver injury, cytokines&#xD;
      and circulating angiogenic factors.&#xD;
