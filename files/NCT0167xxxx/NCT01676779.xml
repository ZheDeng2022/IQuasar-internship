      This is an open label, 2-arm, 1-stage, randomized controlled phase II study in patients with&#xD;
      AJCC stage IIIB/C &amp; -IV melanoma. At baseline tumor assessment (using total body FDG-PET/CT),&#xD;
      patients should be free from measurable tumor lesions (according to RECISTv1.1 definitions)&#xD;
      following prior local therapy (e.g. following surgical resection, isolated limb perfusion,&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy, …). Patients should&#xD;
      not have symptomatic non-measurable tumor lesions (e.g. bone metastasis, or pleural&#xD;
      effusion), and lesions treated by prior local therapy should be free from progression.&#xD;
      Patients should not have received any prior systemic therapy (non-experimental or&#xD;
      experimental).&#xD;

      This is an open label, 2-arm, 1-stage, randomized controlled phase II study in patients with&#xD;
      AJCC stage IIIB/C &amp; -IV melanoma. At baseline tumor assessment (using total body FDG-PET/CT),&#xD;
      patients should be free from measurable tumor lesions (according to RECISTv1.1 definitions)&#xD;
      following prior local therapy (e.g. following surgical resection, isolated limb perfusion,&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy, …). Patients should&#xD;
      not have symptomatic non-measurable tumor lesions (e.g. bone metastasis, or pleural&#xD;
      effusion), and lesions treated by prior local therapy should be free from progression.&#xD;
      Patients should not have received any prior systemic therapy (non-experimental or&#xD;
      experimental).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomized between two treatment arms (Arm-A and -B). In study Arm-A,&#xD;
           patients will receive DC-administrations during one year following randomization.&#xD;
           Salvage treatment by local therapies will be allowed during the study treatment in&#xD;
           Arm-A. In study Arm-B, patients will initiate DC-administrations only after documented&#xD;
           recurrence of the melanoma that cannot be salvaged by local therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is to determine the rate (%) of patients who&#xD;
           are free from macrometastases (: measurable tumor lesions and symptomatic non-measurable&#xD;
           tumor lesions) at 1-year (= 52 weeks) after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated on Arm-B will serve as a contemporary control-arm to help interpreting the&#xD;
      outcome of patients treated in Arm-A. By design (phase II) this trial will not be powered to&#xD;
      statistically prove a predefined difference between the two study arms (this would require a&#xD;
      phase III design). Patients treated in Arm-B will be able to initiate immunotherapy with&#xD;
      autologous DC at the time of recurrence that can not be salvaged by local therapy.&#xD;
      Documentation of the anti-tumor activity and survival following DC-treatment at recurrence in&#xD;
      Arm-B patients will be a secondary objective of this clinical trial.&#xD;
