    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an intervention training executive functions like&#xD;
      attention, working memory, and self-regulation for preschoolers at risk for&#xD;
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is feasible, acceptable to families, and improves&#xD;
      attention, behavior, and functioning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Disruptive behavior disorders, particularly Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),&#xD;
      constitute one of the most common diagnoses in preschool children. Disruptive behaviors are a&#xD;
      major public health problem including causing significant emotional distress for caregivers&#xD;
      and children, expulsion from daycare or early education settings, demands on caregiver's&#xD;
      time, accident proneness and other safety concerns. However, few evidence-based early&#xD;
      interventions exist for preschoolers with attention and behavior problems, which is critical&#xD;
      because they are strongly suggested as the first line of treatment for preschoolers with&#xD;
      ADHD. Because executive functioning (EF) has been consistently been proposed as a putative&#xD;
      factor in the development of disruptive behavior disorders an intervention targeting EF&#xD;
      (e.g., inhibition, working memory), attention, and metacognition during early childhood could&#xD;
      likely affect the development of disruptive behavior disorders in preschoolers. Indeed, EF&#xD;
      skills are identified by kindergarten teachers as primary prerequisites for school success.&#xD;
      EF deficits independently contribute to poorer outcomes in ADHD, and have been linked&#xD;
      directly to academic and social functioning deficits. Given that EF and brain development are&#xD;
      rapidly developing during the preschool years, preschoolers may benefit most from an early&#xD;
      intervention targeting EF skills. Investigators have developed a promising intervention,&#xD;
      Executive Training of Attention and Metacognition (ETAM), for preschoolers, and have&#xD;
      conducted a small preliminary open trial demonstrating the initial acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention. Investigators also found significant moderate effect sizes on objective&#xD;
      measures of EF and moderate to large effect size reductions in ratings of inattention and&#xD;
      behavioral symptoms by parents, clinicians, and teachers. A randomized clinical trial (RCT)&#xD;
      is needed to investigate if these positive effects on executive functioning, attention, and&#xD;
      behavior are due to ETAM or to the effect of parental attention and/or a placebo effect.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to assess the feasibility of a design for a future RCT. Investigators&#xD;
      will develop an attention control (AC) comparison group and assess the feasibility of:&#xD;
      identifying, enrolling and retaining preschoolers at-risk for ADHD, randomization choices,&#xD;
      the measurement of EF and functional outcomes, and delivery protocol for both AC and ETAM by&#xD;
      conducting a pilot RCT with 60 children at-risk for ADHD. Exploratory aims include assessing&#xD;
      whether children in the ETAM group show gains compared to those in AC on targeted (trained)&#xD;
      outcomes (i.e., measures of EF) and untrained outcomes (i.e., ADHD symptoms, academic&#xD;
      readiness, social competence). Investigators will also assess whether gains are maintained as&#xD;
      well as investigate potential moderators/mediators.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will compute an aggregated measure of EF deficits. For each EF measure investigators will define a threshold for adequate performance as a score obtained by 75% of the children. Performance will be dummy-coded according to this threshold as &quot;0&quot; for adequate performance and &quot;1&quot; for poor performance. We will then calculate a continuous measure of EF ranging from 0 (adequate performance on all) to 9 (poor performance on all), by summing the dummy coded scores of all EF measures.</description>
