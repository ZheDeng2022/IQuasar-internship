    <textblock>
      Pre-emptive local anaesthetics are widely used in laparoscopic surgery, but there is no&#xD;
      really consistent evidence that it is useful. Studies in the literature have shown&#xD;
      contradicting results. At our hospital we are currently using pre-emptive local anaesthetics&#xD;
      in the trocar areas, but as the literature does not give a clear and clinically relevant&#xD;
      answer, we need to find out more. This study aims to see if pre-emptive local anaesthetics&#xD;
      are useful in the setting of our day-case, laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is prospective, randomized, and double-blinded with parallel assignments. It&#xD;
      will compare pre-emptive incisional injection of bupivacaine, 5 mg/ml, with a placebo&#xD;
      injection (saline). The clinically relevant comparison should probably be between injection&#xD;
      of local anaesthetics and no injection at all. However a study design like that would make&#xD;
      blinding impossible and probably not acceptable as a research design for a study which aims&#xD;
      to be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test if pre-emptive injection of long-lasting, local anaesthetics&#xD;
      reduces post-operative pain. As local anaesthetics are already implemented in our routine,&#xD;
      the hypothesis is that it has a positive effect by reducing postoperative pain. The null&#xD;
      hypothesis is that there is no difference between local anaesthetics and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of patients will be from our daily surgery, and consecutive patients who are&#xD;
      eligible for day-case, laparoscopic surgery will be asked to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To have a clinically important reduction of post-operative pain a difference of 2 units on a&#xD;
      0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) is chosen for the sample size calculation. A smaller&#xD;
      difference in pain score is not considered clinically relevant in our opinion. With a power&#xD;
      of at least 80% this gives 20 patients in total, 10 in each arm. The power calculation was&#xD;
      done by statistician S. Johnsen at the University of Surrey. We will include 24 patients&#xD;
      altogether to cover for any losses to follow-up. The drop-out rates in clinical trials are&#xD;
      usually estimated at 20 %, which would give 25 patients to be included (20/ (1-0.2) = 25).&#xD;
      This study has, however, a very short follow-up period, so the drop-out rate is expected to&#xD;
      be smaller. Drop-outs will be recorded and accounted for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 participants will be randomized in blocks of 6 patients. Block randomization is chosen to&#xD;
      avoid pooling by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be done by one surgeon. This might be a subject for criticism as one can&#xD;
      say that the results in the study are only true for one surgeon in a particular setting. But&#xD;
      the need for standardization is very important in studies like this, as pointed out by&#xD;
      Wilder-Smith (Wilder-Smith, O. H. 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time of the randomization is identified as the breakage of the study drug vial. If a&#xD;
      potential candidate is found to satisfy any exclusion criteria or withdraws the consent&#xD;
      before the vial is opened, the patient is not randomised. The study ID number and the study&#xD;
      drug vial will be made available for the next potential candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a potential candidate is excluded for any reason after the breakage of the vial but before&#xD;
      the completion of the injection of the study drug, the study ID number will be coded as&#xD;
      Protocol Violation and excluded from the statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient, nursing staff and the surgeon will all be blinded to the substance injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infiltration in the primary, umbilical site will be blind, but as close to the fascia as&#xD;
      possible. The secondary port infiltrations will be done under visual guidance from the&#xD;
      laparoscope, in the fascia and close to the peritoneum. Bupivacaine in a concentration of 5&#xD;
      mg/ml will be used and 5 ml of the solution will be injected at each port site. The patients&#xD;
      who get placebo will get 5 ml of physiologic saline injected at each port site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study will be movement-evoked pain (MEP) 5 hours after surgery, as&#xD;
      half-life of bupivacaine is 4-6 hours. Movement-evoked pain is the most important outcome&#xD;
      measure, because the goal is to get the patient back to normal, daily activities as soon as&#xD;
      possible. Trials measuring both movement evoked pain and pain at rest (PAR) suggests that MEP&#xD;
      is much more intense than PAR postoperative (Srikandarajah et al, 2011). Pain will be&#xD;
      measured on a 10 cm long Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) where 0 cm is no pain and 10 cm is&#xD;
      severe pain. NRS is validated as a good tool for pain measurement at different ages and&#xD;
      education levels (Gagliese et al, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be pain at rest at 2 and 5 hours postoperative, and use of&#xD;
      rescue analgesics. Pain at rest must, of course, be recorded before movement evoked pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain scoring will be done by the patient with help from the nurses at the ward at 2 and 5&#xD;
      hours postoperative, and both will be blinded to which arm the patient is in.&#xD;
