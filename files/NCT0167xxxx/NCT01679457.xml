  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to learn how to improve treatment for clients who are working&#xD;
      hard in treatment at the McLean Hospital Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Institute (OCDI), but&#xD;
      who are not making the progress that would typically be expected. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators will be comparing the performance of such clients in a treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU)-Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) session with their performance in an Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-focused ERP session that follows an ACT booster session. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that clients will perform significantly better in the ACT-focused&#xD;
      ERP session than they will in the TAU-ERP session. More specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that clients and an independent rater will report that in the ACT-focused ERP&#xD;
      session, clients performed significantly fewer rituals and/or avoidance behaviors, exerted&#xD;
      significantly more effort, had significantly less difficulty getting started with the ERP,&#xD;
      were significantly less influenced by their uncomfortable thoughts/feelings, were&#xD;
      significantly more willing to experience discomfort, were significantly more focused on&#xD;
      working towards what is important to the client. The investigators also hypothesize that an&#xD;
      independent rater will rate clients as significantly more compliant with the ACT-focused ERP&#xD;
      session than with the TAU-ERP session. The investigators also hypothesize that clients will&#xD;
      rate the ACT-focused ERP session as significantly more preferable and acceptable than the&#xD;
      TAU-ERP session, and that they will report being significantly more willing to do the&#xD;
      ACT-focused ERP session again.&#xD;
