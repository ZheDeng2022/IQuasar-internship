      Switching from the ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor component to raltegravir in stable&#xD;
      HIV-infected adult patients receiving combination therapy will demonstrate improved clinical&#xD;
      tolerability or lipid profiles with sustained plasma virological response (&lt;50 copies/ml).&#xD;

      A. Objectives To compare the treatment-emerged AEs and virological suppression after switch&#xD;
      to raltegravir-based therapy in stable HIV-infected patients who receiving ritonavir-boosted&#xD;
      protease inhibitor antiretroviral regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The changes in overall incidence and severity of patient-reported clinical adverse events&#xD;
      (based on &quot;symptom distress module) after switch to raltegravir-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of patients who are free of &quot;virological failure&quot; at week 48 after switch&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The change from baseline in CD4 cell counts at week 48 after switch&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The change in quality of life by assess the changes in the domain scores of MOS-HIV&#xD;
           questionnaire at baseline and different study time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The changes in laboratory adverse event, e.g., the mean percent changes from baseline to&#xD;
           48 weeks in plasma lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDLCholesterol, HDL Cholesterol,&#xD;
           triglycerides) after switch&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The proportion of patients who are free of &quot;treatment failure&quot; at week 48 after switch&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The proportion of patients with treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events and&#xD;
           laboratory abnormalities&#xD;
