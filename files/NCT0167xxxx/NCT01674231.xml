  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to learn about the effects of whole grapes, in the form of&#xD;
      freeze-dried grape powder, on markers of health. Phytochemical rich food consumption is&#xD;
      associated with protection against chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD)&#xD;
      demonstrating the ability to modify endothelial function and lipemia, but exact causal&#xD;
      mechanisms are still not well understood. The investigators will examine metabolic and&#xD;
      mechanistic effects of consumption of whole grape powder in chronic as well as acute settings&#xD;
      in response to meal challenges by testing blood samples to determine if markers of health&#xD;
      have improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of this project is that consumption of grapes in the form of a&#xD;
      polyphenol-rich freeze-dried whole grape powder (WGP) will attenuate chronic and meal induced&#xD;
      oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in obese individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the effect of WGP compared to placebo on biomarkers of oxidative stress and&#xD;
           inflammation in obese subjects over 4 week intervention periods in a randomized,&#xD;
           cross-over, double-blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effects of WGP compared to placebo on lipid and apolipoprotein parameters,&#xD;
           and on biomarkers endothelial dysfunction, in obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate and characterize the effects of WGP compared to placebo on mononuclear cells&#xD;
           (MNC) from obese subjects in response to the oxidative challenge of a high fat, high&#xD;
           carbohydrate (HFHC) meal by examining monocyte indices such as oxidant stress-related&#xD;
           transcription factors and downstream gene targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health promotion and prevention of chronic diseases in the face of a continuing obesity&#xD;
      epidemic is the most pressing public health issue today. Epidemiologic evidence supports a&#xD;
      protective effect of plant food-rich dietary patterns, and an inverse relationship of fruit&#xD;
      and vegetable consumption with chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease (CVD). However,&#xD;
      the underlying causal mechanisms are not well understood. Prospective human studies examining&#xD;
      consumption of polyphenol-rich whole grapes or their components have found benefits on&#xD;
      markers of oxidative stress and blood lipids as have other food examples such as blackcurrant&#xD;
      juice and strawberries. Putative mechanisms underlying the positive actions of&#xD;
      polyphenol-rich grapes have been well described in recent reviews. A number of in-vitro cell&#xD;
      culture and in-vivo animal studies with WGP and extracts support these mechanisms. However,&#xD;
      relatively fewer human studies have been conducted examining biomarkers and potential&#xD;
      mechanisms for attenuation of chronic inflammatory responses and meal-induced postprandial&#xD;
      oxidative stress and inflammation in obese humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a metabolic state recognized as being pro-inflammatory, leading to dysregulation&#xD;
      of endothelial function, glucose and lipoprotein metabolism and cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
      Consumption of high fat diets can further impair vascular reactivity in the postprandial&#xD;
      period. Circulating MNC provide a representation of the overall inflammatory status of the&#xD;
      body, which is accessible and can be used to examine mechanistic processes in response to&#xD;
      chronic and meal-induced oxidative stress. Recent literature reports have described the&#xD;
      effect of polyphenol-rich food consumption and Mediterranean diet patterns to reduce NF-κB&#xD;
      activation as well as changes in downstream inflammatory gene expression in peripheral blood&#xD;
      MNC's. Therefore, the proposed study will exploit this approach to examine short-term&#xD;
      responses to a meal challenge as well as longer-term responses to daily consumption of whole&#xD;
      grapes as assessed by plasma and mononuclear cell indices. This research will shed light on&#xD;
      oxidant stress-related transcription factors and downstream gene targets involved in the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects of grape consumption in obese individuals who are at increased risk&#xD;
      of chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional scientific data is needed to understand the links between diet and health and to&#xD;
      develop effective dietary strategies to improve health outcomes, particularly in obesity. The&#xD;
      use of polyphenol-rich whole grape powder to attenuate inflammatory mediators and biomarkers&#xD;
      in blood and mononuclear cells of obese humans represents a targeted intervention approach in&#xD;
      an at-risk population. The goal for the study is to examine the link between the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of grapes as a food and health in a significant public health chronic disease. The&#xD;
      outcomes of the study design will provide preliminary data which bridges well-controlled&#xD;
      human translational research and fundamental research by examining cellular responses to&#xD;
      grape consumption in a human clinical trial. The approach will generate new and unique data&#xD;
      to extend scientific knowledge and allow for the development of a mechanistic component to a&#xD;
      human feeding intervention.&#xD;
