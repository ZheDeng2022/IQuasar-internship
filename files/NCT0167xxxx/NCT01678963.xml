    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical ophthalmic&#xD;
      squalamine lactate eye drops in treating patients with neovascular age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration (wet AMD), a degenerative retinal eye disease that causes a progressive,&#xD;
      irreversible, severe loss of central vision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative retinal eye disease that causes a&#xD;
      progressive loss of central vision. AMD is the leading cause of legal blindness among adults&#xD;
      age 50 or older in the Western world and affects 25-30 million people globally. This number&#xD;
      is expected to triple over the next 25 years. Central vision loss from AMD is caused by the&#xD;
      degeneration of light-sensing cells in the macula called photoreceptors. The macula, the&#xD;
      central portion of the retina, is responsible for perceiving fine visual detail. As&#xD;
      photoreceptors begin to degenerate, so does the individual's central vision. The extent of&#xD;
      vision loss varies widely and is related to the type of AMD, its severity and other&#xD;
      individual characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMD presents itself in two different forms - a &quot;dry&quot; form and the more severe &quot;wet&quot; form. Dry&#xD;
      AMD, the more common and milder form of AMD, accounts for 85% to 90% of all cases. It results&#xD;
      in varying forms of sight loss and may or may not eventually develop into the wet form.&#xD;
      Although the wet form of AMD accounts for only 10% to 15% of all AMD, the chance for severe&#xD;
      sight loss is much greater. Wet AMD is responsible for 90% of severe vision loss associated&#xD;
      with AMD. Approximately 500,000 new cases of wet AMD are diagnosed annually worldwide. In&#xD;
      North America alone, approximately 200,000 new cases of wet AMD are diagnosed each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Squalamine lactate has been found to be an inhibitor of new blood vessel formation&#xD;
      (angiogenesis) induced by VEGF, PDGF or bFGF. Since angiogenesis is implicated in the growth&#xD;
      and maintenance of choroidal neovascularization, squalamine lactate is potentially an&#xD;
      attractive development candidate in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD),&#xD;
      in which blood vessel proliferation has a role.&#xD;
