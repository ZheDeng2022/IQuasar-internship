    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility MRI tracking of a vaccine produced from a&#xD;
      persons cancer cells injected intradermally once a day for 3 consecutive days. One of the&#xD;
      daily doses will contain a chemical that can be detected by an MRI. That will be either the&#xD;
      1st or 3rd day of the 3 day course. On that day MRI scans will be performed 6 and 24 hours&#xD;
      after the injection on that day. Patients may be able to receive booster doses every 1-2&#xD;
      months&#xD;
