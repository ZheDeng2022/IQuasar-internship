  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient navigators have been shown to assist people seeking cancer screening and other&#xD;
      medical services. The purpose of this study is to see whether a patient navigator can link&#xD;
      smokers to available community resources shown to help smokers quit smoking.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the study's potential in terms of its reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the intervention, tobacco-dependent patients will be asked to complete an intake interview and a telephone follow-up interview (at 3 to 6 months post-intervention).</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Patient Navigator</intervention_name>
    <description>The pt navigator will phone (email, text, or other preferred method of contact) pts prior to the date of previously set individual goals (e.g. going to an appt, getting their cessation medications filled, etc) as a reminder &amp; to discuss barriers such as finances, transportation or ambivalent motivation. In this manner, pts receive navigation services tailored to their individual needs &amp; barriers. Once pts are connected with a cessation service (defined as either using cessation medication or at least 1 contact with a Quitline or community-based cessation counselor)or provider-prescribed cessation medication usage, continues the navigation intervention will be considered complete. W/I the 3 month engagement period, pts will receive up to 6 contacts from the Pt Navigator following referral from primary care provider. Consistent with recommended pt navigation practice, the navigator will provide feedback to primary care provider regarding cessation services that the pts are receiving.</description>

        Also, from the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Cancer Prevention (RLCCCP), a&#xD;
        community based Center for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer located at&#xD;
