      The purpose of this study is to compare and determine the efficacy of letrozole&#xD;
      administration to that of combined metformin and Clomiphene in infertile women with&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) not treated before with any ovulation induction agent&#xD;

      The study will be in 200 patient diagnosed to have PCOS among those attending the Fertility&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic at the Women's Health Center, Assiut University Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was prospective randomized controlled trial conducted over a period of 3&#xD;
      years from 1st of January 2009 to 1st of January 2012, at the Women's Health Center, Assiut&#xD;
      University hospital, Assiut, Egypt, after approval was received from the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      faculty of medicine , Assiut University. Women referred to the infertility clinic in women's&#xD;
      health center were screened for PCO using Rotterdam consensus criteria for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      PCOS. The patients who were newly diagnosed as PCO and not treated previously were invited to&#xD;
      participate in our study. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant after&#xD;
      an information sheet had been provided. The patients had the right to refuse participation in&#xD;
      the study or to withdraw at any time without being denied their full regular clinical care.&#xD;
      All personal information and medical data were confidential and were not made available to&#xD;
      third parties. All participants met the Rotterdam consensus criteria for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      PCOS. At admission, a thorough medical history was taken and all women underwent physical&#xD;
      examination, which included anthropometric measurements and after spontaneous menstruation or&#xD;
      progestin induced withdrawal bleeding, basal endocrine evaluation on day 3 of the cycle&#xD;
      included measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH),&#xD;
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH ) and prolactin. Then&#xD;
      vaginal sonographic examination were done to measure endometrial thickness and exclude cases&#xD;
      endometrial pathology or baseline ovarian cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were randomized to receive letrozole or clomiphene citrate plus metformin.&#xD;
      Randomization was performed using a computer-generated random numbers table, and allocation&#xD;
      concealment was achieved using serially numbered opaque envelopes that were only opened once&#xD;
      the interventions were assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the letrozole group, the ovaries were stimulated using 2.5mg/day letrozole (Femara;&#xD;
      Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) for 5 days,in the form of one tablet( 2.5 mg) per day&#xD;
      for 5 days from day 3 to day 7 of the menstrual cycle and if ovulation has occurred with no&#xD;
      pregnancy continue on the same dose for another 2 consecutive cycles ,but if no ovulation&#xD;
      increase the dose to 2 tablets per day(5 mg) for another 2 consecutive cycles in the same&#xD;
      manner .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the second group will take metformin (Cidophage tablets,500 mg per tablet;&#xD;
      CID, ARE, in an oral dose of 1,500 mg/d) 500mg three times daily for 3 months Plus&#xD;
      clomid(50-mg tablets twice daily; Global Napi Pharmaceuticals, Cairo, Egypt , Arab Republic&#xD;
      of Egypt) In the form of 50 mg twice daily (100mg /day) for 5 days from day 3 to day 7 of&#xD;
      menstrual cycle and to be repeated for 3 consecutive cycles in the same manner if no&#xD;
      pregnancy occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, endometrial thickness and mean follicular diameter were assessed by the same&#xD;
      investigator using transvaginal ultrasound on days 2 ,10, 12, and 14 of the menstrual cycle,&#xD;
      and 10 000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (Pregnyl; Organon, Oss, The Netherlands)&#xD;
      were injected intramuscularly if there was at least 1 leading follicle measuring 18 mm or&#xD;
      more in diameter and endometrial thickness detected at that time(endometrial thickness was&#xD;
      determined at the greatest diameter perpendicular to the midsagittal plane in the fundal&#xD;
      region, including both layers of the endometrium). All participants were advised to have&#xD;
      intercourse 24-36 hours after the hCG injection. Two days after being given Human chorionic&#xD;
      gonadotropin, the patients were assessed for signs of ovulation (disappearance of&#xD;
      preovulatory follicle, fluid in the cul-de-sac, and/or corpus luteum formation). Pregnancy&#xD;
      will be diagnosed when positive pregnancy test in urine done or a gestational sac was&#xD;
      detected on transvaginal ultrasound examination 1week after the missed period or serum β-hCG&#xD;
      concentration 14 days after HCG injection if menses had not occurred. A biochemical pregnancy&#xD;
      was considered when the serum β-hCG concentration was 50 mIU/mL or more in the absence of&#xD;
      menstruation. All study medication were stopped when there was positive pregnancy&#xD;
      test.Pregnant patients then will be followed up until an ultrasound could document the&#xD;
      viability of pregnancy. A clinical pregnancy was defined as the presence of a gestational sac&#xD;
      with a beating fetal heart on transvaginal ultrasound. A spontaneous abortion was defined as&#xD;
      the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the end of the 20th week.&#xD;
