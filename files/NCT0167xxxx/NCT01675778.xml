  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most common complaint for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).&#xD;
      Inadequate pain relief is also a common problem in ED. Patients' pain perceptions and&#xD;
      responses to intravenous opioids vary widely and are influenced by multiple factors. The&#xD;
      objective of the current study is to examine the association between total body weight, BMI&#xD;
      (body mass index) and clinical response to a fixed dose of intravenous hydromorphone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most common complaint for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).&#xD;
      Morphine and hydromorphone are the two most commonly administrated intravenous opioid&#xD;
      analgesics. However, a large inter-individual variation in the response to morphine or&#xD;
      hydromorphone has been observed and a significant number of patients do not have satisfactory&#xD;
      pain relief after receiving commonly administered doses of these two medications. Current&#xD;
      studies have focused on investigating optimal strategies of intravenous opioid use for&#xD;
      moderate and severe pain in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to the commonly recommended total body weight (TBW) based dosing strategy, a recent&#xD;
      publication did not demonstrate a linear relationship between TBW and clinical response to&#xD;
      morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of the research is to identify optimal methods of dosing opioids to&#xD;
      alleviate pain in ED patients. The objective of this study is to examine the association&#xD;
      between two measures of body size/body composition and response to a standard dose of&#xD;
      hydromorphone. The null hypothesis is that there is no association between the measures of&#xD;
      body size/composition and response to 1 mg hydromorphone, and thus no difference between the&#xD;
      associations. If a strong association exists between TBW or BMI and pain response, it will&#xD;
      lend support for the importance of taking body size or composition into account when making&#xD;
      decisions about hydromorphone dosing in the ED. It will lay the groundwork for future studies&#xD;
      of analgesic dosing. This is of particular importance given the increasing prevalence of&#xD;
      obesity in the US and other developed nations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the association between analgesic response to a standard dose of hydromorphone&#xD;
           and total body weight in ED patients with acute pain requiring intravenous opioid&#xD;
           analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the association between analgesic response to a standard dose of hydromorphone&#xD;
           and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the associations between analgesic response to a standard dose of&#xD;
           hydromorphone and the two measures of body size/composition, BMI and TBW.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess whether the associations between response to hydromorphone and these measures&#xD;
           of body size/composition are confounded or modified by gender, age, ethnicity and&#xD;
           certain genetic polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the current study will suggest whether body size or composition play a role in&#xD;
      the clinical response to hydromorphone and may lay the groundwork for further studies to&#xD;
      determine whether dosing should be modified to take these characteristics into account either&#xD;
      continuously, e.g. 0.015 mg/kg hydromorphone or categorically (increasing doses by category&#xD;
      of BMI).&#xD;

        <description>Participants were asked to rate their pain levels from 0 (=no pain) to 10 (= worst pain). The change in pain intensity was determined by subtracting the intensity reported before treatment from the intensity reported 30 minutes after treatment. Pearson correlation was used to assess the correlation between change in pain intensity and total body weight (TBW). The reported value represents the correlation coefficient.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Oxygen Saturation Level &lt; 92%</title>
          <description>Opioids can induce respiratory depression, which could lead to low oxygen saturation level. Prolonged low oxygen saturation level &lt; 92% could cause brain damage. Understanding all potential negative impacts of Hydromorphone helps make it safer for clinical use.</description>

        <title>Effect of Gender on the Correlation Between TBW and Change in Pain Intensity</title>
        <description>This study evaluated the effect of gender on the correlation between Total Body Weight (TBW) and change in pain intensity. Participants were asked to rate their pain levels from o (=no pain) to 10 (= worst pain). The change in pain intensity was determined by subtracting the intensity reported before treatment from the intensity reported after treatment. Pearson correlation was used to assess the correlation between change in pain intensity and total body weight (TBW). The reported value represents the correlation coefficient.</description>

        <title>Effects of Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms of Opioid Receptor (OPRM1, A118G) on the Correlation Between TBW and Change in Pain Intensity</title>
        <description>This study evaluated the effect of genetic factors on the correlation between Total Body Weight (TBW) and change in pain intensity. Clinical responses to hydromorphone could be affected by the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in gene involving opioid receptor (OPRM1, A118G). Participants were asked to rate their pain levels from 0 (=no pain) to 10 (= worst pain). The change in pain intensity was determined by subtracting the intensity reported before treatment from the intensity reported after treatment. The median and inter-quantile ranges of pain intensity reduction post-treatment were compared among patients by Kruskal-Wallis test.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between Change in Pain Intensity and BMI at 30 Minutes Post-treatment</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to rate their pain levels from 0 (=no pain) to 10 (= worst pain). The change in pain intensity was determined by subtracting the intensity reported before treatment from the intensity reported 30 minutes after treatment. Pearson correlation was used to assess the correlation between change in pain intensity and body mass index (BMI). The reported value represents the correlation coefficient.</description>

        <population>174 participants completed the treatment but only 163 participants were included in data analysis. The 11 participants were excluded from the data analysis because 2 had prior opioid use, 2 had chronic pain instead acute pain and 7 did not get measured or weighed by staff as required.</population>

        <title>Effects of Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms of Opioid Transporter (ABCB1, C3435T) on the Correlation Between TBW and Change in Pain Intensity</title>
        <description>This study evaluated the effect of genetic factors on the correlation between Total Body Weight (TBW) and change in pain intensity. Clinical responses to hydromorphone could be affected by the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in gene involving opioid transporter (ABCB1, C3435T). Participants were asked to rate their pain levels from 0 (=no pain) to 10 (= worst pain). The change in pain intensity was determined by subtracting the intensity reported before treatment from the intensity reported after treatment. The mean and inter-quantile ranges of pain intensity reduction post-treatment were compared among patients by Kruskal-Wallis test.</description>

        <title>Effects of Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms of Pain Sensitivity (COMT, G1947A) on the Correlation Between TBW and Change in Pain Intensity</title>
        <description>This study evaluated the effect of genetic factors on the correlation between Total Body Weight (TBW) and change in pain intensity. Clinical responses to hydromorphone could be affected by the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in gene involving pain sensitivity (COMT, G1947A). Participants were asked to rate their pain levels from 0 (=no pain) to 10 (= worst pain). The change in pain intensity was determined by subtracting the intensity reported before treatment from the intensity reported after treatment. The mean and inter-quantile ranges of pain intensity reduction post-treatment were compared among patients by Kruskal-Wallis test.</description>
