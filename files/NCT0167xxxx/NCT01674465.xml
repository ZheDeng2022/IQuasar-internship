    <textblock>
      Calcineurin Inhibitors (CNI) are drugs used to suppress the immune system when a person has a&#xD;
      solid organ transplant. Although these drugs keep the transplanted organ from being rejected&#xD;
      they are toxic to kidneys, or nephrotoxic. CNIs cause damage, called fibrosis, to kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrosis is a type of scarring that occurs in kidney tissue. Fibrosis can eventually lead to&#xD;
      kidney failure. One of the pathways that cause fibrosis is a chronic lack of oxygen to the&#xD;
      kidney tissue called &quot;hypoxia&quot;. There is a protein called Nox2 that may be involved in how&#xD;
      this hypoxia happens in the kidney. The Department of Medicine-Nephrology at the University&#xD;
      of Wisconsin is conducting a research study to see how much of the Nox2 protein is present in&#xD;
      kidneys that may have fibrosis caused by CNIs and whether a certain type of Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be used to tell in advance if the disease caused by CNIs is&#xD;
      getting worse. Study hypothesis: MRI, a non-invasive technique, can be used to determine&#xD;
      whether CNI induced kidney disease is getting worse. Additionally, the study aims to&#xD;
      determine the role of Nox2 in CNI nephrotoxicity.&#xD;

      Calcineurin Inhibitors (CNIs) and Renal Fibrosis. CNIs including CsA and tacrolimus are the&#xD;
      cornerstone of maintenance immunosuppression in solid organ transplantation. These drugs are&#xD;
      so effective that newer generation CNIs such as Voclosporin (Isotechnika Pharma, Inc,&#xD;
      Edmonton, Alberta) are in development. They play their immunosuppressive role by inhibiting&#xD;
      the activity of calcineurin, a serine phosphatase that normally dephosphorylates nuclear&#xD;
      factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Dephosphorylated NFAT translocates in the nucleus and&#xD;
      induces the transcription of interleukin-2, an important cytokine for the activation and&#xD;
      proliferation of T-lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite their beneficial actions in transplantation and many autoimmune disorders, the&#xD;
      clinical use of CNIs is limited by their chronic nephrotoxicity. This represents a&#xD;
      significant public health problem since the 10-year incidence of chronic CNI nephrotoxicity&#xD;
      is 100% in renal transplant recipients. Similarly, chronic CNI nephrotoxicity is the dominant&#xD;
      causative factor for kidney failure in nonkidney organ transplant recipients. In this group,&#xD;
      the 5-year risk of ESRD ranges from 7 to 21% and is associated with a 4-time greater risk of&#xD;
      death. The pathological features of chronic CNI nephrotoxicity include progressive and&#xD;
      irreversible interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and arteriolar hyaline changes. De novo&#xD;
      or progressive arteriolar hyaline thickening (AH) is the most pathognomonic lesion of chronic&#xD;
      CNI nephrotoxicity. This lesion consists of vacuolization of endothelial and smooth muscle&#xD;
      cells and focal or circular lumpy protein deposits in the arteriolar wall, which usually&#xD;
      replaces necrotic smooth muscle cells and eventually narrow the vascular lumen. This&#xD;
      arteriolopathy is important for the development of fibrosis. Typically, fibrosis follows a&#xD;
      &quot;striped pattern&quot; from the medulla to the cortex and is associated with vacuolization of the&#xD;
      cytoplasm in tubular epithelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although tacrolimus is superior to CsA in improving graft survival and preventing acute&#xD;
      rejection in kidney transplantation, the individual nephrotoxicity profiles of these drugs&#xD;
      are similar. At cellular and molecular levels, CNIs result in matrix accumulation and EMT via&#xD;
      TGF-beta1 dependent and independent pathways. EMT is an important profibrotic process and a&#xD;
      surrogate marker of native and transplant kidney fibrosis. TGF-beta1 is the primary cytokine&#xD;
      that initiates and maintains EMT by activating signaling pathways and transcriptional&#xD;
      regulators such as Smad 2/3 molecules. During EMT, tubular epithelial cells are transformed&#xD;
      into myofibroblasts through a stepwise process involving loss of cell-cell adhesion molecules&#xD;
      (e.g. E-cadherin) and de novo expression of mesenchymal markers (e.g. alpha-SMA). These&#xD;
      events are followed by tubular basement membrane disruption, cell migration and fibroblast&#xD;
      invasion in the interstitium with production of profibrotic molecules including collagen and&#xD;
      fibronectin. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate CNIinduced EMT&#xD;
      and fibrosis will pave the way for the development of antifibrotic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective evaluation of renal fibrosis in vivo is a key step in this direction. This was&#xD;
      recently achieved by quantitative assessment of renal allograft fibrosis using computerized&#xD;
      digital analyses of Sirius Red. These studies showed that fibrosis was a prognostic indicator&#xD;
      of long-term kidney allograft function and loss. However, the role of this technology in&#xD;
      predicting outcomes in patients with chronic CNI toxicity is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNIs and Renal Hypoxia. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic tubulointerstitial&#xD;
      hypoxia is a final common pathway to end-stage renal disease. CNIs result in decreased nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO) production and bioavailability, thereby leading to decreased vasodilation and&#xD;
      unopposed vasoconstriction and hypoxia. In the chronic setting, CNI-mediated arteriolopathy&#xD;
      and narrowing of the arteriolar lumen contributes to the development of striped interstitial&#xD;
      fibrosis, loss of peritubular capillaries, tubular atrophy and glomerular sclerosis. In turn,&#xD;
      hypoxia of the tubulointerstitial compartment may lead to the formation of free radicals or&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing cellular injury and death, promoting EMT and renal&#xD;
      fibrosis, setting in train a vicious cycle that will end in end-stage renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that result in CNI-induced&#xD;
      renal hypoxia would lead to the development of diagnostic and treatment strategies that delay&#xD;
      or prevent CNI-induced renal fibrosis. A major limitation of studies addressing intrarenal&#xD;
      oxygenation is the lack of noninvasive technologies to quantitate and monitor the&#xD;
      bioavailability of oxygen in the kidney. Blood oxygen level-dependent MRI or BOLD MRI is an&#xD;
      innovative imaging method that uses deoxyhemoglobin as an endogenous contrast agent to&#xD;
      determine tissue oxygen bioavailability. The relationship between paramagnetic&#xD;
      deoxyhemoglobin and T2 relaxation was first demonstrated in 1982. This technique was recently&#xD;
      used, including by our group, to assess intra-renal oxygen bioavailability in patients with&#xD;
      native and transplant kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now propose to use this technology for the monitoring of intrarenal oxygenation in&#xD;
      patients with chronic CNI toxicity. We further suggest combining BOLD MRI with molecular&#xD;
      assessment of renal hypoxia. Hypoxia Inducible Factor one alpha is an oxygen response system&#xD;
      that has recently been used as a molecular marker of renal hypoxia. HIF molecules are&#xD;
      regulated at the protein level by oxygen-dependent enzymes and therefore allow for tissue&#xD;
      hypoxia detection. In the kidney allograft for example, the strong correlation between&#xD;
      HIF-1alpha staining and clinical/subclinical rejection suggests that hypoxia is involved in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of the immune-mediated renal injury and that HIF-1 alpha&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry could enhance the specific diagnosis of acute rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pimonidazole is also a molecular biomarker of hypoxia that once delivered in vivo, binds to&#xD;
      thiol groups at oxygen tensions below 10 mmHg and is visualized with commercially available&#xD;
      antipimonidazole antibodies. It is a small, effective and nontoxic radiosensitizer used as a&#xD;
      hypoxia marker for human squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix, head, and neck. In the&#xD;
      kidney, pimonidazole staining has been used to examine tissue hypoxia in experimental models&#xD;
      of chronic renal disease and acute CNI nephrotoxicity. The role of BOLD MRI, HIF-1 alpha and&#xD;
      pimonidazole in evaluating the mechanisms of chronic CNI-induced hypoxia has not been&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNIs and Nox2. CsA is a pro-oxidant molecule as supported by experimental studies suggesting&#xD;
      that vitamin E inhibits CsA-induced lipid peroxidation and renal damage. Similarly, catalase,&#xD;
      an enzyme that specifically breaks down the reactive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into H2O and O2&#xD;
      and acts as a scavenger of ROS, reduced CsA-associated renal tubular epithelial cell&#xD;
      senescence. In addition, rat proximal tubular epithelial cells exposed to CsA accumulate&#xD;
      intracellular ROS and lipid peroxidation products, along with an altered glutathione redox&#xD;
      state. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CNI-induced generation of ROS remain&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originally named gp91phox, Nox2 is the classical phagocytic NADPH oxidase, an enzyme that is&#xD;
      naturally involved in the immune response including the &quot;oxidative burst&quot;. Nox2 is also the&#xD;
      original identified example of a system that generates ROS as the primary function of the&#xD;
      enzyme and not as a byproduct like the mitochondrion or peroxisomes. It is one of the seven&#xD;
      currently known Nox isoforms, is constitutively associated with the transmembrane stabilizing&#xD;
      protein p22phox and requires the recruitment of cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and&#xD;
      p40phox for function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, CNIs, the backbone of anti-rejection therapies are also profibrotic molecules,&#xD;
      making it difficult to effectively manage immunosuppression and long-term outcomes. We&#xD;
      outline research studies that rigorously assess the role of Nox2 in CNI-induced renal&#xD;
      fibrosis. In addition, we propose contemporary and complementary clinical and translational&#xD;
      strategies to examine the molecular mechanisms that regulate Nox2 activity during&#xD;
      CNI-mediated fibrogenesis. If successful, the results of our studies will provide a&#xD;
      significant step forward in the design of new diagnostic, monitoring and treatment options&#xD;
      aimed to offset the deleterious effects of immunosuppressant therapy and improve long-term&#xD;
      kidney outcomes in organ transplantation.&#xD;
