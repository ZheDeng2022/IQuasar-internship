      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The immune system contains several different types of cells in the blood and other parts of&#xD;
      the body. The body can fight infections well with the right balance of these cell types. The&#xD;
      wrong balance of cell types may cause diseases, such as allergies or asthma. The COX-2 gene&#xD;
      may help decide the balance of cell types that the body makes as part of the immune system.&#xD;
      It may also play a role in certain immune system diseases. Researchers want to see how COX-2&#xD;
      affects the cells in the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how the COX-2 gene works in the body s immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 years of age and above who are part of the Environmental Polymorphisms&#xD;
      Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have one study visit at the National Institutes of Health. They will&#xD;
           collect a urine sample at home on the morning of the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will provide a blood&#xD;
           sample. They will also give researchers the urine sample they collected that morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, controlled study designed to investigate the association of single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) gene, also called&#xD;
      prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase 2 (PTGS2), on T-cell differentiation and function.&#xD;
      Specifically, the impact of the promoter-region SNP 765G&gt;C (rs20417) and the 3 untranslated&#xD;
      region (UTR) SNP 8473T&gt;C (rs5275) on T helper cell (Th) 2, Th9, and Th17 differentiation and&#xD;
      function will be examined. Non-Hispanic, White or Black/African American, non-pregnant&#xD;
      adults, aged 18-65 years, who are wild type (WT), with respect to both the 765G&gt;C and 8473T&gt;C&#xD;
      SNPs, WT with respect to 765G&gt;C and homozygous for 8473T&gt;C, and homozygous for both 765G&gt;C&#xD;
      and 8473T&gt;C will be recruited into a total of three genotype groups. Potential participants&#xD;
      will be identified from the Environmental Polymorphisms Registry, contacted by recruitment&#xD;
      letter and pre-screened for eligibility. Pre-screened individuals will provide verbal consent&#xD;
      to withhold certadata analysis, a urine collection cup, and pre-visit instructions.&#xD;
      Participants will attend a single study visit that will take place at the National Institute&#xD;
      of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Clinical Research Unit (CRU). During this visit,&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained, and there will be a final screening and&#xD;
      eligibility determination, medical history review, vital signs, physical examination and&#xD;
      blood and urine samples will be collected. From peripheral blood, lymphocyte subsets,&#xD;
      prostaglandin levels, and cytokine levels will be determined; stable prostaglandin&#xD;
      metabolites, creatinine, total protein and albumin will be measured in urine. Lymphocytes&#xD;
      will be isolated from peripheral blood for ex vivo analyses. Demographic characteristics&#xD;
      (i.e., age) will be compared between the groups, and when possible, recruitment will be&#xD;
      targeted to achieve an approximate match of race and gender across the groups. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to determine whether the 765G&gt;C or 8473T&gt;C SNPs exhibit altered&#xD;
      Th2, Th9 and Th17 cell differentiation by examining lymphocyte subsets in vivo. The study&#xD;
      will also examine the impact of these two SNPs on circulating Th2/Th9/Th17 cytokine levels&#xD;
      and prostaglandins in vivo, on differentiation of naive CD4+T-cells to Th cell subsets in&#xD;
      vitro, and on lymphocyte production of cytokines and prostaglandins in vitro.&#xD;
