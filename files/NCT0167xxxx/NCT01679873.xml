      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of reporting, in abstracts of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials, 1) the funding sources and 2) the conflicts of interest (COIs)&#xD;
      of the authors on General Practitioners' confidence in the abstracts' conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized Controlled Trial in 3 arms. Participants: General Practitioners (GP). They&#xD;
      will be recruited among residents from the Primary Care department of the Paris Descartes&#xD;
      University and among a GP network who agreed to participate to research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation of participants will be done by a computerized randomization list, the&#xD;
      sequence will be created by an independent statistician with a ratio 1: 1: 1. Participants&#xD;
      will be blind of the hypothesis and of the randomization. Allocation concealment will be&#xD;
      provided because only the statistician will have access to the randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Three interventions will be assessed corresponding to three different types of&#xD;
      abstracts: 1) abstracts not reporting neither the funding sources neither COIs of authors, 2)&#xD;
      abstracts reporting funding sources and 3) abstracts reporting funding sources and COIs of&#xD;
      authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of abstracts will be selected from published randomized trials, testing superiority,&#xD;
      assessing pharmacological treatment, in the field of Primary Care and General Practice and&#xD;
      having a conclusion in favor of the beneficial effect of experimental treatment in terms of&#xD;
      tolerance and / or efficacy. They will then be standardized and modified to obtain three&#xD;
      types of abstracts: 1) with funding sources, 2) with funding sources and COIs and 3) without&#xD;
      either source of funding or COIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to assess one abstract of their randomization arm. Outcome: The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be the GPs' confidence in conclusions. The secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      the quality perception of the study and the interpretation of the benefit of experimental&#xD;
      treatment. Responses will be ranged by a 10-point numeric scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential interests: This study takes place in the field of Primary Care. We believe that&#xD;
      better understandings of impact of funding sources and conflicts of interests are necessary&#xD;
      to allow more transparency in medical research and in his translation into medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size expected: 354 participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dissemination of knowledge and research results is an essential step in the practice of&#xD;
      Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) (1).With the growing number of publications, a lack of&#xD;
      accessibility, and the need for timely messages among information resources larger and&#xD;
      larger, the General Practitioners (GP) often rely on abstracts of published trials (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methodological studies have shown an association between mode of financing, including&#xD;
      industry funding, and how the results and conclusions of published trials are reported&#xD;
      (3-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve transparency, the CONSORT recommends to report funding sources (15) in abstracts&#xD;
      of randomized trials, which is not always followed. Efforts are also made to report conflicts&#xD;
      of interest of authors (COIs). In its version in July 2010, the International Committee of&#xD;
      Medical Journal Editors Uniform Disclosure Form for Potential Conflicts of Interest (ICMJE)&#xD;
      recommends that editors ask to all authors who submit a manuscript, to complete the ICMJE&#xD;
      statement (16,17). Despite this, understanding the complexity and severity of conflicts of&#xD;
      interest is not yet fully taken into account by all the guidelines (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was further demonstrated that the interpretation of results by physicians varies with&#xD;
      their mode of presentation (19-22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not know to what extent the knowledge of funding sources and COIs may&#xD;
      influence the interpretation of findings by the reader. The investigators are therefore&#xD;
      interested in the impact of the presence of these elements in abstracts of published trials&#xD;
      on GPs' confidence in the conclusions presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of reporting, in abstracts of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, 1) the funding sources and 2) the conflicts of interest (COIs) of the&#xD;
      authors on General Practitioners' confidence in the abstracts' conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan a 3 arms randomized parallel-group, conducted among GPs residents in&#xD;
      Primary care and planned according to the CONSORT 2010 guidelines (23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For allocation of the participants, a computer-generated list of random numbers will be used.&#xD;
      Randomization sequence will be created by an independent statistician with R project with&#xD;
      1:1:1 ratio using random block sizes of 2, 4, and 6. The statistician will upload the&#xD;
      randomization list on a secure internet system to assure allocation concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs will be invited by e-mail to participate to this study. They will log on a secure&#xD;
      internet system that will randomize the GP in 3 different arms: 1) abstracts not reporting&#xD;
      neither funding neither COIs, 2) abstract reporting funding source and 3) abstract with&#xD;
      funding and COIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding participants is not possible in this study. To reduce the risk of bias, physicians&#xD;
      will not be informed of the objectives of the study (ie study of the impact of the&#xD;
      presentation of funding sources and COIS), or the existence of randomization. They will blind&#xD;
      of the working hypotheses of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs will be recruited among a network of GPs in France: this network consists of GPs who&#xD;
      agreed to participate in research studies. It brings together members from the Collège&#xD;
      Nationale des Généralistes Enseignants (CNGE) and GPs recruited by regional relays&#xD;
      represented by 10 physicians members of primary Care departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three interventions will be evaluated corresponding to 3 different types of abstracts: 1)&#xD;
      abstracts not reporting the sources of financing or the COIs, 2) abstracts reporting the&#xD;
      sources of funding as recommended by CONSORT for abstracts and 3) abstracts related funding&#xD;
      sources and COIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstracts identification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow reproducibility and generalization of our results, abstracts will be selected from&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in field of Primary Care. The investigators&#xD;
      chose to select abstracts of RCTs because their contents are standardized because of the&#xD;
      CONSORT guidelines. The investigators also chose to retain only the positive trials&#xD;
      (conclusion in favor of the beneficial effect of experimental treatment in terms of tolerance&#xD;
      and / or efficacy) to have a uniform interpretation of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify abstracts, the investigators will search in Medline via PubMed for all indexed&#xD;
      abstracts with using limits for randomized controlled trials, in English, published from the&#xD;
      1srt January 2010 to the 31 December 2010, in the Core Clinical Journal. The Core Clinical&#xD;
      Journal was chosen to ensure a good quality of trials. The investigators restricted the&#xD;
      search to the year 2010 to ensure that physicians do not remember the original abstract and&#xD;
      thus preserve the blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria will be: randomized controlled trials, testing superiority,&#xD;
      assessing pharmaceutical intervention (drugs) in the field of Primary Care (i.e. trials&#xD;
      assessing treatments that may be prescribed by a GP, and those assessing treatments being&#xD;
      prescribed in pathologies supported jointly between specialist and GP.), with a positive&#xD;
      conclusion and funded only by the pharmaceutical industry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be: the non-pharmaceutical interventions (eg medical devices, patient&#xD;
      education, etc..), equivalence or noninferiority trials, safety trials, trials assessing&#xD;
      different pharmacological procedures, abstracts reporting a negative conclusion, not&#xD;
      reporting or reporting the results in an ambiguous conclusion (successful trial but related&#xD;
      the need for other studies), intermediate publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construction of the modified Abstracts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All abstracts will be standardized: the journal, date and registration number of&#xD;
      ClinicalTrial.gov will be deleted. Authors' names will be replaced by generic names. A list&#xD;
      of author names will be determined by drawing 20 names among the 200 names most common in the&#xD;
      UK and will be identical for all abstracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments will be referred to by &quot;experimental treatment A&quot; or &quot;treatment B&quot; in the&#xD;
      abstract and in the title. The names of studies as an acronym will be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, abstracts will be translated into French.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three types of abstracts will be presented as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Abstracts not reporting funding or COIs If these items are reported in the original&#xD;
           abstract, they will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Abstracts reporting funding Funding sources will be searched in abstract reporting by&#xD;
           the editors and in the full text. If funding sources are not found, abstract won't be&#xD;
           retained. Original funding will be reported by the name of pharmaceutical industry, at&#xD;
           the end of the abstract, after conclusion, under the heading &quot;FUNDING&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abstracts reporting funding and COIs Funding sources will be reported as presented&#xD;
           previously. COIs will be searched in abstract reporting by the editors and in the full&#xD;
           text. If they are not found, abstract won't be retained. The COIs will then be ranked&#xD;
           (1) no COIs, (2) authors employed by industry and (3) authors who have a financial&#xD;
           relationship with industry. Financial ties regroup together all COIs other than being&#xD;
           employed: fees, travel costs, as these are to be returned in a personal or institution&#xD;
           with which the author works, stock options, link with a family member employed by the&#xD;
           industry, etc.. For each abstract, the investigators will retain the number of authors&#xD;
           having a conflict. The COIs will be given in the modified abstract by taking the&#xD;
           initials of the authors and their type of COIs, presented in two categories: &quot;financial&#xD;
           or other relationship&quot; and &quot;being employee&quot; under the heading &quot;CONFLICT OF INTEREST&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that the investigators will consider in the same way &quot;no conflict of interest&quot; and the&#xD;
      authors who do not report their COIs. We won't report it in the abstract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to participate in a study evaluating the interpretation of&#xD;
      abstracts of RCTs by e-mail (with 3 reminders) or by an investigator during the national&#xD;
      annual medical congress for general practice. They will be informed that their participation&#xD;
      will take less than 5 minutes. After accepting, physicians will complete a questionnaire to&#xD;
      collect their characteristics: date of birth, sex, status (resident or GP). Then they will be&#xD;
      randomized and start immediately read the abstract and questionnaire. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to evaluate only a abstract in his arm of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimate that 75 abstracts will be available to be assessed. Three main&#xD;
      comparisons will be made: a comparison with the placebo group related funding sources, the&#xD;
      comparison with the placebo group related funding sources and COIS and finally the comparison&#xD;
      group of related funding sources with the related funding sources and COIS. With a&#xD;
      significance level of 1.67% fixed for each of the three comparisons 2-2 (Bonferonni&#xD;
      correction to maintain an overall significance level of 5%), it is necessary to have about&#xD;
      118 quotations in each arm to demonstrate an effect size equal to 0.5 on the numeric scale&#xD;
      with a power of 90% for each comparison 2-2. As it is expected that each physician read a&#xD;
      single abstract, it is necessary to include 118 physicians per arm (354 in total, each&#xD;
      abstract is read 4.7 times on average (4 or 5 times in practice)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be done with the software R project, in intention to treat. A description&#xD;
      of the characteristics of physicians will be made initially. Qualitative variables will be&#xD;
      described by their numbers, percentage and missing data by mode of response and quantitative&#xD;
      variables by their rate, mean, standard deviation. In case of quantitative variables with&#xD;
      asymmetric behavior, they will be presented with their median and interquartile range (25th&#xD;
      percentile-75th percentile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be done on mean of GPs' confidence and the 3 possible comparisons&#xD;
      will be made. The primary endpoint is quantitative, the test used for comparisons 2to 2 will&#xD;
      be the non-parametric Mann Whitney 1.7% threshold. The same analysis is repeated for the&#xD;
      secondary endpoints quantitative.&#xD;
