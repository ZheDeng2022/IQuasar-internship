  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of total knee arthroplasty depends on a number of factors including pre-operative&#xD;
      range of movement, obesity, medical comorbidities, prosthesis design, preparation and&#xD;
      implantation of the prosthesis, soft tissue balancing, as well as implants alignment. Optimal&#xD;
      placement of the implants within 3° of the mechanical axis of the lower limb has been proven&#xD;
      to reduce wear and early implant failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to conventional techniques, computer-Aided Navigation total knee arthroplasty has&#xD;
      been widely used in the last decade and have been proven to improve the accuracy of&#xD;
      prosthesis placement and lower limb alignment by reducing the number of outliers with more&#xD;
      than 3° deviation from the mechanical axis. However, its use also involves a steep learning&#xD;
      curve, high initial capital cost and longer duration of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional computer-navigated TKA using optical tracking systems also requires fixation of&#xD;
      the femoral and tibial reference arrays to bone using anchoring pins. Complications reported&#xD;
      with the use of these pins include either femoral or tibial fracture, pin site pain, pin site&#xD;
      infection and osteomyelitis. The investigators study aims to investigate the accuracy of a&#xD;
      new pinless navigation system for TKA that will avoid these complications.&#xD;

      The duration of surgery and length of hospital stay were recorded for all patients. Three&#xD;
      radiographic measurements were recorded on the coronal films: 1) Hip-Knee-Ankle Angle (HKA),&#xD;
      the angle formed by the mechanical axis of the femur (line between the centre of the femoral&#xD;
      head and the centre of the knee) and the mechanical axis of the tibia (line between the&#xD;
      centre of the talus and the centre of the knee); 2) Coronal Femoral-Component Angle (CFA),&#xD;
      the angle formed by the femoral component and the mechanical axis of the femur; 3) Coronal&#xD;
      Tibia-Component Angle (CTA), the angle formed by the tibia base plate and the mechanical axis&#xD;
      of the tibia. The post-operative radiographic measurements were compared with the&#xD;
      intra-operative readings from the pinless navigation system. The accepted values used in our&#xD;
      study for normal alignment were: 1) 0° ± 3° varus/valgus for HKA; 2) perpendicular (± 3°) to&#xD;
      the mechanical axis of the femur; 3) perpendicular (± 3°) to the mechanical axis of the&#xD;
      tibia.&#xD;
