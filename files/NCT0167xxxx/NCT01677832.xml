  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with ADHD are impulsive and have difficulties in regulating their&#xD;
      behaviors. It has been suggested that a core deficit in inhibitory control may account for&#xD;
      dysfunctional behaviors associated with this disorder. Previous research has shown that&#xD;
      medication and the self-regulation strategy of making implementation intentions (i.e.,&#xD;
      if-then plans) are effective in enhancing children's inhibitory control, which is reflected&#xD;
      in the behavioral as well as electrophysiological (e.g., Electroencephalogram; EEG) data on a&#xD;
      Go/NoGo task in children with ADHD. As suggested by earlier research, however, forming&#xD;
      implementation intentions may have different effects on people who are embedded in different&#xD;
      cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of medication and the self-regulation&#xD;
      of forming implementation intentions by assessing the behavioral performance and&#xD;
      corresponding brain activity during a Go/NoGo task in children and adolescents with and&#xD;
      without ADHD under two different cultural contexts. Further, this study also aims at&#xD;
      investigating the potential moderating effects of culture on making if-then plans. More&#xD;
      important, as we know, this will be the first study to compare the effectiveness of forming&#xD;
      implementation intentions on children and adolescents with ADHD in a cross-cultural way,&#xD;
      which is meaningful for researchers to explore the degree of its application and expected to&#xD;
      provide clinical psychologists an alternative perspective for ADHD treatment in the near&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

      For a deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying the effects of MPH and implementation&#xD;
      intentions, neurophysiological data (with a special interest on the P300 component) during a&#xD;
      Go/NoGo task will be assessed additionally to the behavioral performance (i.e., response&#xD;
      times and error rates). Meanwhile, the information may contribute to a better understanding&#xD;
      of a potential influence of culture on the effect of implementation intentions. The effect&#xD;
      may be equally effective in the cultures, but the underlying processes might still differ. On&#xD;
      the other hand, differences between the two cultural groups might be explained by different&#xD;
      neurophysiological activity during the tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two primary research questions arise: (1) Are MPH and implementation intentions (i.e.,&#xD;
      if-then plans) effective in enhancing the performance of executive function tasks measured by&#xD;
      the Go/NoGo task in children and adolescents with ADHD compared with those without ADHD&#xD;
      within each culture? (2) Does culture play a role in moderating the effect of implementation&#xD;
      intentions on executive function tasks in children and adolescents with ADHD, respectively?&#xD;
      Based on the research questions, two hypotheses are formulated. First, after the treatment of&#xD;
      MPH and the self-regulation strategy of forming implementation intentions, it would result in&#xD;
      less inhibition errors and more increased amplitudes of NoGo P300 and NoGominusGo P300 in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with ADHD. Second, participants with ADHD in Taiwan may benefit more&#xD;
      from the self-regulation strategy, which is reflected in more increased amplitudes of NoGo&#xD;
      P300 and NoGominusGo P300 than found in their counterparts in Germany. However, since this is&#xD;
      the first study to compare the effects of forming implementation intentions in a&#xD;
      cross-cultural way, this latter analysis is more exploratory.&#xD;

        Participants will be recruited respectively in Germany and Taiwan using the same&#xD;
        standardized procedures according to the protocol. Children and adolescents with and&#xD;
        without ADHD between the ages 10 to 14, with an IQ full score ≥ 80, will participate in&#xD;
        this study. Participants with ADHD have to meet the criteria of ICD-10 (WHO, 1991) before&#xD;
        enrolment. They are diagnosed with ADHD combined subtype and have no comorbid disorders.&#xD;
        None of the controls are clinically diagnosed with any disorders and take any medication.&#xD;
        Both samples should be matched according to the variables: gender, IQ, and socio-economic&#xD;
        status (SES).&#xD;
