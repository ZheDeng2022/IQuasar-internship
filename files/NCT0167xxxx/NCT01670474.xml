      Surface thrombogenicity of standard double lumen catheters (stDLC) and surface modified&#xD;
      film-coated domain structured double lumen catheters (fcDLC) consisting of a novel reactive&#xD;
      polyurethane copolymer coating showed that in vitro measured surface thrombogenicity was&#xD;
      reduced in the modified catheter compared with standard catheter. The clinical investigation&#xD;
      revealed that both number of days before catheter removal according to clinical requirements&#xD;
      and number of treatments per catheter were significantly higher with the modified catheter as&#xD;
      compared with the standard catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been used primarily to treat catheter&#xD;
      thrombosis. The relatively high cost of rt-PA and its theoretical potential to cause&#xD;
      bleeding, as well as the morbidity and mortality associated with catheter malfunction and&#xD;
      infection, justify the need for more definitive evidence of the efficacy of rt-PA as a&#xD;
      locking solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study aims to evaluate the impact of rt-PA locking in long-term Hemodialysis (HD) uncuffed&#xD;
      catheters survival.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The solution instilled into the central venous catheter lumens after each HD session and left&#xD;
      in the catheter until the next session (catheter locking solution) is used to prevent&#xD;
      thrombosis during the period between HD sessions and may also prevent catheter-related&#xD;
      infection. However, evidence supporting the use of various locking solutions to achieve these&#xD;
      objectives is limited. Heparin has been the traditional locking solution. Several small&#xD;
      studies have assessed whether citrate and heparin are equally efficacious for maintaining&#xD;
      catheter patency but the interpretation of the results was limited because the studies had a&#xD;
      short follow-up period and included both uncuffed and cuffed central venous catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombosis is a major cause of HD catheter dysfunction, and this problem is rectified by the&#xD;
      use of thrombolytic agents, invasive procedures for declotting, or catheter replacement. A&#xD;
      thrombus at the tip of the catheter or a fibrin sheath around it may resist local&#xD;
      thrombolysis if it is not reached by sufficient concentrations of the drug. Urokinase has&#xD;
      traditionally been used as the thrombolytic agent for HD vascular access declotting, and&#xD;
      success rates for declotting vary from 55% to 85%. However, successful treatment of occluded&#xD;
      central venous catheter (non HD) with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or&#xD;
      alteplase was recently achieved in more than 1,000 patients with success (function restored&#xD;
      in 798 patients [75.0%; 95% CI: 72.3 to 77.6%]). Serious adverse events monitored within 30&#xD;
      days was very rare and efficacy was independent of age, sex, body weight, and catheter type.&#xD;
