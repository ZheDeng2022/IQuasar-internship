  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study of the combination of three drugs: sirolimus, cyclophosphamide, and&#xD;
      topotecan. This is the first study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the&#xD;
      combination of oral sirolimus, oral cyclophosphamide and oral topotecan in pediatric and&#xD;
      young adult patients with relapsed and refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase I study, the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus will be administered in combination with&#xD;
      oral cyclophosphamide and oral topotecan to children with relapsed or refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors. The primary aim of this study is to recommend a phase II dose schedule and describe&#xD;
      the toxicity of this combination. Myelosuppression will be a targeted toxicity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of cyclophosphamide and topotecan is well-tolerated and provides an oral&#xD;
      therapy option for heavily pre-treated patients. The toxicity profile and activity level&#xD;
      suggest that this combination will provide a useful platform onto which novel compounds may&#xD;
      be added. Sirolimus has been shown to demonstrate single-agent activity in preclinical models&#xD;
      of rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and&#xD;
      osteosarcoma. Sirolimus has also been shown to have additive effects in pre-clinical models&#xD;
      of solid tumors when combined with cyclophosphamide. This trial therefore will evaluate the&#xD;
      combination of sirolimus with cyclophosphamide and topotecan. Pharmacokinetic studies of&#xD;
      sirolimus as well as pharmacodynamic studies to assess antiangiogensis and inhibition of the&#xD;
      mTOR pathway will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be accrued to dose levels in cohorts of 3 using a 3 + 3 design. Patients will&#xD;
      initially be enrolled on dose level 1. Patients will receive daily oral sirolimus and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide on days 1 - 21 in a 28 day cycle. This will be combined with oral topotecan&#xD;
      given on days 1 - 14. Sirolimus will be dosed based on steady-state plasma trough&#xD;
      concentrations with a goal level in dose level 1 of 3-7.9 ng/ML and goal levels in subsequent&#xD;
      dose levels of 8-12.0 ng/ML. Dosing of cyclophosphamide and topotecan will be 25 mg/m2/dose&#xD;
      and 0.8 mg/ m2 /dose respectively for dose levels 1 and 2. Level 3 dosing will escalate&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide to 50 mg/ m2/dose. If level 1 dosing is not tolerated, patients will then be&#xD;
      enrolled in a level -1 cohort with cyclophosphamide and sirolimus administered only on days 1&#xD;
      - 14. If level -1 is not tolerated, patients will be enrolled in level -2 with topotecan&#xD;
      administration limited to days 1 - 7.&#xD;

    <description>Define the dose limiting toxicities to recommend a Phase 2 trough concentration of sirolimus when administered on a protracted schedule in combination with oral topotecan and oral cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
Evaluations done during first Cycle to assess/define DLT:&#xD;
Physical exams, vitals, blood tests: CBC, CMB, coagulation-PT, LDH, D-dimer, peripheral smear, urine glucose, performance evaluations.&#xD;
All toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination), severity (by NCI CTCAE v 4.0), and attribution. The MTD is the highest dose level tested at which 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug(s) with at least 2/3 or 2/6 patients encountering DLT at the next higher dose. If 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT at the highest dose level (dose level 3), then that dose level will be called the MTD.</description>
