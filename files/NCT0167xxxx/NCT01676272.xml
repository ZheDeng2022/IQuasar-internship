      Despite the widespread use of advanced biologics for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers,&#xD;
      data comparing one type of modality to another are scarce. This investigation is a&#xD;
      prospective randomized study comparing a bioengineered skin substitute to a human skin&#xD;
      allograft.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal in treating a DFU is to obtain wound closure. Healing can be a lengthy and&#xD;
      painful process for ulcers of diabetic etiology. Healing is often further complicated in&#xD;
      subjects with diabetes by vascular compromise and peripheral ischemia, renal insufficiency&#xD;
      and diminution of inflammatory responses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two products to be compared in this study are both commonly used for the treatment of&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers. DermaGraft is considered a medical device by the FDA, and was cleared&#xD;
      for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in 1997. It is a staple for the treatment of&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers, and is widely used throughout the United States. It is composed of an&#xD;
      absorbable substrate that has been seeded with living human fibroblasts. Once formed, the&#xD;
      graft is cryopreserved until it reaches the clinic, where it is defrosted and applied to the&#xD;
      wound surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TheraSkin is composed of a split thickness skin graft harvested within 24 hours post-mortem,&#xD;
      from an organ donor who has cleared the standard safety screenings. It is classified by the&#xD;
      FDA as a donated tissue. Once harvested, the graft is sanitized according to FDA&#xD;
      specifications, and cryopreserved, until it is delivered to the clinic for application to the&#xD;
      foot ulcer. It is also a widely used treatment for diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
