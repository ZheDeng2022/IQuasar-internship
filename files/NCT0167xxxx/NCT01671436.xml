    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a serious, costly and highly prevalent condition. However,&#xD;
      currently available treatment options have limited efficacy. The aim of this pilot study is&#xD;
      to determine whether patients suffering from MDD who have not responded to at least one&#xD;
      antidepressant trial may actively engage in a novel group therapy, Central Meditation and&#xD;
      Imagery Therapy (CMIT). Preliminary results with individual patients suggest that CMIT&#xD;
      techniques may have benefit for major depression. The purpose of this trial is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of a group form of CMIT for the treatment of major depression. The trial will&#xD;
      also seek to identify neurophysiological and cardiovascular predictors of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 10 subjects with major depressive disorder will receive antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment augmentation with group meditation and mental imagery therapy for a total of 12&#xD;
      weeks, as well as daily meditation practice. Group sessions will also involve gentle yogic&#xD;
      stretches. The subjects will be limited to those who remain depressed despite at least one&#xD;
      trial of antidepressant medication. Changes in brain activity and heart rate variability will&#xD;
      be measured at three time points utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) and pulse monitors.&#xD;
      Depression symptoms will be measured at several time points using questionnaires and&#xD;
      objective measures. Participation will require a total of 15 visits for weekly therapy and&#xD;
      the measurements. Two-month follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to the subjects after&#xD;
      study end to assess durability of any improvements in depressive symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention involved Central Meditation, may be characterized by a voluntary, regulated attentional set towards a specific stimulus or set of stimuli and visualization exercises utilized within CMIT, which primarily involves two types of thought experiments: 1) creating mental models of how a person fits into the larger world and universe according to evolutionary biology and modern cosmology, in order to gain a larger perspective on emotions and thought patterns, and 2) backcasting, the generation of a desirable future coupled with mental time travel back to the present to determine how to create that future with present-day actions.</description>
