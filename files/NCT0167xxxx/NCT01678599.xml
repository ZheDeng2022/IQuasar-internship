      The purpose of this study is to estimate the gain in sensitivity of several multiple-sample&#xD;
      strategies of PCR samples with respect to the current standard (single sample of 10 ml) to&#xD;
      detect Chagas chronic stage at baseline and to identify the optimal sampling strategy based&#xD;
      on the sensitivity, cost,the completeness of sampling and the acceptability for study&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Chagas Disease (CD) ranks among the world's most neglected diseases. In Latin America, 21&#xD;
      countries are endemic for CD with an estimated 108 million people at risk of contracting the&#xD;
      disease. Estimates from the 1980s indicated that some 16 -18 million individuals were&#xD;
      infected. In the 1990s, after a series of multinational control initiatives, estimates of the&#xD;
      number of infected people were revised to 9.8 million in 2001. The estimated burden of&#xD;
      disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) declined from 2.7 million in 1990&#xD;
      to 586,000 in 2001. Recent estimates from Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), 2006&#xD;
      indicate 7.54 million infected people and 55,185 new cases per year. CD,also known as&#xD;
      American trypanosomiasis,is a zoonotic disease caused by the protozoan hemoflagellate&#xD;
      Trypanosoma cruzi that is mainly transmitted by large, blood-sucking, reduviid bugs of the&#xD;
      subfamily Triatominae. Clinically, human CD has two phases, acute and chronic. The acute&#xD;
      phase, which lasts a few weeks, is a febrile and toxemic illness, during which the parasite&#xD;
      can be detected by direct examination of fresh blood. In the chronic phase, the diagnosis&#xD;
      depends on hemocultures of varying degree of sensitivities, xenodiagnosis, PCR or detecting&#xD;
      IgG antibodies. Untreated, the chronic phase continues for the rest of a person's life. It&#xD;
      begins with no specific symptoms or clinical manifestations for a period of approximately 10&#xD;
      or 15 years, the &quot;indeterminate form&quot; of the disease. About 20 to 50% of chronic Chagas&#xD;
      patients over the ensuing years, depending on the endemic area analyzed, will develop&#xD;
      involvement of the heart or gastrointestinal tract. Current therapy for CD is limited to two&#xD;
      nitroheterocyclic drugs, Nifurtimox and Benznidazole, the later being the most widely used&#xD;
      drug for Chagas disease treatment. The indications for treatment are acute disease (including&#xD;
      congenital infection), and early chronic disease (that is, in children &lt; 15 years of age and&#xD;
      patients in the early phase of chronic infection), plus reactivation of the infection by&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late chronic phase is treated at the clinician's discretion. In a hierarchy of need, it has&#xD;
      been argued that patients in the indeterminate phase of the disease would represent the main&#xD;
      target population for evaluation of new treatments. With decreasing incidence of the disease,&#xD;
      even in countries with the highest number of new cases, the highest disease burden is among&#xD;
      patients in the asymptomatic, chronic phase of the disease. Bolivia, for example, has at&#xD;
      least 200,000 children under the age of 15 years and 1 million adults infected with T. cruzi,&#xD;
      for an estimated total of 700,000 people with the indeterminate form or asymptomatic, chronic&#xD;
      phase. The development of effective and affordable treatment for the millions of people with&#xD;
      ongoing infections and the prevention of chronic complications is recognized as a key disease&#xD;
      control priority in CD. The evaluation of cure is considered the most complex aspect of&#xD;
      treatment in CD, leading to often diverse and controversial results. The term parasitological&#xD;
      cure is of difficult interpretation and the evaluation challenging, in light of the need for&#xD;
      total elimination of parasites not only from blood but also from tissue. Clinical cure&#xD;
      demands long-term evaluation and is often of uncertain nature due to the pathogenesis of the&#xD;
      disease, with the action of the parasite, the host response and their consequent clinical&#xD;
      manifestations evolving for long period of times. Over recent years an increasing body of&#xD;
      data has pointed to a strong biological rationale for the use of parasitological outcomes as&#xD;
      surrogate markers for acute and indeterminate Chagas disease. There is increasing evidence of&#xD;
      the role of T. cruzi persistence in the perpetuation of immune response and evolution of the&#xD;
      disease. Also, recent non-randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up have&#xD;
      demonstrated a positive effect from anti-parasitic chemotherapy in patients with chronic CD&#xD;
      and the correlation of these findings with serology results. Therefore, for the purposes of&#xD;
      clinical development and proof-of-concept, it has been suggested that parasitological and&#xD;
      serological tests be used for the assessment of response in both acute and chronic disease. A&#xD;
      negative direct smear at the end of treatment is generally accepted as evidence of response&#xD;
      in acute patients. In chronic disease, serial hemoculture, xenodiagnosis or PCR can be used&#xD;
      to support serological assessment and a positive parasitological result indicates treatment&#xD;
      failure. Hemoculture and xenodiagnosis are techniques that may present low sensitivity in&#xD;
      chronic patients, they require proper resources/infrastructure and very skilful personnel. In&#xD;
      regards to conventional serology, with indeterminate chronic patients, a decrease in antibody&#xD;
      titers may take up to 5 years with seroconversion to negative occurring after 5-10 years. In&#xD;
      consequence, it is proposed that efficacy assessment for clinical studies in indeterminate&#xD;
      disease be done with the use of qualitative and quantitative PCR. However, there has been&#xD;
      significant variability in the clinical sensitivity and specificity of PCR in published&#xD;
      studies, with differences seen across phases of the disease and a number of techniques in use&#xD;
      requiring standardization. In particular, there has been concern regarding the sensitivity of&#xD;
      PCR in chronic Chagas disease due to the low levels of circulating parasites and natural&#xD;
      fluctuations of the parasitaemia. Latest studies have shown a broad dynamic range for PCR use&#xD;
      allowing direct measurements in cases with high parasitic loads such as immunosuppressed&#xD;
      Chagas disease patients and congenitally infected newborns, as well as in cases with low&#xD;
      parasitaemias, such as patients at the indeterminate phase or under etiological treatment.&#xD;
      PCR testing has also been used for early detection of T. cruzi reactivation after heart&#xD;
      transplantation, with documented detection of parasitic load increase, previous to diagnosis&#xD;
      of clinical reactivation. In addition, there are accruing clinical and experimental data&#xD;
      suggesting a degree of correlation between parasitaemia and tissue infection. Another&#xD;
      important advance in recent years has been the TDR sponsored-study for standardization and&#xD;
      laboratory validation of qualitative PCR testing for T. cruzi. Standardized procedures for&#xD;
      qualitative assessment of PCR (standard and real-time PCR) yielding higher analytical&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity, reproducibility, with low levels of intra- and inter-assay&#xD;
      variation and accuracy have been selected. Results from this exercise have been presented in&#xD;
      a meeting in Buenos Aires, Nov 08, and they are expected to be published in the near future.&#xD;
      However, there is limited information on the efficacy of treatment for chronic indeterminate&#xD;
      CD patients, and only a few studies employed PCR to assess parasitological response. A panel&#xD;
      of experts in CD at three meetings hosted by DNDi and the CD protocol development team gave&#xD;
      support to the evaluation of PCR as a marker for parasitological response in indeterminate&#xD;
      chronic disease. During these discussions,there was consensus on the value of using serial&#xD;
      blood collections for qualitative PCR assays in order to increase PCR testing sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data in support of this information are limited to an Argentinean cohort of 41 pregnant women&#xD;
      followed-up with monthly blood collections. In this small group, PCR sensitivity was 60,2%&#xD;
      for a single collection, 74% for 2 blood collections and 80,5% for 3 blood collections (A.&#xD;
      Schijman, manuscript in preparation). In addition, a study from Castro published in 2002&#xD;
      indicated a significant increase from 70.0% to 81.7% in the sensitivity of PCR with the&#xD;
      addition of a second sample (P=0.03). The addition of a third sample led to non-significant&#xD;
      increase in sensitivity to 86.7%. Unfortunately, the sample size was small, there was no&#xD;
      indication of the interval of sampling and the qualitative PCR technique was&#xD;
      non-standardised. During the panel discussions, there was no agreement on the precise&#xD;
      interval for serial sampling, in view of the lack of information in support for a definite&#xD;
      interval for blood sampling to maximize sensitivity. Data obtained with xenodiagnosis suggest&#xD;
      the absence of both circadian rhythm and T. cruzi periodicity with in chronic chagasic&#xD;
      individuals. Therefore, when defining sampling procedures, one would need to balance the gain&#xD;
      on the PCR sensitivity and logistics/feasibility in conducting clinical trials in a field&#xD;
      setting. In order to prepare for future clinical trials on CD, DNDi acknowledges the need to&#xD;
      evaluate and optimize the procedures for PCR implementation as a tool of parasitological&#xD;
      assessment in patients with chronic indeterminate form of CD. Study ethical approval will be&#xD;
      sought from the Médecins Sans Frontières Ethical Review Board and, the Ethical Review Board&#xD;
      from the Colectivo de Estudios Aplicados y Desarollo Social (CEADES), Cochabamba, Bolivia.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study will be submitted and reviewed by the National Chagas Control Program&#xD;
      and the 'Comité de Ética e Investigación' del Ministerio de Salud, Bolivia. This is a&#xD;
      descriptive study aiming to assess whether multiple PCR blood sampling procedures at baseline&#xD;
      can provide higher sensitivity compared to single sampling, as well as their feasibility in a&#xD;
      field setting. Blood sampling for baseline and EOT will be as follows: one initial blood&#xD;
      sample of 10 mL (Sample 1), followed by 1 blood sample of 5mL collected immediately following&#xD;
      (Sample 2); plus one blood sample of 10mL collected 1 week later (Sample 3). Total of 3 blood&#xD;
      samples. At the 6 and 12 months follow-up visits, only the optimal sampling strategy at EOT&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to explore PCR sensitivity according to the number of blood samples, PCR results&#xD;
      will be analyzed as single assays as well as, at the data analysis stage, by combining PCR&#xD;
      results for patients at a given time-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference to be used Current strategy (CS): Sample 1 : Single sample of 10 ml Two major&#xD;
           types of strategies may be developed and need an assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reinforcement Strategy (RS) that consists in adding blood sampling(s) to the current&#xD;
           single-sample approach (volume of 10 ml). Unless additional samplings do not allow the&#xD;
           detection of additional PCR-positive cases (which is unlikely) such strategy will&#xD;
           inevitably be more sensitive than the current one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Substitution Strategy (SS) that consists in replacing the current approach (sample 1 =&#xD;
           10 ml) by a 5 ml sampling (sample 2) and possibly further sampling(s) (sample 3). These&#xD;
           strategies are not necessarily better than the current one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be conducted in rural communities in the municipalities of Aiquile,&#xD;
      Omereque and Pasorapa in the province of Narciso Campero, Bolivia, where Médecins Sans&#xD;
