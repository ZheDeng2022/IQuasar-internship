    <textblock>
      Stroke are the main causes of motor disability among adults and are expected to impose an&#xD;
      increasing social and economic burden for our Country. The impact of stroke on patients is&#xD;
      enormous, with negative ramifications on the persons participation in social, vocational, and&#xD;
      recreational activities. It is the primary cause of long-term disability in these countries.&#xD;
      At the present stage, it is well known that control of balance during upright standing&#xD;
      depends upon the central integration of afferent information from vestibular, somatosensory&#xD;
      (proprioceptive, tactile), and visual systems, which constitute a multilink neural network&#xD;
      for the control of neck, hip, and ankle joints. More recently, it has been studied at the&#xD;
      level of cerebral cortex; vestibular inputs would reach face/neck representation of primary&#xD;
      somatosensory cortex and would be then integrated with visual and somatosensory inputs in&#xD;
      intraparietal, posterior end of the insula and medial superior temporal cortices. Remarkably,&#xD;
      balance impairment and the associated risk of falling represent one of the most prominent and&#xD;
      potentially disabling features in stroke subjects. The specific aims of this project are: to&#xD;
      verify whether the robotics lower limb treatment with body weight support is more effective&#xD;
      than the treadmill treatment in the reduction of motor impairment in Stroke patients, and to&#xD;
      improve the quality of the gait and the endurance and to analyze possible improvements in&#xD;
      terms of physiological biomechanical gait through analysis of spatio-temporal parameters.&#xD;

      Objective: to assess the lower limb recovery after the gait rehabilitation training exercises&#xD;
      in acute and chronic stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project, through a Randomized controlled observer-blind trial aimed at&#xD;
      evaluating the effectiveness of end-effector robot assisted therapy vs the treadmill and&#xD;
      ground treatment in sub-acute and chronic stroke subjects. 90 inpatients and out-patients&#xD;
      with a stroke will be recruited. We will randomize the patients on 3 groups [15 sub-acute&#xD;
      (ischemic and hemorrhagic) stroke patients (after 30Â±7 days from injury) and 15 chronic&#xD;
      (ischemic and hemorrhagic) patients (after 3/6 months days from injury) for all groups]:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. sub-acute and chronic stroke patients robot treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sub-acute and chronic patients treadmill treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. sub-acute and chronic patients ground treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to verify whether the robotics end-effector GEO lower limb treatment with body weight&#xD;
           support is more effective than the treadmill treatment or ground treatment in the&#xD;
           reduction of motor impairment in sub-acute and Chronic stroke patients, and to improve&#xD;
           the quality of the gait and the endurance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to analyse possible improvements in terms of physiological biomechanical gait through&#xD;
           analysis of kinematics , kinetics and EMG evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to analyse possible improvements in terms of reduction of instable posture and&#xD;
           movements, which can represent a reduction of the risk of fall typical of these&#xD;
           subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to evaluate the kinematic, kinetic and EMG quantitative data during selected movements&#xD;
           (gait, posture, ) compared with age matched reference data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to investigate the stability of the effects of robot-assisted treatment at 4/6 months&#xD;
           follow-up in terms of Quality of Life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first goal of this project is to investigate the differences in improvement of the quality&#xD;
      and safety of the gait (motor performance and functional recovery) through kinematic/kinetic&#xD;
      and EMG parameters (Change in Step Length, Change in Gait Velocity and Change in Stride Time&#xD;
      Variability, 3D joints kinematics, ground reaction forces, joint kinetics, muscle&#xD;
      activation,) and traditional clinical scales in sub-acute and chronic stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second goals is aimed at identifying possible advantages in the QoL of patients&#xD;
      undergoing such a kind of in-patients and out-patients rehabilitation treatment and at&#xD;
      investigating novel methods enabling lower limb functional recovery, leading to wide&#xD;
      potential for regaining personal independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third goal is to analyse direct cost savings associated with the use of such&#xD;
      technologies, measured as direct, indirect and intangible costs, through specific HTA&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
