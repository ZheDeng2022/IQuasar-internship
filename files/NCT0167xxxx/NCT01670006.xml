    <textblock>
      The objective of this feasibility study is to obtain preliminary safety and efficacy data&#xD;
      associated with cochlear implantation in individuals with severe to profound sensorineural&#xD;
      hearing loss contralateral to an ear with normal, or near-normal, hearing. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that restoration of hearing in the deafened ear will result in improved speech perception in&#xD;
      the treated ear and advantages related to restoration of hearing to both ears.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Eighteen years-of-age or older at the time of implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of single-sided deafness as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Poorer ear (ear to be implanted):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, defined as pure-tone&#xD;
                       thresholds 80 dB HL or greater for the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000,&#xD;
                       and 4000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Monosyllabic word understanding, as measured using the CNC Word Test at 60&#xD;
                       dBA under earphones, less than or equal to 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Better ear (contralateral ear):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Normal or near-normal hearing, defined as pure-tone thresholds no poorer&#xD;
                       than 30 dB HL at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz and no poorer than 40 dB&#xD;
                       HL at 4000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Monosyllabic word understanding, as measured using the CNC Word Test at 60&#xD;
                       dBA under earphones, of greater than or equal to 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Duration of severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss of at least 6 months (to&#xD;
             ensure stability of hearing loss) but no greater than 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. English spoken as a primary language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Alleviation of tinnitus as the stated primary or sole motivation for seeking&#xD;
             implantation by the subject and/or investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Actively using an implantable device in the poorer ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Onset of severe to profound hearing loss &lt; 6 years-of-age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of active middle-ear pathology based on otologic examination and/or&#xD;
             immittance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Medical or psychological conditions that contraindicate undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ossification or any other cochlear anomaly at the implant ear that might prevent&#xD;
             complete insertion of the electrode array.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hearing loss of neural or central origin, including auditory neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject regarding the possible benefits,&#xD;
             risks, and limitations inherent to the surgical procedure and prosthetic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Unwillingness and/or inability of the candidate to comply with all investigational&#xD;
             requirements including, but not limited to, study protocol and surgical procedure, as&#xD;
             determined by the investigator.&#xD;
