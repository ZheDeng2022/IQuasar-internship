    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral&#xD;
      dabrafenib in children and adolescent subjects with advanced BRAF V600 mutation-positive&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;

      Part 1 (dose escalation study) will identify the recommended Part 2 (tumor-specific expansion&#xD;
      study) dose and regimen using a dose-escalation procedure. Approximately 6 to 18 subjects&#xD;
      will participate in Part 1 and will receive a starting dose of 3 mg/kg and dose will&#xD;
      deescalate or escalate between 1.5 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) and 6 mg/kg. Up to 6 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled at one dose level dependent upon the number of subjects at the current dose&#xD;
      level, the number of subjects who have experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at the&#xD;
      current dose level, and the number of subjects enrolled but with data pending at the current&#xD;
      dose level. Escalation may proceed until either a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is&#xD;
      established, or until the dose in which the median pharmacokinetic parameters consistent with&#xD;
      exposure in adults are achieved. Cohorts may be added in order to evaluate additional dose&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 consists of four disease-specific cohorts of subjects with tumors known to have BRAF&#xD;
      V600 activation (pediatric low-grade gliomas, pediatric high-grade gliomas, Langerhans cell&#xD;
      histiocytosis [LCH], and other tumors such as melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma&#xD;
      [PTC]). Each cohort will enroll at least 10 subjects with a pre-dose and at least 1 post-dose&#xD;
      disease assessment. In both the parts of the study, on Day 1, a single first dose will be&#xD;
      administered, and repeat dosing will begin on Day 2. PK sampling will be performed on Day 1&#xD;
      and Day 15 for subjects &gt;=25 kg in weight. For subjects &lt;25 kg and &gt;=10 kg in weight, blood&#xD;
      samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 15. For subjects &lt;10kg in weight,&#xD;
      blood samples for PK analysis will be collected after repeated administration on Day 15 only.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study. Treatment with dabrafenib will&#xD;
      be continued until disease progression or until no clinical benefit or development of an&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or until they withdraw consent or begin a new therapy. At the end of&#xD;
      treatment, a final study visit will occur.&#xD;

    <description>Three subjects will receive a single dose of 3 mg/kg dabrafenib on Day 1 and repeat dose will begin from Day 2, evenly divided in two daily doses. Once all 3 subjects have been fully evaluated for the first 28 days (including Day 15 PK) and no DLTs are observed, a next subject will be enrolled at the next higher dose levels (i.e., dose escalation to 3.75 mg/kg [+1] and may be further to 4.5 mg/kg [+2] and so on). If all 3 subjects have not been fully evaluated for the first 28 days or 1 DLT occurred, the fourth subject will be enrolled at the same dose level. If 2 or more DLTs are observed, the next subject will be enrolled at the next lower dose level (i.e., de-escalated to 2.25 mg/kg [-1] and may be further to 1.5 mg/kg [-2]). Similarly, the process is repeated for the fifth and sixth subjects in a cohort. All subjects will receive treatment till end of study.</description>
