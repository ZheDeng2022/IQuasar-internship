  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to confirm that the presence of the Proxima 3 disposable in the&#xD;
      arterial line doesn't significantly attenuate the arterial pressure wave form. The principal&#xD;
      aim of the trial will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To obtain quantitative data allowing investigation of the pressure wave form obtained in a&#xD;
      standard arterial line compared to various arterial lines fitted with the Proxima 3.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to examine the transmission of the arterial pressure wave form&#xD;
      through Proxima 3 disposable attached to a configurable parts of the patient's arterial line.&#xD;
      The Proxima device has been tested by Intertek as part of the Proxima 2 project and found to&#xD;
      comply to BS EN 60601-1 2nd edition &quot;Medical electrical equipment - Part 1: General&#xD;
      requirements for basic safety and essential performance&quot;. Additional internal tests have also&#xD;
      been carried out for clause 51.103, frequency response, from BS EN 60601-2-34(2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study part of the on-going development of the Proxima system which monitors metabolic&#xD;
      parameters in critically ill patients using a disposable sensor array. This study builds upon&#xD;
      the four clinical trials carried out in the past two years by Sphere Medical in partnership&#xD;
      with the NHS (REC references: 10/H1308/53, 10/H0308/113, 11/SW/0166, 12/SW/0175).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study forms part of the development process for the Proxima family of devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Proxima 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is a disposable multi-parameter microanalyser&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is connected into the patient's arterial line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will measure all or some of blood gases, haematocrit and electrolytes and is connected&#xD;
           to a small bedside monitor, which displays the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microanalyser can perform an unlimited number of analyses over a period of up to seventy&#xD;
           two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will be used as part of a closed system, reducing infection risk and preventing blood&#xD;
           loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proxima 3 will enable clinicians to measure blood parameters without leaving the patient's&#xD;
      bedside. This will support the ability to respond rapidly to changing conditions in their&#xD;
      critically ill patients. The measurements made by the Proxima 3 system have the potential to&#xD;
      inform clinical decision support systems and to change, at a fundamental level, the ability&#xD;
      of clinicians to improve patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the Proxima 3 is a passive component. It will NOT be connected to the Proxima 3&#xD;
      monitor. NO blood will be taken and NO analysis of the blood analyte concentrations will&#xD;
      occur in this study.&#xD;
