    <textblock>
      This study wants to determine the activity of a first-line treatment related to Thymidylate&#xD;
      Synthetase (TS) Expression. Patients with the diagnosis of non-squamous advanced&#xD;
      Non-Small-Cell Lung-Cancer (Stage IV) and without evidence of EGFR mutation may be enclosed&#xD;
      in this clinical trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the screening procedure tumour specimens obtained by primary biopsy, will be analysed&#xD;
      for EGFRmut and immunohistochemically for thymidylate synthetase (TS) expression. Employing&#xD;
      the H-Score with a cut-off of 150, EGFR-wt patients will be stratified into a TS low (Stratum&#xD;
      A) and TS high (Stratum B) group. This procedure is aiming to provide two equally sized&#xD;
      strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After stratification according to the TS expression level patients will be treated with a&#xD;
      combination of Pemetrexed, Cisplatin and Bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed/Cisplatin/Bevacizumab will be administered for a maximum of 4 cycles. Patients&#xD;
      with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) will continue on&#xD;
      maintenance therapy of Pemetrexed and Bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of treatment/patient: up to 1,5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow Up: at least 6 month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned number of patients: 146 treated patients&#xD;
