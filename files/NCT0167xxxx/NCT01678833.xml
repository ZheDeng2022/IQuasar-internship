      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some treatments for substance abuse are considered effective for some people who are&#xD;
      drug dependent, many others do not benefit as much over time. Researchers are working to find&#xD;
      out what characteristics predict treatment response. They also want to determine how to&#xD;
      design treatments that are more effective for a greater number of substance abusers. This&#xD;
      pilot study involves providing drug addicts with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a&#xD;
      treatment considered to be one of the most effective in reducing substance-abuse, to identify&#xD;
      ways in which the brain works that may predict and explain treatment effects. A comparison&#xD;
      group will be included that receives only standard psychotherapy or talk therapy. This&#xD;
      approach will enable researchers to determine what factors might be interfering with&#xD;
      favorable treatment outcomes and how to refine or develop new treatments that work well for&#xD;
      more people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To identify individual characteristics which predict and explain the effects of CBT in&#xD;
      people with opiate dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Males between 18 and 60 years of age who are dependent on opioids (such as heroin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be willing to take buprenorphine and receive substance abuse&#xD;
           counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will ask questions about participants ability to cope in certain situations,&#xD;
           along with questions about drug use and lifestyle issues. These questions will be asked&#xD;
           twice, before and after completing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be placed into one of two groups. One group will have CBT twice a week&#xD;
           for 8 weeks. The other group will have standard counseling twice per week. Both groups&#xD;
           will take buprenorphine as part of the drug abuse treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have other tests during this study. They will have imaging studies to&#xD;
           look at brain function. These studies will test thinking and decision making.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to collect data for a NIH RO1 grant submission&#xD;
      that aims to elucidate cognitive, emotional regulatory and neurobiological mechanisms that&#xD;
      both moderate and mediate effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in individuals with&#xD;
      opiate dependence. CBT has proven moderately effective in treating substance abuse; however,&#xD;
      significant variability in treatment outcomes remains. CBT curricula teach adaptive decision&#xD;
      making and cognitive reappraisal skills to down-regulate emotional responses to drug-related&#xD;
      cues, thereby promoting avoidance of drug use situations. A certain level of cognitive and&#xD;
      emotion regulatory functioning is, however, required for assimilating and executing these&#xD;
      skills which is often deficient in substance abusers. Consequently, many addicts cannot&#xD;
      effectively process and act on CBT curriculum, leading to poor treatment outcomes. Tailoring&#xD;
      interventions requires systematic investigation of neurobiological indicators that interfere&#xD;
      with or promote favorable treatment responsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The small pilot study outlined below will provide the feasibility and supportive data for a&#xD;
      larger effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Moderation. Identify baseline ECF and emotion regulatory functions and their neural&#xD;
      substrates that predict treatment variability in the form of: (a) program responsivity (e.g.,&#xD;
      treatment engagement, motivation, social competences) and (b) posttreatment outcomes (e.g.,&#xD;
      substance use frequency, days of continuous abstinence). Functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) will be used during performance of tasks that measure ECF (decision-making;&#xD;
      inhibitory control) and cognitive reappraisal of emotional cues to investigate the&#xD;
      neuromodulatory role of PFC regions (e.g., OFC, ACC) on emotion (e.g., amygdala) and reward&#xD;
      (e.g., ventral striatum) structures and autonomic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Mediation. Determine whether change in these neurocognitive functions in response to&#xD;
      CBT mediate intervention effects. Evidence suggests that CBT alters PFC and limbic function;&#xD;
      such changes are associated with clinical outcomes in depression and anxiety. Similarly, in&#xD;
      drug abusers, we predict treatment response will be associated with changes in neural&#xD;
      activation patterns, ECF, and emotional regulation, and that little to no change will occur&#xD;
      in those with relatively poorer outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Participants will be 18 primary opioid dependent individuals between the&#xD;
      ages of 18 and 60. These individuals will either be enrolled in NIDA Protocol 09-DA-N020,&#xD;
      (Dr. Kenzie Preston, PI) or patients at the University of Maryland Medical Center outpatient&#xD;
      substance abuse clinics (i.e., Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program (ADAP) or Outpatient Addiction&#xD;
      Treatment Service (OATS) and are receiving buprenorphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants visit their treatment facility daily for buprenorphine and receive&#xD;
      standard counseling as part of Protocol 09-DA-N020 or their treatment protocol at ADAP or&#xD;
&#xD;
      OATS. They will be screened by MMG for eligibility into the present study then randomly&#xD;
      assigned to a TAU control group or a CBT group. This study consists of 3 assessment time&#xD;
      points (baseline, midway, post-treatment) and 16 bi-weekly counseling visits (CBT or standard&#xD;
      TAU counseling). Baseline assessments will consist of functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) during performance of decision making, inhibitory control and emotional regulatory&#xD;
      tasks. Questionnaires will be used to evaluate historical and current drug use, background&#xD;
      and psychological traits, and other relevant factors. Those in the TAU group visit their&#xD;
      treatment facility routinely for buprenorphine and standard counseling but will not receive&#xD;
      CBT. The CBT group participants will undergo 8 weeks of CBT in the&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archway Clinic twice a week provided by a CBT clinician from Mountain Manor Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center who will be supervised by Dr. Marc Fishman, treatment director at MMTC; this CBT&#xD;
      counseling will be in place of the TAU counseling they would be receiving as part of the&#xD;
      parent protocol. Midway through CBT/TAU counseling, participants in this pilot study will be&#xD;
      evaluated outside the scanner with the same cognitive tasks used in the scanner and&#xD;
      questionnaires from baseline. After treatment completion, they will receive a post-treatment&#xD;
      fMRI scan where they will perform the same tasks and questionnaires. Also, we will&#xD;
      preliminarily assess mediation by examining variability in level of responsivity within the&#xD;
      treatment group to determine whether this outcome is related to functional baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and change over time. Expectations are that baseline features will predict&#xD;
      intervention response and that these same characteristics will change over time in response&#xD;
      to intervention in those with favorable outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of our outcome evaluation will be use of opioid (e.g., frequency, days of&#xD;
      continuous abstinence, etc.), coping strategies, and change in lifestyle measures (e.g.,&#xD;
      employment, relationships, behavioral problems, treatment engagement).&#xD;
