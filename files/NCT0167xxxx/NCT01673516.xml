  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Renal Sympathetic Denervation (RDN) improves&#xD;
      the control of blood pressure (BP) in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, as&#xD;
      compared to intensive medical therapy (IMT) using hemodynamic parameters and then applying a&#xD;
      predefined algorithm of drug selection (i.e. integrated hemodynamic management - IHM) during&#xD;
      6 months intensive treatment program (receiving antihypertensive care according to the 2007&#xD;
      ESH Guidelines). Working hypothesis: When it is possible to disrupt the sympatho-renal axis&#xD;
      by RDN - BP reduction occurs to a greater extent and more rapidly than applying intensive&#xD;
      medical therapy using IHM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease, affecting approximately 1 billion1&#xD;
      people worldwide. Hypertension is a major public health concern, because of its complications&#xD;
      (coronary artery disease, heart failure, renal disease, stroke). Early blood pressure control&#xD;
      in hypertensive patients guarantees the best prevention of cardiovascular events on the long&#xD;
      term (2007 ESH-ESC Guidelines on the Management of Hypertension; VALUE study). However, in&#xD;
      spite of education efforts and antihypertensive drugs, blood pressure control rates remain&#xD;
      low. The most common cause of uncontrolled BP is inadequate pharmacological treatment,&#xD;
      because the selection of antihypertensive agents is often done independently of the&#xD;
      hemodynamic status of the patient (volemic status, peripheral resistance, cardiac inotropy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sympatho-renal axis describes the dual role of the kidney as originator of some central&#xD;
      nervous system afferent signals and recipient of efferent sympathetic signals. Both the&#xD;
      contribution of the kidney to central sympathetic drive and the consequences of sympathetic&#xD;
      efferent drive to the kidney contribute to the development and sustenance of hypertension.&#xD;
      Poly-pharmacy strategies for the treatment of elevated blood pressure have identified&#xD;
      populations of patients with treatment resistant hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Resistant Hypertension(TRH) is a blood pressure that remains above goal in spite of&#xD;
      the concomitant use of antihypertensive medications from more than 3 drug classes. Patients&#xD;
      who require more than 4 drug classes to have their blood pressure controlled are also&#xD;
      considered to have resistant hypertension. Preferably, the regimen should include a diuretic&#xD;
      and all doses should be optimal2 .The true prevalence of treatment resistant hypertension is&#xD;
      unknown. In clinical trials from 20 to 40% of randomized patients did not reach blood&#xD;
      pressure targets3. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in USA&#xD;
      (2003-2008), non-pregnant adults with hypertension were classified as resistant if their&#xD;
      blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg or higher and if they reported using antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications from 3 different drug classes or drugs from 4 antihypertensive drug classes&#xD;
      regardless of blood pressure. The prevalence was 12.8% of the drug-treated hypertensive&#xD;
      population. Risk factors for treatment-resistant hypertension include older age and obesity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment-resistant patients are more likely to have albuminuria, reduced renal function, and&#xD;
      a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke or heart failure. They are at&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular complications although the true incidence of death and&#xD;
      morbidity remains currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Spanish Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Registry5, 8295 of 68045 treated patients&#xD;
      (12.2%) had treatment resistant hypertension, defined as an office blood pressure equal to or&#xD;
      exceeding 140 mm Hg systolic and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RDN is a novel procedure which has been approved safe and gives a remarkable reduction of BP&#xD;
      in treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. The HOTMAN® System is a novel impedance&#xD;
      cardiographic device, measuring and calculating hemodynamic parameters. The HOTMAN® System&#xD;
      may help the physician to control blood pressure in patients with resistance hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Our pilot study(Renal sympathetic denervation in patients with treatment-resistant&#xD;
      hypertension after witnessed intake of medication before qualifying ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure.Fadl Elmula FE, Hoffmann P, Fossum E, Brekke M, Gjønnæss E, Hjørnholm U, Kjær VN,&#xD;
      Rostrup M, Kjeldsen SE, Os I, Stenehjem AE, Høieggen A.Hypertension. 2013&#xD;
      Sep;62(3):526-32)has showed that The mean office and ambulatory BPs remained unchanged at 1,&#xD;
      3, and 6 months in the 6 patients, whereas there was no known change in antihypertensive&#xD;
      medication. Two patients, however, had a fall in both office and ambulatory BPs. Our findings&#xD;
      question whether BP falls in response to RDN in patients with true treatment-resistant&#xD;
      hypertension.That is why we intended to do an intrim analysis after inclusion of around 30%&#xD;
      of the total number planned to be included in the study.&#xD;
