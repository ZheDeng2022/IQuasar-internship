    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis being tested is that magnetic resonance imaging and serologic biomarkers&#xD;
      of apoptosis and extracellular matrix remodeling will precede echocardiographic indices of&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic function among childhood cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines&#xD;
      thus allowing evaluation of new therapies to prevent and manage heart failure in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A: Patients who received a high dose of anthracyclines and who completed chemotherapy&#xD;
      for a minimum of 2 year and are still in remission we gathered information about their&#xD;
      previous heart disease, radiation dose to the heart, bone marrow transplant, age at&#xD;
      treatment, gender, elevation of serum cardiac troponin-T or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide measurements during anthracycline therapy, systolic dysfunction and congestive heart&#xD;
      failure during anthracycline therapy. Participants had a Cardiac MRI (CMRI), echo and&#xD;
      collection of serum for the the measurement of biomarkers of inflammation (C Reactive Protein&#xD;
      (CRP), TNF-α, myocyte injury (Cardiac troponin (cTn), extracellular matrix remodeling,&#xD;
      (Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP), Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), C terminal&#xD;
      propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), C terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP),&#xD;
      Bone Alkaline Phosphatase, apoptosis (Caspase-3 P17 peptide), and ventricular derived B-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) once during the study. Part A has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: For those patients enrolled in part A they had another CMRI to validate CMRI findings&#xD;
      and to study progression of cardiomyopathy overtime by comparing all CMRI derived imaging&#xD;
      parameters between the first and second subject visits. Results of their standard of care&#xD;
      echo will be post-processed to include the same parameters as the subjects' previous research&#xD;
      echo that took place 2 years ago for comparison. Subjects had a blood draw (3mL) for for DNA&#xD;
      and RNA analysis. Part B has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C: Will include an additional 60 patients who received low dose anthracycline therapy&#xD;
      (&lt;300 mg/m2) and who were also identified through the cardio-oncology registry. These&#xD;
      patients will undergo a CMRI, study echo, and a blood sampling: Cardiac Troponin (cTn) ,&#xD;
      Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP), Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), C terminal&#xD;
      propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), C terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP),&#xD;
      Bone Alkaline Phosphatase, Caspase, C Reactive Protein (CRP), TNF-α, hematocrit, and&#xD;
      NT-proBNP (a more sensitive measurement of BNP). Blood draw for DNA/microRNA analysis.&#xD;
      Results of the standard of care echo will be post-processed to include the same parameters as&#xD;
      the original 60 subjects' previous research echocardiogram for comparison purposes. All&#xD;
      subjects recruited will serve either as a &quot;case&quot; (because they have cardiotoxicity) or as a&#xD;
      control, if they are free of cardiotoxicity. Currently enrolling for part C patients who&#xD;
      received low dose anthracyclines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiotoxicity for the overall group will be defined as global systolic dysfunction&#xD;
      (indicated by an ejection fraction &lt; 2SD below normal (Z score &lt;-2), or decrease in global&#xD;
      circumferential or longitudinal strain magnitude less than 2SD below normal. CMRI is&#xD;
      considered to be the standard of care for assessment of cardiomyopathy. Based on the proven&#xD;
      utility of CMRI as a screening tool for cardiomyopathy, CMRI studies will be performed as&#xD;
      standard of care for assessment of global and regional myocardial function in cancer&#xD;
      survivors. T1 pulse sequences for estimation of native T1 and ECV are continually being&#xD;
      developed and refined, and will require further validation prior to clinical application.&#xD;
      These sequences will still be considered be part of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Part A. CMRI parameters will be correlated with echo parameters of&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic function. Data on peak circumferential strain will be compared to&#xD;
      published historic normative data. T1 relaxation values will be compared to a group of age&#xD;
      matched controls with normal SF and no exposure to anthracyclines. Results are expressed as&#xD;
      mean and SD for continuous data and as percentages and numbers for categorical data. Subjects&#xD;
      will be classified into 3 groups as detailed previously. Differences in the means between the&#xD;
      groups and between exposed and controls for all normally distributed data will be assessed by&#xD;
      analysis of variance. For skewed data, the Mann-Whitney U test will be performed. Image&#xD;
      quality scores for all patients will be averaged for corresponding T1 maps. Mean segmental T1&#xD;
      and ventricular myocardial peak circumferential strain values and standard deviations will be&#xD;
      calculated. The literature shows that T1 value is subject to a mild systematic heart rate&#xD;
      dependency and a patient's height and weight has some impact on T1 values. To find and&#xD;
      correct for these potential confounding factors, the relationships between T1 and heart rate,&#xD;
      height, and weight will be investigated by using linear regression analysis of section data.&#xD;
      In addition, the relationship between T1 mapping-derived relaxation time, left ventricular&#xD;
      myocardial peak circumference strain and echocardiography parameters of systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic function will be investigated by using linear regression analysis of section data.&#xD;
      All statistical analysis will be performed with SAS 9.2. All tests are two tailed, and P &lt;&#xD;
      .05 is considered to indicate a significant difference. Interobserver and intraobserver&#xD;
      variability of HARP strain will be performed using a paired t test and reported as a mean&#xD;
      difference and 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-1/TIMP ratio, PICP, CITP, Bone Alkaline&#xD;
      Phosphatase and that of Caspase-3 P17 peptide will be measured as indicators of extracellular&#xD;
      matrix remodeling and apoptosis, respectively and compared to CMRI and echocardiographic&#xD;
      parameters of systolic and diastolic function. Serum level of a cleaved p17 fragment (p17) of&#xD;
      Caspase-3, the end effector caspase for apoptosis, will be compared to published normative&#xD;
      data from a group of 167 healthy subjects 68. Circulating levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and&#xD;
      TIMP-1 will be compared to published historic healthy controls 69 Serum biomarkers N-terminal&#xD;
      pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) and Cardiac troponin will also be obtained given their known association&#xD;
      with cardiac dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers statistical analyses results are expressed as mean and SD for continuous data and&#xD;
      as percentages and numbers for categorical data. Subjects will be classified into three&#xD;
      groups as detailed previously. Differences in the means between the groups for all normally&#xD;
      distributed data will be assessed by analysis of variance. For skewed data, the Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U test will be performed. The relationship between levels of Troponin, Caspase-3 P17 peptide,&#xD;
      MMPS, TIMPs, PICP, CITP, Bone Alkaline Phosphatase, CRP, CK-MB, and echo parameters of&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic function will be investigated by using linear regression analysis of&#xD;
      section data. All statistical analysis will be performed with SAS 9.2. All tests are two&#xD;
      tailed, and P &lt; .05 is considered to indicate a significant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interdisciplinary nature and the potential for bedside to bench translational research&#xD;
      should position us to obtain pilot data based on the projected changes in our patient&#xD;
      cohorts. For example, we will test whether serum P17 level in any patient groups (groups 1-3)&#xD;
      is higher than that in healthy controls. However, it is possible that only the late groups&#xD;
      (Group 2 or 3) will show a rise in P17 level. Similarly, only the late groups may show&#xD;
      changes in serum MMPs or T1 relaxation time. If any of the change is too small to be detected&#xD;
      given the sample size, we will focus on parameters exhibiting larger differences vs. healthy&#xD;
      controls. This will also guide us in designing future study. The change in MMPs may reflect&#xD;
      presence of diastolic vs. systolic dysfunction in the early vs. late groups. For example, it&#xD;
      is possible that the early group (Group 1) will exhibit diastolic problem, manifested as a&#xD;
      reduced MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio. When significant systolic dysfunction ensues, the ratio may be&#xD;
      reversed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: All CMRI imaging biomarkers of cardiotoxicity demonstrated in the baseline pilot&#xD;
      study will be compared among the first and second study visits among the high dose (≥240&#xD;
      mg/m2) subjects. Frequencies and percents of the patients who exhibit the phenotype of&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity as measured by cMRI will be calculated for each study visit. If the&#xD;
      frequencies/percents are the same or greater in the second visit as compared to the first,&#xD;
      then the use of cMRI to indicate anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity can be validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: All CMR imaging parameters of athracycline induced cardiomyopathy will be&#xD;
      compared between the first and second study visits among high dose (≥240 mg/m2) subjects. All&#xD;
      CMR volumetric parameters including volumes, mass, and measurements of end systolic fiber&#xD;
      stress as well as measurements of global and regional myocardial function, T1 maps and ECV&#xD;
      will be compared between the two study visits using paired t-tests, p&lt;0.05 will be used to&#xD;
      indicate a statistically significant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To compare CMR parameters of global, and regional systolic function and&#xD;
      microscopic fibrosis as indicated by changes in T1 mapping-derived relaxation time and&#xD;
      increase in extracellular volume matrix (ECV) to those of subjects in the high-dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: The objective of this aim is to test the hypothesis that CMR imaging biomarkers of&#xD;
      AIC will be less frequent among subjects exposed to low dose anthracyclines. The proportion&#xD;
      of subjects that possess the anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity phenotype in both the high&#xD;
      and low dose groups will be compared using Fisher's exact test. P&lt; 0.05 will be used to&#xD;
      indicate a statistically significant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To quantitate serologic biomarkers of inflammation, myocyte injury,&#xD;
      extracellular matrix remodeling and apoptosis among childhood cancer survivors treated with&#xD;
      low-dose anthracyclines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aim will tell the hypothesis that elevation of biomarkers of inflammation, myocyte&#xD;
      injury, extracellular matrix remodeling and apoptosis will be less prevalent in survivors of&#xD;
      childhood cancer exposed to low-dose anthracyclines, as reflected by lower levels of serum&#xD;
      CRP, high sensitivity troponin, MMPs and Caspase-3 P17 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: The objective is to characterize changes in serum levels of markers for&#xD;
      extracellular matrix remodeling and apoptosis in patients at various intervals after&#xD;
      anthracycline chemotherapy. Serum levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-1/TIMP ratio, PICP,&#xD;
      CITP, Bone Alkaline Phosphatase and that of Caspase-3 P17 peptide will be measured as&#xD;
      indicators of extracellular matrix remodeling and apoptosis, respectively and compared to&#xD;
      CMRI and echocardiographic parameters of systolic and diastolic function. Serum level of a&#xD;
      cleaved p17 fragment (p17) of Caspase-3, the end effector caspase for apoptosis, will be&#xD;
      compared to published normative data from a group of 167 healthy subjects (Agosto, Azrin,&#xD;
      Singh, Jaffe, &amp; Liang, 2011). Circulating levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 will be&#xD;
      compared to normal controls. Serum biomarkers N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) and Cardiac&#xD;
      troponin will also be obtained given their known association with cardiac dysfunction. A&#xD;
      literature review of six small studies suggest that NT-pro-BNP, and Cardiac troponin might&#xD;
      also be useful markers in the early detection of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity&#xD;
      (Mavinkurve-Groothuis, Kapusta, Nir, &amp; Groot-Loonen, 2008). Of interest, in a larger study&#xD;
      performed in 122 asymptomatic survivors of childhood cancer, none had abnormal cTnT levels&#xD;
      and only thirteen percent had abnormal NT-pro-BNP levels (Mavinkurve-Groothuis et al.&#xD;
      631-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specfic Aim 3: To compare the results of the DNA/RNA analysis between all subjects with and&#xD;
      without anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy regardless of cumulative dose. DNA and RNA&#xD;
      analysis will be collected for future analysis by the Jackson Lab bioinformatics core unit,&#xD;
      to be analyzed based on the results of a parallel murine model of cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
