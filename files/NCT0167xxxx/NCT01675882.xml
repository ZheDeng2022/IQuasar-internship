      The objectives of this dose-finding study for the treatment of peanut allergy are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of 3 doses of Viaskin Peanut (50 mcg ,100 mcg and 250 mcg&#xD;
           peanut protein per patch) to significantly desensitize peanut-allergic subjects to&#xD;
           peanut after 12 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of a long-term treatment with Viaskin Peanut.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is a common allergy in the United States, with a prevalence in the general&#xD;
      population as high as 1%. Peanut allergy management is based on strict peanut avoidance and&#xD;
      injectable epinephrine after the allergic systemic reactions have started. Specific&#xD;
      Immunotherapy methods currently available have shown some limitations in their use because of&#xD;
      safety issues. Hence, there is an important unmet medical need for efficient and safe&#xD;
      treatment of peanut allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBV Technologies has developed an epicutaneous delivery system, called Viaskin, a method&#xD;
      based on delivering precise quantity of the allergen on the upper layers of the skin.&#xD;
      Avoiding contact between the allergen and the bloodstream should confer to epicutaneous&#xD;
      immunotherapy (EPIT) a higher level of safety as systemic reactions should be circumvented&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VIPES study is a 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled,randomized trial to study the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Viaskin Peanut in subjects from 6 to 55 years old with a history of&#xD;
      immediate hypersensitive reaction to peanut protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted at sites with investigators and staff trained and experienced in&#xD;
      the diagnosis and the management of peanut allergy and anaphylaxis, and who are capable of&#xD;
      performing a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) in adult and/or&#xD;
      pediatric subjects. Three doses of peanut proteins, i.e. 50 mcg, 100 mcg and 250 mcg will be&#xD;
      evaluated for the study. Following the confirmation of peanut allergy at screening, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into four different treatment groups, including 50 mcg,&#xD;
      100 mcg and 250 mcg peanut protein or placebo. Treatment will be comprised of daily&#xD;
      applications of Viaskin Peanut or placebo patch for 12 months. Each subject will undergo two&#xD;
      DBPCFCs: one at screening and one at Month 12. A follow up visit will be performed 2 weeks&#xD;
      after completion of treatment and the last DBPCFC.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This Phase IIb, placebo-controlled study was conducted in participants aged 6 to 55 years old with peanut allergy at 22 study centers in 5 countries (Canada, France, Netherlands, Poland and USA) between 31 July 2012 and 31 July 2014. All participants who completed the VIPES study up to Visit 11 (inclusive) were eligible for participation in the follow-up study (OLFUS-VIPES).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study had a 4-week screening period, 52-week treatment period and 2-week follow-up period. A total of 221 participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio into 4 treatment groups (50 micrograms [μg], 100 μg, 250 μg peanut proteins and placebo). Each participant underwent dose-escalating double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) at screening and Month 12. At screening, a dose-escalating DBPCFC confirmed peanut allergy to an eliciting dose &lt;=300 milligrams (mg) peanut protein.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The peanut protein eliciting dose was defined as the first dose of peanut protein administered to the participant during the DBPCFC procedure which caused an objective allergic reaction. This was capped to 300 mg at the screening DBPCFC and to 2000 mg at the Month 12 DBPCFC. For participants with missing treatment response at Month 12, LOCF imputation was used (i.e., participants were considered as non-responders).</description>

        <description>The peanut protein eliciting dose was defined as the first dose of peanut protein administered to the participant during the DBPCFC procedure which caused an objective allergic reaction. This was capped to 300 mg at screening DBPCFC and to 2000 mg at the Month 12 DBPCFC. For participants with missing treatment response at Month 12, LOCF imputation was used (i.e., participants were considered as non-responders).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Severity of Symptoms Based on the Oral Food Challenge (OFC) Symptom Score Sheet at Month 12; Analyzed in Overall Population</title>
        <description>The symptoms of erythematous rash, pruritus, urticaria/angioedema, rash, sneezing/itching, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, laryngeal symptoms (example, throat clearing, occasional cough, hoarseness, frequent dry cough, inspiratory stridor), wheezing, subjective complaints, objective complaints and cardiovascular symptoms (example, color change, weakness, dizziness, mental status change, tachycardia, decreased blood pressure, etc) were observed. The OFC score ranges from 0 to 3 for each symptom (0=Absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate or 3=severe). The total symptom score for each participant was calculated. Higher scores indicate worst outcome. For participants with missing treatment response at Month 12, LOCF imputation was used (i.e., participants were considered as non-responders).</description>

        <description>The mean wheal diameter of skin prick test (sum of the orthogonal diameters divided by 2) at each time point is calculated for the 5 skin prick tests at baseline and at each time point, i.e., Months 3, 6 and 12: undiluted, diluted 1:10 millimeter (mm), diluted 1:100 (mm), diluted 1:1,000 (mm), diluted 1:10,000 (mm). The ratio of the mean wheal diameter at each time point for a specific dilution versus the baseline value for that specific dilution was calculated and classified as &lt;=0.5 or &gt;0.5, allowing to assess the number of participants of those mean wheal diameters that have been at least halved from the baseline value.</description>
