  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that at the end of the 12-month trial, teenagers regularly&#xD;
      self-monitoring their asthma control with ACT administered through Facebook will have&#xD;
      improved ACT scores as compared with teenagers receiving usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to administer the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a clinically validated&#xD;
      and reliable measure of asthma control, to a pediatric pulmonary patient population, using&#xD;
      novel channels to improve usage of the tool and health outcomes. The investigators will&#xD;
      administer ACT to patients using Facebook to monitor asthma control and notify clinicians&#xD;
      when there is deterioration of control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to improve health outcomes in patients with asthma by measuring adherence to the&#xD;
      use of monitoring tool, follow-up visits to their specialist, and hospitalization/Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) visits. To achieve this, the investigators will use a novel technology&#xD;
      platform that is simple, secure, private and easily scalable to other relevant sites and&#xD;
      groups, without the need for additional investment. Currently, patients take the ACT survey&#xD;
      only during their scheduled office appointments. The aim of the study is to increase the use&#xD;
      of ACT to monitor patients who see a pediatric pulmonologist to promote regular&#xD;
      self-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACT is a short symptom-based survey consisting of 5 questions, validated in English and&#xD;
      Spanish. Participants will receive reminders on Facebook every month to login to the study&#xD;
      website to complete the ACT survey therefore allowing patients to easily take the survey on a&#xD;
      regular basis, and receive reminders and educational content in the media spaces they already&#xD;
      inhabit. Participants would receive reminders and links in the same way they would receive&#xD;
      other reminders or notifications from Facebook. The system will rate asthma control and send&#xD;
      patients and their specialist notification of status if it reaches critical levels, defined&#xD;
      as a score of 14 or lower on the ACT survey. This will be a system generated notification,&#xD;
      based on a protocol developed in conjunction with the physicians at the Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital (MGH) pediatric pulmonary department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will study the efficacy of electronic social networks in engaging teenagers&#xD;
      in their asthma control over time, using a simple but effective symptom-based survey tool.&#xD;
      Both patients and providers would receive notifications in case of deteriorating control,&#xD;
      which could result in early intervention and lead to better clinical outcomes by prompting&#xD;
      timely intervention by the clinician. The Center for Connected Health (CCH) will work with&#xD;
      the MGH Department of Pulmonology, as well as the Pediatric Asthma group at Partners&#xD;
      Community HealthCare Inc. (PCHI) to enroll ambulatory teenagers with asthma in the research&#xD;
      study for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups.&#xD;
