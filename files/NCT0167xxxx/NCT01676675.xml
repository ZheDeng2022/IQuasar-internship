  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza virus with high incidence and&#xD;
      serious complications even causing death. According to the announcement released by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO), the number of global annual influenza case was 0.6 to 1.2 billion&#xD;
      and 0.5 to 1 million people died. The emergence of a new subtype of influenza virus may cause&#xD;
      an influenza pandemic with occurence once every 10 to 50 years which cause serious adverse&#xD;
      consequences for human health and social welfare worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 1997 to 2003，the H5N1 virus infection has increased highly and gradually spreaded to&#xD;
      Europe, Africa and other countries and regions. High mortality caused by H5N1 virus has&#xD;
      attracted the WHO and national government great attention. So it is meaningful to develop&#xD;
      vaccine to provide effective antibody to reduce the number of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      whole virus inactivated influenza H5N1 vaccine.&#xD;
