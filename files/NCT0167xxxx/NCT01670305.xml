    <textblock>
      Residual pockets and furcation defects are challenging sites that require additional&#xD;
      periodontal therapy. The aim of this study is evaluate 1)the effect of a single photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy (PDT) as monotherapy residual pockets in single rooted teeth and 2) the effect of PDT&#xD;
      in association with scaling and root planing (SRP) in class II furcation lesions with probing&#xD;
      pocket depth (PPD) &gt;5mm and bleeding on probing (BoP). A blind randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial was conducted in subjects presenting at least three residual pockets in single root&#xD;
      teeth and subjects with at least one molar presenting class II furcation defect. To evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of a single PDT as monotherapy in residual pockets, the selected sites were&#xD;
      assigned to receive: PDT alone, photosensitizer alone or SRP alone. To evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      PDT in association with SRP in class II furcation lesions, the selected sites were assigned&#xD;
      to PDT+SRP or SRP alone. Clinical, microbiological and immunoenzymatic analyses were assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-therapies.&#xD;

      Residual pockets and class II furcation lesions are challenging sites that require additional&#xD;
      periodontal therapy. The aims of this study were to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) the effect of a single PDT as monotherapy residual pockets in single rooted teeth and 2)&#xD;
      the effect of PDT in association with SRP in class II furcation lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in subjects presenting at least&#xD;
      three residual pockets in single root teeth and subjects with at least one molar presenting&#xD;
      class II furcation involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of a single PDT as monotherapy in residual pockets, the selected sites&#xD;
      were assigned to receive one of following therapies: PDT alone, photosensitizer alone or SRP&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of PDT in association with SRP in class II furcation lesions, the&#xD;
      selected sites were assigned to receive PDT+SRP or SRP alone. Microbiological,&#xD;
      immunoenzymatic analyses and clinical parameters: probing pocket depth (PPD), position of the&#xD;
      gingival margin (PGM), relative clinical attachment level (RCAL), full mouth plaque (FMPS)&#xD;
      and bleeding score (FMBS), will be assessed at baseline,3 and 6 months post-therapies.&#xD;
