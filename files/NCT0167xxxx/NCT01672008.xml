    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of NOX-100&#xD;
      to reduce intradialytic hypotension (IDH) in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-stage, prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-dose, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      cross-over, phase IIa study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles of&#xD;
      NOX-100 to reduce the number of intradialytic hypotension episodes. At single-blind stage I,&#xD;
      the eligible subject will receive a 1-week run-in period followed by a 1-week NOX-100&#xD;
      treatment in a dose of 0.4mg/kg/hr. To evaluate the clearance of NOX-100, plasma levels of&#xD;
      NOX-100 at the end of the 1st dialysis and prior to the 2nd dialysis will be measured. An&#xD;
      interim analysis will be undertaken after the completion of first stage. The following&#xD;
      process should be conducted only if the plasma level of NOX-100 decreases by 90% or more in&#xD;
      these patients and all safety data have been reviewed by the medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At double blind stage II, patients will be randomized to one of the following treatment&#xD;
      sequences in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequence A: NOX-100 treatment phase followed by Placebo treatment phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequence B: Placebo treatment phase followed by NOX-100 treatment phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 1-week placebo, the subjects will receive the two 4-week treatment (sequence A or&#xD;
      sequence B)which are separated by 1-week wash-out. In the NOX-100 treatment phase, subjects&#xD;
      will subsequently receive NOX-100 in doses of 1.2, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/hr at the first three&#xD;
      dialysis sessions over each week. In the placebo treatment phase, subjects will receive&#xD;
      comparative placebo for four weeks. For the first 20 subjects, the treatment dose could be&#xD;
      escalated only after the individual safety data have been reviewed by an unblinded medical&#xD;
      monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm if there is hepatic metabolism of NOX-100 between dialysis sessions, a&#xD;
      pre-dialysis plasma level will be tested at the 2nd dialysis of Week 2, 5, 7 and 10 in the&#xD;
      second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both stages, the blood pressure will be measured pre-HD, every 30 minutes during HD and&#xD;
      post-HD for monitoring the hypotension episode. For safety assessment, all AE(s), SAE(s) and&#xD;
      any signs/symptoms during HD will be recorded. The safety of study drug will be followed&#xD;
      until 4 weeks after last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established prior to start of the trial and&#xD;
      the DSMB meeting will be hold every 6~12 months during study period. Both medical monitor and&#xD;
      DSMB will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial participants.&#xD;
