      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that among individuals who suffer from panic disorder there is&#xD;
      higher incidence of co-morbid balance impairment than in the healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the treatment of panic disorder, through the treatment of&#xD;
      co-morbid balance impairment using virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy environment, is more&#xD;
      effective than the exposure to still pictures from the same scene in VR without balance&#xD;
      challenge or comparing to standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of&#xD;
      panic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research relies on previous studies, which have shown mutuality between anxiety and&#xD;
      balance impairment, even if only sub-clinical. The VR-based training environment enables&#xD;
      multi-sensorial stimulus in a dynamic interactively changing setting. With the addition of a&#xD;
      cognitive task (dual task distracting the fear), the investigators can add cognitive load and&#xD;
      therefore challenge the control of balance even more. Individuals who suffer from balance&#xD;
      impairment avoid their exposure to many balance-challenging situations - a fact that may&#xD;
      increase their anxiety. The investigators assume that a considerable number of PD individuals&#xD;
      also experience balance control impairments - mostly subclinical ones. Moreover, balance&#xD;
      impairment accompanies other psychiatric disorders, though not enough literature exists on&#xD;
      the subject.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety disorders are a group of ailments, which are characterized by excessive and abnormal&#xD;
      vague senses of apprehension followed by stress and restlessness (Berrios 1999). As a group,&#xD;
      anxiety disorders were found to have the highest lifetime prevalence, i.e. they are the most&#xD;
      commonly occurring class of mental disorders (Kessler et al. 2010) with 17.7% prevalence in a&#xD;
      year (Kessler et al. 2005). This group of disorders consists of five main mental disorders:&#xD;
      specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety and panic&#xD;
      disorder - which the investigators will be focusing on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panic disorder (PD) is a chronic ailment characterized by spontaneous, unexpected occurrence&#xD;
      of panic attacks, i.e. periods of intense fear, which vary dramatically in the recurrence of&#xD;
      panic attacks between patients and within a patient, ranging from a few per day to a few per&#xD;
      year (American Psychiatric Association 2000). PD often occurs in conjunction with&#xD;
      agoraphobia, i.e. the fear and avoidance from situations and settings they perceive they have&#xD;
      little control on, such as public places and 'suffocating' surroundings (Kessler et al.&#xD;
      2005). PD can reach a lifetime prevalence of 5% (Kessler et al. 2010) and above (Serretti et&#xD;
      al. 2011) and women are two to three times more likely to be affected than men (Schumacher et&#xD;
      al. 2011). PD mostly develops in young adulthood (25y mean age), however this is not&#xD;
      mandatory as onset during childhood or early adolescence most likely remains undiagnosed&#xD;
      (Schumacher et al. 2011). Individuals suffering from PD are also said to have a deregulated&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system at rest and during orthostatic challenge (i.e. tilt test), displayed&#xD;
      by heightened heart rate and diastolic blood pressure compared to those of healthy controls&#xD;
      (Martinez et al. 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many years of research have been invested in seek of an association between anxiety or PD and&#xD;
      impaired physical balance (Perna et al. 2001; Sklare et al. 2001; Staab and Ruckenstein 2003;&#xD;
      Staab 2006; Redfern et al. 2007). Many times the treatment of anxiety disorders in general,&#xD;
      and PD among them, which target limbic areas, fail to succeed; thus it is recommended to&#xD;
      treat the comorbid balance impairment, which its treatment alone can ameliorate anxiety&#xD;
      (Shefer et al. 2010). Literature on the subject has indicated high prevalence of comorbid&#xD;
      balance disorders and anxiety in general (Alvord 1991; Balaban and Jacob 2001; Kalueff et al.&#xD;
      2008) as well as anxiety disorders specific ranging from agoraphobia, panic attack and&#xD;
      generalized anxiety (Alvord 1991; Balaban and Jacob 2001; Balaban and Thayer 2001; Jacob and&#xD;
      Furman 2001). Anxiety in general and PDs are a common co-morbidity in acute and chronic&#xD;
      vestibular disorders (Eagger et al. 1992; Matheson et al. 1999; Jacob and Furman 2001; Pollak&#xD;
      et al. 2003), evolving from vestibular deficiency or sensorimotor disintegration. In spite of&#xD;
      abundant literature supporting anxiety-imbalance relationship, it is still uncertain whether&#xD;
      they are causality related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further investigation on the subject revealed that individuals who suffer from PD may also&#xD;
      display altered cognitive patterns (Casey et al. 2004; Starcevic and Berle 2006). In&#xD;
      addition, last decade research in the cognitive field has been dedicated to evaluating&#xD;
      cerebellar involvement (Andreasen and Pierson 2008). Studies in animal models (Brodal et al.&#xD;
      1991; Dum and Strick 2003; Kelly and Strick 2003) have shown cerebellar connection to the&#xD;
      frontal cortex through the pons and thalamus, suggesting its participation in neural circuits&#xD;
      mediating higher cognitive functions. While cerebellar lesions in animals have indicated&#xD;
      motor coordination and motor learning impairments (Thach 1996; Bastian et al. 1998), studies&#xD;
      in humans have assigned the cerebellum a role in time intervals perception (Akshoomoff and&#xD;
      Courchesne 1992), rhythm sequences imitation (Fiez et al. 1995) and associative learning&#xD;
      (Attwell et al. 2002). Hence, the cerebellum seems to act as a modulator of cognitive&#xD;
      processes performed by the cerebral cortex, which detects patterns and pattern changes as&#xD;
      well as errors in both motor and cognitive functions and feedbacks the cerebrum (Andreasen&#xD;
      and Pierson 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further support for this association lies in the theory of learning. Erez et al. (Erez et al.&#xD;
      2004) present a three-stage of learning theory, which includes an acquisition stage and two&#xD;
      distinct stages of conditioned response (CR): the emotional CR, driven by the autonomic and&#xD;
      hormonal systems, is fast and non-specific and the motor CR, provides an effective CR and is&#xD;
      slow but specific. Despite the apparent differences, these two stages seem to be highly&#xD;
      interrelated as can be explained by a frightening stimulus: fear CRs are acquired, emotional&#xD;
      fear CRs take over and promote motor CRs. Contrariwise fear CRs may take over, if a&#xD;
      subclinical balance disorder exists, it could be postulated that intervention of balance may&#xD;
      reduce PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance maintenance itself occurs automatically and is involved in the execution of basic&#xD;
      motions, which enable daily life activities (Keshner 1994; Kurtzer et al. 2005) as well as&#xD;
      high performance skills such as ballet (Koutedakis and Jamurtas 2004) and athletics&#xD;
      (Hrysomallis 2011). Normally, once a balance task becomes automatic, voluntary or cognitive&#xD;
      action are enabled without a trade-off (Adi-Japha et al 2008). The success of performing any&#xD;
      motor task lies on the ability to conduct task-related voluntary movements on top of constant&#xD;
      involuntary postural adjustments (Keshner 1994; Kurtzer et al. 2005). Thus, each task-related&#xD;
      maneuver involves the contraction of muscles in the limbs and trunk for the maintenance of&#xD;
      body stability. Balance maintenance also requires constant integration between sensory input&#xD;
      coming from vestibular, visual, somatosensory (mainly proprioceptive) channels and the motor&#xD;
      system (Shefer et al. 2010). Converging from different sensory sources, this system addresses&#xD;
      various balance maintenance aspects (Massion and Woollacott 1996) and so the loss of sensory&#xD;
      input from either one can result in the alteration of posture (Le and Kapoula 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired vestibular function causes imbalance, nausea, vertigo and abnormal eye movements&#xD;
      (Gilman and Newman 1996) and hinders the acquisition and emission of corrective movements.&#xD;
      Such occasions are associated with limbic-related anxiety, perhaps through the parabrachial&#xD;
      circuit (Balaban and Thayer 2001). The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is reciprocally connected&#xD;
      with the spinal cord, hypothalamus, amygdala and limbic cortex, and thus receives vestibular&#xD;
      nuclear and visceral afferent information; therefore links vestibulo-visceral integrations&#xD;
      especially in the adjustment to gravito-inertial challenges. In a recent study evaluating&#xD;
      vestibular mutation in mice, it was found that an elevated plus-maze platform and an&#xD;
      open-field test contributed greatly to anxiety levels (Shefer et al. 2010). While under&#xD;
      rotation, extra-cellular recordings gave support to vestibulo-recipient areas of the PBN&#xD;
      integrate signals from the vestibular nuclei and convey information about whole-body's&#xD;
      orientation to pathways that produce homeostatic and affective responses (Balaban et al.&#xD;
      2002); giving further support to panic and impaired balance co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who suffer from vestibular or balance disorders many times demonstrate symptoms&#xD;
      of anxiety, and conversely, patients with anxiety disorders often show abnormalities of&#xD;
      clinical balance or vestibular function tests (Bronstein et al. 2004; Furman et al. 2005).&#xD;
      Perna et al. (Perna et al. 2001) showed that PD patients demonstrate larger velocity and&#xD;
      length in body sway in comparison to healthy controls. An additional study measured postural&#xD;
      sway in anxiety patients as a response to a moving visual environment and found greater sway&#xD;
      among the anxiety group comparing to the healthy controls (Redfern et al. 2007). A&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease study has shown that in most cases they did not suffer from a specific&#xD;
      vestibular disease, but do have subclinical abnormalities of the balance system. These&#xD;
      patients control their posture relying on non-vestibular cues, proprioceptive and mostly&#xD;
      visual input (Staab 2006; Caldirola et al. 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite some considerable evidence in the literature, it is still difficult to isolate and&#xD;
      verify balance impairment in PD. Thus the investigators propose the implementation of virtual&#xD;
      reality exposure therapy. The term virtual reality (VR) refers to the use of an interactive&#xD;
      computerized environment (software and hardware) simulating real world settings, which enable&#xD;
      the immersion of the individual in trial (Weiss et al. 2005). With its high sensitivity, it&#xD;
      is possible to create an environment where the individual is gradually led into a motivating&#xD;
      and challenging environment, which requires his/ her alertness and physical attendance rather&#xD;
      than imaginational capabilities. Within the VR it is possible to design a setting that&#xD;
      consists of motivational and challenging elements, which indicate for the individual&#xD;
      regarding his/ her own capability and competence (in contrast to his/ her impotence and&#xD;
      passiveness) and from the amended experience (triumph is achieved). In addition, the&#xD;
      therapist has the unique opportunity to be part of that environment in real-time and&#xD;
      straightforward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR exposes the examinee as well as the therapist to salient components of the panic evoking&#xD;
      situation and by visual, auditory and motor elements the stressing environment is&#xD;
      reconstructed and reveals its panic-provoking roots (Roy et al. 2010). VR exposure enables&#xD;
      the identification of intimidating moments as well as confident ones, providing the examinee&#xD;
      with a competing instrument to deal with the stressing moments, while allowing the&#xD;
      environment to change and adjust exposure levels and challenge the examinee (Wiederhold and&#xD;
      Wiederhold 2010). VR exposure is done in laboratory conditions and under full supervision,&#xD;
      thus it addresses individuals who are physically incapable of outdoors training as well. All&#xD;
      in all, the utilization of the VR method allows the employment of a stepwise exposure&#xD;
      approach, which is made by computerized and human fine-tuned modifications of the scene&#xD;
      (Wiederhold and Wiederhold 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, VR exposure therapy, in practice for more than twenty years, supports the&#xD;
      learning and training of neuro-motor tasks such as in flight, ski and surgery simulators.&#xD;
      During the last few years, VR exposure method has made its way to clinical utilization in&#xD;
      rehabilitation centers and hospitals, where balance and motor control are the main focus (Roy&#xD;
      et al. 2010). The exposure to VR may contribute from several aspects, which are out of the&#xD;
      reach of conventional therapy methods. VR exposure therapy provides an innovative and&#xD;
      exceptional opportunity to reconstruct the scene and setting, which lead to panic behavior,&#xD;
      and expose the examinee to critical factors consisting of the panic root. Altogether, VR&#xD;
      systems enable the learning of simple and complex skills in a controlled environment, due to&#xD;
      the endowment of monitored, graded, and adapted exposure of the various components&#xD;
      constructing the therapy in a systematic manner (Rizzo et al. 1997a; Rizzo et al. 1997b;&#xD;
      Schultheis and Rizzo 2001; Merians et al. 2002; Deutsch et al. 2004; Weiss et al. 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using VR, balance performance is evaluated precisely and efficiently by measuring body sway&#xD;
      during quiet standing and during a few sets of perturbations (Nashner 1976; Allum and&#xD;
      Carpenter 2005). The measured factor is the displacement of the center of pressure (CoP),&#xD;
      i.e. a point at which a counter-reaction force vector of the vertical ground is applied. This&#xD;
      force vector represents a weighted average of the pressure vectors of each foot on the force&#xD;
      plates (Winter et al. 1990; Winter 1995). The CoP is a dynamic factor and displaces a few&#xD;
      centimeters within a plane constantly (Winter 1995; Winter et al. 1996). Body sway is a&#xD;
      kinematic term and is often estimated from the CoP displacement (in the anterior-posterior&#xD;
      and medio-lateral axes) which is derived from force plate data, and is assumed to be&#xD;
      synonymous with the CoP measure (Winter et al. 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance maintenance and postural adjustments are modified by repeating experiences and&#xD;
      improve with practice (Pollock et al. 2000), less muscles are recruited and responses refine&#xD;
      and become subtle (Horak and Nashner 1986; Horak et al. 1989; Chong et al. 1999). Besides&#xD;
      physical conditions, balance maintenance depends also on cognitive aspects such as attention,&#xD;
      memory and dual tasking. Plotnik et al. (Plotnik et al. 2011) showed a relationship between&#xD;
      dual tasking abilities and fall risk in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      suggesting that Parkinsonian fallers are easily affected by dual tasking, with a great&#xD;
      likelihood of loss of balance during the execution of daily attention-drawing activities.&#xD;
      Thus, motor skills ranging form very simple to most complex ones can be performed and&#xD;
      monitored for the characterization of learning processes; and training in virtual&#xD;
      environments provides the opportunity to study learning skills and build learning curves&#xD;
      (Holden 2005; Carelli et al. 2009). During VR, complete movement sequences are recorded as a&#xD;
      pattern allowing full investigation motor skills, which is important in accordance with the&#xD;
      notion that motor skill learning is task specific (Karni et al. 1998; Korman et al. 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many researches have recognized the potential of using VR in clinical treatment of&#xD;
      psychopathologies, especially in the anxiety field. Some evidence on the application of VR&#xD;
      exposure therapy to the treatment of specific phobias and PD can be recently found in the&#xD;
      literature (Botella et al. 2004; Pull and Damsa 2008; de Carvalho et al. 2010; Gerardi et al.&#xD;
      2010; Meyerbroker and Emmelkamp 2010; Perez-Ara et al. 2010; Meyerbroker et al. 2011). A&#xD;
      Belgian research studying motor vehicle accident trauma examinees showed that the use of VR&#xD;
      was the most efficient method in treating phobias and that VR exposure provided a safe&#xD;
      controlled therapeutic environment unrelated to treatment circumstances (Wiederhold and&#xD;
      Wiederhold 2010). Therefore, VR exposure is applied interactively, since there is more value&#xD;
      to an exposure where the examinee is active and the environment is dynamic and challenging;&#xD;
      as exposure of this nature enhances alertness and emotional excitement, which are valuable to&#xD;
      the treatment's success. The investigators will examine prevalence and severity in PD&#xD;
      patients taking into consideration that they have higher prevalence of balance impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of the VR method involves research and development costs as well as&#xD;
      maintenance ones, and sometimes technical impediments may take place due to the relying on&#xD;
      advanced and multisensory method. VR method calls for the recruitment of a technician beyond&#xD;
      the professional therapist, which will be thoroughly trained and will operate a large number&#xD;
      of software test-runs (pilots) before introducing it to patients. The common belief that&#xD;
      multisensory exposure, triggering several systems at the same time distract the examinee's&#xD;
      mind and prevent him/ her to be fully immersed (Roy et al. 2010) is refuted. In Sheba&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Center for Advanced Technologies there is a VR laboratory running for years,&#xD;
      enabling the rapid and successful rehabilitation of many patients. Salient and relevant&#xD;
      specification of the VR laboratory can be adjusted to the treatment of balance disorder and&#xD;
      panic. The investigators intend to implement VR method in the treatment of balance disorder&#xD;
      patients, and to investigate its role in ameliorating panic behavior. The investigators&#xD;
      further hypothesize that VR treatment can aid patients with challenging situations and&#xD;
      improve neuro-motor functioning and thus better management in their everyday experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 (evaluation) - to investigate whether there is balance impairment within PD patients&#xD;
      in comparison to matched healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 (treatment) - to investigate whether balance training using VR exposure therapy is&#xD;
      significantly more effective in reducing panic symptoms, than the exposure to still pictures&#xD;
      from the same scene without balance challenge, or from CBT standard protocol for the&#xD;
      treatment of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 Sixty PD patients, men and women at the age of 18-45, will be recruited from Sheba&#xD;
      Medical Center psychiatric clinics and an ad. PD will be assessed using SCID-1 checklist.&#xD;
      Patients and 20 healthy controls matched by age, sex and BMI will complete the MINI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 The same 60 PD patients will be randomized to three treatment groups: (1) 20 through&#xD;
      VR-based balance training; (2) 20 through exposure to still pictures from the same VR scene&#xD;
      but no balance challenge; (3) 20 through CBT for PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study includes a neurological examination which focuses on balance assessment&#xD;
      based on questionnaires and a psychiatric examination for PD diagnosis. In addition, this&#xD;
      research exposes the participants to a medical device (VR), which has been certified by the&#xD;
      FDA and has received the Israeli Ministry of Health approval. This advanced method is used&#xD;
      daily at the Advanced Technologies Department of the Rehabilitation Hospital at Sheba Medical&#xD;
      Center. Furthermore, the identification and contact details of patients and healthy controls&#xD;
      will be encoded to follow anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: The investigators will collect demographic data such as age, sex and education,&#xD;
      basic information such as height and weight for BMI calculation for the matching with healthy&#xD;
      controls. The investigators will also collect medical history and concomitant medicine,&#xD;
      clinical state as well as general morbidity and sports-related questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: The investigators will ask the participants of this research not to take any part in&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic treatment apart from the ones in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panic Disorder Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who participate will be diagnosed using the SCID-1 checklist and MINI for PD&#xD;
      diagnosis and CGI. In addition the participants will go through the following for the&#xD;
      assessment of PD severity and functionality under panic attacks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) In addition, the investigators will use visual&#xD;
           analogue scale (VAS) for the assessment of the panic severity level from one week to the&#xD;
           other (will be applied in each visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are recruited will pass a neurological examination which includes a thorough&#xD;
      balance assessment. Within this assessment the investigators will implement two self-rating&#xD;
      questionnaires: Dizziness Handicap Inventory and the The Activities-specific Balance&#xD;
      Confidence (ABC) Scale, as well as the functional assessment tools implemented by the&#xD;
      neurologist:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Berg Balance Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dynamic Gait Index, DGI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional Gait Assessment, FGA Additionally, objective balance assessment will be done&#xD;
           using VR as given in the detailed description.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also collect the following measures: blood pressure, Galvanic Skin&#xD;
      Conductance and Heart Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAREN system&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR system the investigators will be using is the CAREN™ (Computer Assisted Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Environment) Integrated Reality System, using the CAREN III software. This system is designed&#xD;
      by MOTEK BV, (Amsterdam, The Netherlands, www.motekmedical.com). This system works in&#xD;
      real-time and enables the creation of a variety of controlled and repeatable simulated&#xD;
      environments via dedicated software with 3D visual, sound, and proprioceptive stimuli. It&#xD;
      consists of the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion Platform - CAREN™ consists of an electro-hydraulic motion 2 meter diameter motion&#xD;
      platform (Rexroth Hydraudyne, MOTEK, Micro motion, www.rexroth-hydraudyne.com ) that can be&#xD;
      manipulated with 6 degrees of freedom (x-y-z translation and pitch-roll-yaw rotation). The&#xD;
      movement of the platform is either driven by the subject's movements, or preprogrammed in&#xD;
      synchrony with function curves that define a specific pathway in the virtual environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Force Plates - Two 51 × 47 centimeter force plates (AMTI - Advanced Mechanical Technology,&#xD;
      INC, Massachusetts, USA, www.amtiweb.com) are embedded in the motion platform. The output of&#xD;
      the force plates is three dimensional force and moment data from each platform as well as the&#xD;
      CoP displacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion Capture - Up to 41 passive markers are placed on anatomical landmarks and sampled at&#xD;
      120 Hz to record 3D head, trunk and limb motion. The markers are detected by an optokinetic&#xD;
      system which consists of 12 Vicon infra-red cameras having a resolution of 2 megapixels&#xD;
      (www.vicon.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Projection: The Virtual scene is projected on a large screen (3m × 2.5m). Stereo projection&#xD;
      may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Road scene' In a virtual reality setting, standing on a moving platform, subjects were&#xD;
      required to maintain their balance, while advancing along a pre-defined road (the 'road&#xD;
      scene'). The scene was projected onto a large screen, in front of the subject. The scene&#xD;
      consisted of a virtual road, bounded on both sides by walls. The road itself had flat,&#xD;
      straight sections, vertical bumpy sections (movement along the y-axis), right and left tilts&#xD;
      (rotation of 'z axis' - &quot;roll&quot;) and right and left translations (movement along the 'x axis'&#xD;
      - &quot;sway&quot;). The platform's movement was correlated with the visual stimulus (i.e., when the&#xD;
      subject arrived at a bump on the screen, the platform elevated. When the road tilted, the&#xD;
      platform tilted accordingly in the same direction). The length of the road is 1230m. The&#xD;
      road's velocity was 30 m/sec, which equals to 1.8 km/min or 108 km/h. The specific parameters&#xD;
      of the platform excursions in the 'X' (pitch) and 'Z' axis will be determined following a&#xD;
      pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Road scene' with an additional task The voluntary, secondary task consisted of&#xD;
      intercepting 18 moving targets (colored ball of 12.5 cm diameter) appearing above the road.&#xD;
      Each target could be intercepted when appearing no further than 20 cm from the subject's&#xD;
      hands (which are reflected on the screen as a 4.5 cm in diameter ball). The targets appear,&#xD;
      one at a time, at pre-set points along the road alternately on the right and left sides of&#xD;
      the subject's body. Each ball is displayed for 5 seconds from its appearance and then&#xD;
      disappears (unless it has been intercepted). After intercepting a target, the subject was&#xD;
      instructed to return to the 'home position'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On either of the scenes, the challenge level may be heightened by increasing the platform's&#xD;
      tilt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 A 3-4 hours introductory meeting will take place and will include a couple of hours&#xD;
      assessment using the SCID-1 checklist for the diagnosis of PD, as well as the implementation&#xD;
      of the MINI for psychopathology elimination. A general neurological examination for both&#xD;
      healthy controls and PD patients will include functional balance assessment and self-rating&#xD;
      questionnaires, VR-based evaluation of objective measures of balance maintenance (described&#xD;
      in detail). VR exposure will be done in three consecutive exposures: (a) VR road scene (movie&#xD;
      only) - in case the movie itself evokes anxiety and panic symptoms; (b) balance training&#xD;
      using VR (no movie); (c) movie +balance challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be done in conditions, such as entering a dark closed room, assuring the&#xD;
      minimum of anxiety is evoked. Therefore, the investigators will take VAS subjective report&#xD;
      and physiological measurements from the participant for cardio-vascular fluent monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 The same 60 PD patients will be randomized to three treatment groups: (1) 20 through&#xD;
      VR-based balance training; (2) 20 through exposure to still pictures from the same VR scene&#xD;
      but no balance challenge; (3) 20 through CBT for PD. At this stage too the investigators will&#xD;
      use VAS subjective report of the panic levels during the last week as well as objective&#xD;
      physiological measurements at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the neurologist and psychiatrist at the 5th and last visits, there will be a&#xD;
      CAREN specialist and a physiotherapist from the VR crew in each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Protocol of imbalance treatment using VR exposure therapy (10 visits) 9 visits of&#xD;
           VR-training with/ without parallel task: road scene repeating, which takes 24 minutes,&#xD;
           including preparation and the installment of up to 41 sensors; 45 minutes per visit. The&#xD;
           challenge increases if possible and will consist of sharp slopes and bumpy roads and/ or&#xD;
           cognitive load (additional task). In addition, specific balance parameters will be&#xD;
           collected, HR, GSC and a physiological examination and a verbal conversation at the end&#xD;
           of each visit will take place and inform the participant on his/ her improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the 5th visit there will be another psychiatric evaluation using the same&#xD;
           questionnaires and assessment tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Last visit: a summary meeting with no VR exposure. The investigators will implement all&#xD;
           the assessment tools and questionnaires, as well as a neurological examination. In this&#xD;
           visit the investigators will repeat sway and perturbation measurements and will make a&#xD;
           summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Protocol of imbalance treatment using VR exposure therapy (10 visits) 9 visits of&#xD;
           exposure to still pictures from the same VR scene: still pictures in a loop, which takes&#xD;
           24 minutes, including preparation and the installment of up to 41 sensors; 45 minutes&#xD;
           per visit. In addition, specific balance parameters will be collected, HR, GSC and a&#xD;
           physiological examination and a verbal conversation at the end of each visit will take&#xD;
           place and inform the participant on his/ her improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the 5th visit there will be another psychiatric evaluation using the same&#xD;
           questionnaires and assessment tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Last visit: a summary meeting with no VR exposure. The investigators will implement all&#xD;
           the assessment tools and questionnaires, as well as a neurological examination. In this&#xD;
           visit the investigators will repeat sway and perturbation measurements and will make a&#xD;
           summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CBT standard protocol for the treatment of PD (10 visits) A CBT standard protocol for&#xD;
           the treatment of PD will be applied in all 10 visits. Each visit will last 1 hour,&#xD;
           except for the 5th and last visits, which include a psychiatric assessment using the&#xD;
           same evaluation scales and questionnaires as in the evaluation, and therefore will last&#xD;
           1.5 hours. CBT will be implemented by a therapist, i.e., a psychologist or psychiatrist&#xD;
           trained for the treatment of panic disorder. The therapist evokes emotional feelings&#xD;
           such as vulnerability, disappointment, frustration, joy etc. This supportive therapy&#xD;
           helps the individual to normalize his/ her behavior at the time of a panic-evoking&#xD;
           situation and thereafter. The therapist tries to lead the individual to self-empowerment&#xD;
           by providing him/ her self-defense mechanisms and inner-strengthening tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling the Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assure anonymity of all data collected and medical discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: The investigators intend to interview 60 participants in order to recruit 60 PD&#xD;
      patients, and at the same time the investigators will interview 20 matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same 60 PD patients from Stage 1 will participate in a 10-12 weeks experiment. In&#xD;
      addition, there will be a follow-up within 6 months and 12 months from end of trial, when the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to fill assessment questionnaires regarding their PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test for normal distribution of the dependent variables and then will&#xD;
      examine the differences between the groups using univariate analyses: for continuous&#xD;
      independent variables, such as scores, the investigators will apply t-test and for&#xD;
      categorical variables, such as sex - chi square. All using SPSS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any data to be collected during this study will be used for research purposes only and does&#xD;
      not have diagnostic significance at the moment. However, this study may have clinical&#xD;
      realizations and application in the future. Should the investigators have important findings,&#xD;
      this research group has intentions to publish them.&#xD;
