  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the timing of post-exercise feeding on 15&#xD;
      hours post-exercise glycemic control and metabolic flexibility and in overweight and obese&#xD;
      young men with a family history of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - To determine the temporal effects of post-exercise feeding (i.e., immediate&#xD;
      post-exercise vs. 3 hours post-exercise) on glycemic control, peripheral insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      and metabolic flexibility (as evaluated by sleep RQ) in this same group of participants. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a 3 hour delay in nutrient ingestion will promote significantly greater&#xD;
      improvements in glucose tolerance, metabolic flexibility, and peripheral insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      both immediately and several hours post-ingestion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study is cross-sectional and utilizes a within-subject design to study young men&#xD;
      under two different nutrient timing protocols, which are randomly-ordered and spaced at least&#xD;
      2 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be screened for eligibility via phone or email and scheduled for an&#xD;
           initial visit, in order to consent to the study and undergo some basic baseline&#xD;
           evaluations. We will rely on participant self-report to verify absence of chronic&#xD;
           disease or drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After consenting to the study, fasting blood glucose, height, weight, and air&#xD;
           displacement plethysmography (BodPod®) will be conducted in the Clinical Exercise&#xD;
           Physiology Laboratory at The George Washington University, in Washington, DC. These&#xD;
           measures may occur on the same day as consent or at another scheduled time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After screening, consenting, and baseline assessments, participants will undergo 2&#xD;
           experimental conditions, which will be randomly-ordered and approximately 2 weeks apart.&#xD;
           If possible, both of these experimental visits will be scheduled shortly after the&#xD;
           consent form is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A registered dietitian will instruct participants to eat a standardized (35 kcal∙kg body&#xD;
           weight-1∙day-1) diet comprising 60% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 20% fat for 3 days&#xD;
           prior to both experimental sessions. This instruction will be administered after the&#xD;
           BodPod® assessment is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants will report to the USDA Laboratory chamber at 7:30 AM for the experimental&#xD;
           sessions. Height, weight blood pressure and heart rate will be measured, then a fasting&#xD;
           blood sample (5 cc) will be obtained for determination of basal glucose &amp; insulin&#xD;
           concentrations. A Hidalgo Ambulatory Monitoring Sensor Array Vest (Equivital I: Hidalgo&#xD;
           Ltd., Cambridge UK) will be worn by all participants measured in the calorimeter for the&#xD;
           entire 48 period. This device measures heart rate (HR), heat flux, core body&#xD;
           temperature, posture and physical activity (PA) from a built-in accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Then, the sensor portion of the CGMS then will be placed subcutaneously and the CGMS&#xD;
           calibrated with whole blood using the Accu-Check Advantage (Roche Diagnostics,&#xD;
           Indianapolis, IL) glucometer. Participants will then enter the whole room calorimeter&#xD;
           (metabolic chamber) and complete a hunger scale. Hunger will be evaluated 10-20 minutes&#xD;
           before the start of each meal and 2 hours after the resistance exercise bout. On the&#xD;
           first day, participants eat a standard breakfast provided by the USDA kitchen at&#xD;
           approximately 7:45-8:00AM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Gutierrez or a research assistant will take obtain glucometer readings before and 60&#xD;
           minutes after each meal to calibrate the the CGMS. These evaluations will occur 4-6&#xD;
           times over the course of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Standardized meals (lunch at 11:00AM and dinner at 7:00PM) will be provided for subjects&#xD;
           by the USDA. Blood samples (5 cc each) will be collected prior to and 120 minutes after&#xD;
           breakfast and lunch; and prior to and 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-min following the start of&#xD;
           the evening meal for the determination of post-meal responses in glucose &amp; insulin. A&#xD;
           trained phlebotomist with at least 50 successful IV catheter placements will place an IV&#xD;
           catheter into the participant's median antecubital vein before the evening meal to&#xD;
           facilitate multiple draws after the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. On the second day, subjects will awake in the calorimeter at approximately 7:00 AM and a&#xD;
           fasting blood sample (5 cc) will be obtained for determination of basal concentrations&#xD;
           of glucose &amp; insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. At about 7:30 AM, subjects will eat a standardized breakfast to be consumed by 8:00 AM.&#xD;
           Two hours after a standardized lunch meal, served at 11:00AM, participants will perform&#xD;
           one of the following resistance exercise nutrient-timing protocols: immediate&#xD;
           post-exercise nutrition at approximately 2:00 PM 3 hour post exercise nutrition at&#xD;
           approximately 5:00 PM). All participants will undergo both experimental conditions at&#xD;
           different testing sessions.&#xD;
