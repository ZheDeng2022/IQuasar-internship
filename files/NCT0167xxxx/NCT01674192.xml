  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single 2 mg oral dose of&#xD;
      prucalopride in subjects with various degrees of renal impairment compared with normal renal&#xD;
      function and to monitor the safety profile of prucalopride in subjects with renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prucalopride might accumulate and exhibit a different pharmacokinetic profile in renally&#xD;
      impaired subjects compared with the normal population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open label, single-dose, pharmacokinetic trial with prucalopride in&#xD;
      subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment. Subjects were classified into one of four&#xD;
      renal function groups, as defined by a 24-hour creatinine clearance determination (CRCL)&#xD;
      obtained within 2 weeks before trial entry. Each subject was administered a single 2mg oral&#xD;
      dose of prucalopride. Plasma samples and complete urine collections were obtained from 0&#xD;
      through 120 h (6 days) after dosing to characterize the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride.&#xD;

&#xD;
        All subjects had to meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Males or females. Females were to be of non-childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal subjects had to meet the following additional inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demographically comparable to the subjects with renal impairment, within 30% of mean&#xD;
             weight and height and 10% of the mean age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical examination, clinical laboratory results, and 12-lead ECG within normal&#xD;
             limits at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No intake of medication, including over-the-counter medication, during a pre-trial&#xD;
             7-day drug-free washout period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with renal impairment had to meet the following additional inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable severity of renal disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medications to treat underlying disease states or medical conditions&#xD;
             related to renal insufficiency were allowed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of medication and/or treatment regimen from 2 months prior to and during&#xD;
             the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with stable cardiovascular disease could be enrolled, provided that the&#xD;
             investigator felt their condition would not interfere with the results of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects who met any of the following criteria were excluded from the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to prucalopride or inactive ingredients in the&#xD;
             prucalopride capsule or to related prokinetic compounds;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any other investigational drug within 30 days prior to signing the consent or&#xD;
             intention to take any investigational drug during the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any abnormal medical history, physical examination, ECG, or laboratory results;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with renal impairment who met any of the following criteria were excluded&#xD;
             from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any abnormality in medical history, physical examination, ECG, or laboratory results&#xD;
