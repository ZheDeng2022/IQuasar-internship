    <textblock>
      Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) research has focused on the sensory features and failed to&#xD;
      address an important aspect of RLS; i.e. a 'hyperarousal' or profound chronic sleep loss&#xD;
      without significant excessive daytime sleepiness. This hyperarousal produces RLS symptoms by&#xD;
      overwhelming the normal inhibitory processes needed to decrease sensory and motor cortical&#xD;
      activity for resting and sleep. Thus the hyperarousal produces both the RLS need to move when&#xD;
      trying to rest and the inability to maintain sleep. The biological consequences of this&#xD;
      hyperarousal process on sleep (increased wake time) and cortical excitability (as&#xD;
      demonstrated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)) are postulated to reflect increased&#xD;
      degree of excitatory glutamatergic activity, and therefore affected brain regions will show&#xD;
      relatively increased glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) on MR spectroscopy (MRS). Changes in&#xD;
      inhibitory activity and GABA may also occur, but less significantly than the increase in&#xD;
      Glu/Gln. Our pilot MRS data discovered a new abnormality in RLS: increased Thalamic Glx (Glu&#xD;
      + Gln) that correlated well with sleep measures of hyperarousal. Glx levels are not specific&#xD;
      for the neurotransmitter role of Glu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project RLS and matching controls subjects will be studied using polysomnograms (PSG)&#xD;
      and TMS and 7T MRI for MRS that provides accurate measurement of Gln levels, which reflect&#xD;
      mostly neurotransmitter Glu activity. The first aim is to confirm that Gln is increased in&#xD;
      the thalamus and to determine if this also occurs in the motor and sensory cortices. The&#xD;
      relation between Glu, Gln and GABA will also be evaluated. Second, assessments will be made&#xD;
      of the degree of relation between Gln increase and the hyperarousal effects on sleep and&#xD;
      cortical excitability (TMS). This would demonstrate that abnormally increased Glu activity is&#xD;
      primary to RLS hyperarousal and radically changes the emphasis in RLS to be less on dopamine&#xD;
      and more on Glu-hyperarousal as a major feature of RLS.This is an entirely new direction for&#xD;
      RLS research and treatment development. The new concept of hyperarousal adds a missing&#xD;
      dimension to understanding RLS, namely the discovery of the Glu abnormality and its central&#xD;
      relation to the other hyperarousal features.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moderate to severe Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a major public health problem,&#xD;
      significantly affecting 1.5 to 3% of adult Americans (3 - 7 million), resulting in profound&#xD;
      sleep loss and an urge to move during sitting or resting in the later part of the day. Work&#xD;
      productivity is decreased by 20%, quality of life is as bad or worse than that for other&#xD;
      chronic diseases, e.g. arthritis and diabetes, and there is increased cardio-vascular disease&#xD;
      risk. Current approved dopaminergic treatments fail to improve sleep time, engender impulsive&#xD;
      behaviors and may make RLS worse. New treatments and new research directions to find them are&#xD;
      needed. The current research focus on the sensory features has failed to address an important&#xD;
      aspect of RLS; i.e. a 'hyperarousal' or profound chronic sleep loss without significant&#xD;
      excessive daytime sleepiness. This hyperarousal produces RLS symptoms by overwhelming the&#xD;
      normal inhibitory processes needed to decrease sensory and motor cortical activity for&#xD;
      resting and sleep. Thus the hyperarousal produces both the RLS need to move when trying to&#xD;
      rest and the inability to maintain sleep. The biological consequences of this hyperarousal&#xD;
      process on sleep (increased wake time) and cortical excitability (as demonstrated by&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)) are postulated to reflect increased degree of&#xD;
      excitatory glutamatergic activity, and therefore affected brain regions will show relatively&#xD;
      increased glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) on MR spectroscopy (MRS). Changes in inhibitory&#xD;
      activity and GABA may also occur, but less significantly than the increase in Glu/Gln. Our&#xD;

      the emphasis in RLS to be less on dopamine and more on Glu-hyperarousal as a major feature of&#xD;
      RLS. This is an entirely new direction for RLS research and treatment development. The new&#xD;
      concept of hyperarousal adds a missing dimension to understanding RLS, namely the discovery&#xD;
      of the Glu abnormality and its central relation to the other hyperarousal features. It opens&#xD;
      the opportunity to develop new animal and cell RLS research. It provides new directions for&#xD;
      medication treatment development, changes the emphasis for primary treatment toward Glu drugs&#xD;
      and the MRS provides a useful and accessible measure for evaluating medication treatment&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
