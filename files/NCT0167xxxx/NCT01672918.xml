      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a genetic disorder of the lymph system.&#xD;
      People with ALPS often have swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck and armpit. They also&#xD;
      have a much higher risk of developing lymphoma. It is not always easy to determine whether&#xD;
      the swollen lymph nodes are caused by ALPS or by lymphoma. Researchers want to see whether&#xD;
      different imaging studies can show the difference between ALPS and lymphoma. The studies used&#xD;
      will be positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT). Researchers will use&#xD;
      a drug called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to look at the lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how well imaging studies can distinguish between swollen lymph nodes caused by ALPS&#xD;
      or by lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals must be 5 years of age or older and enrolled on the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health natural history study of ALPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants should either have lymphoma or have symptoms that suggest possible&#xD;
           lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an FDG-PET/CT scan. It will be performed according to standard&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the results of the scan do not show lymphoma, participants will stay on the study for&#xD;
           1 year for clinical follow up. They may have a second FDG-PET/CT scan if there is a&#xD;
           change in symptoms. Such changes include further enlargement of lymph nodes, unexplained&#xD;
           fevers, or weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the results of the scan show evidence of new or worsening lymphoma, treatment on this&#xD;
           study will end. Further tests based on clinical symptoms, including a lymph node biopsy,&#xD;
           may be done under the ALPS natural history study to rule out or make a diagnosis of&#xD;
           lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) is an inherited disorder associated with&#xD;
      defective lymphocyte apoptosis, which is clinically characterized by prominent nonmalignant&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and overt autoimmune diseases such as hemolytic anemia,&#xD;
      autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Additionally, ALPS patients have a&#xD;
      significantly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (HL). The diagnosis of lymphoma is particularly troublesome in ALPS because many ALPS&#xD;
      manifestations overlap with clinical features suggestive of lymphoma. Therefore, individuals&#xD;
      with ALPS may undergo repeated biopsies during the course of the disease. Fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is a noninvasive&#xD;
      test that may help us discriminate benign from malignant lymphadenopathy in patients with&#xD;
      ALPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with ALPS and clinical symptoms suggestive of lymphoma, such as a sudden&#xD;
      increase in focal lymphadenopathy and/or systemic B symptoms associated with lymphoma, we&#xD;
      want to investigate whether FDG-PET/CT is useful in determining a plan of action by assisting&#xD;
      in locating the most active lymph node and determining whether a surgical biopsy is&#xD;
      warranted. Under this protocol, FDG-PET/CT scans will be done to rule out lymphoma. A lymph&#xD;
      node biopsy may be necessary to determine the pathology of the lymph node and will not be&#xD;
      done for research purposes alone.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To qualify for enrollment, patients must meet all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Fulfill current criteria for the diagnosis of ALPS, which includes documented chronic&#xD;
             nonmalignant lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly, and either greater than or equal to&#xD;
             1.5% T-cell receptor alpha/beta+ DNTs in the peripheral blood or confirmed RAS&#xD;
             mutation with or without elevated alpha/beta DNTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be enrolled in ALPS natural history protocol #93-I-0063.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have 1 or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Sudden enlargement of at least 1 lymph node or group of lymph nodes over&#xD;
                  baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Systemic symptoms suspicious for lymphoma (i.e., loss of weight, loss of&#xD;
                  appetite, fatigue, night sweats, fever, and pruritus).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. A histologically proven diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be 5 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded if any of the following is present:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concurrent proven infection or inflammatory disease (e.g., sarcoidosis), which itself&#xD;
             often shows increased FDG uptake by PET and which could interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hyperglycemia (regardless of etiology) determined by fasting glucose of &gt;200 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Weight in excess of 400 lb, which will exceed the weight limit for the scanner table.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnancy or breast-feeding. For women of childbearing potential, a negative urine or&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test is required within 24 hours prior to an FDG-PET/CT scan.&#xD;
