      The increase of nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infection Nontuberculous mycobacteria lung&#xD;
      infection (NTM-LD) becomes an important clinical concern [1] because the rate of NTM&#xD;
      infection has increased over the past ten years [2-3]. According to a study in Taiwan, NTM-LD&#xD;
      increased from 1.26 to 7.94 per 100,000 inpatients/year during 2000 to 2008 [2]. The reasons&#xD;
      for this increase are not readily clear, but could be related to the growth in numbers of the&#xD;
      acquired immunocompromised population and advances of technique for mycobacterial culture&#xD;
      [4-7]. Among the NTM infection in Taiwan, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and M. abscessus&#xD;
      (MAB) were most frequently isolated [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difficulty in early diagnosing and confirming true NTM-LD However, NTM exists in the&#xD;
      environment ubiquitously, so the relevance (true disease patient number over the number of&#xD;
      patients with disease or just colonization) is far less than 100% and varied in different NTM&#xD;
      species. For example, previous studies have shown that the presence of M. kansasii and MAC&#xD;
      had a clinical relevance around 47~70% and 35~42%, respectively [8-9]. As for MAB which is&#xD;
      emerging pathogen worldwide, has a relevance of 33% [9]. According to contemporary NTM&#xD;
      guidelines established by American thoracic society, NTM pulmonary infection is diagnosed by&#xD;
      multiple criteria including microbiology of respiratory specimen and clinical findings as&#xD;
      well as radiographic findings [1]. In microbiology criteria, two or more sets of positive&#xD;
      sputum mycobacterial culture for the same NTM species within one year is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because NTM colonization is not uncommon in respiratory tract, diagnosis of true pulmonary&#xD;
      NTM infection is a great challenge in clinical practice. Actually, microbiology tests for&#xD;
      mycobacteria are neither timely nor efficient. Mycobacterial culture is time-consuming, which&#xD;
      needed weeks to wait the results even though it's current gold standard for micro-organism&#xD;
      identification [10]. The nucleic acid amplification method such as polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      could not discriminate true NTM infection and solely colonization because the micro-organism&#xD;
      is present in both situations [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To early diagnose and then start treatment of NTM infection is important because NTM&#xD;
      pulmonary infection might be rapid lethal infection in intensive care unit or in patients who&#xD;
      had not received early proper treatment [6]. In addition, MAC or MAB which are most common in&#xD;
      Taiwan are resistant to most of anti-tuberculosis regimen. Hence, more rapid and accurate&#xD;
      diagnostic test should be developed [1-2, 6] The help of innate immunity in diagnosing NTM-LD&#xD;
      The body inflammatory marker, represent our immune response, would be an indicator for&#xD;
      differentiating true mycobacterial pulmonary infection from colonization while the first set&#xD;
      of mycobacterial culture grew NTM [12-15]. Both interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-alpha play critical roles in protective immunity to mycobacterial infections [16-17].&#xD;
      These responses are linked to engagement of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) that is critical for&#xD;
      mycobacterial infection [18]. However, the TLR-2 expression has not been evaluated between&#xD;
      patients with NTM infection and colonization. According to the success of application of&#xD;
      interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis detection [19], we understand the specific&#xD;
      immune response is helpful to diagnose mycobacterial infection. We therefore focus on the&#xD;
      expression of TLR-2 and associated downstream cytokines in our patients with MAC or MAB lung&#xD;
      disease, which accounts the most of NTM infection [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design in our study for diagnosis In order to investigate the help of host immune in&#xD;
      diagnosing NTM pulmonary infection, we initially compare the baseline expression of TLR-2 and&#xD;
      downstream cytokines in the MAC or MAB infected patients and colonized subjects. Then, we&#xD;
      perform an in-vitro stimulation test using mycobacteria (MAC or MAB) for co-culturing with&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients. The TLR-2 expression and cytokines activation&#xD;
      will be examined after the stimulation test. We then analyze the expression difference&#xD;
      between NTM-LD and colonization.&#xD;
