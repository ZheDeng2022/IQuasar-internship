  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, an uncalibrated minimally invasive Pulse-code Modulator (PCM) has been developed:&#xD;
      the MostCare system. This monitoring system is powered by Pressure Recording Analytical&#xD;
      Method (PRAM), which is based on the mathematical analysis of the arterial pressure profile&#xD;
      changes. It allows beat-to-beat Stroke Volume (SV) assessment from the pressure signal&#xD;
      recorded invasively in radial, brachial, or femoral arteries. The most innovative features of&#xD;
      this method are: 1) the lack of a calibration requirement, 2) the analysis of the arterial&#xD;
      wave signal is performed at 1000 Hz, 3) a dedicated arterial catheter-transducer is&#xD;
      unnecessary. MostCare is powered by PRAM (Pressure Recording Analytical Method) algorithm.&#xD;
      The investigators primary end-point was to evaluate the relationship between Cardiac Output&#xD;
      (CO) measured by MostCare with CO calculated with Echo-Doppler in Intensive Care Unit (ICU)&#xD;
      patients under different clinical conditions. As a secondary end-point the investigators&#xD;
      evaluated the relationship between CO measured by MostCare with CO obtained with&#xD;
      thermodilution techniques (standard bolus thermodilution or transpulmonary thermodilution,&#xD;
      i.e. PiCCO system). This is a prospective multicentre observational study.&#xD;

      (*) Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. MostCare system data acquisition Before each CO measurement, the arterial pressure&#xD;
      catheter and transducer quality will be assessed as follows: easy aspiration of 5 ml of blood&#xD;
      easily re-injected without resistance; visual assessment of the quality of the arterial&#xD;
      waveform contour; adequate response to the flush test (square wave). If necessary, the best&#xD;
      position for the signal quality will be checked by extending the wrist and manipulating the&#xD;
      catheter. For each determination of Echo-Doppler (and ThD-CO when applicable), a&#xD;
      corresponding value for MostCare must be obtained by averaging the individual beats over the&#xD;
      same time necessary to obtain the Echo-doppler-CO (and ThD-CO when applicable) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Echo-Doppler data acquisition (transoesophageal - TOE - or transthoracic - TTE - echo)&#xD;
      Echo-Doppler-CO will be measured using the standard formula CSA x VTI (cross sectional area x&#xD;
      velocity time integral x heart rate in ml/min). 2D measurement of the aortic annulus diameter&#xD;
      allows calculation of the flow CSA which is then multiplied by the VTI (velocity time&#xD;
      integral) of the Pulsed Doppler flow velocity profile across the aortic valve to determine&#xD;
      the SV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other hemodynamic variables as an ancillary part of the study will compare shortening&#xD;
      fraction (SF) or EF fraction from Echocardiography with CCE and dp/dt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Thermodilution data acquisition (ThD-CO) (when applicable) Data coming from ThD pulmonary&#xD;
      artery catheter (PAC) or a CVC + femoral artery catheter (transpulmonary thermodilution,&#xD;
      PiCCO system) will be collected from the monitor itself or the system for patient monitoring&#xD;
      used in the units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For standard PAC-ThD-CO, five consecutive injections of 10 ml of 5% glucose cold solution&#xD;
      will be randomly injected during respiratory cycle over a 5-min period. Thermodilution-CO (or&#xD;
      PiCCO-CO) will be calculated as the average of the five measurements. All these 5&#xD;
      measurements will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MostCare, Echo-doppler (and Thermodilution when applicable) Change in ventilator parameters,&#xD;
      sedation drugs, or fluid infusions or vasopressor dose will not be allowed during the&#xD;
      acquisition time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (*) Study timing and procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient CO determinations will be performed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandatory measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Baseline: (MostCare + Echo-doppler simultaneously, and MostCare + Echo-doppler +&#xD;
      Thermodilution when applicable) = single comparison between techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded but not mandatory measurements (fitting to the therapeutic protocol used in each&#xD;
      center):&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Pre- and post- treatment (fluid challenge, vasoactive drugs and inotropics changes)&#xD;
      (MostCare + Echo-doppler simultaneously, and MostCare + Echo-doppler + Thermodilution when&#xD;
      applicable) = dynamic comparison between techniques (two measures). This will allow a&#xD;
      sub-analysis of CO (the trend of CO) changes, validity of trend, for both SV and CO before&#xD;
      and after a therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient: demographic, anthropometric, pre-medical history, indication(s) for ICU admission;&#xD;
      (cardiovascular diseases and cardiac function, respiratory diseases, etc...), severity scores&#xD;
      (SAPS II, SOFA, ….).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled will be analysed in intention-to-treat even data recording failed. In&#xD;
      this case, that would be a limit if any, for the tested technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic MostCare: SV, HR, CO, CCE, ∆P/∆T, ABPs, ABPd, ABPm. Other hemodynamic data: CVP,&#xD;
      PaoP, SvO2, lactate,... Echocardiography: stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output. Other&#xD;
      hemodynamic variables are allowed to be collected by Echo according to the centre protocols&#xD;
      and the experience of each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac and vasoactive drugs dose or infusion rate will be collected: dobutamine, dopamine,&#xD;
      norepinephrine, epinephrine, nitrates, beta-blockers, ACE-I,ecc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilatory: mechanical ventilation settings: mode of ventilation (CPAP, BiPAP, VC, PC),&#xD;
      pressure support (if applicable), peak and plateau pressure, PEEP level, FiO2 oxygenation&#xD;
      (SaO2, PaO2,…) ICU stay and outcome: morbidity (number and type of complications), length of&#xD;
      stay, mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (*) Statistical analysis and methodology, number of patients to be enrolled, duration of the&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data will be copied on an excel file to be properly independently analyzed with a&#xD;
      statistical software. Correlation tests (Spearman or Pearson), Student paired t-test, and&#xD;
      Bland-Altman analysis will be applied. A minimum of 30 patients per centre will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study in a period of 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This &quot;minimum number&quot; of patients is mandatory as: 1) the enrollment of 30 patients per&#xD;
      centre eliminates the potential bias that may occur when few data come from a single centre,&#xD;
      2) minimum 300 patients enrolled represents a suitable number to obtain the &quot;statistical&#xD;
      power&quot; necessary to validate the comparison between the different methods, and 3) further&#xD;
      analysis and comparisons in subgroup of patients having similar clinical settings can be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
