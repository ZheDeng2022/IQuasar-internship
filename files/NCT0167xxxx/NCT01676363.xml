  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diflunisal is an anti-inflammatory drug (like ASA or ibuprofen) that has been used as a&#xD;
      painkiller for 20 years. Recent research shows that it may have an anti-HIV effect in the&#xD;
      laboratory. Approximately 20 HIV-infected adults who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      will be given diflunisal by mouth twice daily for 4 weeks, at a dose that has been shown to&#xD;
      be safe when used to treat pain. Subjects will be monitored closely for safety and will have&#xD;
      frequent blood tests during the study to see if the drug has any effect on the level of HIV&#xD;
      in their blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following informed consent, potential subjects will undergo a screening visit to determine&#xD;
      study eligibility. Within 2 weeks of screening, they will undergo a Day 1 visit for blood&#xD;
      testing. At the Day 8 visit on the following Monday, after study visit procedures have been&#xD;
      completed, they will commence taking diflunisal 500 mg twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks (Days&#xD;
      8-36, study treatment period), during which they will be seen once a week for blood tests.&#xD;
      Following the last dose of diflunisal which will be taken on the morning of Day 36, they will&#xD;
      be seen for blood tests after 1 week off the study drug (Days 43, washout phase), and again&#xD;
      for a final visit after 2 weeks off study drug, on Day 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to take diflunisal 500 mg by mouth in two doses approximately 12&#xD;
      hours apart (+ or - 1 hour), with or without food. A 2-week supply will be dispensed on Days&#xD;
      8 and 22. Study medication bottles (empty or not) will be returned to the clinic on Days 22&#xD;
      and 36. Pill counts will be performed to assess adherence. Adherence will further be&#xD;
      evaluated by measuring diflunisal drug levels in plasma samples collected weekly starting at&#xD;
      the baseline visit, and assayed at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the subject has provided informed consent, a screening visit will be performed&#xD;
      including a complete medical history and record of concomitant medications to determine study&#xD;
      eligibility. Complete physical exam, CBC, platelet count, serum creatinine and estimated GFR,&#xD;
      serum potassium, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, CD4 cell count, and pregnancy test for women of&#xD;
      child-bearing potential will be performed at the screening visit and repeated at the final&#xD;
      study visit. At each study visit, blood will be drawn for HIV RNA, and a serum sample will be&#xD;
      collected and stored for measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP), d-dimer, and possibly other&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers. Plasma (for diflunisal drug level measurement) and peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMC's) will be collected and stored weekly from the baseline visit to Day&#xD;
      50. PBMC's will be frozen and shipped in batches to Eric Verdin, MD at the Gladstone&#xD;
      Institute of Virology and Immunology (1650 Owens St San Francisco, CA 94158, USA) for&#xD;
      analysis of T cell subsets (naïve, memory CD4 and CD8 T cells) and levels of protein&#xD;
      acetylation (histone or other) as a surrogate marker of drug activity. Adverse events and&#xD;
      concomitant medications will be recorded at the baseline visit and updated weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the final study visit, subjects will be compensated for their time in the&#xD;
      amount of $500. Subjects who need to discontinue the study early, e.g. due to significant&#xD;
      clinical or laboratory adverse events related to the study drug, will receive the full&#xD;
      stipend at the end of their participation in the study. Subjects who choose to withdraw from&#xD;
      the study early or who are withdrawn for study noncompliance will not be eligible to receive&#xD;
      the stipend. Subjects who require ongoing reimbursement for travel expenses to enable them to&#xD;
      attend study visits will receive advances on their stipend upon providing receipts for&#xD;
      parking, etc.&#xD;
