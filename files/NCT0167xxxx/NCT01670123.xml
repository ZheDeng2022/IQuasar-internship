      This three-year intervention development proposal is submitted to the NIMH DATR Mood&#xD;
      Disorders/Sleep Disorders Program A2-AID and is led by a New Investigator. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to further develop and then evaluate the clinical utility of a new personalized&#xD;
      smart-phone intervention to enhance illness self-management in people with bipolar disorder.&#xD;
      Bipolar disorder is a heterogeneous fluctuating condition and a leading source of disability.&#xD;
      Consistent with NIMH Strategic Aim 3.2, self-monitoring tools are vital to clinical&#xD;
      management and evidence-based psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder. Practice&#xD;
      guidelines state that all patients should receive education in self-monitoring and&#xD;
      identifying adaptive responses to early warning signs and symptoms. Advances in technology&#xD;
      have enabled electronic monitoring of patient-reported outcomes using mobile devices - an&#xD;
      assessment strategy called Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Using freely available&#xD;
      software, we have developed a preliminary version of a novel smart-phone intervention that&#xD;
      integrates EMA with brief psychosocial intervention designed for people with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. Mobile real-time interventions have been successfully applied in other chronic&#xD;
      illnesses and have theoretical advantages over clinic-based interventions in motivating and&#xD;
      cuing health-protective behavior. Our new intervention is called Personalized Real-Time&#xD;
      Intervention for Stabilizing Mood (PRISM), and it delivers tailored intervention content&#xD;
      naturalistically at the moment that symptoms occur. We recently conducted a small&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study of PRISM in outpatient adults with bipolar disorder that suggests the&#xD;
      intervention is feasible, presents no technological or operational barriers, yields data that&#xD;
      corresponds with clinical ratings, and is perceived as useful by participants. Building from&#xD;
      our preliminary work, we propose to further develop the intervention based on participant&#xD;
      feedback and theoretically-driven enhancements. We will then conduct a randomized trial to&#xD;
      assess the clinical utility of this new intervention over 12 weeks. Specifically, we will&#xD;
      randomize a sample of 90 adults aged 18 and older with Bipolar Disorder I or II to one of two&#xD;
      experimental conditions. Participants in both conditions will participate in two in-person&#xD;
      sessions adapted from an evidence-based psychosocial intervention for bipolar disorder, aimed&#xD;
      at identifying early warning signs and adaptive responses to symptom fluctuations. The&#xD;
      Control condition will participate in the in-person sessions, and the PRISM condition will&#xD;
      also utilize the smart phone device for 12 weeks. In this pilot trial, we will compare&#xD;
      outcomes between the two conditions on standard clinical ratings of depressive and manic&#xD;
      symptoms, along with psychosocial functioning. We will assess predictors of compliance and&#xD;
      changes in outcomes in the PRISM condition to inform a larger effectiveness trial. We will&#xD;
      use exploratory analyses to further refine the intervention, including capitalizing on the&#xD;
      rich repeated measures obtained by the device. This study will provide a strong basis for a&#xD;
      larger effectiveness trial, along with a potentially useful tool to enhance self-management&#xD;
      in bipolar disorder. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder is a leading cause of&#xD;
      disability, and many people do not have access to evidence-based psychosocial interventions.&#xD;
      Mobile devices may prove more effective than clinic-based interventions, because they deliver&#xD;
      self-management strategies at the moment that symptoms occur. To lead to a larger&#xD;
      effectiveness study, we propose to further develop our novel intervention uses mobile&#xD;
      technology to monitor and intervene with symptoms in real-time, and then conduct a 12-week&#xD;
      randomized trial in 90 patients to evaluate the acceptability and short-term efficacy of our&#xD;
      smart-phone based intervention for bipolar disorder.&#xD;
