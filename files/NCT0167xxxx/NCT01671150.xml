  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive disorders occur at a high rate in patients with inflammatory disorders, with a&#xD;
      point prevalence of 15-29%, which is two to three times greater than that observed in the&#xD;
      general population. Substantial evidence has shown that inflammation and increases in&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokine activity play a critical role in the onset and perpetuation of&#xD;
      depression and depressive symptoms (e.g. insomnia, fatigue) in those who are co-morbid for&#xD;
      inflammatory disorders. Consistent with this, experimental work has shown that an&#xD;
      inflammatory challenge can increase depressed mood in an otherwise healthy sample. Based on&#xD;
      these findings, there has been a growing interest in whether inflammatory processes can&#xD;
      contribute to depression in a causal manner and how these effects might occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the observation that inflammatory processes trigger social withdrawal, coupled with&#xD;
      evidence that feelings of 'social disconnection' play a critical role in the onset and&#xD;
      perpetuation of (non-inflammatory forms of) depression, it is surprising that the social&#xD;
      psychological consequences of inflammation and their contribution to depression have not been&#xD;
      more fully explored. Here, we suggest that inflammation may increase feelings of social&#xD;
      disconnection and that these social psychological changes may be an important contributor to&#xD;
      inflammation-associated depression. Indeed, preliminary data demonstrated that an&#xD;
      experimentally-induced inflammatory challenge (endotoxin) led to increases in self-reported&#xD;
      feelings of social disconnection (e.g., &quot;I feel disconnected from others&quot;) in addition to&#xD;
      increases in depressed mood. Aside from these findings, however, there are no studies that&#xD;
      have explored the effect of inflammatory processes on social experience in humans. The&#xD;
      over-arching objective of this proposal is to explore the experiential and neural correlates&#xD;
      of inflammatory-induced changes in social experience (e.g., feelings of social&#xD;
      disconnection), which may provide a critical missing link in understanding the relationship&#xD;
      between inflammation and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (n=100) will be randomly assigned to receive either endotoxin or placebo and&#xD;
      will then be monitored for the next six hours. Blood draws to assess cytokine levels as well&#xD;
      as self-reported feelings of social disconnection and depressed mood will be collected&#xD;
      hourly. In addition, at the time of peak cytokine response, participants will complete a&#xD;
      neuroimaging session to examine the effect of inflammatory challenge on neural sensitivity to&#xD;
      social rejection and social acceptance. It is hypothesized that endotoxin will increase&#xD;
      feelings of social disconnection over time, and that the underlying neural sensitivities that&#xD;
      give rise to these feelings (e.g., increased neural sensitivity to social rejection;&#xD;
      decreased neural sensitivity to social acceptance) will contribute to inflammatory-induced&#xD;
      depressed mood.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be required to be in good general health (as evaluated during the&#xD;
             phone and in-person screening sessions described below), and to be between 18-50 years&#xD;
             of age. All participants will be required to be fluent in English and to be&#xD;
             right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Following a structured telephone interview, prospective participants with the&#xD;
             following conditions will not advance to the in-person screening session:&#xD;
             claustrophobia or presence of metal in their body (relevant for the neuroimaging&#xD;
             component of the study), pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the next 6 months,&#xD;
             presence of chronic mental or physical illness, history of allergies, autoimmune,&#xD;
             liver, or other severe chronic diseases, current and regular use of prescription&#xD;
             medications, nightshift work or time zone shifts (&gt; 3hrs) within the previous 6 weeks,&#xD;
             or previous history of fainting during blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Furthermore, the absence of significant health problems or medication use history will be&#xD;
        confirmed by an in-person screening session. Any participant who has any of the following&#xD;
        conditions will be ineligible for the study: Medical conditions. (1) presence of co-morbid&#xD;
