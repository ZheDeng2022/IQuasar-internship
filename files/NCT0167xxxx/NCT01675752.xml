      1. Protocol Summary Title: SHARP: Small Hyperplastic and Adenomatous Reliability Protocol&#xD;
      Purpose: To compare the accuracy of NBI-in vivo differentiation between hyperplastic and&#xD;
      adenomatous &lt;10 mm polyps with that of histology in an European multi-center study. To assess&#xD;
      variability among endoscopists in NBI accuracy. We also aim to assess whether this technology&#xD;
      impacts the appropriateness of surveillance intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: 1) Before starting the patient enrollment, the participating endoscopists will attend&#xD;
      an internet-based training program on the in vivo differentiation between hyperplastic and&#xD;
      adenomatous polyps. Following this course, a qualifying examination will be required for each&#xD;
      endoscopist to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Patients who are scheduled for screening or diagnostic colonoscopy will be considered for&#xD;
      inclusion. Patients with at least one histologically verified &lt;10 mm polyp will be included.&#xD;
      In order to measure NBI feasibility, each included polyp will be in vivo assessed by NBI in&#xD;
      order to rank between a high- and a low- level of diagnostic confidence, and thereafter will&#xD;
      be sent for histological assessment. NBI- and histological accuracy in differentiating&#xD;
      between hyperplastic and adenomatous lesions will be analyzed and compared, in order to&#xD;
      assess the NBI-sensitivity and specificity. The primary outcomes are to measure the NBI&#xD;
      feasibility and accuracy in the study population, and to assess the variability among the&#xD;
      endoscopists. Secondary outcome measures will be a cost analysis on how much savings would be&#xD;
      achieved by not referring NBI-diagnosed hyperplastic polyps to histology, and a clinical&#xD;
      inference on how many patients would be scheduled for an inappropriate post-polypectomy&#xD;
      follow up, when follow up schedule is based on NBI classification. Clinical results will be&#xD;
      analyzed using various statistical measures of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Site Locations: 10 European centres with NBI-technology&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 NBI-expert endoscopist for each centre Enrollment: 160 small (&lt;10 mm) polyps at each site&#xD;
      Study technology: NBI-Olympus without optical magnification Risk: Non-interventional study.&#xD;
