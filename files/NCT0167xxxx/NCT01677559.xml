  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of MLN8237 (alisertib) when&#xD;
      given together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel)&#xD;
      in treating patients with solid malignancies that are metastatic or cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. Alisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel work by killing the cells&#xD;
      or by stopping them from dividing. Giving alisertib together with nab-paclitaxel may provide&#xD;
      a more effective anticancer treatment with fewer side effects.&#xD;

             surgically sterilized), patient must be willing to use an acceptable method of birth&#xD;
             control (i.e., hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. If a&#xD;

             the pancreas or upper small bowel, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have ≥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have a known history of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other&#xD;
             conditions that could result in excessive daytime sleepiness, such as severe chronic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have a requirement for supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not require constant administration of a proton pump inhibitor, H2&#xD;
             antagonist, or pancreatic enzymes. Intermittent uses of antacids or H2 antagonists are&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have QTc &gt; 500ms within 14 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have had a myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
             or have New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled&#xD;
             angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence&#xD;
             of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not be known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with MLN8237 or Abraxane. In addition,&#xD;
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
