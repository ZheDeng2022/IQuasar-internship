      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Lab studies help researchers better understand cancer biology. This information may lead to&#xD;
      new methods for diagnosing or treating cancer. To develop these studies, researchers want to&#xD;
      collect samples from people with cancer or precancer conditions of the lymph system. These&#xD;
      conditions include multiple myeloma, different types of lymphoma, and adult&#xD;
      leukemia/lymphoma. The samples collected will include blood, urine, bone marrow, and tumor&#xD;
      and skin tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect tissue samples to study different types of lymph cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a lymphoid cancer or precancer condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different samples will be collected for study. Blood samples will be collected at the&#xD;
           initial testing. More blood samples will be collected at different treatment points.&#xD;
           Other liquid samples include urine, bone marrow, and any abnormal fluid. Tumor tissue&#xD;
           and skin tissue biopsies will also be collected for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 79,190 people living in the United States will be diagnosed with lymphoma in&#xD;
      2012, including 9,060 cases of HL, 70,130 cases of non-Hodgkin s lymphoma (NHL) and multiple&#xD;
      cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Laboratory investigations conducted in the Lymphoid&#xD;
      Malignancies Branch, including analysis of cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic biology&#xD;
      are attempting to develop new prognostic and diagnostic models, therapeutic agents and novel&#xD;
      treatment approaches for lymphoid malignancies and pre-malignant conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This biology protocol is designed to allow sample acquisition for use in the study of&#xD;
      lymphoid malignancies and malignancy precursors, including but not limited to B and T cell&#xD;
      malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin s lymphoma (HL),&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM), lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma&#xD;
      (ATL)as well as comparison to tissues from patients without lymphoid disease. A variety of&#xD;
      laboratory investigations will be conducted on blood, tumor, bone marrow, urine, abnormal&#xD;
      fluid and normal tissue, including analysis of cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic&#xD;
      biology in the support of NIH translational trials to develop new therapeutic agents and&#xD;
      novel treatment approaches as well as new prognostic and diagnostic models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients who meet the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed pathological diagnosis of lymphoid malignancy or lymphoid precursor, including&#xD;
           B-cell and T-cell lymphomas: including but not limited to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
           (DLBCL), Hodgkin s lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), lymphomatoid granulomatosis&#xD;
           (LYG) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No known lymphoid malignancy or lymphoid precursor diagnosis and planning a surgical&#xD;
           procedure during which blood or normal lymph node(s)/tissue (i.e., those not with&#xD;
           pre-determined likelihood of abnormality/malignancy) may be obtained for research&#xD;
           studies as part of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine, in an exploratory fashion, a variety of biologic&#xD;
      assays relevant to the investigation of lymphoid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that up to 60 consented subjects will be studied each year. To account for&#xD;
      these anticipated 60 consented subjects in addition to up to potentially 5 screen fails each&#xD;
      year, an accrual ceiling of 650 consented subjects is planned over 10 years.&#xD;
