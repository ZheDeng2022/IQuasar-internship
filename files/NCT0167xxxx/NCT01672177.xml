    <textblock>
      The main aim of the project is to evaluate a self-care intervention program aimed at&#xD;
      enhancing the ability of mildly disabled and healthy older persons in Singapore to manage&#xD;
      their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of training community health&#xD;
      workers located within Senior Activity Centres in Singapore to support the self-care capacity&#xD;
      development amongst older persons in the locale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Singapore is facing a rapidly ageing population due to its changing demographics. One of the&#xD;
      biggest challenges associated with older adults is providing them with adequate and&#xD;
      sustainable health care. There are four main barriers that make it challenging to do so in&#xD;
      this segment of the population: (1) Lack of knowledge of simple coping mechanisms and self&#xD;
      care; (2) inadequate access to care and healthcare; (3) social, economic, and political&#xD;
      exclusion; and (4) declining family support and strains on state services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal, is to conduct a randomized controlled trial that tests the impact of a&#xD;
      state-of-the-art self care training program focused on teaching older adults how to manage&#xD;
      their health and if present, their diabetes, hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease. The training focuses on health promotion, disease prevention, health seeking&#xD;
      behavior, chronic disease management and empowerment. The study period is 18 months with&#xD;
      measurements taken at baseline, 8 months and 18 months. Major events (stroke, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, end-stage renal disease, hospitalization, deaths) during the study will also be&#xD;
      recorded. A questionnaire assessing functional status (IADL), quality of life (EQ5D),&#xD;
      knowledge and attitude about health care, health seeking behavior, and health status (CIRS-G)&#xD;
      will be used. Anthropometric measures will also be taken to better understand certain aspects&#xD;
      related to the health and physical status of the participants as well as biomarkers such as&#xD;
      the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol (total HDL), triglycerides, blood&#xD;
      pressure and peak expiratory flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is to improve each individual score and to measure improvement in&#xD;
      overall quality of life and mental well-being. The total sample size for this pilot study is&#xD;
      400 older persons (above 55 years of age) randomly sampled from Tiong Bahru/Bukit Merah and&#xD;
      Ang Mo Kio. The health care training will be based in Senior Activity Centres (SACs) located&#xD;
      in HDB blocks. The investigators will select 12 SACs and randomly assign 6 SACs to the&#xD;
      intervention group and 6 SACs to the control group. All twelve groups will receive a baseline&#xD;
      assessment of physical and mental health status and a follow-up at 8 and 18 months. Two&#xD;
      community health trainers (CHT) will be assigned to each of the intervention groups. These&#xD;
      CHTs will have been trained by personnel at the Tsao Foundation to conduct the training&#xD;
      protocol and collect data from participants. The intervention group will then receive the&#xD;
      health care training once a week for 2 hours over a period of seven-eight months (56 hours&#xD;
      total). The content of training materials focuses on health promotion, disease prevention,&#xD;
      health seeking behavior, chronic disease management, and anti-stigmatization. In addition,&#xD;
      each participant, regardless of randomization, will be given an event diary at baseline. The&#xD;
      diary will be used to record any health related events that occur during the course of the&#xD;
      study. Such events would include visits to GPs or traditional medicine practitioners,&#xD;
      purchasing medications, hospitalization, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the study will demonstrate the following: 1) Improve&#xD;
      chronic disease outcomes for individuals presenting with these diseases: hypertension (20%&#xD;
      decrease in systolic blood pressure), diabetes (1% decrease in HBA1C levels), and COPD (10%&#xD;
      increase in peak expiratory flow) over the 18-month study period. 2) Improve quality of life&#xD;
      of participants and their caregivers. 3) Improve knowledge, behaviours and attitudes towards&#xD;
      health care utilization. 4) Develop a community health worker capacity in low-income&#xD;
      settings. 5) Reduce the number of hospitalizations, outpatient and emergency visits in the&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will also allow the investigators to test their methods for recruitment,&#xD;
      training, and evaluation of the self-care training program. If successful, this study will&#xD;
      provide evidence that older adults in the intervention group can more effectively manage&#xD;
      their own health care and avert or delay the onset of disability compared to older adults in&#xD;
      the control group. One of the long term goals is to replicate this study in Cambodia, India,&#xD;
      Indonesia, and Vietnam. The investigators have identified academic and practice partners in&#xD;
      each of these countries who have expressed an interest in the project and donors are awaiting&#xD;
      the results from this pilot study before funding the regional components.&#xD;
