    <textblock>
      The Danish regions aim to implement antenatal education in small groups for all expectant&#xD;
      parents. The effects of general antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both,&#xD;
      remain largely unknown. Also it is unknown if antenatal education in small groups is superior&#xD;
      to antenatal lectures which is currently standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to evaluate if antenatal birth and parent preparation in small groups&#xD;
      can increase parenting resources thereby easing birth and creating a smoother and less&#xD;
      stressful transition to parenthood among the participants, compared to those allocated to&#xD;
      standard care. This in turn is hypothesized to improve health and thriving among newborn&#xD;
      families and affect their use of healthcare services. A thorough process evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted highlighting enabling factors and barriers to the implementation. Finally&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individually randomised trial sited at Hvidovre Hospital, a large birth clinic in the&#xD;
      Copenhagen Capital Region of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 1756 pregnant women ≥ 18 years old, recruited before 20+0 weeks gestation, due&#xD;
      to give birth at Hvidovre Hospital. Being legally able and willing to provide signed consent,&#xD;
      and being fluent in Danish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are randomised to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A research-based birth and parenting program. The intervention consists of 4 sessions in&#xD;
           small groups that last for 2,5 hours per session at 25, 33 and 35 weeks of gestation,&#xD;
           and a post-natal session 5 weeks after expected due date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard care (control group). The pregnant woman and her partner are offered two&#xD;
           antenatal lectures in an auditorium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation of participants to the intervention will be 1:1 to the intervention and the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected via questionnaires at baseline, 37 weeks gestation, 9 weeks&#xD;
      post-partum, 6 months post-partum and 1 year post-partum, via the hospital obstetric&#xD;
      database, and via the national registers. Analyses will be intention to treat. Subgroup&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted in relation to personal and demographic characteristics. Process&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted using questionnaires and qualitative interviews. The incremental&#xD;
      societal cost of the intervention will be computed and compared to the measured outcomes in a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Stress, parenting alliance, depressive symptoms, wellbeing obstetric intervention,&#xD;
      use of health care services, self-efficacy, divorce.&#xD;

      Antenatal education Today Danish antenatal classes are primarily offered in auditoriums as&#xD;
      lectures with a minimum of interaction with the audience. The Danish regions currently aim in&#xD;
      time to implement antenatal birth and parent preparation classes in small groups for all&#xD;
      expectant parents. However, it is unknown if 1) antenatal preparation in small groups is&#xD;
      superior to standard care; 2) what elements the preparation should encompass to meet the&#xD;
      needs of expectant parents today; and 3) what the cost-effectiveness of antenatal preparation&#xD;
      in small groups is compared to large-scale preparation in auditoriums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objectives and purpose The primary aim is to compare parenting resources, health and&#xD;
      thriving, and use of healthcare services in newborn families enrolled in a research-based&#xD;
      standardised antenatal birth and parenting program in small groups with those allocated to&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the program: We have developed a comprehensive, theoretically founded&#xD;
      parenting program in collaboration with midwives, health care visitors, a psychologist and&#xD;
      family therapist, parents, and leading national and international researchers and clinicians&#xD;
      in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation: Focus group interviews with service providers, group facilitators and&#xD;
      participants will be carried out. Program fidelity e.g. whether the protocol is followed in&#xD;
      program delivery, and how much of the intended program the participants are receiving, as&#xD;
      well as program reach e.g. what proportions of the intended groups are participating in the&#xD;
      program, has an impact on the effect of an intervention. We will evaluate whether the&#xD;
      protocol is followed in program delivery and how much of the intended program the&#xD;
      participants are receiving. Participants will be asked to fill in an electronic questionnaire&#xD;
      on-site at the end of each session. The questionnaire will highlight whether the intended&#xD;
      subjects of the session have been covered as well as to what extent the participants found&#xD;
      the information given useful. Group facilitators will be asked to fill in a similar&#xD;
      questionnaire with the opportunity to explain why certain topics may have been omitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non respondent/non-participation: What proportions of the intended groups are participating&#xD;
      in the program will be explored by examining demographic characteristics of those who&#xD;
      declined to participate in the trial via the national registers, as well as examining&#xD;
      characteristics of those who accepted and then did or did not show up for the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis: Finally the incremental societal cost of the intervention will&#xD;
      be calculated and compared to the measured outcomes in a cost-effectiveness analysis. Direct&#xD;
      health care costs as well as productivity costs in terms of labour market participation and&#xD;
      sickness absence. For this we will use data from the obstetric database at Hvidovre Hospital,&#xD;
      national registers and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design Individually randomised trial sited at a large birth clinic in the Copenhagen&#xD;
      Capital Region, Hvidovre Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will have two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A research-based parenting program described in more detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard care (control group). The pregnant woman and her partner are offered two&#xD;
           antenatal lectures on birth and breastfeeding in an auditorium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm: Groups of approximately 6-7 couples (or mothers) will meet three times&#xD;
      during pregnancy and 1 time 5 weeks after expected due date, for the duration of 2.5 hours&#xD;
      per session. (The aim is to create groups of 6-7 couples; however, due to fluctuations in&#xD;
      uptake groups of 4-9 couples will be deemed acceptable). The sessions will include&#xD;
      information and discussions about emotions and expectations related to birth and parenting,&#xD;
      identification of social network resources, couple communication, breastfeeding, parent-child&#xD;
      attachment, directions on taking care of a newborn, and recognising common signs of mood&#xD;
      disorders and how to react. A website with parenting information and exercises will be&#xD;
      created and parents will be encouraged to use this material alongside the sessions. In&#xD;
      addition to gaining knowledge about issues related to birth and parenting, and creating an&#xD;
      environment where parents can discuss their feelings and concerns, the program aims at&#xD;
      enhancing expectant parents' awareness of their own resources and problem-solving strategies.&#xD;
      Furthermore the way the groups are composited will enable participants to establish relations&#xD;
      with other expectant parents in their local area. All sessions will be led by a midwife. The&#xD;
      postnatal session will be conducted in collaboration with a health visitor, to increase&#xD;
      knowledge on available resources in the local communities Informed consent All participants&#xD;
      considered for this trial will be provided with written and oral information on this trial so&#xD;
      that participants can make an informed decision about their participation in this trial. A&#xD;
      project phone line will be established where participants can contact a project member&#xD;
      throughout the trial if she has further questions, or wishes to withdraw her consent for&#xD;
      participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data will be collected from both parents using web-based questionnaires at:&#xD;
      baseline (approximately 18 weeks gestation) (Tp0), 37 weeks gestation (Tp1), 9 weeks after&#xD;
      expected due date (Tp2), 6 months after expected due date (Tp3), 1 year after expected due&#xD;
      date (Tp4). Participants will be contacted via e-mail, when due to answer a questionnaire.&#xD;
      Two reminders will be sent via additional e-mails, the first after a week and the second&#xD;
      after 14 days. Data will also be obtained from the hospital obstetric database and the&#xD;
      national registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medication/treatment All participants are free to make use of concomitant&#xD;
      antenatal/postnatal services and parent groups. As use of other services and parent groups&#xD;
      may influence the outcomes that we are interested in, use and services will be examined,&#xD;
      documented and given careful consideration in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explorative outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to primary and secondary outcomes, there are following explorative outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-natal depressive symptomatology and anxiety - questionnaire data, EPDS (tp0,1,2)&#xD;
      Breastfeeding - questionnaire data (tp0,1,2,3) Use of healthcare services i.e.: for the&#xD;
      parents obstetric intervention i.e. augmentation of labour, vacuum extraction, caesarean rate&#xD;
      - data from the hospital obstetric database (tp2), and contact to healthcare professionals&#xD;
      for depressive symptomatology and unscheduled postnatal visits- questionnaire data (tp2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family medicine use - questionnaire data (tp2,3) and register data (tp4) Smoking -&#xD;
      questionnaire data (tp1,2,3,4) Satisfaction with relationship and family break-ups -&#xD;
      questionnaire data (tp 0,1,2,3,4), and data from the national registers on divorce and&#xD;
      break-ups (tp4): mental well-being (tp1,2,3,4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial the intermediate outcomes of interest are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenting resources: trust in own ability to cope with: 1) birth (tp1), 2) discharge (tp1) 3)&#xD;
      parenting (tp1,2,4) breastfeeding (tp0,1); couple communication (tp0,1,2,3,4); social&#xD;
      support/network (tp0,1,2,3,4) Statistical plan and data analysis Sample size and power&#xD;
      estimations We are planning a trial of independent experimental and control participant with&#xD;
      1 control per experimental participant. 2011 data from the HH Obstetric Database (unpublished&#xD;
      data) indicate that epidural use among pregnant women is 31%. If the true epidural use for&#xD;
      experimental participants is 25%, we will need to include 1,175 experimental participants and&#xD;
      1,175 control participants be able to reject the null hypothesis that the epidural use for&#xD;
      experimental and control participants are equal with probability (power) 90%. The Type I&#xD;
      error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 5% Amendment 17th&#xD;
      February 2014: Due to slow recruitment, we reduce the power from 90% to 80%, thus reducing&#xD;
      the sample size from 2,350 participants to 1,756 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power estimation for the secondary outcome Perceived Stress Scale We are planning a trial&#xD;
      with 1175 experimental participants and 1175 control participants. In a previous study the&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale response within each participant group was normally distributed with&#xD;
      standard deviation 6 (18). If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 1,&#xD;
      we will be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental&#xD;
      and control groups are equal with probability (power) 98.1%. The type 1 error probability&#xD;
      associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power estimation for the secondary outcome Swedish Parenthood Stress Questionnaire In a&#xD;
      previous study the Swedish Parenthood Stress Questionnaire response within each subject group&#xD;
      was normally distributed with standard deviation 0.5 (19). If the true difference in the&#xD;
      experimental and control means is 0.1, we will be able to reject the null hypothesis that the&#xD;
      population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power)&#xD;
      99.8%. The type 1 error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power estimation for the secondary outcome Parenting Alliance Measure In a previous study the&#xD;
      Parenting Alliance Measure response within each subject group was normally distributed with&#xD;
      standard deviation 20. If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 4, we&#xD;
      will be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups are equal with probability (power) 98.7%. The type 1 error probability&#xD;
      associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Reporting will follow the guidelines of the CONSORT-statement.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be intention to treat as well as per protocol. The level of&#xD;
      significance will be 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the primary binary outcome will be done using logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this analysis will be subjected to a worst case and a best case scenario&#xD;
      analysis of the potential impact of missing values. In the analysis of the two secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures a mixed model with repeated measures will be used. The fixed effects will&#xD;
      include a linear and a quadratic time component and their corresponding interactions with the&#xD;
      intervention indicator. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used initially. If&#xD;
      convergence cannot be obtained the spatial power law covariance structure will be tried and&#xD;
      then the compound symmetric model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the general linear univariate model it will be tested if the mean values differ between&#xD;
      the two intervention groups at time 1 (9 weeks following birth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the assumptions of the above analyses cannot be fulfilled with reasonable approximation&#xD;
      the groups will only be compared at time 1 using a nonparametric test (Mann Whitney).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unadjusted analyses are the primary analyses. If possible all analyses will be repeated&#xD;
      adjusted for the protocol specified stratification variable and the baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three explorative subgroup analyses may be conducted in each case provided the subgroup&#xD;
      interacts significantly with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dealing with multiplicity, gate keeping will be used to adjust the observed p values for&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes. Both observed and adjusted p values will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct access to source data/documentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in its latest&#xD;
      form as well as national laws and regulations. The investigators permit audits and inspection&#xD;
      by providing direct access to source data/documentation. The trial will be monitored by an&#xD;
      unrelated research group at the National Institute of Public Health. eCRFs will be checked,&#xD;
      and as minimum the following will be monitored locally:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients for existence (If the CPR number is correct), All patients for documented&#xD;
      informed consent&#xD;
