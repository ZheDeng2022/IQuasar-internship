  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent epidemiologic survey has indicated that approx. 42% of Danish women treated for&#xD;
      breast cancer experience negative sequelae in the form of pain following treatment. Chronic&#xD;
      pain is known to be associated with impaired social and emotional functioning, and thus&#xD;
      presents a particular concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based intervention is among the complementary, psychological treatments, which&#xD;
      cancer patients commonly seek out in relation to the course of their illness. Despite the&#xD;
      popularity of mindfulness-based intervention among cancer patients, no studies have so far&#xD;
      investigated the effect of mindfulness-based intervention on chronic pain in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. While no studies so far have focused on pain, there is evidence to suggest that&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention is associated with improved psychosocial adaption to cancer.&#xD;
      Furthermore, non-cancer research suggests that mindfulness-based intervention is associated&#xD;
      with reduced pain experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy&#xD;
      (MBCT) on chronic pain in breast cancer patients. Women who have completed their treatment&#xD;
      for breast cancer and who experience chronic pain, will be randomized to an intervention&#xD;
      group (MBCT) or a treatment-as-usual control group. All participants will be assessed at the&#xD;
      same time points, i.e. before the intervention (baseline), and three times after the&#xD;
      intervention/control condition, with the last follow-up 6 months after the intervention. In&#xD;
      addition, a number of potential moderators and mediators of the outcome will be explored. For&#xD;
      example, recent studies indicate that adult attachment style may constitute an important&#xD;
      moderator and/or mediator in the development of pain, and preliminary research has suggested&#xD;
      that attachment style may moderate the effect of mindfulness-based intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will provide valuable new knowledge about the potential of MBCT as a treatment&#xD;
      strategy for chronic pain in breast cancer patients, will contribute to the clarification of&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms in the experience of and coping with pain, which could help the&#xD;
      development of more effective, individualized interventions.&#xD;
