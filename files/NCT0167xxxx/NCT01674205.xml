    <textblock>
      This study seeks to understand the host factors that affect the replication and immune&#xD;
      response of seasonal and candidate pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in&#xD;
      humans and to develop biomarkers that can predict the viral shedding and immune response to&#xD;
      LAIVs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza A viruses are widely distributed in nature and exist as many different subtypes.&#xD;
      Pandemics of influenza can occur, and vaccine development is focused on those subtypes that&#xD;
      are predicted to represent the greatest pandemic threat to the human population. This study&#xD;
      seeks to understand the host factors that affect the replication and immune response of&#xD;
      seasonal and candidate pandemic LAIVs in humans and to develop biomarkers that can predict&#xD;
      the viral shedding and immune response to LAIVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three vaccines will be evaluated: the licensed seasonal LAIV, with a focus on the H3N2&#xD;
      component; the H9N2 G9/AA ca vaccine, which is among the most immunogenic of the candidate&#xD;
      pandemic LAIVs evaluated to date; and the H2N3 MO 2066/AA ca vaccine, which is among the&#xD;
      least immunogenic of the candidate pandemic LAIVs evaluated to date. The seasonal LAIV will&#xD;
      be evaluated in an outpatient setting, while the other two vaccines will be evaluated in an&#xD;
      inpatient setting. In each setting, some participants will receive a placebo vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be assigned to one of four groups. Participants who are seronegative&#xD;
      to both H9N2 G9/AA ca and H2N3 MO 2006/AA ca viruses will be randomly assigned to receive one&#xD;
      of those vaccines (Group 1: H9N2 G9/AA ca; Group 2: H2N3 MO 2006/AA ca) or placebo (Group 4)&#xD;
      and will remain in an inpatient isolation facility. Participants who are seronegative to the&#xD;
      H3 component of seasonal LAIV will be randomly assigned to receive either seasonal vaccine&#xD;
      (Group 3) or placebo (Group 4) and will be followed as outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will remain in the study for 56 days. Participants in the inpatient arms&#xD;
      will be admitted on Day -2, will receive study vaccine on Day 0, and will undergo a basic&#xD;
      history, physical examination, and nasal wash each day until discharge. On some study days,&#xD;
      inpatient participants will undergo a blood collection and/or a nasal swab; at the screening&#xD;
      visit and on Day -1 or Day -2, participants will give a urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the outpatient arms will receive study vaccine on Day 0 and will have study&#xD;
      visits on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 28, and 56. On Days 1 through 7, participants will&#xD;
      undergo a basic history, physical examination, and nasal wash. On some visits, participants&#xD;
      may undergo a blood collection and/or a nasal swab; at the screening visit and on Day -1,&#xD;
      participants will give a urine sample. Unused blood or nasal wash samples will be stored and&#xD;
      may be used in future research studies.&#xD;
