    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm crossover study comparing tivozanib hydrochloride&#xD;
      and sunitinib in subjects with metastatic RCC who have received no prior systemic therapy for&#xD;
      Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). Approximately 160 subjects will be stratified for ECOG score (0&#xD;
      vs 1) and histology (clear cell vs non-clear cell) and then will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms. The study consists of two 12-week treatment periods with a 1-week washout in&#xD;
      between. Subjects will receive double-blind (over-encapsulated) tivozanib hydrochloride and&#xD;
      sunitinib sequentially. The study is designed to compare subject treatment preference, as&#xD;
      well as overall safety and tolerability, frequency of dose modifications and kidney-specific&#xD;
      health outcomes/QoL.&#xD;
