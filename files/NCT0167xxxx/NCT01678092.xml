      A phase 1 single center study in which omalizumab is dosed normally (according to the product&#xD;
      insert) in subjects with atopic dermatitis.&#xD;

      A Phase I randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Omalizumab in subjects with&#xD;
      severe atopic dermatitis and food allergy. Subjects were to participate for 2 years. The&#xD;
      treatment period was a 24 week period during which subjects received Omalizumab either every&#xD;
      2 or 4 weeks subcutaneously (as per product insert guidelines). Subjects randomized to the&#xD;
      placebo group received sterile water every 2 or 4 weeks subcutaneously. Previous medications&#xD;
      were standardized at equivalent doses one month prior to the first dose. The monthly&#xD;
      laboratory assessment for each subject included a complete blood count (CBC), serum&#xD;
      chemistries (Chem7/AST/ALT), and IgE levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Adverse events and clinical status were actively monitored during study visits at&#xD;
      weeks 4, 8, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 (up to 3 months after last study dose) the as well as&#xD;
      reviewed in daily diaries per NIH assessment guidelines. Assessments of platelet count (CBC),&#xD;
      liver function (LFTs), serum chemistry panel, and serum IgE were made on a monthly basis&#xD;
      during the treatment period (24 weeks). Serum pregnancy testing was performed at screening&#xD;
      only as part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: Efficacy parameters included a standardized SCORAD classification system,&#xD;
      Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score and subject/care giver global assessment for&#xD;
      subjects at 24 weeks compared to baseline. An assessment for food allergy was made by skin&#xD;
      prick testing and RAST performed at baseline and during or after the last dose. Diaries were&#xD;
      also taken to assess use of concomitant medications and food allergy symptoms. In addition,&#xD;
      one of the secondary endpoints was to assess the durability of effect of Xolair once the&#xD;
      treatment was discontinued. This was achieved through follow-up visits 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24&#xD;
      months after the last treatment dose. The investigators also assessed use of concomitant&#xD;
      medications and food allergies via daily diaries for each of these assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects planned: 20 (Omalizumab 10 and Placebo 10). Number of subjects analysed:&#xD;
      (Omalizumab 4 and Placebo 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female aged 4-25 years. Diagnosis of severe atopic dermatitis (meeting SCORAD&#xD;
      criteria) with at least 6 months of documented symptoms. Also with concomitant food allergy&#xD;
      as determined by a positive skin prick testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omalizumab was supplied as a sterile, white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder contained&#xD;
      in a single-use vial that is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI), USP, and&#xD;
      administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection. A Xolair vial contains 202.5 mg of Omalizumab,&#xD;
      145.5 mg sucrose, 2.8 mg L-histidine hydrochloride mono hydrate, 1.8 mg L-histidine and 0.5&#xD;
      mg polysorbate 20 and is designed to deliver 150 mg of Omalizumab, in 1.2 mL after&#xD;
      reconstitution with 1.4 mL SWFI, USP. Treatment dose was determined as outlined in the&#xD;
      product insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 year study duration (24 Weeks treatment). The reference was placebo (sterile water) given&#xD;
      subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy variables were improvement of SCORAD, Physician's Global Assessment, and&#xD;
      Subject/Caregiver Global Assessment scores for subjects at 24 weeks compared to baseline.&#xD;
