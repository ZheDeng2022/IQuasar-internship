      Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most important infectious disease worldwide. For&#xD;
      controlling TB, the important strategy includes not only adequate anti-tuberculous treatment&#xD;
      but also well control of latent TB infection (LTBI). Latent TB infection (LTBI) has 10% of&#xD;
      reactivation or more in patients with immuno-compromised disorder. Although LTBI can be&#xD;
      detected by interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or tuberculin skin test, how to predict who&#xD;
      will become active TB from LTBI is still unclear but important. In overall prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment for LTBI, the lengthy duration and possible serious side effect too scared to&#xD;
      general application especially 90% of population who may not get illness. Therefore, to&#xD;
      recognize who develop active TB from LTBI is important for targeted prophylactic therapy. The&#xD;
      good marker is not discovered at present. When TB bacilli arrive our lung, macrohage is the&#xD;
      first line defense and necrosis rather than apoptosis is the dominant form of cell death,&#xD;
      which affords a protective milieu for M. tuberculosis. Though the apoptosis is suppressed in&#xD;
      TB, the apoptosis-associated markers have rarely been investigated in human LTBI vs. active&#xD;
      TB. We set up a cohort study to detect active TB developing from LTBI and first-step conduct&#xD;
      a case control study to compare apoptosis markers between LTBI and active TB for evaluating&#xD;
      the apoptosis markers in discriminating TB infection status. The significant markers should&#xD;
      be verified in further cohort study of LTBI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The apoptosis-associated markers, including Fas ligand, Decoy-receptor 3,&#xD;
      Lipoxin, and prostaglandin E2, are discriminative in patients with active TB from those with&#xD;
      LTBI and thus might predict the potential of being active TB from LTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the serum apoptosis-associated markers between patients with active TB and&#xD;
      patients with LTBI To evaluate the efficiency of apoptosis-associated markers to&#xD;
      differentiate potential of active TB from LTBI Methods: We prospectively enroll patients with&#xD;
      active TB (n=100) and LTBI (n=100), defined by IGRA. Blood sample would be collected before&#xD;
      they received definite treatment after yielding informed consent. We will examine serum&#xD;
      apoptosis-associated markers including Fas ligand, Decoy-receptor 3, Lipoxin, and&#xD;
      prostaglandin E2, and other cytokines and chemokines in serum sample and supernatant from&#xD;
      T-cell after TB antigen stimulation. Their clinical characteristics will be recorded. We&#xD;
      compare the laboratory and clinical data between the two groups and analyze the efficacy of&#xD;
      diagnostic help from these markers.&#xD;
