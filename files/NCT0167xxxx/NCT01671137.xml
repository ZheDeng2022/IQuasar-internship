      The present study has several aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish whether Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Strain GG is able to prevent the onset of IBS&#xD;
           in a high risk group of children enrolled after an acute gastroenteritis (the study has&#xD;
           been powered to this aim).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish whether Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Strain GG is able to stabilize the intestinal&#xD;
           microbiota after an acute gastroenteritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Define the intestinal microbiota of children following an acute gastroenteritis and&#xD;
           identify, if possible, a modification of the microbiota that can predict the emergence&#xD;
           of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.&#xD;

      Study Design A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial planned&#xD;
      following the recommendations established by the Consensus report on clinical trial in IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children during/after an acute episode of gastroenteritis will enter a 12 months treatment&#xD;
      (m1-m12) period followed by a 6 months follow-up phase (m13-m18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be assigned consecutive numbers, starting with the lowest number available, and&#xD;
      randomly assigned, with the use of a computer generated randomisation list using permuted&#xD;
      block design, to receive orally either LGG (6 × 109 colony forming units) or placebo&#xD;
      (capsules identical in taste and appearance to the active study product except for the&#xD;
      absence of LGG) once a day. Enrolled children will be entered sequentially to receive the&#xD;
      assigned treatment. Boxes containing placebo will have the same shape, dimension, indication&#xD;
      and appearance as those containing the viable LGG and will be provided by the probiotic&#xD;
      producer (Dicofarm SpA, Rome, Italy) which ensure that the study is blinded for investigators&#xD;
      and patients. Group assignment will be concealed from participants and investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation With the assumption that, in a 12 month period, IBS would be expected in&#xD;
      16% of children after an episode of acute gastroenteritis as opposed to 5% in the general&#xD;
      paediatric population without gastroenteritis, we calculated that a sample of 210 children&#xD;
      per group would be required for the study to have 80% power to show an advantage of LGG over&#xD;
      placebo in reducing the rate of IBS, based on a two-sided type 1 error rate of 5%..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility of Patients Patients recruited from primary care paediatricians or paediatric&#xD;
      wards during/after (less seven days) an episode of gastroenteritis&#xD;
      (bacteria/viruses/parasites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children of 2 - 16 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Either sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chronic disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical history of abdominal pain history suggestive for functional&#xD;
           dyspepsia/aerophagia/abdominal migraine&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Growth failure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Alarm signs of organic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments, Compliance and Adherence. During the duration of the trial (m1-m18) patients&#xD;
      will record gastrointestinal symptoms on monthly bases and the following data will be&#xD;
      collected: a) questionnaire of frequency/severity of pain, b) school absence and c) GI&#xD;
      symptom score by the compilation of the gastrointestinal symptom rating score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the severity of pain a combination of the self-report Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
      and the Faces Pain Scale (FPS) will be used. The 0-10 mm VAS scale (0 no pain, 10 worst&#xD;
      possible pain) included a horizontal colour gradient (green-red), plus a rating. When asked&#xD;
      to evaluate pain, the child would point to a level and trace a line. This particular VAS is a&#xD;
      validated standard to evaluate pain in children older than five. Assessment was eased&#xD;
      coupling the VAS with the FPS that consists of six faces ranging from a relaxed face to a&#xD;
      face showing intense pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal symptom rating score (GSRS) consists of a 15-point questionnaire to assess&#xD;
      severity and frequency of symptoms validated by Svedlund et al..&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the six months of follow-up the questionnaire will be compiled every other months and&#xD;
      the GSRS at month 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact on parent's overall assessment of treatment will be obtained by a monthly&#xD;
      interview by the question &quot;how do you feel the medication is affecting the health of your&#xD;
      child?&quot;; possible answers are significant, mild, or no relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure compliance one investigator will contact the families every four weeks to monitor&#xD;
      the process of the study. Adherence will be measured by counting the number of capsules&#xD;
      returned at the study visit; children who missed for more than 20% of the medications were&#xD;
      considered noncompliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures Primary outcome will be the incidence in IBS in children receiving LGG as&#xD;
      compared to those receiving placebo. We have chosen pain as the primary outcome measure, in&#xD;
      line with the proposed points-to-consider for IBS trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS or chronic abdominal pain will be diagnosed and categorised according to ROME III&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are: 1) evaluation of frequency/severity of symptoms according to&#xD;
      treatment arm; 2) evaluation of perception of children's health according to parents and 3)&#xD;
      modification of intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal microbiota The intestinal microbiota will be assesses according to methods&#xD;
      published elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the modification of the intestinal microbiota following an acute gastroenteritis&#xD;
      and to determine whether the onset of the IBS is anticipated by a modification of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota we will proceed to the collection of faecal samples at entry, after one month and&#xD;
      every two months after enrolment. During the six months of follow-up a fecal sample will be&#xD;
      collected only at month 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteria DNA in stools will be extracted and stored at -80°C for future analysis. At the end&#xD;
      of the trial a subset of informative fecal bacterial DNA will be assessed: a) patients that&#xD;
      have NOT developed IBS (LGG and placebo), b) patients that have developed IBS (LGG and&#xD;
      placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the intestinal microbiota of these informative cases will help to assess&#xD;
      whether there is a intestinal microbiota suggestive of future inset of IBS and ability of LGG&#xD;
      to stabilize the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events and Disallowed Medication Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
      Children will not allowed to consume any probiotic other than those provided (except for a&#xD;
      transient period no longer that 2 weeks) and they will be invited to continue their eating&#xD;
      and physical exercise habits. Concomitant use of medications affecting gastrointestinal&#xD;
      motility and/or pain perception was allowed, providing parents registered the intake.&#xD;
