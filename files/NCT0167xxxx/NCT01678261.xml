    <textblock>
      The human genetic material consists of 46 chromosomes of which two are sex chromosomes. The&#xD;
      sex-chromosome from the mother is the X and from the father the Y-chromosome. Hence a male&#xD;
      consist of one Y and one X chromosome and a female of 2 X-chromosomes. Alterations in the&#xD;
      number of sex-chromosomes and in particular the X-chromosome is fundamental to the&#xD;
      development of numerous syndromes such as Turner syndrome (45,X), Klinefelter syndrome&#xD;
      (47,XXY), triple X syndrome (47,XXX) and double Y syndrome (47,XYY). Despite the obvious&#xD;
      association between the X-chromosome and disease only one gene has been shown to be of&#xD;
      significance, namely the short stature homeobox gene (SHOX). Turner syndrome is the most well&#xD;
      characterized and the typical diseases affecting the syndrome are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Increased risk of diseases where one's own immune system reacts against one's own&#xD;
           body (autoimmune diseases) and where the cause of this is not known; For example&#xD;
           diabetes and hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased risk of abortion and death in uteri&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Underdeveloped ovaries with the inability to produce sex hormones and being infertile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Congenital malformations of the major arteries and the heart of unknown origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alterations in the development of the brain, especially with respect to the social and&#xD;
           cognitive dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased incidence obesity, hypertension, diabetes and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy women with to normal X-chromosomes, the one of the X-chromosomes is switched off&#xD;
      (silenced). The X-chromosome which is silenced varies from cell to cell. The silencing is&#xD;
      controlled by a part of the X-chromosome designated XIC (X-inactivation center). The&#xD;
      inactivation/silencing of the X-chromosome is initiated by a gene named Xist-gene (the X&#xD;
      inactivation specific transcript).This gene encodes specific structures so called lincRNAs&#xD;
      (long intervening specific transcripts) which are very similar to our genetic material (DNA)&#xD;
      but which is not coding for proteins. The final result is that women are X-chromosome mosaics&#xD;
      with one X-chromosome from the mother and the other X from the father. However, numerous&#xD;
      genes on the X-chromosome escape this silencing process by an unknown mechanism.&#xD;
      Approximately two third of the genes are silenced, 15 % avoid silencing and 20 percent are&#xD;
      silenced or escape depending on the tissue of origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned long non-protein-coding parts of our genetic material (LincRNAs) are&#xD;
      abundant and produced in large quantities but their wole as respect to health and disease&#xD;
      need further clarification. Studies indicate that these LincRNAs interact with the protein&#xD;
      coding part of our genetic material modifying which genes are translated into proteins and&#xD;
      which are not. During this re-modelling there is left foot prints on the genetic material&#xD;
      which can indicate if it is a modification that results in silencing or translation of the&#xD;
      gene. It is possible to map these foot prints along the entire X-chromosome using molecular&#xD;
      techniques like ChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation) and ChIP-seq (deep sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The understanding achieved so far as to the interplay between our genetic material and&#xD;
      disease has arisen from genetic syndromes which as the X-chromosome syndromes are relatively&#xD;
      frequent and show clear manifestations of disease giving the researcher a possibility to&#xD;
      identify genetic material linked to the disease. Turner and Klinefelter syndrome are, as the&#xD;
      remaining sex chromosome syndromes, excellent human disease models and can as such help to&#xD;
      elaborate on processes contributing to the development of diseases like diabetes,&#xD;
      hypothyroidism, main artery dilation and ischemic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Define the changes in the non-coding part of the X-chromosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify the transcriptome (non-coding part of the X-chromosome)as respect to the RNA&#xD;
           generated from the X-chromosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify changes in the coding and non-coding parts of the X-chromosome which are&#xD;
           specific in relation to Turner syndrome and which can explain the diseases seen in&#xD;
           Turner syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study tissue affected by disease in order to look for changes in the X-chromosome with&#xD;
           respect to both the coding and non-coding part of the chromosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Determine if certain genes escape X-chromosome silencing and to establish if this is&#xD;
      associated with the parent of origin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The X chromosome is a cornerstone to the pathogenesis of a number of syndromes, whereof some&#xD;
      are Turner syndrome (45,X), Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY), triple X syndrome (47,XXX) and&#xD;
      double Y syndrome (47,XYY). Despite this importance to clinical disease, only one gene on the&#xD;
      X chromosome has so far been implicated in the wide spectra of phenotypic traits seen in&#xD;
      these and other X-related syndromes. The one known gene is the SHOX (the short stature&#xD;
      homeobox) gene and encodes a transcription factor that has brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)&#xD;
      and fibroblast growth factor receptor gene (FGFR3) as transcriptional targets. It is located&#xD;
      at the pseudoautosomal region of the X and Y chromosomes. This gene has been shown to be&#xD;
      involved in short stature in Turner syndrome, Leri-Weill syndrome and idiopathic short&#xD;
      stature. It also causes the increased stature in Klinefelter syndrome, triple X syndrome and&#xD;
      XYY syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of traits and diseases are seen frequently in X-chromosomal syndromes that cannot be&#xD;
      explained by this SHOX gene. The best characterized of these syndromes is Turner syndrome,&#xD;
      where these phenotype traits can be divided into:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Autoimmune predilection, which leads to an increased risk of virtually all autoimmune&#xD;
           diseases of unknown pathogenesis such as diabetes and hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Decreased intrauterine viability. Here haploinsufficiency of X-linked pseudoautosomal&#xD;
           genes operating in the placenta has been suggested to be involved (STS and CSF2RA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ovarian dysgenesis, leading to ovarian insufficiency and the need for long term sex&#xD;
           hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Congenital cardiovascular malformations of unresolved pathogeneses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Brain development, especially social-cognitive development, which is altered in many&#xD;
           cases, often in a more &quot;male-like&quot; direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis. In healthy women's&#xD;
           cells, with two X-chromosomes, random X inactivation takes place (13). The process is&#xD;
           governed by the X inactivation center (XIC) and initiated by Xist that is a gene&#xD;
           encoding a long intervening non-coding RNA (lincRNA). The Xist gene is located close to&#xD;
           the centromere on the long arm of the X chromosome, where from it orchestrates&#xD;
           repressive histone modifications (recruiting PRC2) along the X chromosome leading to&#xD;
           inactivation. In the remaining active X chromosome PRC2 is titrated away by Tsix, which&#xD;
           effectively leaves all females as mosaics for the X chromosome with one of maternal and&#xD;
           one of paternal origin. However, a great number of genes that are spread out on the X&#xD;
           chromosome escape this X-inactivation by unknown mechanisms and dosage compensation&#xD;
           takes place, so that expression between males and females are comparable for many genes&#xD;
           (15, 16). Approximately 65% of genes are fully silenced, while 15% completely escape&#xD;
           X-inactivation, and 20% show variable expression, depending on tissue cell origin (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LincRNAs are pervasively transcribed in the genome, although their role in health and disease&#xD;
      is poorly understood. Studies of dosage compensation, imprinting and homeotic gene expression&#xD;
      suggest that lincRNAs function at the interface between DNA and chromatin remodeling with&#xD;
      further involvement in reprogramming of chromatin to promote cancer metastasis. To date a&#xD;
      range of different interactions have been hypothesized for lincRNAs in transcriptional&#xD;
      regulation, and they may function both as intact interacting molecules as well as Dicer&#xD;
      processed molecules that are chopped into small interfering RNAs that degrade other RNAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chromatin remodeling can be analyzed by the marks left by histones on the DNA strand, which&#xD;
      can be of either permissive or repressive nature, depending on the acetylation or methylation&#xD;
      taking place of the histones. As an example, trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3&#xD;
      (H3K4me3) is enriched at transcriptionally active gene promoters, whereas trimethylation of&#xD;
      H3K9 (H3Kme3) and H3K27 (H3K27me3) are present at gene promoters that are transcriptionally&#xD;
      repressed. By use of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (chIPseq) one&#xD;
      can obtain these marks along the whole X chromosome in one assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epigenetic alterations of histone modifications can be studied by a new methodology,&#xD;
      enabling the use of relatively old pathological specimens. This opens new prospects for&#xD;
      expansion of our knowledge of the role of the X-chromosomal permission and inactivation to&#xD;
      different diseases, where X-chromosomal syndromes may serve as the initial model to&#xD;
      understand such processes that are highly likely to be important to diseases (e.g. diabetes&#xD;
      and hypothyroidism) beyond these syndromes. As another example, congenital malformations of&#xD;
      the heart are frequent in Turner syndrome and often lead to early aortic dilatation and&#xD;
      dissection. In these patients and in controls, we collect paraffin- embedded blocks of tissue&#xD;
      from the aortic wall, which can now be assessed using this frontline methodology with a&#xD;
      potential to identify novel marks on Turner patients DNA compared to the DNA of non-Turner&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imprinting is another important aspect of sex chromosome action. Imprinting refers to the&#xD;
      process where a gene (or more genes) may be imprinted depending on parental origin. Put&#xD;
      another way, a gene can be &quot;turned on or off&quot; depending on its maternal of paternal origin.&#xD;
      Furthermore, mouse studies show that clusters of genes on the X chromosome are imprinted and&#xD;
      are independent of X chromosome inactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the biological inheritance is apparent for the major cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidities affecting the population, where a hereditary trait clearly prevails in certain&#xD;
      families. Despite a promise for targeting the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity, the specific parts of the genome that potentially trigger the pathologies largely&#xD;
      remain to be defined, and could bring important knowledge of the pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major body of knowledge on the implications of genome aberrations originates from&#xD;
      diseases with obvious and severe manifestations resulting from clear modes of transmission&#xD;
      that allow identification of the causative regions of the genome. Such genetic disorders hold&#xD;
      the potential for understanding the role of a specific locus of the genome, if this can be&#xD;
      identified, as large chromosomal regions often are involved. In the case of the X-&#xD;
      chromosomal phenotypes we expect the causative agent to be on the X chromosome, and will use&#xD;
      various novel technologies to identify this agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, our limited knowledge of the importance of the X-chromosome to cardiovascular&#xD;
      pathology comes from single-gene disorders, and more non-specific gender differences in&#xD;
      addition to the sex chromosomal anomalies. In contrast, no single-gene disorder on the Y-&#xD;
      chromosome has been established to be related to cardiovascular morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate human models for improved understanding of the role played by the sex chromosomes&#xD;
      are available. Here, deviations from normality not only occur at a reasonable prevalence but&#xD;
      also associate with readily identifiable phenotypes and adverse prognosis. Turner and&#xD;
      Klinefelter syndromes constitute such models; females with a reduction in X- chromosomal&#xD;
      material and males with an increase in X-chromosomal material, respectively. These anomalies&#xD;
      of the sex-chromosomes associate with excess morbidity and mortality from both congenital and&#xD;
      acquired cardiovascular as well as diabetes, ovarian insufficiency and other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiovascular phenotypes and the expression and activation of genes are investigated in&#xD;
      healthy females and males with a comparison between Turner and Klinefelter syndromes in a&#xD;
      cross-sectional descriptive design. These studies have already been performed and a precise&#xD;
      characterization is established. The hypothesis is that the significance of the X-chromosome&#xD;
      will manifest as altered levels of expression and activation in association with different&#xD;
      cardiovascular phenotypes. Secondarily, basic analogous knowledge is provided of the&#xD;
      Y-chromosome. The project is expected to generate further hypotheses on the role played by&#xD;
      the genome to morbidity in both the population having a normal karyotype as well as in&#xD;
      abnormal karyotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project we will provide a unique combination of front line molecular technologies and&#xD;
      well defined patient cohorts. The hypotheses we will test are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-coding transcripts from the X chromosome play a fundamental role in sex chromosome&#xD;
           abnormalities, and may work through regulation of epigenetic mechanisms and through mRNA&#xD;
           destabilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The regulation of non-coding RNA expression on X-chromosomes is based on epigenetic&#xD;
           mechanisms that lead to different histone marks, and different DNA methylation in e.g.,&#xD;
           Turner and Klinefelter syndrome persons when compared to healthy gender-matched&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The gene expression pattern resulting from these mechanisms is different in sex&#xD;
           chromosome abnormalities in comparison with healthy males and females, and this&#xD;
           difference can be studied in diseased tissues from Turner syndrome women and compared to&#xD;
           normal control tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. It may be possible to identify one or a few driver molecules in diseased tissues from&#xD;
           Turner and Klinefelter syndrome persons, that can be validated in vitro and in vivo and&#xD;
           that may explain the disease processes, giving important pathophysiological information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected findings. We expect to be able to define the epigenetic changes at the X-chromosomes&#xD;
      at a single base resolution, thus identifying CpG methylation at the DNA strands as well as&#xD;
      permissive and repressive histone marks in histones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to identify the transcriptome both regarding mRNA and non-coding RNAs (long as well&#xD;
      as microRNAs) for RNAs generated from the X-chromosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to be able to provide an Atlas of the epigenetic events specific for Turner&#xD;
      syndromes and the effects of these on the transcriptome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using bioinformatic methods this will hopefully lead to identification of novel dysregulated&#xD;
      molecules that may explain various properties of these patients. These molecules will then be&#xD;
      subject to validation in separate patient cohorts using PCR or IHC technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In diseased tissue we will study the tissue specific alterations of the epigenome and&#xD;
      transcriptome of the X chromosomes and compare this to normal tissues from the control&#xD;
      samples. We hope this will lead to identification of the drivers of the disease process and a&#xD;
      pathophysiological understanding of the disease process.&#xD;
