      This was a single centre, single-blind, randomized, balanced, combined single dose study&#xD;
      under fasting condition and multiple doses study under fed condition with normal&#xD;
      diabetic-meal, two-period, two-sequence cross-over study to to compare the bioavailability of&#xD;
      metformin hydrochloride 500 mg extended release caplet (test drug) and metformin&#xD;
      hydrochloride 500 mg prolonged release tablet (reference formulation).&#xD;

      On Day 1, to obtain pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose, the test or reference drugs&#xD;
      were given with 200 mL of water and swallowed without chewing the drug. For multiple doses&#xD;
      administration at Day 2 until Day 5, the study drugs were administered at a regimen of one&#xD;
      tablet each day, 30 minutes after breakfast. Time of drug administration was standardized for&#xD;
      all participating subjects throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each subject, on Day 1 until Day 5 blood samples were drawn 5 mL before breakfast and&#xD;
      drug administration; and breakfast was provided only on Day 2 until Day 5. Only on Day 1 and&#xD;
      Day 5 after drug administration, the blood samples were drawn 5 mL each at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,&#xD;
      3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples drawn on Day 1 were used to show the single dose pharmacokinetic profile&#xD;
      under fasting condition; while those drawn on Day 5 were used to show the&#xD;
      multiple-dose-pharmacokinetic profile after meal intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after the first drug administration (washout period), the same procedure was&#xD;
      repeated with the alternate drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma concentrations of metformin were determined by high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed&#xD;
      in the single dose study were AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, tmax, and t1/2. The pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters assessed in multiple doses study at steady state phase were AUCtau, Cmax, Cmin,&#xD;
      and t1/2.&#xD;
