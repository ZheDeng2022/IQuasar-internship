  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the surgical site infection rate and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction for absorbable versus non absorbable suture in closure of skin at cesarean&#xD;
      section in obese women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean section (CS) is the commonest major operation performed on women in the world.&#xD;
      Approximately one in 4 women in the United States is delivered by cesarean section, and it is&#xD;
      well established that operative abdominal delivery is associated with a significant risk of&#xD;
      infection compared with vaginal delivery. These risks are increased with preexisting&#xD;
      operative site infection, breaks in sterile technique, prolonged preoperative admissions that&#xD;
      may result in colonization with resistant microbes, prolonged operative duration, use of&#xD;
      electrocautery, obesity, advanced age, inadequate host immunocompetence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese women may have increased susceptibility to infections because of the effects of obesity&#xD;
      on the immune system, skin barriers, wound healing, mobility, and coexisting chronic diseases&#xD;
      including diabetes, which could increase infection risk by itself. Cohort studies have shown&#xD;
      that women with a body mass index (BMI)&gt;30kg/m^2 have a two to three folds increased risk of&#xD;
      post cesarean infections, such as wound infection, urinary tract infection UTI),&#xD;
      endometritis, or pneumonia, compared with non-obese women. Other studies found that obesity&#xD;
      doubled the risk specifically for post-cesarean wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound complications are a major source of morbidity after CS and contribute to prolonged&#xD;
      hospital stay and rates of readmission. Age, (BMI), length of incision, and timing of&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotic administration have all been associated with post cesarean surgical&#xD;
      site infection (SSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A surgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body&#xD;
      where the surgery took place. SSI can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin&#xD;
      only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin,&#xD;
      organs, or implanted material. SSI has a great impact on the economy and health care&#xD;
      resources. Infection has always been a feature of modern surgery and continues to be a&#xD;
      significant problem for health care practitioners across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ideal skin closure would be safe and effective, associated with minimal patient&#xD;
      discomfort, and have a good cosmetic result. It would also be inexpensive and require fewer&#xD;
      health care resources by being fast and easy to apply, require minimal follow-up evaluation,&#xD;
      and be associated with a low rate of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for closing the skin at the time of cesarean delivery include stainless steel&#xD;
      staples, subcuticular absorbable staples, subcuticular suture, adhesive closure strips, and&#xD;
      tissue adhesives (cyanoacrylates). Each of the methods has its postulated benefits for wound&#xD;
      outcomes; however, none of these have been compared in a prospective trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of skin closure suture material on wound complication rates in Obstetrics is poorly&#xD;
      studied. And when we are talking about obese patients we did not find any recommendation&#xD;
      regarding the suture material of skin closure although most of Obstetricians use different&#xD;
      sutures materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does closure of skin by absorbable compared to non absorbable suture affect the rate of&#xD;
      surgical site infection in obese patients undergoing caesarian section? Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that no difference between absorbable compared to non absorbable suture.&#xD;
