    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a 60-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of a methylated vitamin B complex nutritional supplement (Max Stress&#xD;
      B™) for improving depressive and anxiety symptoms according to the Beck Depression and&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventories, respectively, in 60 patients (18+ years of age) diagnosed with major&#xD;
      depression or other forms of depressive disorders and an elevated level of homocysteine (&gt; 10&#xD;
      µmol/L) at baseline. Secondary outcomes will include anthropometrics for body composition,&#xD;
      blood pressure and pulse, level of physical activity, dietary intake, and quality of life.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and 30 and 60 days. The study will consist of two&#xD;
      treatment arms: (a) vitamin B complex nutritional supplement and (b) placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained in this study will help in determining the efficacy of using&#xD;
      nutritional supplements for improving the outcomes of people with depression.&#xD;

      Study Design Potential participants will be identified through referrals from the offices of&#xD;
      Dr. Woolger, the UM Department of Psychiatry Clinics, the Medical Wellness Center, and the&#xD;
      Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine. Drs. Woolger and Konefal will conduct a&#xD;
      preliminary screening of their clients to determine if the potential participant meets the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria to participate in the study. Dr. Lewis, Messrs. Long, Dicenso, or Bregman,&#xD;
      or Mses. Hoffman, Rafatjah, Melillo, Ko, Alonso, or McCurdy will conduct preliminary&#xD;
      screenings through the Medical Wellness Center or the Center for Complementary and&#xD;
      Integrative Medicine. Once accepted into the study, participants will then contact Dr. Lewis,&#xD;
      Messrs. Long, Dicenso, or Bregman, or Mses. Hoffman, Rafatjah, Melillo, Ko, Alonso, or&#xD;
      McCurdy for informed consent and study protocol procedures. Subjects will then be assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two study conditions. Assignment of subjects to treatment groups will be done by&#xD;
      following a table of random permutations, which will balance the number of subjects in each&#xD;
      group. The table will be prepared in advance by a random number generating program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Sixty subjects (30 in each condition) with depression will participate in this&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be primarily those who have expressed an interest in trying&#xD;
      non-medication or integrative treatment approaches for their depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial visit The study will be fully explained to each potential participant, and a written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained before beginning the intervention. Dr. Lewis, Messrs. Long,&#xD;
      Dicenso, or Bregman, or Mses. Hoffman, Rafatjah, Melillo, Ko, Alonso, or McCurdy will&#xD;
      administer all of the assessments at baseline and follow-up and will notify the subjects of&#xD;
      the time to return for the follow-up appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Participants enrolled in the study will receive either the Max Stress B™ at a&#xD;
      dosage level of ½ teaspoon twice daily or the placebo for the 60-day treatment period.&#xD;
      Subjects will not be advised to modify eating or physical activity habits or non-depression&#xD;
      prescription medication use. Subjects will not be allowed to use depression-treatment&#xD;
      medication starting at 2 weeks before beginning the intervention and until the conclusion of&#xD;
      the 60-day treatment period. Subjects will be instructed not to consume any other nutritional&#xD;
      supplements containing any of the vitamin B complex nutrients, SAMe, inositol, PABA, or&#xD;
      folate for two weeks prior to having the baseline assessments and until the conclusion of the&#xD;
      60-day period. Because of how Max Stress B™ is produced by Premier Research Labs, consuming&#xD;
      the Max Stress B™ should be well-tolerated. We are aware of no side effects of this&#xD;
      particular product. According to the company's literature, Max Stress B™ is a whole-nutrient&#xD;
      natural source extract from probiotic colonies that contains: vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6,&#xD;
      and B12, and folate, PABA, biotin, inositol, purified water, and certified organic alcohol.&#xD;
      This product is documented online at the following web address: http://www.prlabs.com/ under&#xD;
      the &quot;Products&quot; tab, item #2352.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and Assessments Each participant will complete a basic demographics and medical&#xD;
      history questionnaire to assess the importance of these background variables. They will also&#xD;
      be asked to list their current medications and note any changes in type or amount during the&#xD;
      course of the study. Blood pressure, heart rate, body weight and height, skinfold&#xD;
      assessments, and hip and waist circumference will be assessed by Dr. Lewis, Messrs. Long,&#xD;
      Dicenso, Bregman, or Reihm, or Mses. Rafatjah, Melillo, Ko, Alonso, or McCurdy at baseline&#xD;
      and 30- and 60-days follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria used to select the assessment instruments included: a) appropriateness for the&#xD;
      population; b) ease of administration and scoring; c) experience administering these&#xD;
      measures; and d) employment of measures involving a multi-method (i.e., self-report and&#xD;
      physical measures) approach to enhance the validity of the overall assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measures will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary outcome of this study is depression level, assessed by the Beck Depression&#xD;
           Inventory II, which will be assessed to reflect its relationship to changes in dietary&#xD;
           patterns and physical activity. Because item 9 of the Beck Depression Inventory inquires&#xD;
           about &quot;Suicidal thoughts or wishes,&quot; we will immediately notify the attending physician&#xD;
           in the Crisis facility of UM/JMH if a subject responds affirmatively to this question,&#xD;
           which may be indicative of suicidal ideation (SI). Any spontaneous comments or&#xD;
           circumstances indicative of SI should be explored with the participant (e.g., &quot;life not&#xD;
           worth living,&quot; &quot;be better off dead,&quot; selling or giving away possessions, or withdrawing&#xD;
           from relationships, etc.). If suicidal ideation is present, the assessor will maintain&#xD;
           persistent contact with the subject until the physician can meet with the subject. If&#xD;
           the suicide threat is judged to be immediate by the physician (i.e., the subject&#xD;
           indicates current intent, has a plan, and available means) then the assessor will&#xD;
           maintain contact with the subject and ensure that the subject is taken to a psychiatric&#xD;
           emergency setting. The Jackson Crisis Mental Health Unit (305-355-7777) is a potential&#xD;
           emergency facility and is located at 1695 N.W. 9th Avenue at the back of the Mental&#xD;
           Health building.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Beck Anxiety Inventory to assess the change in the participant's level of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physiological and anthropometric: Blood pressure and heart rate, body weight and height&#xD;
           to calculate body mass index (BMI), skinfold caliper assessment to calculate percent&#xD;
           body fat, waist and hip circumference to calculate waist to hip ratio at baseline and 60&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physical activity: Physical activity will be assessed at baseline and 30- and 60-days&#xD;
           follow-up by the Stanford 7-day Activity Recall. This instrument assesses the amount&#xD;
           (number of hours) of moderate, physically challenging, and very physically challenging&#xD;
           activities over the past 7 days. This instrument provides useful estimates of habitual&#xD;
           physical activity for research, significantly agrees with daily self-report of physical&#xD;
           activity, and has been validated for use in community settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quality of life: The SF-36v2™ Health Survey provides psychometrically-based physical and&#xD;
           mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index. It is a&#xD;
           generic measure that does not target a specific age, disease, or treatment group and&#xD;
           will be assessed at baseline and 30- and 60-days follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Compensation Subjects will be compensated $40 for attending each assessment at&#xD;
      baseline and 30- and 60-days follow-up. This amount is intended to compensate for their time&#xD;
      and effort in completing the outcome and assessment measures. Therefore, a subject could&#xD;
      receive up to $120 for participating in the study. We believe this amount to be fair and not&#xD;
      to constitute coercion, given the commitment required for completing the entire protocol.&#xD;
