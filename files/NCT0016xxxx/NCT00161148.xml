      PSC is a progressive liver disease without effective medical treatment. There is often&#xD;
      co-existent ulcerative colitis. Probiotics (bacterial food supplements) have been shown to&#xD;
      benefit patients with ulcerative colitis. In the current protocol potential beneficial&#xD;
      effects of probiotics on liver biochemistry and liver related symptoms as pruritus are being&#xD;
      assessed in 12 PSC patients in a randomized controlled cross over study (3 months probiotics,&#xD;
      1 one wash-out and 3 months placebo).&#xD;

      I. INTRODUCTION Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive cholestatic liver&#xD;
      disease characterized by multifocal strictures of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts,&#xD;
      which frequently leads to biliary cirrhosis and liver failure. The aetiology of PSC is&#xD;
      unknown but is thought to be (auto)immune-mediated. Nevertheless, in a number of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials a clear benefit of treatment with various immunosuppressive agents, such as&#xD;
      D-penicillamine, methotrexate, corticosteroids or nicotine, could not be demonstrated.&#xD;
      Although treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) improves serum liver tests and is&#xD;
      prescribed on a large scale for PSC patients, this therapeutic modality may have no&#xD;
      beneficial effect on the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 - 90% of patients with PSC have concurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mostly&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis. Conversely, 7% of patients with IBD have PSC. The close association&#xD;
      between inflammatory bowel disease and PSC suggests that substances originating from the&#xD;
      inflamed gut may damage the liver and biliary tree. Bacterial products may act as toxic&#xD;
      proinflammatory agents. N-formyl L-methionine L-leucine L-tyrosine is a peptide produced by&#xD;
      enteric flora. When this peptide was introduced into the colon of rats with colitis, it was&#xD;
      absorbed, underwent enterohepatic circulation, and appeared undegraded in bile. Histologic&#xD;
      changes in the livers of the rats resembled those in PSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that are used to redress the bacterial composition of the&#xD;
      enteric flora which may be altered in disease. Beneficial effects of probiotics have already&#xD;
      been described in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, pouchitis and non-alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver disease. Probiotic bacteria have also been shown to counteract inflammatory&#xD;
      processes by enhancing the degradation of enteral antigens, reducing the secretion of&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators, thereby modifying in a beneficial way the balance between pro- and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory mediators, and stabilizing gut barrier functions. These effects may benefit&#xD;
      PSC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that administration of probiotics may improve the composition of the&#xD;
      enteric flora and subsequently decrease the release of substances that may be toxic and&#xD;
      harmful for the liver and biliary tree in PSC patients. Furthermore, immunological&#xD;
      alterations induced by treatment with probiotics may have positive effects in PSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. AIM OF THE STUDY Primary aim: assessment of the effects of treatment with probiotics on&#xD;
      serum liver tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim: assessment of the effects of treatment with probiotics on fatigue and&#xD;
      pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. DESIGN OF THE STUDY Double-blind randomized cross-over pilot study. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to treatment with probiotics or placebo for a period of 12 weeks. After a&#xD;
      wash-out period of 4 weeks, placebo-treated patients will receive verum and vice versa for&#xD;
      another period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage of concurrent medication for PSC (UDCA, immunosuppressives) will remain the same&#xD;
      during the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are being treated with antibiotics during the study period for more than 1 week&#xD;
      will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
