      Introduction In patients with a biliary obstruction, tissue is acquired immediately before&#xD;
      drainage during endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). This is performed by&#xD;
      passing a brush inside the bile duct stricture. However, brush cytology has a modest&#xD;
      sensitivity (30-57%) for the diagnosis of cancer. A device, called the &quot;G.I.U.M.&quot; catheter,&#xD;
      allows for the sampling of higher amounts of tissue during ERCP compared to brush cytology.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic yield of tissue sampling performed in&#xD;
      patients with a suspected malignant biliary stricture using 2 techniques, namely a standard&#xD;
      brush catheter and the G.I.U.M..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol design Eligible patients will have tissue sampling performed using both techniques&#xD;
      during ERCP, the first technique used being randomly assigned and immediately followed by the&#xD;
      other one as well as biliary decompression. All specimens obtained will be subjected to&#xD;
      cytopathological examination. After inclusion of the total number of patients, smears will be&#xD;
      anonymized and analyzed for diagnosis, cell cellularity and quality. The final clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis in each case will be based on cytologic results plus histological examination of&#xD;
      biopsy specimens.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with a suspected malignant biliary obstruction are considered unsuitable for&#xD;
      surgery because of locally advanced or metastatic disease or poor clinical performance&#xD;
      status. Management of these patients is facilitated by a tissue diagnosis at initial&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). This may obviate further invasive&#xD;
      tests, and the most suitable nonsurgical treatment can be initiated without delay. Brush&#xD;
      cytology is the most frequently used technique. The procedure is relatively easy to perform,&#xD;
      requires little time, and generally is safe. Although its specificity is close to 100%, brush&#xD;
      cytology has a modest sensitivity that ranges from 30% to 57% in most published studies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A device, called the &quot;G.I.U.M.&quot; catheter has been developed to increase the amount of tissue&#xD;
      available for analysis 1. It consists of a basket with multiple wires that can be passed&#xD;
      through the stricture, and grasp tissue between the wires. It has been shown in an&#xD;
      uncontrolled study to allow for the diagnosis of malignancy with a high sensitivity&#xD;
      (Endoscopy, submitted for publication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic yield of tissue sampling performed using a&#xD;
      standard brush catheter and the G.I.U.M. in patients with a suspected malignant biliary&#xD;
      stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspicion of malignant biliary stricture without prior histopathologic confirmation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent for ERCP, including sampling and dilation modalities, obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coagulopathy not corrected by administration of vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to pass a guidewire through the stricture;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hilar stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol design and management policy Eligible patients will have tissue sampling performed&#xD;
      using both techniques, the first technique used being randomly assigned and immediately&#xD;
      followed by the other one. Randomization will be performed by opening an opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelope numbered according to a table of random numbers with blocks of 6 patients; each&#xD;
      center will receive a pack of 24 numbered envelopes (made by an investigation nurse). A&#xD;
      listing of all patients with a biliary stricture diagnosed at ERCP will be maintained (name,&#xD;
      surname, date of birth, and date of examination), and reason for non inclusion will be&#xD;
      stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of tissue sampling Antibiotics will be administered intravenously 30 minutes before&#xD;
      ERCP. ERCP with biliary decompression will be performed with standard techniques. 2 After&#xD;
      bile duct cannulation, iopromide (Ultravist, 300mgI/mL, Berlex, Montville, N.J.) will be&#xD;
      injected, and the level and length of the biliary stricture will be determined. A guidewire&#xD;
      will be passed through the stricture and intrahepatic opacification will be completed. A&#xD;
      biliary sphincterotomy will be performed using a standard sphincterotome, to facilitate&#xD;
      placement of a stent or of a naso-biliary drain. Pancreatography will possibly be attempted,&#xD;
      especially if pancreatic disease is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue sampling will be performed in the order assigned by randomization, according to the&#xD;
      following technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brush: the RX-cytology brush (M00545000, Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, Mass.) will be&#xD;
           passed as a unit within its 8 French sheath, over the guidewire through the stricture.&#xD;
           Previous stricture dilation will be left at the discretion of the endoscopist. The&#xD;
           brush/sheath will be withdrawn immediately below the stricture, the brush will be moved&#xD;
           forth and back within the strictured segment at least 10 times. The brush will then be&#xD;
           pulled into the catheter, still located immediately below the stricture, and the unit&#xD;
           brush/catheter will be removed. A X-ray will be taken with the top of the brush inside&#xD;
           the stricture, and the X-ray will be kept in a dedicated file, as well as a X-ray with&#xD;
           the stricture opacified with contrast medium. Specimens obtained with the brush will be&#xD;
           smeared on glass slides and fixed in 95% ethanol immediately after collection, in the&#xD;
           ERCP suite. Immediately after, the brush will be agitated in 10 ml of saline placed in a&#xD;
           vial. Finally, the brush segment will be cut from the supportive wire and placed into a&#xD;
           container with CytoLytt solution (Cytyc, Crawley, United Kingdom).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G.I.U.M.: immediately before using the G.I.U.M. catheter, the biliary stricture will be&#xD;
           dilated using a 6-mm in diameter MaxForce balloon catheter (Microvasive Endoscopy,&#xD;
           Boston Sc.). The G.I.U.M. catheter will be passed as a unit within its 8.5F sheath,&#xD;
           alongside the guidewire. Once the basket/sheath is located above the stricture, the&#xD;
           basket will be opened and passed through the strictured segment 1 time. The basket will&#xD;
           then be pulled into the catheter, and the unit basket/catheter will be removed.. A X-ray&#xD;
           will be taken with the meshes of the G.I.U.M. catheter opened inside the stricture, and&#xD;
           the X-ray will be kept in a dedicated file. Specimens obtained with the G.I.U.M. will be&#xD;
           smeared on glass slides and fixed in 95% ethanol immediately after collection, in the&#xD;
           ERCP suite. Immediately after, the G.I.U.M. will be agitated in 10 ml of saline placed&#xD;
           in a vial. Finally, all the material remaining between the wires of the G.I.U.M. will be&#xD;
           rinsed through the sheath into a vial by perfusing 30 ml of CytoLytt solution (Cytyc)&#xD;
           taken from the vial furnished by the manufacturer using a 20-ml sterile syringe into the&#xD;
           same vial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smears as well as the 2 vials of saline and the 2 vials of CytoLytt will be labeled with the&#xD;
      patient's name and the mark &quot;G.I.U.M.&quot; or &quot;brush&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications possibly detected during ERCP or during the 30 following days will be noted and&#xD;
      assessed by using established consensus criteria. 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of tissue sample Cytolytt vials: specimens in Cytolytt will be prepared according&#xD;
      to the ThinPrep processor operator manual (http://www.thinprep.com/85506Prd/gencyt.htm).&#xD;
      Specimens obtained with the ThinPrep technique will be processed for 1 slide as described by&#xD;
      the manufacturer. Cell block inclusion will be performed whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smears: specimens will be stained by the Papanicolaou technique for standard cytologic&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytopathological examination After inclusion of the total number of patients, labels and&#xD;
      marks on the smears will be removed and replaced by random numbers. Two non-consecutive&#xD;
      random numbers from 1 to 1000 will be selected for each patient, one for the smear obtained&#xD;
      with the G.I.U.M., the other for the smear obtained with the brush by JMD. Smears will be&#xD;
      re-read by two cytopathologists blinded to the name of the patient, the technique of tissue&#xD;
      sampling, previous diagnosis, as well as the relationship between the 2 random numbers for&#xD;
      each pair of samples collected from the same patient (so avoiding interpretation of a sample&#xD;
      obtained using one of the 2 techniques with the knowledge of the sample obtained from the&#xD;
      same patient using the other technique). Indeed, their knowledge will be limited to the fact&#xD;
      that a biliary stricture was identified at ERCP. Final diagnosis will be reached by agreement&#xD;
      between the 2 cytopathologists. Specimens will be interpreted as normal, atypical (considered&#xD;
      benign), highly atypical (suspicious for cancer), and malignant. Cell cellularity and single&#xD;
      epithelial cell cellularity will be graded as absent, rare, moderate, or numerous. Finally,&#xD;
      nuclear detail will be graded as poor, satisfactory, or excellent. Other data will be&#xD;
      recorded as indicated in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list of patients' names for whom cell block inclusion has been performed will be kept, with&#xD;
      indication if it was obtained from material collected with the cytobrush or with the G.I.U.M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological examination Surgical specimens obtained from patients who undergo&#xD;
      duodenopancreatectomy will be subjected to histopathological examination, in particular to&#xD;
      detect carcinomatous lymphangitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The final clinical diagnosis in each case will be based on cytologic&#xD;
      results plus specimens obtained at surgery, autopsy, via percutaneous puncture or endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasonography with fine needle aspiration, and disease course, including signs of clinical&#xD;
      deterioration, death, or a stable course and/or improvement during follow-up. Information&#xD;
      will be collected by reviewing hospital records and telephone contact with patients/families&#xD;
      and referring physicians 1, 6 and 12 months after ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of calculating sensitivity and specificity, all highly atypical (suspicious&#xD;
      for cancer) and malignant diagnoses at cytopathologic examination will be regarded as&#xD;
      &quot;positive&quot;, and diagnoses of normal and atypical (considered benign) will be regarded as&#xD;
      &quot;negative&quot;.4 Sensitivity and specificity will be calculated using the Fischer exact test. A p&#xD;
      value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the hypothesis that the sensitivity for the detection of cancer would be 45 4 and&#xD;
      70% on specimens obtained with the brush and the G.I.U.M. catheter respectively, we calculate&#xD;
      that at least 68 patients with a final clinical diagnosis of cancer should be included to&#xD;
      reach statistical significance with 5% and 20% alpha and beta error, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be performed after collection of resection specimens in 5 patients&#xD;
      to evaluate possible lesions to the biliary tract and surrounding tissues.&#xD;
