    <textblock>
      The PRIMAKid trial is a general practice based double-blind randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial on the effectiveness and costs of combined influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in&#xD;
      pre-school children with recurrent respiratory tract infections. A target number of 660&#xD;
      children aged 18-72 months with a history of two or more general practitioner attended&#xD;
      episodes of RTI, are included. Exclusion criteria are diseases accompanied by a high risk of&#xD;
      recurrent RTI and conditions chronically treated with corticosteroids. Over a period of 7 to&#xD;
      22 months follow-up, the number of febrile RTI-episodes as primary outcome is assessed, and&#xD;
      as secondary outcomes the severity and length of febrile RTI-episodes, medical visits /&#xD;
      interventions, health-related quality of life and productivity loss of parents.&#xD;
