      The current study is a double-blind, placebo-control randomized clinical trial examining the&#xD;
      efficacy of memory retraining in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Impairment in higher level&#xD;
      cognitive processing, such as new learning and memory, is one of the most common deficits in&#xD;
      individuals with MS and such deficits have been shown to exert significant negative impact on&#xD;
      multiple aspects of everyday life, including occupational and social functioning. Despite&#xD;
      these findings, few studies have attempted to treat these cognitive deficits in order to&#xD;
      improve the everyday functioning of individuals with MS. Through a small randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, we found that individuals with MS with documented memory impairment show a significant&#xD;
      improvement in their memory performance following a treatment protocol designed to facilitate&#xD;
      learning. The current proposal will replicate this finding and further evaluate (a) the&#xD;
      impact of the treatment on everyday functioning, (b) the long term efficacy of the treatment&#xD;
      and (c) the utility of booster sessions in facilitating long-term treatment effects. We will&#xD;
      randomly assign individuals with MS, with documented impairment in new learning abilities, to&#xD;
      a memory retraining group or a placebo control group. Both groups will undergo baseline,&#xD;
      immediate and long-term follow-up assessment consisting of: (1) a traditional&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery and (2) an assessment of global functioning examining the impact&#xD;
      of the treatment on daily activities. This design will allow us to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      this particular memory retraining technique in an MS population through the assessment of&#xD;
      cognitive function via a standard evaluation. In addition, we will be able to draw&#xD;
      conclusions regarding the impact of this particular memory remediation program on everyday&#xD;
      life from questionnaires completed by the participant and a significant other. Optional&#xD;
      enrollment in pre- post neuroimaging will also allow us to look at changes in the brain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Impairments in higher level cognitive processing, such as new learning and memory, are among&#xD;
      the most common deficits in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and such deficits have&#xD;
      been shown to exert significant negative impact on multiple aspects of everyday life,&#xD;
      including occupational and social functioning. Despite these findings, few studies have&#xD;
      attempted to remediate these cognitive deficits in order to improve the everyday functioning&#xD;
      of individuals with MS. While limited research addressing the efficacy of memory retraining&#xD;
      in MS does exist, this research has been marred by significant methodological flaws.&#xD;
      Specifically, the only existing study of memory retraining in MS to utilize: (1) a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial and (2) an objective outcome assessment is our pilot research carried out at&#xD;
      Kessler Medical Rehabilitation Research and Education Corporation (KMRREC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;The Advisory Board recommends that NCMRR initiate and coordinate studies of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of medical rehabilitation interventionsâ€¦using new and precise quantitative&#xD;
      measurements of impairment, including functional and societal limitations and disability,&#xD;
      with particular emphasis on disability and societal limitations.&quot; The current proposal&#xD;
      directly addresses this recommendation of the NCMRR Advisory Board. It is designed to (1)&#xD;
      replicate our pilot study with larger sample sizes (2) expand our assessment measures to&#xD;
      better assess individuals with mild cognitive impairments, thus testing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention within this important subpopulation (3) assess the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention utilizing more global measures of everyday life, including an objective measure&#xD;
      (the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test), which has preliminary support through our pilot&#xD;
      study, as well as additional questionnaires to be completed by both the participant and a&#xD;
      significant other (4) evaluate the long-term effects of the treatment protocol and (5)&#xD;
      examine the utility of booster sessions to facilitate long-term treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet these study objectives, we will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial, applying a memory rehabilitation technique to a large sample of MS&#xD;
      participants. This protocol has been well-validated with other neurological populations and&#xD;
      preliminary evidence in support of its use in MS now exists. Individuals with MS, with&#xD;
      documented impairment in memory and new learning, will be randomly assigned to either a&#xD;
      memory retraining group or a placebo control group. Outcome will be measured through several&#xD;
      mechanisms: (1) a traditional neuropsychological (NP) battery and (2) an assessment of global&#xD;
      functioning (AGF) examining the impact of the treatment on daily activities. Both groups will&#xD;
      undergo baseline, immediate follow-up, and long-term follow-up assessments consisting of a&#xD;
      traditional NP evaluation, which examines objective performance on well-validated measures of&#xD;
      cognitive function, and an AGF, which includes self-report measures of memory abilities,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, quality of life, and occupational functioning. In this way, we will be able to&#xD;
      objectively evaluate the presence or absence of changes in memory performance through a NP&#xD;
      assessment, while also evaluating the impact of this treatment protocol on an individual's&#xD;
      everyday life through the AGF. While most studies evaluating the efficacy of cognitive&#xD;
      retraining usually employ a pre-training and post-training evaluation, such evaluations have&#xD;
      been criticized for their lack of ecological validity. The present design allows the&#xD;
      assessment of the efficacy of this particular memory retraining technique within an MS&#xD;
      population using traditional measures, as well as the assessment of the impact that such a&#xD;
      rehabilitation technique has on everyday life. In addition, we will include a 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up assessment to measure the long-term impact of this treatment on objective cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, through a NP assessment, and everyday life, through an AGF. Finally, half of the&#xD;
      participants in the experimental group will participate in monthly &quot;booster sessions&quot;&#xD;
      following the completion of treatment and we will evaluate the impact of these sessions on&#xD;
      the maintenance of treatment effects over time. A subset of the sample will also complete pre&#xD;
      and post neuroimaging to evaluate changes in cerebral activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that new learning is a key problem in MS. In addition, a small pilot&#xD;
      study, funded by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) and administered by the&#xD;
      current PI, tested this memory retraining protocol in an MS population. Results showed that&#xD;
      when these deficits in new learning are treated, a significant improvement is noted in memory&#xD;
      performance. However, the impact of the memory retraining protocol on everyday functioning&#xD;
      remains unclear. The documentation of the efficacy of memory retraining in MS, particularly&#xD;
      on everyday functioning, could have a significant impact on symptom management and quality of&#xD;
      life in the lives of persons with MS. As such, specific aims of the current research protocol&#xD;
      are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. This study will objectively evaluate the clinical utility of a memory retraining&#xD;
      protocol to improve performance on objective tests of new learning and memory in a large&#xD;
      sample of individuals with MS with documented deficits in this area. This protocol has been&#xD;
      previously utilized in a traumatic brain injury (TBI) population and a small pilot sample of&#xD;
      individuals with MS, yielding promising data. NCMRR states that research analyzing existing&#xD;
      rehabilitation techniques, empirically assessing their validity, and providing justification&#xD;
      to the consumer and practitioners is required for the advancement of the field of medical&#xD;
      rehabilitation research and recognizes this as a high priority research area. Our study does&#xD;
      precisely this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. We will increase the generalizability and real life application of assessment&#xD;
      techniques by assessing outcome following cognitive retraining with more global measures of&#xD;
      everyday life. An objective measure of everyday functioning will be included, as well as&#xD;
      numerous subjective measures of everyday functioning, which will be gathered via established&#xD;
      self-report instruments, as well as ratings by a significant other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. This study will also assess the efficacy of this memory retraining protocol in a&#xD;
      mildly impaired MS group, which has not been properly tested previously. Due to measurement&#xD;
      ceiling effects in our pilot study, the utility of this technique to improve new learning and&#xD;
      memory abilities in individuals with mild deficits has not yet been determined. The current&#xD;
      study improves upon the measurement techniques used in the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: This study will evaluate the long-term efficacy of this memory retraining protocol&#xD;
      through the inclusion of a 6-month follow-up assessment. Many cognitive remediation studies&#xD;
      in the literature examine the efficacy of the treatment immediately following program&#xD;
      completion. However, given the time, expense, and labor involved in such intensive treatment,&#xD;
      it is important to demonstrate the long-term efficacy of such a program. The current study&#xD;
      therefore goes beyond the typical protocol length to evaluate the long-term impact such&#xD;
      treatment will have on objective testing and on an individual's daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: Booster sessions have been used to maximize the long term benefit of cognitive&#xD;
      retraining in other patient populations. However, the utility of booster sessions has never&#xD;
      been investigated in MS. An additional question we will address in the current treatment&#xD;
      study is the impact of &quot;booster sessions&quot; following the completion of the treatment protocol.&#xD;
