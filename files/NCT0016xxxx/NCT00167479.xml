  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of&#xD;
      risperidone monotherapy in the treatment of ambulatory bipolar disorder with comorbid&#xD;
      lifetime panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder and current at least moderately&#xD;
      severe anxiety.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 8-week trial of&#xD;
      risperidone monotherapy in outpatient subjects with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or NOS&#xD;
      disorder, a lifetime panic or generalized anxiety disorder, and current at least moderately&#xD;
      severe anxiety symptoms. Approximately 90 subjects will be enrolled to obtain 60 subjects who&#xD;
      complete the 8-week trial. Subjects will be randomized to risperidone or placebo in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. No concomitant psychotropic medication will be allowed except for prn lorazepam during&#xD;
      the first two weeks for the management of affective and anxiety symptoms, and prn zolpidem&#xD;
      and zaleplon throughout the study for the management of insomnia. Throughout the study,&#xD;
      psychiatric scales will be used to assess psychiatric symptoms and the presence of&#xD;
      treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored and recorded.&#xD;
