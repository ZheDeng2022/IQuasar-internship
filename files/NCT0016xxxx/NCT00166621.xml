      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety, and population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and determinants of drug responses to buspirone in children with autism&#xD;
      using a randomized, double blind, cross over study in children ages 2 to 6 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined as qualitative impairment in social&#xD;
      interaction and communication and restrictive stereotype patterns of behavior, interests and&#xD;
      activities. Pharmacological agents are being increasingly used off label in very young&#xD;
      autistic children, and there is virtually no data regarding the pharmacokinetics, safety or&#xD;
      efficacy of these agents in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach in this study differs from pharmacotherapy studies of autism carried out thus&#xD;
      far in several ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the rationale underlying our approach is based upon an attempt to alter synaptic&#xD;
           plasticity during postnatal development, focusing on very young children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are integrating our drug trial with a PG study evaluating whether buspirone response is&#xD;
           related to expression of genes involved in serotoninergic neurotransmission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will assess these variables together with in vivo assessment of serotonin synthesis&#xD;
           capacity with PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, crossover study where children will be&#xD;
      stratified by age into two groups. Treatment will last for 12 weeks with dosing twice a day.&#xD;
      Parent ratings, cognitive tests and blood sampling will occur throughout the study period.&#xD;
