      The goal of this study is to determine whether thalidomide can stop the progression of&#xD;
      fibrosis in IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, feasibility and efficacy of&#xD;
      400 mg of thalidomide administered daily for one year in patients with idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis (IPF) who have failed or are not candidates for treatment with corticosteroids&#xD;
      and/or cytotoxic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of patients with biopsy-proven moderate to severe IPF who&#xD;
      have failed or are not candidates for standard therapy with corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an unmasked Phase II, safety and efficacy trial of subjects with biopsy-proven IPF&#xD;
      who have failed or are not candidates for standard therapy with corticosteroids and/or&#xD;
      cytotoxic drugs. The study doctors are interested in studying the effects of the oral drug&#xD;
      Thalomid(R) on IPF. Thalomid(R) (thalidomide) is an approved medication for Hansen's disease&#xD;
      (leprosy). It is know to have anti-inflammatory effects and effects on fibrosis. It is hoped&#xD;
      that Thalomid(R) may prevent progression of IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalidomide is investigational for this use, which means that it has not been approved by the&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age range for this study is 50-80 years, inclusive. There are 6 visits over the 12 month&#xD;
      period. These visits include physical exams, pregnancy tests (if applicable), several symptom&#xD;
      scales and questionnaires about your pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary function testing,&#xD;
      x-rays,peripheral nerve testing, and blood tests including arterial blood gas measurements.&#xD;
      You will be given the medication in capsule form every 28 days for a year. There is a set&#xD;
      schedule for increasing the doses of the thalidomide every 2 weeks until it reaches the 400&#xD;
      mg. dose that is being studies. A stool softener is also provided for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects must read, sign and follow a manual of precautions prepared by Celgene, the&#xD;
      manufacturer of Thalomid(R), before enrolling in this study. This manual, containing the&#xD;
      S.T.E.P.S.(R) precautions, will be given to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions located in Baltimore,&#xD;
      Maryland.&#xD;
