      We propose to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct cross-sectional assessments of depression, disability, health-related quality of&#xD;
           life, eating patterns, and eating attitudes in a population-based sample approximately&#xD;
           6000 women aged 40-60 with over-sampling of women with BMI greater than 30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among obese women free of depression, enroll approximately 100 in a 6-month standard&#xD;
           behavior therapy weight management program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among obese women with significant depression, randomly assign 200 to either a 6-month&#xD;
           standard behavior therapy weight management program or a combined cognitive-behavior&#xD;
           therapy program focused on both depression and weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete follow up assessments of weight, depressive symptoms, and functional status in&#xD;
           all three treatment groups for 12 months following enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and follow-up data will be used to address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association between depression and obesity among middle-aged women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific effects of depression and obesity on functional status, disability, and health&#xD;
           services utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of depression on participation in and outcomes of a standardized weight&#xD;
           management program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Benefit of combined treatment (focused on depression and weight management) above that&#xD;
           of standardized behavioral therapy for obese women with significant depressive symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a significant and growing public health concern, accounting for approximately&#xD;
      300,000 excess deaths per year and approximately 9% of US health care expenditures.&#xD;
      Prevalence of obesity has steadily increased, with an estimated rate among middle-aged women&#xD;
      exceeding 30%. Obesity has a substantial impact on medical morbidity and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public health approaches to the prevention and treatment of obesity must consider the&#xD;
      substantial overlap with depression. Some data suggest a 50% increase in risk of depression&#xD;
      among obese women. Women with a history of depression or depression treatment are&#xD;
      over-represented among those seeking obesity treatment. Current or past depression is also&#xD;
      associated with less success in losing weight or maintaining weight loss. Because women with&#xD;
      depressive disorders are typically excluded from clinical trials of weight loss treatments,&#xD;
      data on the management of comorbid depression and obesity are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose two related studies: A population-based epidemiologic study of the association&#xD;
      between obesity and depression among women and a longitudinal study of obesity treatment&#xD;
      among two cohorts (one with comorbid obesity and depression, one with obesity only)&#xD;
      identified by the epidemiologic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1 - Epidemiologic Study: A population-based sample of approximately 6000 women aged&#xD;
      40-65 will complete structured telephone assessment of weight, nutrient intake, physical&#xD;
      activity, depression, functional impairment, and disability. Women with Body Mass Index (BMI)&#xD;
      &gt;30 will be oversampled. Insurance claims data will be used to measure health care costs.&#xD;
      Aims of the epidemiologic study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the association between obesity and depression among middle-aged women.&#xD;
           Secondary analyses will examine possible mechanisms for any association.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the specific contributions of obesity and depression to disability, functional&#xD;
           impairment, and health care utilization and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 - Treatment study: A cohort of approximately 100 women with obesity (BMI &gt; 30) and no&#xD;
      current depressive disorder will be enrolled in a 6-month state-of-the-art group weight loss&#xD;
      treatment. Approximately 200 women with comorbid obesity and depression will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the identical weight loss treatment or to a combined cognitive-behavior&#xD;
      group therapy program focused on both depression and weight loss. Aims of the treatment study&#xD;
      will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the effect of depression on success in weight loss treatment by comparing weight&#xD;
           loss, nutrient intake, and physical activity in depressed and non-depressed women&#xD;
           enrolled in the identical weight loss program. Secondary analyses will examine&#xD;
           mechanisms for any observed difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the benefits of a combined weight loss/depression intervention above those of&#xD;
           weight loss treatment alone by comparing weight loss, nutrient intake, physical&#xD;
           activity, depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and disability in the two groups&#xD;
           of women with comorbid obesity and depression randomly assigned to the two different&#xD;
           intervention programs.&#xD;
