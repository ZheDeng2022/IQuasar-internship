      Children having open heart surgery must be on a heart-lung bypass machine. It is essential&#xD;
      that the blood in the heart-lung machine does not clot. This is accomplished by giving a drug&#xD;
      called heparin, a &quot;blood thinner&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of making a clot involves a lot of steps. One of the steps involves a protein&#xD;
      called thrombin. Heparin acts on thrombin to keep blood from clotting. A technique has been&#xD;
      developed to measure the blood's ability to generate thrombin. The bloods's ability to&#xD;
      generate thrombin is measured by a thrombin generation curve (TGC). This curve would be very&#xD;
      helpful to know when choosing the dose of heparin. We haven't found any studies using TGC in&#xD;
      babies less than a month old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to do a study comparing the TGC in 10 newborns without a heart defect to the TGC in&#xD;
      10 newborns with a congenital heart defect. To do this we will need one sample of blood. the&#xD;
      sample we need is 3 cc which is a little more than 1/2 teaspoon. The blood sample for both&#xD;
      groups is to be taken from the intravenous catheter (IV) the child will have placed for&#xD;
      surgery. The newborns without a heart defect will be children having surgery for a&#xD;
      non-cardiac problem.&#xD;

      Neonates are unique due to maturational differences in their coagulation systems. During the&#xD;
      first few months of life, distinct differences exist between the coagulation system of a&#xD;
      neonate and that of an adult including differences between the concentration of coagulation&#xD;
      proteins, the ability to generate thrombin and the ability to inhibit thrombin once it is&#xD;
      formed (1). One important coagulant protein that is quantitatively deficient in the first&#xD;
      several months of life is prothrombin. In the coagulation cascade, prothrombin is converted&#xD;
      into thrombin, a major regulator of hemostasis. In healthy newborns mean prothrombin values&#xD;
      are less than 70% of adult mean values (1), and investigators have found that neonatal&#xD;
      prothrombin level is directly proportional to the amount of thrombin generated (1). In fact,&#xD;
      the impaired ability of newborn plasma to generate thrombin in the face of deficient&#xD;
      prothrombin has been shown to be similar to adults who are being treated therapeutically with&#xD;
      an anticoagulant (2). Therefore, low prothrombin levels in neonates have important&#xD;
      implications when considering anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For neonates with congenital heart disease presenting for cardiac surgery, anticoagulation&#xD;
      for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is necessary to prevent clotting as blood comes into contact&#xD;
      with the unphysiologic surfaces of the extracorporeal circuit. This is achieved by the use of&#xD;
      high dose heparin, which is used to inhibit the formation and activation of thrombin. Since&#xD;
      neonatal prothrombin levels are low, rendering them unable to generate large amounts of&#xD;
      thrombin, neonates with congenital heart disease requiring anticoagulation for CPB have&#xD;
      historically been considered heparin sensitive (3). However, in a recent investigation&#xD;
      conducted by this group, elevated baseline levels of thrombin production and activity were&#xD;
      consistently found in neonates presenting for cardiac surgery (4). Additionally, despite&#xD;
      routine heparin dosing, elevated markers of thrombin production were also found in these&#xD;
      neonates during CPB when compared to their adult counterparts (4). Perhaps the assumption&#xD;
      that neonates with congenital heart disease are similar to other healthy neonates in their&#xD;
      impaired ability to generate thrombin is incorrect. Contact activation may occur&#xD;
      preoperatively from the presence of indwelling umbilical catheters and central lines or from&#xD;
      interventional manipulations in the cardiac catheterization lab and stimulate their&#xD;
      coagulation systems to generate more thrombin than anticipated. Elevated thrombin levels in&#xD;
      neonates presenting for cardiac surgery would consequently have important implications in&#xD;
      determining the optimal heparin dose needed to provide adequate anticoagulation for CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A technique has been developed to monitor the thrombin generating capacity of plasma (5). A&#xD;
      thrombin generation curve (TGC) can be constructed from a sample of plasma and the area under&#xD;
      the TGC, called the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), is a good indicator of the&#xD;
      coagulability of the sample. Currently, we have found no published data addressing the TGC in&#xD;
      the neonatal population. Therefore, we propose a prospective study between neonates with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease presenting for cardiac surgery and other healthy neonates to compare&#xD;
      their respective abilities to generate thrombin by measuring TGCs.&#xD;
