      The main purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to put into practice a&#xD;
      cardiac screening program for survivors of Hodgkin's disease. In this study, we would also&#xD;
      like to screen for cardiac risk factors that can be modified either through life-style&#xD;
      changes or medications, to uncover significant abnormal heart findings in which treatments&#xD;
      may be needed, and to see if there is a link between cardiac health and quality of life.&#xD;

      -  On the day of the patient's scheduled follow-up visit with their oncologist, additional&#xD;
           blood work will be obtained and the patient will fill out questionnaires concerning&#xD;
           their general health and assessing quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A separate cardiology visit with a preventative cardiologist will be performed. At this&#xD;
           visit, the patient will undergo a Stress Echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Stress Echocardiogram is made up of three parts: Resting echo study, stress test and&#xD;
           repeat echo while the heart is still beating fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A resting echo provides the baseline examination and demonstrates the size and function&#xD;
           of various chambers of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The stress test involves exercise using a treadmill or a stationary bike. In patients&#xD;
           who are unable to complete a high level of exercise due to physical limitations, stress&#xD;
           to the heart is provided by a pharmaceutical or chemical stimulation to the heart.&#xD;
           Exercise is started at a slower, warm-up speed and then increased every 3 minutes.&#xD;
           Exercise is abruptly stopped once the patient exceeds 85% of the target rate. EKG&#xD;
           recordings are made every minute of exercise and then again after exercise is stopped.&#xD;
           Blood pressure is recorded at three minute intervals during exercise and then again at&#xD;
           rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately after exercise is stopped, the patient will undergo a repeat echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no cardiac abnormalities are detected, the screening tests will be repeated every 3&#xD;
           years, if the patient is less than 10 years out from their initial treatment. If the&#xD;
           patient is more than 10 years from initial treatment, then the tests will be repeated at&#xD;
           approximately 18 months from the initial screening and once more at the end of the third&#xD;
           year.&#xD;
