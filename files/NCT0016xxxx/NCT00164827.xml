      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency worldwide. In Hong Kong it&#xD;
      accounts for about 5% of all admissions through the Accident and Emergency Department1. The&#xD;
      most common cause is bleeding from a peptic ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcers bleed when an artery at the base of the ulcer is eroded, Bleeding from such an eroded&#xD;
      artery may be intermittent, as the artery may be plugged by a thrombus. Dislodgement of the&#xD;
      clot results in rebleeding. Rebleeding has long been recognized as one of the worse&#xD;
      prognosticators for ulcer bleeding and is associated with a 6-10 fold increase in mortality.&#xD;
      Rebleeding is associated with a major bleed manifested by hematemesis and hypotension,&#xD;
      indicating that a large size vessel has been eroded. Such vessels, and the clot plugging&#xD;
      them, may be visible endoscopically and have been named &quot;stigmata of recent haemorrhage&quot;.&#xD;
      Such stigmata are associated with a higher risk of rebleeding. High-risk stigmata, such as&#xD;
      active bleeding, a protuberant &quot;visible vessel&quot;, or an adherent clot, are now used to select&#xD;
      patients who are liable to rebleed for endoscopic therapy. In recent years, with advances in&#xD;
      endoscopic technology and expertise, therapeutic endoscopy has taken over as the first line&#xD;
      therapy for bleeding5. Techniques such as injection therapy, thermal coagulation and clip&#xD;
      application have been shown to be highly effective in controlling bleeding7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rebleeding after endoscopic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rebleeding is the most important prognostic factor in patients with ulcer haemorrhage. It&#xD;
      carries a 10-fold increase in mortality. Rebleeding can be predicted by hematemesis and shock&#xD;
      on admission. Before the era of therapeutic endoscopy traditional dogma recommends early&#xD;
      surgery to preempt another catastrophic bleed in these patients. With the advent of effective&#xD;
      endoscopic haemostasis the place of early surgery is less clear. Indeed a trial at our center&#xD;
      indicates that repeat endoscopic therapy can salvage 75% of rebleeding patients without&#xD;
      compromising patient safety10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled repeat endoscopy at 24 hour intervals have been used to detect and retreat any&#xD;
      remaining stigmata11. Such a policy also subjects many patients to unnecessary endoscopy and&#xD;
      treatment but has not been shown to improve outcome. Re-endoscopy at 24-hour intervals misses&#xD;
      rebleeding that occurs in the interim, but repeated endoscopy at closer intervals is&#xD;
      impractical. Some authors has suggested combining clinical endoscopic data in a scoring&#xD;
      system to select patients for repeat endoscopic re-treatment, and demonstrated improved&#xD;
      outcome in a small series. Others have used Doppler signals in arteries in the ulcer base to&#xD;
      predict failures of endoscopic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition of rebleeding - Use of wireless endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical rebleeding is usually defined as vomiting of red blood, hemodynamic instability or&#xD;
      drop in the hemoglobin level after initial stabilization. These clinical features appear only&#xD;
      after a significant amount of blood has been lost. There is, at present, no reliable method&#xD;
      of detecting rebleeding in a timely fashion. If there is a reliable early warning system,&#xD;
      analogous to ECG monitoring for arrhythmia in patients who has had a myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      we may be able to intervene in time to preempt the harmful effects of further major blood&#xD;
      loss in a patient who has already bled from the ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy using a pill sized (11mm x 26mm, weight ~ 4 grams) capsule endoscope was first&#xD;
      reported by Iddan. The capsule can be swallowed and transmit images from various part of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract as the capsule traverses the gastrointestinal tract. The main&#xD;
      indication at present is the visualization of the small intestine, especially for locating&#xD;
      sources of bleeding that are beyond the range of gastroscopy and colonoscopy. The battery of&#xD;
      the capsule lasts for up to 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to use the capsule endoscope to monitor the bleeding peptic ulcer after therapeutic&#xD;
      endoscopy in order to detect rebleeding before clinical manifestation.&#xD;
