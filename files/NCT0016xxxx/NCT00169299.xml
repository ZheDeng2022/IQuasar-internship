  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surveys indicate that 25 to 33% of women have moderate to severe menopausal symptoms&#xD;
      including hot flashes, night sweats, and disturbed sleep. The treatment of choice in the&#xD;
      medical community for these symptoms is hormone replacement therapy, which is estrogen and&#xD;
      sometimes progestin. Many women also use over-the-counter herbal remedies. However, less is&#xD;
      known about how well these products work, or their safety. Few have undergone the kind of&#xD;
      rigorous testing required of prescription drugs and little is known about their long-term&#xD;
      effectiveness in relieving symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare several over-the-counter herbal remedies to hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy. Our primary aim is to look at the effects of these remedies on your&#xD;
      self-reported menopausal symptoms. We will also be measuring their effects on other factors&#xD;
      known to be affected by hormone replacement therapy: cholesterol, blood sugar, bone density,&#xD;
      vaginal cell structure, and blood clotting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hormone replacement therapy (HT: estrogen and progestin) remains the treatment of choice for&#xD;
      women with vasomotor symptoms, and long-term HT has been recommended for prevention purposes.&#xD;
      The demand for alternatives to HT, and the availability and use of over-the-counter products&#xD;
      including dietary phytoestrogen supplements, and naturopathic medicines has grown&#xD;
      dramatically. Few of these products have faced the rigors of randomized trials and none have&#xD;
      been tested to evaluate their effects on long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this 4-year, randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of three alternative approaches utilizing phytoestrogens to treat vasomotor symptoms&#xD;
      in peri- and postmenopausal women. The treatments were chosen because of the scientific&#xD;
      evidence supporting a possible benefit, the availability of products with adequate quality&#xD;
      control, their frequency of use in naturopathic medicine, and our ability to blind&#xD;
      participants to the intervention. The 5 proposed treatment arms are: 1) conjugated equine&#xD;
      estrogen with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with or without an intact&#xD;
      uterus respectively; 2) a single herbal product, black cohosh; 3) a multibotanical&#xD;
      preparation; 4) a combination regimen that includes the same multibotanical preparation plus&#xD;
      soy diet counseling; and 5) placebo. Our primary aim is to compare the effects of three&#xD;
      alternative treatments, HRT and placebo on the frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms&#xD;
      measured by The Wiklund Menopause Symptom Checklist and a daily Vasomotor Symptom Diary. Our&#xD;
      secondary aims are to compare the effects of three alternative treatments, HRT and placebo&#xD;
      on: 1) vaginal cytology (vaginal maturation index); 2) serum lipids (total cholesterol, HDL&#xD;
      and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides); 3) bone mineral density (hip and spine dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry scan); 4) glucose metabolism (insulin, fasting blood glucose); and 5)&#xD;
      coagulation factors (fibrinogen, PAI-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are that compared to placebo, the three alternative treatments tested in this&#xD;
      proposal will; reduce frequency of hot flashes and night sweats, improve vaginal maturation&#xD;
      and decrease vagina atrophy as measured by maturation index, lower total cholesterol and LDL&#xD;
      with no effect on HDL, reduce the rate of decline in bone mineral density (BMD), and have no&#xD;
      effect on glucose metabolism or clotting factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish our specific aims we will: 1) recruit and randomize approximately peri- and&#xD;
      post-women to one of 5 treatment arms for one year; 2) collect measurements of primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months; and 3) compare changes in outcomes in&#xD;
      the groups taking alternative treatments to those in the HRT and placebo groups.&#xD;
