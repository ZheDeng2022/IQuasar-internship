    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if omalizumab is effective in treating non-allergic&#xD;
      asthma. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of omalizumab to treat&#xD;
      moderate to severe allergic asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lower airways. The inflammatory process is&#xD;
      associated with changes in airway hyperresponsiveness (irritability), and airflow limitations&#xD;
      caused by bronchoconstriction, edema, and mucous plugging. Mast cells, basophils,&#xD;
      eosinophils, activated T-lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and airway epithelial cells&#xD;
      all play a role in this inflammatory process by releasing mediators directly responsible for&#xD;
      local inflammation and by releasing mediators that encourage a further influx of inflammatory&#xD;
      cells (Expert Panel Report 2, 1997). These cells and their products eventually produce a&#xD;
      state of chronic allergic inflammation leading to increased vascular leakage, mucous&#xD;
      secretion, smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness, and nerve activation. Clinically, this process&#xD;
      is characterized by intermittent shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest&#xD;
      tightness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although most asthmatics are atopic (allergic), non-atopic asthmatics exist and can develop&#xD;
      equally severe disease. Non-allergic asthmatics have a trend towards higher than normal&#xD;
      levels of the allergic antibody (IgE) though obviously they lack skin test specificity. When&#xD;
      examining skin test reactivity and serum IgE as independent variables for asthma risk, there&#xD;
      was a stronger association with serum IgE elevation than skin test reactivity. In fact, serum&#xD;
      IgE tended to be high in asthmatics regardless of skin test reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omalizumab (Xolair®) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds specifically&#xD;
      to the (FceRI) binding site on human IgE. The binding of omalizumab inhibits the ability of&#xD;
      IgE to bind to basophils or mast cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omalizumab recently received FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent&#xD;
      allergic asthma in pediatric (12 years of age and above) and adult patients. The addition of&#xD;
      omalizumab to standard asthma therapies has been found to reduce asthma exacerbations and&#xD;
      decrease both inhaled corticosteroid dose and rescue medication use. (Busse, 2001). In a&#xD;
      phase III double blinded placebo controlled trial involving 525 severe allergic asthmatics,&#xD;
      omalizumab treated patients had fewer exacerbations during both a steroid stable phase and&#xD;
      steroid reduction phase than did placebo controls (Busse, 2001). The median reduction in&#xD;
      steroid dose during reduction phase was 75% and 50% in the omalizumab and placebo groups&#xD;
      respectively. In a similarly designed steroid reduction study involving 6 to 12 year-old&#xD;
      moderate to severe allergic asthmatics, steroid reduction was possible in 100% of treated&#xD;
      patient verses 66.7% of placebo treated patients (Milgrom, 2001). Other steroid reduction&#xD;
      studies have had similar results (Buhl 2002, Soler 2001). Omalizumab has also been shown to&#xD;
      improve quality of life in allergic asthmatics as measured by the Asthma Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (AQLQ). In adults, AQLQ demonstrated greater improvement at 16, 28 and 52 weeks&#xD;
      in omalizumab treated patients than in placebo treated (Finn 2003). Similarly in pediatric&#xD;
      populations, AQLQ improvement reached statistical significance in omalizumab treated patients&#xD;
      (Lemanske 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omalizumab has shown itself to be a promising new therapy for the treatment of moderate to&#xD;
      severe allergic asthma. It is currently not indicated for patients with non-allergic asthma.&#xD;
      The objective of this study will be to define the effects of omalizumab on cell surface FceRI&#xD;
      expression and serum IgE of non-allergic asthmatics.&#xD;
