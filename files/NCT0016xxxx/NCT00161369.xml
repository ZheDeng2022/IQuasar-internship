  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homocysteine (Hcy) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) have recently been recognized as&#xD;
      potential risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population, and the metabolism of&#xD;
      each of these substances seems to be closely related. This study investigates the association&#xD;
      between these substances, and whether elevated serum levels of Hcy and ADMA would be related&#xD;
      to a high risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events in maintenance hemodialysis (HD)&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Objective- Homocysteine (Hcy) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) have recently been&#xD;
      recognized as potential risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population, and the&#xD;
      metabolism of each of these substances seems to be closely related. This study investigates&#xD;
      the association between these substances, and whether elevated serum levels of Hcy and ADMA&#xD;
      would be related to a high risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events in maintenance&#xD;
      hemodialysis (HD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods- The subjects were recruited from both day-time and night-time HD patients at&#xD;
      Maruyama Hospital. The study inclusion criteria were those patients who had been receiving&#xD;
      hemodialysis therapy for more than 6 months, were in a stable condition and were under 70&#xD;
      years old. The degree of atherosclerosis was evaluated by four indices involving the carotid&#xD;
      artery intima-media thickness (IMT), carotid artery plaque, percentile of calcification index&#xD;
      in the abdominal aortic wall (ACI) and elongation of the thoracic aorta. At the same time,&#xD;
      plasma Hcy and ADMA were measured. After the initial laboratory examination and evaluation of&#xD;
      the degree of atherosclerosis, all the patients were followed up for 5 years.&#xD;
