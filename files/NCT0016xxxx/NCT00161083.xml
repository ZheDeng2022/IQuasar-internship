  <brief_summary>

      We conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on effects of UDCA on biliary&#xD;
      pain and complications in highly symptomatic gallstone patients scheduled for&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. We also evaluate potential beneficial effects of impaired gallbladder&#xD;
      motility&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gallstone disease is very common with an estimated prevalence of 10-15% in the adult Western&#xD;
      population. Approximately 90% of gallstone carriers are asymptomatic. The annual risk of&#xD;
      biliary colic in asymptomatic gallstone carriers has been suggested to be approximately 1%.&#xD;
      Also, asymptomatic gallstone carriers are at risk for acute pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis&#xD;
      and acute cholecystitis. Although accurate prospective data are lacking, annual incidences of&#xD;
      these potentially lethal complications are estimated to be approximately 0.2%, 0.2% and 0.3%,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One can easily imagine that migration of gallbladder stones into the common bile duct may&#xD;
      lead to biliary pain. How gallbladder stones remaining in the gallbladder lead to biliary&#xD;
      symptoms is not entirely clear. Strong gallbladder contraction, with temporary impaction of&#xD;
      the stone in the orifice of the cystic duct might cause biliary pain. Although impaired&#xD;
      gallbladder motility could therefore theoretically protect against colics, symptomatic&#xD;
      gallbladder stone patients often have complaints despite coexistent impaired gallbladder&#xD;
      emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been claimed to reduce the risk of biliary pain, regardless&#xD;
      of gallstone dissolution. In a large study by Tomida et al., risks of biliary pain or&#xD;
      gallstone complications (acute cholecystitis) were reduced in both symptomatic and&#xD;
      asymptomatic gallstone carriers, although gallstones were generally not dissolved. Also,&#xD;
      biliary pancreatitis might be prevented by long-term UDCA treatment. Increased fasting and&#xD;
      residual postprandial gallbladder volumes during UDCA treatment, less cholesterol crystals or&#xD;
      decreased mucin contents in bile could be the underlying mechanisms for these beneficial&#xD;
      effects. However, prospective studies on effects of UDCA on symptoms or complications in&#xD;
      highly symptomatic patients are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Netherlands symptomatic gallstone patients are admitted to a waiting list for elective&#xD;
      cholecystectomy by general surgeons. The waiting period may last several months because of&#xD;
      logistic reasons. During this waiting period gallstone patients are at risk for biliary pain&#xD;
      and complications. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial on effects of UDCA on biliary pain and complications in highly symptomatic gallstone&#xD;
      patients scheduled for cholecystectomy. We also evaluated potential beneficial effects of&#xD;
      impaired gallbladder motility&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients between 18 and 75 years of age study are upon admission to the waiting list&#xD;
             for elective cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  presence of gallbladder stones or sludge, without bile duct stones or bile duct&#xD;
                  dilatation at ultrasonography;\&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  at least one episode of severe right upper quadrant or midline epigastric pain of&#xD;
                  at least 30 min. duration, with radiation and/or movement urge, or at least three&#xD;
                  episodes of severe right upper quadrant or midline epigastric pain of at least 30&#xD;
                  min. duration without such radiation or movement urge, in the previous 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contra-indication for general anaesthesia or surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or previous acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice or pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous papillotomy, because of preferential flow of UDCA-enriched bile to the&#xD;
             intestine rather than to the gallbladder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or previous use of UDCA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to speak Dutch or English or mental disability&#xD;
