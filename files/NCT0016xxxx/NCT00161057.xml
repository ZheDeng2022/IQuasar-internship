  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we, the investigators at UMC Utrecht, intend to investigate changes in brain&#xD;
      activation patterns using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in patients suffering&#xD;
      from schizophrenia who are medication naive or off medication, before using medication and&#xD;
      after 8 weeks of medication. Patients will perform a working memory task, a language task and&#xD;
      a motor task while lying in the scanner. We hypothesize that the efficiency of the working&#xD;
      memory system is reduced and that the lateralization of language is diminished in these&#xD;
      patients, and that these functions will normalize after treatment.&#xD;

      Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder with a wide range of symptoms and signs including&#xD;
      hallucinations, delusions, disorganisation, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits.&#xD;
      Investigation of the neural substrates of the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia has&#xD;
      revealed abnormalities in brain activity patterns. Particularly, earlier studies using&#xD;
      functional FMRI conducted at the UMCU, revealed diminished language laterality, deficits in&#xD;
      working memory and a reduced ability to automate cognitive processes. The aim of this project&#xD;
      is to study the relationship between these brain activation patterns and neuroleptic&#xD;
      treatment. More insight into psychopharmacological effects on brain physiology, may&#xD;
      eventually enable us to better predict what effect treatment will have on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), who are&#xD;
      medication naive or medication free for a period of at least 2 weeks will be included.&#xD;
      Patients will be tested before and after 8 weeks of treatment with an atypical antipsychotic.&#xD;
      In the scanner patients will perform a working memory task, a language task and a&#xD;
      visual-motor task. At study entry and after 8 weeks the PANSS, Clinical Global Impressions&#xD;
      (CGI) and CDSS (Calgary Depression Scale of Schizophrenia) will be performed. Besides these&#xD;
      patients, we will also include a group of matched healthy controls. We hypothesize that in&#xD;
      medication naive or patients of-medication lateralization is reduced, and that efficiency of&#xD;
      the working memory system is reduced. Lateralization is expected to correlate negatively with&#xD;
      positive functions. We expect that antipsychotic treatment will normalize brain function and&#xD;
      that the degree of normalization is correlated with the clinical measures of treatment&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
