      The purposes of this study are: (1) to investigate the incidence and causes of falls of&#xD;
      stroke patients residing in Taipei City and Taipei county after their discharge from the&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital, (2) to investigate the relationship between clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of stroke patients before their hospital discharge and their incidence of&#xD;
      falls after hospital discharge, and (3) to identify the risk factors for stroke patients who&#xD;
      frequently fall after hospital discharge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Falls are one of the most common accidents among stroke patients. Stroke patients are more&#xD;
      prone to falls than community-dwelling older adults because of their cumulative risk factors&#xD;
      of falls such as cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction. Recent studies on falls in&#xD;
      Taiwan have primarily focused on falls of community-dwelling older adults. Research focused&#xD;
      on falls among stroke patients in Taiwan, however, is scarce. Studies reported by researchers&#xD;
      in other countries have only investigated the incidence and causes of falls of patients&#xD;
      staying in medical institutions up to three months post-stroke. Therefore, the incidence and&#xD;
      immediate causes of falls remain unknown for post-hospital discharge stroke patients during&#xD;
      their sub-acute and chronic stages. In addition, whether falls of stroke patients after&#xD;
      hospital discharge could be predicted by their clinical manifestations during hospital stay&#xD;
      also requires further investigation.&#xD;
