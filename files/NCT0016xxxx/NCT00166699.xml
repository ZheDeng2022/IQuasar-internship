      The study will establish whether the use of ultrasound scanning with a purpose built probe&#xD;
      will aid the insertion of the needles for epidural and spinal anaesthesia for obese women&#xD;
      undergoing elective caesarean section The study group will be 46 obese women (defined by the&#xD;
      ratio of height to weight) at time of initial booking ultrasound scan, undergoing routine&#xD;
      caesarean section with no serious illnesses that are both willing and able to provide&#xD;
      informed consent prior to spinal epidural anaesthesia. Patients will be excluded if they have&#xD;
      signs or symptoms of systemic or local infection, if they have a history of previous spinal&#xD;
      surgery, a blood clotting abnormities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the ultrasound probe a randomised comparison&#xD;
      of the traditional clinical methods of feeling the bones of the spine and ultrasound guided&#xD;
      insertion of a combined spinal epidural anaesthetic will be undertaken. The rodiera tiped&#xD;
      17/18G 90mm tuohy needle and 123mm 27G spinal needle manufactured by Sarstedt will be the&#xD;
      regional needles used for the combined spinal epidural anaesthetic. Randomisation into two&#xD;
      groups (ultrasound guided needle insertion and feeling the bones) will be by computer&#xD;
      generated random sequence. This information will be recorded in sealed envelopes and placed&#xD;
      in the ward. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and who consent immediately prior to&#xD;
      caesarean section will be sequentially assigned a number that will correspond to a sealed&#xD;
      envelope. The main aim of the study will be to detect any difference in time taken to insert&#xD;
      epidural catheter via the needle in the patients back. The other factors measured will be the&#xD;
      number of times the skin is punctured and bone touched by the needle, number of conversions&#xD;
      from regional (spinal epidural) to general anaesthesia, patient satisfaction scores,&#xD;
      requirement for extra local anaesthetic following initial blockade during Caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The factors will be compared by student t-test using Statistica6 (StatSoft,Inc.(2001).&#xD;
      STATISTICA (data analysis software system), version 6. www.statsoft.com). A population of 46&#xD;
      patients will be required assuming a mean time for inserting a combined spinal epidural&#xD;
      without&#xD;

      Study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical evaluation of a novel ultrasound probe to guide the insertion of central&#xD;
      regional anaesthesia using a regional anaesthetic needle modified to aid insertion under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance in morbidly obese women undergoing elective caesarean section. - (full&#xD;
      title) The clinical evaluation of a novel ultrasound probe-(short title)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases of trauma to the conus medularis following spinal anaesthesia have been highlighted&#xD;
      recently by Reynolds1. A second report in the same vein described the inaccuracy of using&#xD;
      Tuffier's line between the iliac crests to identify a safe lumbar interspace2. As suspected&#xD;
      by many clinicians, precise lumbar interspace identification by palpation is prone to error.&#xD;
      Broadbent2 et al confirmed this showing that anaesthetists were only 29% accurate, as&#xD;
      determined by MRI/ (Ultrasonography was not investigated by Broadbent). The inaccuracy was&#xD;
      corroborated by Furness et al3. who showed that clinical identification by anaesthetists&#xD;
      using palpation was 30% accurate, as assessed by lumbar spine X-ray. In contrast, in the&#xD;
      latter study, placement of markers using ultrasonography at L3-4 interspace was 71% accurate,&#xD;
      a figure which is comparable with the 76% accuracy in the preliminary study described below .&#xD;
      It should be noted in the Furness study that ultrasonography was performed by a consultant&#xD;
      radiologist but in our study an anaesthetist performed the procedure. The Broadbent and&#xD;
      Furness studies both documented that identification by anaesthetists using palpation was&#xD;
      often inaccurate by two, three or four interspaces. Using ultrasound, in both the Furness3&#xD;
      study and our study, markers were always within one interspace of the intended position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbid obesity is an increasingly prevalent problem in obstetric practice. Landmarks are&#xD;
      often impalpable in obese patients making insertion of epidurals problematic. Thus there is&#xD;
      clear clinical need to develop a safe efficient way to administer epidural anaesthesia. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis of our application is that ultrasonic visualisation of the landmarks will&#xD;
      aid insertion. Further it is possible to develop and manufacture a probe for general use by&#xD;
      anaesthetists that will improve current clinical practice in this problematic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial study to investigate accuracy ultrasound by non radiologist:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory study was undertaken to determine the precision with which an anaesthetist&#xD;
      could identify the correct L3-4 interspace using ultrasonography. Twenty-three&#xD;
      ultrasonographic examinations of lumbar spine were performed by an anaesthetic senior house&#xD;
      officer with minimal training on patients undergoing an elective MRI scan of the lumbar&#xD;
      spine. Seventeen patients were eligible for inclusion in this study. Patients' median age was&#xD;
      47 years, and body mass index 27 kg/m2. In 13 of the 17 (76%) patients, the SHO using&#xD;
      ultrasonography was able to place a marker correctly at the L3-4 interspace as indicated by&#xD;
      MRI. In four patients, the marker was at the L2-3 interspace. In five of the 17 patients&#xD;
      apposition of spinous processes was noted on MRI scan and it was in three of these patients&#xD;
      that the marker was at the L2-3 interspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound has been used to aid the insertion of central neuraxial anaesthesia on three&#xD;
      occasions. (Watson et al unpublished). The 3 cases below describe the successful ultrasound&#xD;
      assisted insertion of three neuroaxial blocks to allow both emergency and elective caesarean&#xD;
      section. The first two reports are based on the same woman undergoing emergency and elective&#xD;
      section during two consecutive pregnancies complicated by obesity and pre-eclampsia. The&#xD;
      third case report was complicated by the previous spinal fusion surgery for a lumbar disc&#xD;
      prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the novel ultrasound transducer provides a method of reducing the time taken&#xD;
      to insert a combined spinal epidural anaesthetic in obese women undergoing elective caesarean&#xD;
      section&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maternity hospitals involved in this trial have in excess of 25,000 deliveries per year&#xD;
      and a significant percentage of these mothers come from under privileged backgrounds with a&#xD;
      high incidence of morbid obesity. A study population of 46 patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      those women undergoing elective caesarean section&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation into two groups will be by computer generated block randomisation method. This&#xD;
      information will be recorded in sealed envelopes and placed in the labour ward at princess&#xD;
      royal maternity. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and who consent will be&#xD;
      sequentially assigned a number that will correspond to a sealed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the study starting we will recruit and consent 10 elective section patients to&#xD;
      optimise the quality control of for imaging with the split array ultrasound transducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the ultrasound probe a randomised comparison of&#xD;
      the traditional clinical methods of palpation and ultrasound guided insertion of a&#xD;
      (CSE)combined spinal/epidural anaesthetic will be undertaken. The combined spinal epidural&#xD;
      (17/18G 90mm rodiera tiped tuohy needle and 123mm 27G spinal needle manufactured by Sarstedt&#xD;
      will be used for all patients and all the tuohy needles will be sand and bead blasted,&#xD;
      desterilised and repackaged prior to use. All patients will have a spinal anaesthetic 2.4mls&#xD;
      of heavy bupivacaine and a 22G epidural catheter sited via a 16G tuohy needle with&#xD;
      diamorphine or fentanyl. All anaesthetic procedures will be undertaken by the same&#xD;
      experienced anaesthetist. However those patients in the ultrasound group will have the&#xD;
      insertion of the tuohy needle guided by ultrasound and the will be compared to the current&#xD;
      method of palpation. All patients will then undergo elective caesarean section. Patient's&#xD;
      having an ultrasound inserted using palpation may be transferred to the ultrasound guided&#xD;
      group after 30 minutes of attempted insertions or at the discretion of the anaesthetist&#xD;
      treating the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of patients from study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient may withdraw from the study at any time without giving any reason or&#xD;
      justification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any protocol violation will result in the patient being immediately withdrawn from the study&#xD;
      If the patient requires emergency caesarean section they will be withdrawn from the study If&#xD;
      the patient is in labour prior to their intended date of operative delivery they will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study Any patient who does not undergo an caesarean section will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be time taken to insert an epidural catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of times the skin is punctured The number of times the cortex of bone touched by&#xD;
      the epidural needle The number of conversions from regional (central-neuraxial) to general&#xD;
      anaesthesia Patient satisfaction scores immediately post op and at 30 minutes post op The&#xD;
      volume and concentration of supplementary local anaesthetic administration following primary&#xD;
      spinal blockade during caesarean section Number of needle advancements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of conversions to general anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of 'dry spinal taps'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient numbers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A population of 46 patients will be required assuming a mean time for inserting a combined&#xD;
      spinal epidural without ultrasound guidance of 15 minutes and with ultrasound guidance of 10&#xD;
      minutes with a standard deviation of 5 minutes for both groups ( power=90%, alpha error&#xD;
      =0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Safety and Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time taken to perform the CSE will be recorded from the moment the skin is sterilised to&#xD;
      the moment the epidural catheter has been fixed to the skin. A record of the number of&#xD;
      attempts and number of times bone is encountered by the needle will be recorded. If patients&#xD;
      in the palpation group require ultrasound assistance to locate the epidural space this will&#xD;
      also be recorded. Drugs administered both systemically and intrathecally or epidurally will&#xD;
      be documented. Patients will be assessed immediately after insertion of the CSE with regard&#xD;
      to comfort during the procedure and and pain experienced. They shall also be reassessed 30&#xD;
      minutes postoperatively to ascertain their overall satisfaction of the technique for the&#xD;
      surgery, to ensure no pain was experienced during the operation. They should also be visited&#xD;
      on the first postoperative day, specifically to look for any complications of the CSE such as&#xD;
      headache or neuropraxia, and should receive a final check prior to discharge at 5 days to&#xD;
      ensure no adverse events have occurred.&#xD;
