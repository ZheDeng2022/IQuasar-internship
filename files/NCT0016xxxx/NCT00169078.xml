  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attempts to understand the relationship malaria transmission intensity and antimalarial drug&#xD;
      resistance had rested mainly on mathematical models. To date, except for two studies which&#xD;
      reported reductions in the prevalence of drug resistance in Tanzania and Zimbabwe, no other&#xD;
      field data addressed the impact of reducing malaria transmission by the use of vector control&#xD;
      measures on antimalarial drug resistance. Thus whether vector control decrease or increase&#xD;
      drug resistance remains a contentious issue. The aim of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      impact of insecticide-treated curtains (ITCs) on clinical and parasitological outcomes in&#xD;
      children with uncomplicated malaria treated with chloroquine (CQ), on the prevalence of&#xD;
      genetic markers of resistance to CQ and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and on the ability of&#xD;
      children to clear drug resistant parasites. The therapeutic efficacy of CQ was studied in 9&#xD;
      villages which used ITCs for 6-8 years and 9 villages with no history of ITC use. A&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey was also conducted to estimate the prevalence of genetic markers of&#xD;
      resistance to CQ and SP in asymptomatic children.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drug resistance has been associated with increased numbers of hospital admissions,&#xD;
           increased cases of clinical malaria and malaria-specific mortality . Several strategies&#xD;
           have been proposed as means by which the spread of antimalarial drugs resistance could&#xD;
           be delayed. These strategies include reducing drug pressure, improving the quality of&#xD;
           drug use, using combinations of antimalarial drugs and use of vector control measures.&#xD;
           Restricting the use of drugs to reduce drug pressure is presently unrealistic due to&#xD;
           poor access to health facilities and a lack of equipment. Improving the quality of use&#xD;
           of antimalarials through the use of pre-packaged doses, education and training is a&#xD;
           sound control strategy. However, the impact of this strategy on drug resistance has not&#xD;
           yet been evaluated. Another promising approach to contain drug resistance is the use of&#xD;
           combination therapies. The most successful combinations so far are those using&#xD;
           artemisinin and its derivatives. It is likely that implementing combination therapy in&#xD;
           resource limited countries will be hampered by its high cost. Given their impact in&#xD;
           reducing malaria transmission, cases of clinical malaria and all-cause malaria&#xD;
           mortality, insecticide-treated materials (ITMs) have recently been proposed as a&#xD;
           potential tool for delaying the development and spread of drug resistance. So far, the&#xD;
           debate on the interaction between malaria transmission intensity and drug resistance has&#xD;
           been driven by analytical models and, to our knowledge, only 2 field studies have yet&#xD;
           addressed the impact of ITMs on antimalarial drug resistance. If ITMs reduced the&#xD;
           development and spread of antimalarial drug resistance, this would enhance their&#xD;
           usefulness as a malaria control tool. This study examines the impact of&#xD;
           insecticide-treated curtains (ITC)used over 6-8 years on the prevalence of antimalarial&#xD;
           drug resistance in Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the frequency of in vivo clinical and parasitological failures&#xD;
                following treatment of uncomplicated malaria with CQ in children living in villages&#xD;
                protected and not protected by insecticide treated curtains (ITC).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if children in ITC and non-ITC villages with clinical malaria differ&#xD;
                in their ability to clear genetically resistant parasites after treatment with CQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the proportions of children infected with parasites carrying the&#xD;
                pfcrt-76T and pfmdr1-86Y alleles associated with resistance to CQ in villages&#xD;
                protected and not protected by ITC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the proportions of children infected with parasites carrying parasites&#xD;
                with the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps)&#xD;
                alleles associated with resistant to SP in ITC and non- ITC protected villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To relate in vivo clinical and parasitological failure rates to the presence of&#xD;
                genotypic markers of resistance to CQ by estimating genotype-failure indices (GFIs)&#xD;
                and genotype-resistance indices (GRIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Field work&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive case detection was used to recruit children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated&#xD;
      malaria using a slightly modified version of the standard WHO in vivo method for assessing&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy of anti-malarial drugs .Children seeking care at the selected health&#xD;
      centres were screened for eligibility to join the study, enrolled and followed up for 14&#xD;
      days. If a child's axillary temperature was &gt;=37.5 ºC and no obvious cause of fever other&#xD;
      than malaria was found on clinical examination, about 500 ml of blood was drawn into a&#xD;
      micro-container containing EDTA. Microscopic diagnosis of malaria and measurement of&#xD;
      packed-cell volume (PCV) were performed immediately after samples were received in the&#xD;
      laboratory. After enrolment, further clinical examinations were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 7,&#xD;
      and 14. In addition, the caretakers were advised to bring children back to the health centre&#xD;
      at any time between day 1 and day 14 if the child's condition did not improve. Thick and thin&#xD;
      blood films and filter paper blood spots were prepared on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and at unscheduled&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of children and treatment outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard treatment with CQ was administered to children with uncomplicated malaria. The&#xD;
      treatment dosing was 25 mg/kg body weight of CQ over 3 days; 10 mg/kg on days 0, 1 and 5&#xD;
      mg/kg on day 2. Treatment was administered at the clinic under the supervision of a nurse.&#xD;
      Outcomes for the in vivo trial were classified according to the WHO clinical and&#xD;
      parasitological assessment system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of pfcrt-76 and pfmdr1-86 mutations in the community&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional survey was conducted to estimate the prevalence of pfcrt-76 and pfmdr1-86&#xD;
      mutations in asymptomatic children. Random samples of children aged 6 to 59 months and&#xD;
      children aged 5 years to 14 years were selected per village. Thick and thin blood films and&#xD;
      filter paper blood spots were prepared from a finger-prick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of the entomological inoculation rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the peak period of malaria transmission (September&#xD;
      2002) for the estimation of the EIR. Catches were performed using CDC light traps. An ELISA&#xD;
      test was used to detect the presence of P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-economic and health seeking behaviour survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, a survey was performed in a random sample of 20 compounds in each village to collect&#xD;
      data on health seeking behaviour, socio-economic and demographic features of the study&#xD;
      population including the frequencies of population movements between villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Laboratory methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thick and thin blood films were stained with Giemsa stain (3%) for 45 minutes. Asexual&#xD;
      parasites and gametocytes of P. falciparum were counted against 400 white blood cells. For&#xD;
      molecular biology analyses, DNA was extracted from pre, post-treatment and cross-sectional&#xD;
      survey filter paper blood spots using chelex. DNA was amplified by nested PCR to detect&#xD;
      mutations at pfcrt-76. Nest 2 PCR products were digested by Apo I endonuclease restriction&#xD;
      enzyme and electrophoresed onto a 3% agarose. Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing&#xD;
      (SSOP) was performed to detect the presence of pfmdr1-86 mutation. Mutations at dhfr (51, 59&#xD;
      and 108) and at dhps ( 437 and 540) were also detected by SSOP. MSP2 gene polymorphisms were&#xD;
      studied by PCR to differentiate recrudescence from new infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Sample size and power&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 18 communities (9 per group), the study would have 80% power to detect, at the 5%&#xD;
      significance level, a 50% decrease in clinical failure rate in eligible children. This number&#xD;
      of communities would also permit the detection of a 40% decrease in parasitological failure&#xD;
      rate in eligible children with the same power, and at least 60% and 40% increases in clinical&#xD;
      and parasitological failure rates, at 5% significance level, in children carrying parasites&#xD;
      with CQ resistant genotypes before CQ treatment was started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Data processing and analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two data clerks independently entered data onto computers using EPIINFO version 6.0. Analyses&#xD;
      were performed using STATA (Release 8.2, www.stata.com). The study main endpoints were&#xD;
      examined using Generalized Estimating Equations regression model&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Community approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was obtained after meetings with community leaders to explain the objectives of the&#xD;
      study and what it involved. In addition to community consent, individual signed informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from caretakers of children before enrolment.&#xD;
