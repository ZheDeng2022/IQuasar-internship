  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the efficacy and safety of higher doses of&#xD;
      rituximab to a combination of standard doses of Rituxan + CVP (Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine,&#xD;
      and Prednisone) in patients with chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP who did not&#xD;
      respond to or relapsed after standard doses of rituximab.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficacy: The primary objective (primary endpoint) is to determine the rate of response&#xD;
           (partial or complete response) at week 16 (± 2) post-treatment in both pilot arms: the&#xD;
           high dose Rituximab (or HDR) group (750 mg/m2 x 4) and the group treated with a regimen&#xD;
           combining standard doses of Rituximab with CVP (R-CVP.) A complete response (CR) will be&#xD;
           a platelet count increase ³ 150,000/mL on two consecutive occasions one week apart,&#xD;
           without any other therapy. A partial response will be considered if the platelet count&#xD;
           increases between 50 and 150,000/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety: To assess and compare the incidence of moderate and severe adverse-events&#xD;
           including the number and type of infections in both arms of the study using Genentech&#xD;
           standard safety monitoring and serious adverse event (SAE) reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the response rate in the 2 treatment arms in the &quot;Rituximab non-responders&quot;&#xD;
           sub group (see 4.1 for definition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the response rate in the 2 treatment arms in the &quot; Rituximab relapsers&quot;&#xD;
           subgroup&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the mean duration of response (PR or CR) in the 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the duration of very low to absent peripheral blood B cells in the two&#xD;
           treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG and/or IgM level &lt; ½ of lower&#xD;
           limit of normal for age) and white blood counts in the two arms.&#xD;
