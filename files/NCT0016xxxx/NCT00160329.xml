      The study is looking to compare the impact of lipid levels and HIV viral loads between three&#xD;
      different drug regimens: Continuing current regimen (ritonavir boosted regimen), Switching to&#xD;
      Atazanavir, or Switching to Atazanavir in combination to Ritonavir.&#xD;

      Study Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled pilot study to compare the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      substitution of atazanavir (ATV) or ATV/RTV for ritonavir boosted PI in patients with ongoing&#xD;
      viremia who are experiencing hyperlipidemia and/or requiring treatment with lipid lowering&#xD;
      agents. In this study 60 subjects on a ritonavir boosted PI-containing antiretroviral regimen&#xD;
      who are experiencing hyperlipidemia and ongoing HIV viremia will be randomized in a 1:1:1&#xD;
      ratio to either switch the ritonavir boosted PI component of the antiretroviral regimen to&#xD;
      ATV or ATV/RTV, or continue the ritonavir boosted PI-based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other changes in the antiretroviral regimen will be allowed for the first 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Thereafter, the investigator may change background ARVs based on the results of the screening&#xD;
      resistance test. No new class of antiretrovirals will be allowed to be added through 48&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects will be monitored closely over 48 weeks with careful assessment of CD4&#xD;
      profile, viral loads and lipid profiles as well as drug resistance and replication capacity.&#xD;
      Stopping rules will be implemented based on CD4 and viral load profile to ensure subject&#xD;
      safety. The objective of this study is to determine whether protease inhibitor regimens that&#xD;
      have less of an adverse impact on lipid profiles can maintain a stable CD4 profile compared&#xD;
      to standard ritonavir boosted PI regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiretroviral regimens that include ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors are commonly&#xD;
      recommended and prescribed, particularly in patients with some degree of drug resistance.&#xD;
      Despite the potency of boosted regimens, many HIV-infected patients receiving these regimens&#xD;
      have incomplete viral suppression and yet maintain clinical stability and CD4 counts above&#xD;
      nadir levels: the so called 'CD4/HIV disconnect' state. It is likely that this state of&#xD;
      CD4/HIV discordance is due in part to the maintenance of drug resistant HIV virus that is&#xD;
      relatively unfit, that is its replication capacity and ability to infect and destroy CD4&#xD;
      cells is compromised. The selective pressure exerted by antiretroviral therapy appears to be&#xD;
      important in maintaining these drug resistant but relatively unfit quasispecies. It has been&#xD;
      shown that even patients with CD4 counts below 50 cells/cc and ongoing viremia maintain a&#xD;
      clinical benefit from continued therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, lipid abnormalities are commonly seen in patients receiving boosted PI&#xD;
      regimens. For example, in a clinical trial in which lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) was given to&#xD;
      treatment na√Øve subjects, approximately 1/3 developed grade 2 or higher lipid abnormalities&#xD;
      over 48 weeks. There is a growing concern that these lipid abnormalities will increase the&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In fact, recent data suggest an increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality related to HIV infection and/or antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy. There are increasing efforts directed at minimizing long-term toxicities of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy while maintaining its clinical benefit. (Witness the high degree of&#xD;
      interest in treatment interruptions as a strategy to limit toxicities associated with&#xD;
      long-term antiretroviral therapy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atazanavir (ATV), a recently approved PI, appears to have little to no impact on the lipid&#xD;
      profile in subjects enrolled in clinical trials. Other advantages with atazanavir are its&#xD;
      dosing schedule and overall tolerability. Furthermore, recent studies using ritonavir-boosted&#xD;
      ATV also show favorable lipid effects compared to LPV/r. Ritonavir boosting provides higher&#xD;
      drug levels and therefore may improve the potency of ATV, especially against PI-resistant&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;
