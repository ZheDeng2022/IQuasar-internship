      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Immune&#xD;
      Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% TVR (Triple Virally Reduced) Solution in subjects with&#xD;
      primary immunodeficiency (PID) manifesting as hypo- or agammaglobulinemia. Subjects are&#xD;
      treated every 21 days and receive a total of 12 infusions: for the first 3 infusions subjects&#xD;
      receive GAMMAGARD S/D to ensure a steady-state and to acquire data with a licensed product;&#xD;
      for the remaining 9 infusions subjects receive IGIV, 10% TVR Solution.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be eligible for study entry if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a form of primary immunodeficiency (PID) as described by Rosen et al, 1999 16&#xD;
             manifesting as agammaglobulinemia (X-linked) or hypogamma-globulinemia (common&#xD;
             variable immunodeficiency), requiring immunoglobulin replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have had regular treatment for at least three months with either intravenous&#xD;
             immunoglobulin preparations or immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular use given&#xD;
             subcutaneously&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have serum IgG levels greater than or equal to 5 g/L as determined by the local&#xD;
             laboratory at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if female of childbearing potential, agree to employ adequate birth control measures&#xD;
             during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have given written informed consent&#xD;

             last three treatments before inclusion into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  suffer from documented selective IgA deficiency with antibodies against IgA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have an acute infection that requires intravenous antibiotic treatment (Last treatment&#xD;
             day should be seven days before study entry.)&#xD;

          -  are at high risk of contracting blood-borne viral infections through parenteral drug&#xD;
             abuse or life style&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  suffer from congestive heart failure and receive on-demand treatment with furosemide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  show renal dysfunction defined as serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  in case of females, are pregnant or nursing mothers&#xD;
