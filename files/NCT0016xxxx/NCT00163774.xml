      Analysis of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygenation using complementary focal and global&#xD;
      monitoring techniques will permit the delivery of more informed individualised and 'targeted'&#xD;
      therapy on the patient with severe head injury, reduce episodes of secondary brain injury and&#xD;
      therefore improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a deeper understanding of Cerebral Blood Flow and auto-regulation for TBI&#xD;
           patients based on the results of data collected in patients post TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the basis for further multi modality clinical trials in severely brain&#xD;
           injured patients in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve understanding of the various secondary processes that continue to cause&#xD;
           neuronal damage after the initial injury, and therefore affect patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To proceed to the second phase of the study, with the introduction of algorithms for&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;

      The ultimate aim of this study is to improve the outcome of patients with severe head injury&#xD;
      by reducing secondary brain injury. It is hoped that this will be achieved by improving&#xD;
      clinical management through the adoption of Best Practice monitoring measures. The severe&#xD;
      head injury population is a disparate clinical group with varying CBF derangements, and&#xD;
      complex inter-relationships between the various physiological parameters which are being&#xD;
      measured. Common protocol based therapy for all head-injured patients is simplistic and&#xD;
      cannot fully accommodate the variations between patients or within an individual brain. We&#xD;
      believe that to improve outcome, these individual derangements and patterns have to be&#xD;
      identified and the correct therapeutic combinations fashioned on an individual basis. This is&#xD;
      not the current practice in Australia. The first phase of this project was completed in March&#xD;
      2004 following the recruitment of ten patients. These patients were intensively monitored and&#xD;
      based on the data collected and current international literature we devised a new treatment&#xD;
      protocol for patients with severe head injuries. We anticipate that implementation of this&#xD;
      new protocol will improve outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  further clarify what the above mentioned relationships between monitoring parameters&#xD;
           are, what are the most critical ones and the effect that optimisation of these&#xD;
           parameters has on brain swelling, ICP control and on clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  introduce treatment algorithms/protocols to alter the haemodynamic parameters, CPP and&#xD;
           ICP and to optimise PbrO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study the patients having decompressive craniectomy using these techniques where&#xD;
           possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare patient outcomes to previous outcome studies at the Alfred Hospital.&#xD;
