  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspergillus is a fungus found in soil, on farms and on construction sites. In those whose&#xD;
      immune system is impaired it causes severe infection. The people who are particularly at&#xD;
      high-risk of infection with Aspergillus (which is called Invasive Aspergillosis)are those&#xD;
      with acute leukaemia who are having chemotherapy and those post bone marrow transplantation.&#xD;
      Currently 15% of those at high-risk develop Invasive Aspergillosis and 60-90% of those with&#xD;
      Invasive Aspergillosis die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main reason for this high death rate is that our current diagnostic tests are not good at&#xD;
      detecting infection or often only detect the infection at advanced stages when treatment is&#xD;
      ineffective. Because of the limitations of current diagnostic tests the current practice is&#xD;
      to give empiric antifungal therapy (EAFT) early to treat suspected Invasive Aspergillosis.&#xD;
      However studies have demonstrated that this therapy has only resulted in a minor reduction in&#xD;
      the mortality rates and it also causes significant drug toxicity. It is a suboptimal&#xD;
      treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New tests have recently been developed to diagnose Invasive Aspergillosis. These tests are&#xD;
      for the detection of an Aspergillus protein in blood and for the detection of Aspergillus DNA&#xD;
      in blood. Available data suggests that these new tests make an early diagnosis and seem to be&#xD;
      able to monitor responses to treatment. However no study has been reported to date which&#xD;
      demonstrates that the use of these tests can impact on important patient outcomes. This trial&#xD;
      is being performed to determine whether the use of the new diagnostic tests to guide&#xD;
      antifungal therapy will help improve treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis, reduce drug&#xD;
      toxicity and reduce the death rate in the high-risk patients as compared with the current&#xD;
      standard method of diagnosis and treatment with EAFT.&#xD;

    <description>The standard-diagnostic strategy was designed to be consistent with the 2002 guidelines for antimicrobial use in neutropenic patients with cancer. When an invasive fungal infection was suspected (e.g. persistent fevers) cultures of blood, urine, sputum (if available) and faeces (if clinically indicated), and HRCT scans of chest were performed. Bronchoscopy and biopsies were performed according to institutional protocols. Empiric antifungal therapy was recommended whilst undergoing these investigations and was continued, de-escalated to prophylaxis, or changed to treatment of invasive aspergillosis or other IFD according to test results.</description>
