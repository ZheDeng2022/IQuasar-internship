  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out how accurate the Navigator continuous glucose monitor is&#xD;
      in children. It is also being done to see if use of the Navigator can improve blood sugar&#xD;
      control and help prevent low blood sugar events. This study has three basic parts: Use of the&#xD;
      Navigator at home for one week without being able to see the blood sugar readings; a Baseline&#xD;
      visit or a 24-hour admission to a research unit of the hospital to find out how well the&#xD;
      Navigator measures the blood sugar; and then 3 months use of the Navigator at home as an aid&#xD;
      to diabetes care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 children will be recruited from five centers in the United States to&#xD;
      participate in this study. The information gained from this study will be used to plan a&#xD;
      larger study in which half of the patients will use the Navigator and half will not. Children&#xD;
      who participate in this study will not be eligible to take part in the larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Navigator provides a glucose reading every 60 seconds (or 1440 readings a day). Each&#xD;
      sensor is designed to provide readings for up to 120 hours. It has alarms for hypoglycemia&#xD;
      and hyperglycemia and for projected high and low glucose values. The alarm set points can be&#xD;
      adjusted by the user. The Navigator also has a trend arrow indicating the glucose rate of&#xD;
      change (&gt;-2 mg/dL/min, -2 to -1 mg/dL/min, -1 to 1 mg/dL/min, 1 to 2 mg/dl/min, and &gt;2&#xD;
      mg/dl/min). Subjects can enter events, such as when they took insulin, ate, or exercised. The&#xD;
      sensor requires calibration values to be entered 3 times during the first day of wear at&#xD;
      1-hour, 3-hours, and 24-hours and does not require additional calibration values. The values&#xD;
      are entered directly into the Navigator which has a TheraSense Freestyle home glucose meter&#xD;
      built into the unit. The Navigator has not yet been approved by the FDA. The Navigator&#xD;
      currently under review by the FDA will limit sensor wear to 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a child enters the study, the following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaires will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parents and children (if at least 9 years old) will be asked to fill out&#xD;
                questionnaires on a computer in the clinic. The questions will be about the child's&#xD;
                diabetes, how the diabetes is being treated, and how the diabetes affects the&#xD;
                parent and child.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Children who are using insulin pump therapy and are at least 9 years old and&#xD;
                parents will be interviewed about the child's diabetes management habits at home.&#xD;
                The interview will be conducted by phone by trained interviewers who are at Nemours&#xD;
                Children's Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, one of the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood will be drawn to measure glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parents and children will be instructed on using the Navigator. The first sensor will be&#xD;
           inserted by the parent or child with guidance from the study nurse. During the first&#xD;
           week, the parent and child will not be able to see the results from the Navigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Children will be asked to do the following before returning for the Baseline Visit or&#xD;
           the hospital stay about 1 week later:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Check the blood sugar using the Freestyle meter built into the Navigator at least 4&#xD;
                times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Wear the Navigator sensor everyday and change the sensor at the end of day 5&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  On the day a new sensor is started, do 3 fingerstick blood sugar readings using the&#xD;
                built-in Freestyle meter to calibrate the Navigator&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Enter a meal marker event into the Navigator each time your child has a meal or&#xD;
                snack&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Insert a new sensor 1, 2, 3, or 4 days before your child will stay in the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bring any used sensors, including the packaging and inserting device to the&#xD;
                Baseline Visit or hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit Children who are using Lantus with MDI therapy will return for a Baseline&#xD;
      Visit approximately one week (7-12 days) after the enrollment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital Stay Those children who are using insulin pump therapy will return for a hospital&#xD;
      stay approximately one week (7-12 days) after the enrollment visit and will use the Navigator&#xD;
      for about 24 hours. The last sensor that was placed at home will continue to be worn during&#xD;
      the hospital stay. A new sensor will also be placed so that your child has 2 sensors inserted&#xD;
      during the hospital stay to see how closely the 2 sensors agree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CGMS sensor will be inserted and calibrated one hour later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small tube called a catheter will be placed in a vein in the child's arm and will stay in&#xD;
      the vein while the child is in the hospital. From this tube, a very small blood sample will&#xD;
      be drawn every 30 minutes during the hospital stay. After breakfast, blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken about every 10 minutes for about an hour. For children who are at least 7 years old,&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken about every 20 minutes during a period of exercise in the&#xD;
      afternoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures at Home after the Baseline Visit or Hospital Stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use the Navigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Navigator should be worn all of the time for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The sensor must be replaced every 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  With each sensor wear 4 blood sugar readings must be done using the built-in&#xD;
                Freestyle meter to calibrate the Navigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Enter a meal marker event into the Navigator each time a meal or snack is eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Children may be asked to insert a new sensor 5 days before some of the study visits&#xD;
                to allow the study personnel to look at the skin after the sensor has been worn for&#xD;
                5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Download the Navigator - Once a week, children will need to download the glucose results&#xD;
           from the Navigator, which will then be emailed to the study coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use Algorithms for Diabetes Management Decisions - The study doctor or nurse will give&#xD;
           the parents and children instructions (Algorithms) for how to make changes to diabetes&#xD;
           management from the results of the Navigator. The instructions will be used by the&#xD;
           parents and children to make decisions as they receive the results from the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Phone Interviews - After 3 days and 2, 4, 8, and 10 weeks after the children leave the&#xD;
           hospital, one of the staff will call to see how they is doing with the Navigator and the&#xD;
           instructions for diabetes management decisions. We will ask what the child ate in the&#xD;
           last meal before the call. We also will ask if the child has been sick or under any&#xD;
           stress. For females who have started menstruating, we will ask about her menstrual&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will return to the diabetes clinics for visits 1, 3, 7, and 13 weeks after the&#xD;
      hospital stay. At these visits, the following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any used sensors, including the packaging and inserting device will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The skin will be looked at where the Navigator has been worn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Navigator and the child's insulin pump will be downloaded and reviewed with the&#xD;
           parent and child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The diabetes management instructions will be reviewed with the parent and child to&#xD;
           determine if the instructions have been helpful or if they need to be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 3, 7, and 13- week visits, parents and children (if at least 9 years old) will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a questionnaire about how much you liked or disliked the instructions that&#xD;
      were given for using the results of the Navigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 7-week visit, the following will also be done in addition to the child's regular&#xD;
      clinic visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Blood will be drawn to measure the HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 13-week visit, the following will also be done in addition to the child's regular&#xD;
      clinic visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood will be drawn to measure the HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaires will be completed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parents and children (if at least 9 years old) will be asked to complete the same&#xD;
                questionnaires and the phone interview that were done during the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parents and children will be asked to complete one more questionnaire about how&#xD;
                much they like using the Navigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the children are willing to continue using the Navigator, they will be given&#xD;
           additional sensors to use as often as they would like and they will return for another&#xD;
           regular clinic visit in about 3 months (26-week visit). At that visit, the skin will be&#xD;
           looked at where the Navigator was used, the HbA1c will be measured, and the parents and&#xD;
           children will be asked to complete the same questionnaires that were completed at the&#xD;
           13-week visit about how much they liked using the Navigator and the instructions that&#xD;
           were given for using the results of the Navigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who decide to continue using the Navigator will be seen again at 26-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the 26-week visit, subjects will be given the choice to continue in the study until&#xD;
           the device is approved by the FDA or until Abbott Diabetes Care can no longer provide&#xD;
           supplies for the study. Subjects who agree to continue in the study will sign an&#xD;
           addendum to the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who continue in the study will return to the clinic every 3 months for a&#xD;
           follow-up visit. The same procedures completed during the 26-week visit will be&#xD;
           completed at each subsequent visit.&#xD;
