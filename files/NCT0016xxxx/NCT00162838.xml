  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis develops due to subgingival infection with specific microbial pathogen from&#xD;
      dental plaque. The bacteria can activate immunoinflammatory mechanisms within the local&#xD;
      periodontal tissues that lead to destruction of collagen and alveolar bone. Human gingiva&#xD;
      contains Langerhans and connective tissue dendritic cells. Signals from periodontal pathogen&#xD;
      can induce dendritic cells to maturation,rapidly increasing surface expression of MHC class&#xD;
      II, costimulatory molecules, and secrete proinflammatory cytokines to regulate adaptive T&#xD;
      cell immune response. Studies on cytokines have led to controversy about different T cell&#xD;
      subsets associated with the progression of periodontitis. Seymour proposed that&#xD;
      susceptibility to periodontal disease progression involve a predominantly Th2 response while&#xD;
      Ebersole speculated that Th2 cells providing protective function. It is possible that a given&#xD;
      pathogen may produce different maturation signals by activating DCs induce a given type of&#xD;
      immune response. In this study, we observed the profiles and amounts of cytokine production&#xD;
      of DCs stimulated with P. gingivalis and T. forsythensis compared with E. coli, to see&#xD;
      whether the periodontal pathogens may induce different response of dendritic cells in the&#xD;
      innate immunity.&#xD;

      Periodontitis develops due to subgingival infection with specific microbial pathogen from&#xD;
      dental plaque. The bacteria can activate immunoinflammatory mechanisms within the local&#xD;
      periodontal tissues that lead to destruction of collagen and alveolar bone. Bacterial&#xD;
      antigens can release from the supra and subgingival dental plaque on the tooth surface as&#xD;
      well as from bacteria attached to mucosal surfaces. The sulcular epithelium served as a&#xD;
      physical barrier to the insult of the bacteria, the presence of Langerhans cells is also&#xD;
      responsible for communication with the immune system. Dendritic cells (DCs), the most&#xD;
      effective antigen-presenting cells, contact and process the antigens. Signals from pathogen&#xD;
      induce dendritic cells to maturation. Mature DCs rapidly increase surface expression and&#xD;
      stability of MHC class I and class II-peptide complexes, upregulate the surface expression of&#xD;
      adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86) and secrete&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12…….. then they migrate to lymphoid organs,&#xD;
      where they regulate T cell immune response. Human gingiva contains Langerhans and connective&#xD;
      tissue dendritic cells. Immature dendritic cells appeared to be limited to the epithelium,&#xD;
      whereas mature dendritic cells were restricted to the connective tissue. Studies on cytokines&#xD;
      have led to controversy about the the different T cell subsets associated with the&#xD;
      progression of periodontitis. Seymour proposed that susceptibility to periodontal disease&#xD;
      progression involve a predominantly Th2 response while Ebersole speculated that Th2 cells&#xD;
      providing protective function. Progression of periodontitis is also associated with the&#xD;
      presence of gram-negative anaerobic microorganism such as Porphyromonas gingivalis,&#xD;
      Bacteroides forsythus. Different bacteria and their LPS can elicit strikingly different&#xD;
      response. It is possible that a given pathogen may produce different maturation signals by&#xD;
      selectively activating a particular DC subset to induce a given type of immune response. In&#xD;
      this study, we observed the profiles and amounts of cytokine production of DCs stimulated&#xD;
      with P. gingivalis and T. forsythensis compared with E. coli, to see whether the periodontal&#xD;
      pathogens may induce different response of dendritic cells in the innate immunity.&#xD;
