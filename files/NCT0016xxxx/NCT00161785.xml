      The purpose of this study is to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TBE antibody persistence 2 and 3 years after the third TBE vaccination with FSME-IMMUN&#xD;
           0.5ml by means of ELISA and neutralization test (NT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TBE antibody response to a booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml, by means of ELISA&#xD;
           and NT.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male and female subjects will be eligible for participation in this study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they understand the nature of the study, agree to its provisions and provide written&#xD;
             informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they received the third vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml during the course of Baxter&#xD;
             Study 213;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  blood was drawn before and after their third vaccination during the course of Baxter&#xD;
             Study 213;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they showed an ELISA-concentration &gt; 126 VIE U/ml and / or a NT-titer &gt;= 1:10 after&#xD;
             the third vaccination in Baxter Study 213;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they agree to keep a Subject Diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  received any TBE vaccination since their third vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  received a vaccination against yellow fever and / or Japanese B-encephalitis since&#xD;
             their third vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are known to be HIV positive (a special HIV test is not required for the purpose of&#xD;
             the study) since their third vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a known or suspected problem with drug or alcohol abuse (&gt; 4 liters wine / week&#xD;
             or equivalent level of other alcoholic beverages);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within one month to the first and&#xD;
             second blood draw;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have participated in another Baxter vaccine study within the last six months (with the&#xD;
             exception of follow-up studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will not be eligible for booster vaccination if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they are not clinically healthy, (i.e. the physician would have reservations&#xD;
             vaccinating with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml outside the scope of a clinical trial);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of&#xD;
             treatment (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) that can be expected to influence&#xD;
             immunological functions;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they have donated blood or plasma within one month to the booster vaccination;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  female of childbearing potential are pregnant or breastfeeding before the booster&#xD;
             vaccination (positive pregnancy test result at the medical examination before the&#xD;
             booster vaccination);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they have shown an allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine since&#xD;
             their third vaccination in Baxter Study 213;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they are simultaneously participating in another clinical trial including&#xD;
             administration of an investigational product within six weeks prior to the booster&#xD;
             vaccination until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, but have a febrile illness (body&#xD;
        temperature &gt;= 38.0Â°C, measured orally) at the scheduled time of vaccination, will not be&#xD;
        vaccinated until their body temperature returns to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have received any vaccination within two weeks prior to the booster&#xD;
        vaccination will not be vaccinated until an interval of two weeks has passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If subjects have received antipyretics within 4 hours prior to the intended TBE&#xD;
        vaccination, the vaccination should be performed at a later time.&#xD;
