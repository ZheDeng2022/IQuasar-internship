      General anesthesia allows people to have surgery without experiencing the procedure or pain.&#xD;
      To remain unconscious, the depth of sleep must be monitored. Various monitors have been&#xD;
      developed, one of which is BIS (short for bispectral index). BIS monitors the level of sleep&#xD;
      during anesthesia and improves patient recovery because the amount of sleep drugs can be&#xD;
      fine-tuned to the individual. Patients who need a lot to stay asleep get more, and those who&#xD;
      need less get less. As a result, patients tend to wake up faster with BIS monitoring as&#xD;
      compared to standard practice not using BIS. Little is known about the long-term effects of&#xD;
      BIS monitoring. This study investigates whether BIS monitoring during anesthesia improves&#xD;
      long-term outcome, well after surgery is over. The hypothesis is that it does. Two groups of&#xD;
      patients are compared: one in which BIS monitoring was used, and one in which it was not.&#xD;
      Groups are compared on tests of memory, concentration and mental well-being, to see if one&#xD;
      does and feels better than the other. The investigators also take blood samples to see how&#xD;
      well patients' bodies deal with the surgery. The investigators expect the BIS monitoring&#xD;
      group to do better.&#xD;

      Monitoring the effect of sedative drugs, used to anesthetize people during surgery, is&#xD;
      complex. Technological advances that focus on brain activity (electroencephalogram, EEG)&#xD;
      recently yielded promising parameters, such as the bispectral index (BIS). BIS is a scale&#xD;
      from 100 (awake) to 0 (complete cortical EEG suppression), and values between 45 and 60 are&#xD;
      recommended for surgical anesthesia. Compared to standard practice, the use of BIS speeds&#xD;
      emergence and early recovery from anesthesia while reducing anesthetic drug use. Little is&#xD;
      known about the long-term effects of BIS monitoring but it is not unlikely that early&#xD;
      improvements in clinical outcome persist over time. Studies have associated first-year&#xD;
      postoperative mortality to prolonged periods of too deep surgical anesthesia, as defined by&#xD;
      BIS levels below 45. BIS monitoring could thus serve an important function in enhancing&#xD;
      patient management and care. Prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials of BIS&#xD;
      monitoring and its long-term effects are lacking, however.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to assess whether monitoring of sedation level during&#xD;
      general anesthesia, using BIS, enhances long-term recovery. Two outcome domains are of&#xD;
      interest: Cognitive function (attention, vigilance, and memory) and immune system responses&#xD;
      (inflammation). The former is measured using a computerized test battery while blood samples&#xD;
      (cytokines and TNF-a levels) address the latter. Patients are randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      monitoring groups. While BIS is recorded in both, the values are not available to guide drug&#xD;
      dosing in the standard practice group (i.e., blinded). In this group, parameters such as&#xD;
      changes in respiration, heart beat, and blood pressure guide the amount of drugs being&#xD;
      administered. In the other group, BIS readings are available and used to titrate drugs to&#xD;
      values between 50 and 60 (target 55). The anesthetic protocol is similar for both. Recovery&#xD;
      is assessed repeatedly in all patients at various intervals after surgery (6 hrs, 1st and 2nd&#xD;
      day, and 1 month follow-up). In this way, we intend to capture outcome-variation over time.&#xD;
