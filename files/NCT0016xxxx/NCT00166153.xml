  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival of children who have received heart transplants has greatly improved over the&#xD;
      last ten years. One reason for this is better control over rejection. Rejection medications&#xD;
      require a delicate balance of enough medicine to work without causing side effects. It is a&#xD;
      goal to avoid both rejection and side effects from the anti-rejection medicines. Usually&#xD;
      several medicines are used together to prevent rejection. One of these medicines is often&#xD;
      Mycophenolic Acid or CellceptThis medicine has been used longer for adults than is has for&#xD;
      children. More information is needed on using it for children. The dose is usually determined&#xD;
      by the patient's weight or body surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been some early studies of the use of Cellcept, but none have proven a&#xD;
      relationship between the blood level of the drug and how well it works. More also needs to be&#xD;
      known about how this drug works with other anti-rejection drugs and how it works in boys and&#xD;
      girls. This study will look more closely at proper dosing, how Cellcept works with other&#xD;
      anti-rejection medications, side effects, and any differences in how this medicine works in&#xD;
      boys and girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the study will be receiving Cellcept and have blood levels of the drug drawn.&#xD;
      Results of their usual treatment and testing will be recorded and evaluated for signs of&#xD;
      rejection. All the information will be analyzed. Results of this study will be reported to&#xD;
      transplant committees locally and nationally.&#xD;

      Pediatric heart transplant recipients receiving MMF will undergo study testing to measure MPA&#xD;
      levels by the HPLC method and T-cell subsets by flow cytometry method. As standard of care&#xD;
      they receive histological grading of routine endomyocardial biopsies using the International&#xD;
      Society of Heart Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading scale. The data obtained from standard&#xD;
      assessments will include medications, echocardiographic reports, pre-and post biopsy&#xD;
      assessments/physical exams, hospital records for any inpatient hospitalization, and any&#xD;
      laboratory assessments. Also, information will be collected on all patients which will be&#xD;
      examined for tolerance and success (side effects and rejection) of immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In newly transplanted patients, study testing will occur at the same time as standard of care&#xD;
      biopsies which are typically 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, 4&#xD;
      months, 5 months, 6 months, 8 months, 10 months, 12 months. If the patient has additional&#xD;
      visits due to rejection or changes in immunosuppression, then more frequent study testing may&#xD;
      be done per investigator preference. Previously transplanted patients will have study testing&#xD;
      at the same time as their standard of care visits, usually annually.&#xD;
