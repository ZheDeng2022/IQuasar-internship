  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a liver transplant, the hepatitis C virus (which destroyed one's own liver) eventually&#xD;
      comes back. In many patients, this will eventually cause the loss of the new liver and can&#xD;
      also confuse the doctors taking care of them because it is hard to tell the difference&#xD;
      between one's body rejecting the new liver and hepatitis. This can cause serious treatment&#xD;
      errors that can lead to more severe hepatitis or to rejection of the liver. Some of the drugs&#xD;
      used to prevent rejection of one's new liver can cause the hepatitis to come back in a more&#xD;
      severe form. This is especially true for the drugs known as corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right now, the only effective treatment against hepatitis C is a combination of two drugs&#xD;
      called interferon and ribavirin. These drugs act by strengthening one's immune system to&#xD;
      fight the virus and by directly reducing the reproduction of the virus. Because the treatment&#xD;
      with these drugs is associated with many side effects, there is little experience with&#xD;
      treating patients after liver transplantation with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators' transplant program, they have decided to treat all patients with&#xD;
      hepatitis C as early as possible after transplantation and to follow them closely for the&#xD;
      development of hepatitis and side effects of the treatment. The investigators treat one's&#xD;
      hepatitis as early as possible, before any actual damage has occurred in the new liver. This&#xD;
      approach has been tried before but it has been hard to tell if it has worked or not. The main&#xD;
      reason for failure was that many patients could not complete the treatment due to side&#xD;
      effects. The investigators' purpose is to treat those side effects aggressively so that most&#xD;
      patients can complete the treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to collect all the data regarding the investigators' treatment&#xD;
      protocol so that they will be able to learn if this form of treatment is beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes performing liver biopsies at scheduled times after one's liver transplant&#xD;
      and for scheduled blood tests to see how much virus is still in the blood. If patients show&#xD;
      signs that they are not responding to treatment they will be removed from the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HCV recurs in the transplanted liver almost invariably. The clinical course is variable and&#xD;
      ranges from no hepatitis to severe aggressive hepatitis with cirrhosis. Factors that affect&#xD;
      outcome are high viral load prior to OLT, genotype, and immunosuppressive regimen. Recent&#xD;
      studies indicate that the severity of recurrence is increasing with longer follow up, and&#xD;
      longevity of both graft and patient is compromised by HCV. Viral load appears to be&#xD;
      particularly affected by corticosteroids. The impact of mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus&#xD;
      is not certain. The results of re-transplantation are generally poor and seem to be a&#xD;
      non-cost beneficial way to deal with recurrence HCV cirrhosis. Additionally,&#xD;
      re-transplantation deprives other patients from getting OLT in a timely fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that with intensive alpha interferon and ribavirin treatment, up to&#xD;
      40% of patients can be cleared of virus as measured by PCR. Thus, despite the cost and side&#xD;
      effects of this treatment, it appears justified to treat recurrence preemptively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the deleterious effects of high dose Corticosteroids it seems logical to attempt to&#xD;
      withdraw them as soon as possible from treatment. MMF is often incompatible with interferon&#xD;
      and ribavirin treatment due to leukopenia and anemia. The same is true for sirolimus. Thus,&#xD;
      most patients will eventually be treated with Tacrolimus monotherapy. Presently, numerous&#xD;
      patients end up being treated with Tacrolimus monotherapy as part of the reduction in immune&#xD;
      suppression, which occurs over time. There is, however, very little prospective data&#xD;
      regarding Tacrolimus monotherapy and almost no data on the specific issue of monotherapy in&#xD;
      HCV patients. Even less is known with respect to this type of treatment while using&#xD;
      interferon and ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our purpose in this protocol is to examine both the effect of preemptive antiviral treatment&#xD;
      on recurrent HCV and the effect of Tacrolimus monotherapy in this setting. This may be&#xD;
      important as more and more programs are turning to preemptive anti viral treatment and the&#xD;
      issue of appropriate immune suppression becomes seminal to this discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the safety and efficacy of PEG interferon and ribavirin in the treatment of&#xD;
           HCV recurrence after OLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effectiveness and safety of maintenance dose of PEG interferon to delay&#xD;
           progression of fibrosis and histologic damage, in non-responders to the initial regimen&#xD;
           of PEG interferon and ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the effect of early prednisone withdrawal in the rate of response to&#xD;
           treatment with PEG interferon and ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the feasibility of Tacrolimus monotherapy in patients undergoing treatment for&#xD;
           HCV recurrence post transplant.&#xD;
