      Title: A Multi-Centre, Single-Blind, Parallel Group, Clinical Evaluation of the Efficacy and&#xD;
      Safety of Duac® Gel (a Gel Containing Clindamycin Phosphate [Equivalent to 1% Clindamycin]&#xD;
      and 5% Benzoyl Peroxide) And Differin® Gel (a Gel Containing 0.1% Adapalene) in the Topical&#xD;
      Treatment of Mild to Moderate Acne Vulgaris&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of a gel formulation containing a combination&#xD;
      of clindamycin phosphate (equivalent to 1% clindamycin) and benzoyl peroxide (5%) once daily&#xD;
      with a gel containing 0.1% adapalene once daily in the treatment of acne vulgaris of mild to&#xD;
      moderate severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methodology: Randomised, comparator-controlled, single-blind trial. The Investigators/&#xD;
      Assessors will be blinded to the treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Male and female patients, aged 12-39, with mild to moderate acne vulgaris.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris of the face with at least 15 inflammatory&#xD;
             lesions and/or non-inflammatory lesions, but no more than three nodulocystic lesions&#xD;
             and an acne grade of greater than 2.0 and less than 7.0 (The Leeds Revised Acne&#xD;
             Grading System7).&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Patients who have participated in a clinical trial involving a drug within 30 days of&#xD;
             recruitment into the study (or are likely to do so at any time during their&#xD;
             participation).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients who are either an immediate family member, or a colleague, of study&#xD;
             personnel.&#xD;
