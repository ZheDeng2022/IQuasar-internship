      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine wether adjunctive atomoxetine is more effective thank placebo for&#xD;
           neuropsychological measures of reaction time, motor speed, psychomotor speed, sustained&#xD;
           attention, learning and memory, working memory, and executive functioning. To determine&#xD;
           the effect size of atomoxetine on these neuropsychological measures for follow-up&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if atomoxetine has short-term benefits for improving weight gain and other&#xD;
           metabolic abnormalities associated with antipsychotics.&#xD;

      Participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are competent to participate&#xD;
      in the informed consent process and provide written informed consent will be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study. Participants will undergo a psychiatric evaluation, which will include the&#xD;
      ascertainment of demographic information, past psychiatric and treatment history, and&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; First et al, 1997) diagnostic interviews. A&#xD;
      best estimate diagnostic approach will be utilized in which information from the SCID is&#xD;
      supplemented by information from family informants, previous psychiatrists, and medical&#xD;
      records to generate a diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments: The symptom assessments will include the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale&#xD;
      (BPRS; Overall and Gorham, 1961); Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS;&#xD;
      Andreasen, 1982); and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI; Guy, 1976). i) BPRS: the four&#xD;
      positive symptom items - conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior,&#xD;
      and unusual thought content - will be used to measure positive psychotic symptoms. These four&#xD;
      items have been have been used to assess positive symptoms in previous studies (Kane et al,&#xD;
      1988; Buchanan et al, 1998). The BPRS Anxiety/Depression Factor, consisting of the somatic&#xD;
      concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, and depression items, will be used to assess dysphoria&#xD;
      (Guy, 1976). The BPRS hostility and uncooperativeness items will be used to assess hostility.&#xD;
      We are not including the suspiciousness item, which is traditionally part of the BPRS&#xD;
      Hostility Factor (Guy, 1976), because we have included this item with the other positive&#xD;
      symptom items. ii) SANS: the SANS total score, minus the global items, inappropriate affect,&#xD;
      poverty of content of speech, and attention items, will be used to measure negative symptoms.&#xD;
      The inappropriate affect, poverty of content of speech, and attention items are excluded as&#xD;
      lacking construct validity and because factor analytic study results suggest that these items&#xD;
      are not closely related to negative symptoms (Buchanan and Carpenter, 1994). iii) CGI: the&#xD;
      CGI severity of illness item will be used to assess global changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments: The safety assessments will include the Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal&#xD;
      Symptom Rating Scale (SAS; Simpson and Angus, 1970); Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale&#xD;
      (AIMS) (Guy, 1976); Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS; Barnes, 1989) and Side Effect Checklist&#xD;
      (SEC). i) SAS: a modified 11-item version of the SAS will be used to assess EPS. ii) AIMS: is&#xD;
      a 12-item scale, with 7 items designed to assess abnormal facial, oral, extremity, and trunk&#xD;
      movements; 3 global judgement items; and 2 current dental status items. iii) BAS : is a 4&#xD;
      item scale assessing objective and subjective symptoms of akathisia. iv) SEC: is designed to&#xD;
      assess vital signs and commonly occurring antipsychotic side effects. v) Changes in total&#xD;
      body weight, body mass index, lipid profile, and serum glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive Assessments: The following neuropsychological tests will be administered: (1)&#xD;
      reaction time, processing speed and efficiency, working memory-Digit Symbol, Number&#xD;
      Sequencing, Letter Number Sequencing, Mental Arithmetic, Grooved Pegboard, Simple Reaction&#xD;
      Time, Complex Reaction Time, Delayed Match to Sample from the Automated Neuropsychological&#xD;
      Assessment Metric; (2) sustained attention and resistance to distractibility-Gordon's&#xD;
      Continuous Performance Test; (3) learning and memory-California Verbal Learning Test and&#xD;
      Brief Visual Memory Test; (4) executive functioning- Planning Test and Phonemic Fluency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-Week Stabilization Phase: In the 2-week stabilization phase, participants will undergo&#xD;
      baseline symptom, medical, safety, and neurocognitive assessments. The participants will&#xD;
      undergo a physical examination; an EKG; and laboratory tests of major organ functions (i.e.,&#xD;
      CBC, liver function tests, electrolytes, glucose, BUN/Creatinine, Urinanalysis (UA), and&#xD;
      thyroid functions). A baseline antipsychotic level will be collected. All women will have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8-Week Double-Blind Treatment Phase: Participants will be randomly assigned to atomoxetine or&#xD;
      placebo using a permuted block randomization system. Treatment assignment order is random&#xD;
      within each block, and the total number of participants assigned to each treatment are equal.&#xD;
      The block sizes will vary in random sequence between 2 and 4. Thus, it will be difficult to&#xD;
      ascertain the next treatment assignment, even if a participant becomes unblinded, while the&#xD;
      imbalance of numbers between the treatment groups is kept within tight limits. The central&#xD;
      unblinded pharmacist will be notified of the treatment assignment, and will inform unblinded&#xD;
      pharmacists at the other sites about which study medication to dispense. Separate emergency&#xD;
      unblinding envelopes for each participant will be kept in a locked cabinet at each dispensing&#xD;
      pharmacy. In addition, an emergency unblinding tool will allow specific, designated staff&#xD;
      (i.e., the P.I. and Co-P.I.) to log onto the randomization data base through the MPRC&#xD;
      computer network and request treatment assignment for a specific participant. An electronic&#xD;
      audit trail will be kept of all such unblinding requests. All unused unblinding envelopes&#xD;
      must be returned unopened to the central pharmacy at the end of the study. Participants will&#xD;
      receive biweekly BPRS, SANS, SAS, BAS, AIMS, Side effect, and vital sign assessments.&#xD;
      Neurocognitive assessments will be performed at week 0 and week 8 or endpoint. Laboratory&#xD;
      tests, antipsychotic levels, and the EKG will be repeated at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Titration Schedule: The target atomoxetine dose for this study is 80 mg/day. The&#xD;
      following titration schedule will be used: Week 1-2: atomoxetine 40 mg/day; Week 3-8:&#xD;
      atomoxetine 80 mg/day. This titration schedule serves to enhance tolerability and minimize&#xD;
      side effects. Participants randomized to placebo will receive an equal number of placebo&#xD;
      tablets during the titration schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications: Participants in the study will be allowed to continue on their&#xD;
      medication regimen that they were taking prior to the trial. This will allow the results to&#xD;
      be more generalizable. Patients must be stabilized on a single second generation&#xD;
      antipsychotic, excluding clozapine, at an unchanged dose for at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
      randomization. All participants must be on a stable dose of all other psychotropic&#xD;
      medications for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. No medication changes or changes in&#xD;
      dose will be permitted during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of atomoxetine's noradrenergic activity and it's modest ability to cause increases in&#xD;
      blood pressure, participants on drugs that have the potential for vasopressor effects, such&#xD;
      as venlafaxine or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed as needed (PRN) benztropine (1-6mg/day) for extrapyrmidal&#xD;
      symptoms, lorazepam (1-6 mg/day) for anxiety, agitation or akathisia, and chloral hydrate for&#xD;
      sleep (500-1000 mg/day). To minimize the effects of the PRN medications on test results,&#xD;
      participants will not receive any of the above PRN medications 12 hours prior to&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing. Additionally, participants requesting the use of benztopine or any&#xD;
      antiparkinson agent will first be assessed with a movement rating scale to document the&#xD;
      presence of EPS prior to receiving the antiparkinson agent and will not have received any&#xD;
      antiparkinson agent within 12 hours prior to the movement assessment. Participants requiring&#xD;
      routine use of benztropine and lorazepam will be excluded or withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of the Blind: For outpatients, study medication will be dispensed on a biweekly&#xD;
      basis. They will be given two extra days of medication in case of a missed appointment.&#xD;
      Inpatient subjects will receive their study medication daily from either the Spring Grove&#xD;
      Hospital Center TRU or the Perry Point VAMHC central pharmacy. An unblinded pharmacist at&#xD;
      each site will dispense all study medications. The blind will be broken only if a medical&#xD;
      emergency requires this information. If this occurs, the participant will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All raters, investigators and other staff will be blind to treatment assignment except for&#xD;
      the pharmacist. The pharmacist does not participate in assessing any of the primary symptom&#xD;
      or side effect dependent variables and conveys no information about treatment assignment to&#xD;
      participants or staff except in a medical emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance: Participants receiving 75% of their assigned medication will be considered&#xD;
      compliant. The 75% criterion ensures that participants will receive adequate treatment to&#xD;
      evaluate the comparative efficacy of atomoxetine and placebo. Outpatient compliance will be&#xD;
      monitored through weekly pill counts and subject interviews. Medications will be dispensed on&#xD;
      a weekly basis and will only be dispensed after compliance is assessed and all assessments&#xD;
      are completed. Inpatient compliance will be monitored through inpatient medication records.&#xD;
      If a participant is observed to have a compliance problem, then this will be discussed with&#xD;
      the participant and a plan formulated to bring the participant back within the compliance&#xD;
      parameter. For outpatients, the plan may include contacting the participant's caretaker or&#xD;
      scheduling increased clinic visits. These monitoring procedures have been used in other MPRC&#xD;
      studies and have resulted in high levels of compliance. Compliance patterns will be carefully&#xD;
      monitored in each treatment group and will be described as part of any presentation of study&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
