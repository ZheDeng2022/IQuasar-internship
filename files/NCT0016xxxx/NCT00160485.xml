      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the oral administration of glyburide is as&#xD;
      effective as insulin in the treatment of gestational diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SYNOPSIS: Infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes(GDM) are at risk for a&#xD;
           variety of adverse perinatal outcomes including macrosomia with subsequent birth trauma&#xD;
           and cesarean delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia, polycythemia, jaundice, hypocalcemia,&#xD;
           respiratory depression and newborn intensive care unit admission. These adverse outcomes&#xD;
           are thought to be related to the degree of maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy.&#xD;
           Women with GDM are typically treated with insulin to lower blood glucose levels to as&#xD;
           near-normal as possible. A single randomized trial has suggested that the oral&#xD;
           sulfonylurea, glyburide is a clinically effective and safe alternative to insulin&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Many obstetric care providers have adopted the use of glyburide in the routine&#xD;
           management of gestational diabetes. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
           and the American Diabetic Association both state that further studies are needed in a&#xD;
           larger patient population before the use of newer oral hypoglycemic agents can be&#xD;
           supported for use in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STATUS: Previous studies have demonstrated that there is no maternal-fetal transfer of&#xD;
           glyburide and when compared to insulin is an effective alternative to insulin.&#xD;
           Additionally, a published cost analysis concluded that glyburide is significantly less&#xD;
           costly than insulin for the treatment of GDM. The benefits of an oral agent for the&#xD;
           management of gestational diabetes include less discomfort for the patient in drug&#xD;
           administration, lower requirement for patient education in the administration of&#xD;
           injectable medications and less chance of error in dosing. Our study population is more&#xD;
           ethnically diverse and our incidence of large for gestational age infants is lower than&#xD;
           in the largely Hispanic population studied by Langer et al. Many obstetricians,&#xD;
           including ourselves, apply different criteria than Langer for diagnosing gestational&#xD;
           diabetes , and for deciding when to institute insulin therapy. It is our goal to confirm&#xD;
           the prior single study concerning the safety and efficacy of glyburide in reducing the&#xD;
           complications of GDM utilizing a more ethnically diverse population with more realistic&#xD;
           goals in glycemic control. To this end we will add to the medical literature supporting&#xD;
           this alternative therapy to insulin.&#xD;

      PLAN: Women who present for prenatal care are routinely screened for gestational diabetes&#xD;
      (GDM) with a one-hour 50gm oral glucose challenge test (GCT). This screening occurs at the&#xD;
      first prenatal visit if risk factors (marked obesity, prior pregnancy affected by GDM, prior&#xD;
      macrosomic infant, glycosuria, strong family history of diabetes) for GDM are identified on&#xD;
      intake history. If no risk factors for GDM are identified or if initial screening is&#xD;
      negative, the GCT is administered between 24-28 weeks gestation. At our institution, the GCT&#xD;
      is considered positive if, one hour after ingestion of a 50gm oral glucose solution, the&#xD;
      serum glucose is greater than or equal to 135mg/dl. This screening cutoff varies among&#xD;
      medical treatment facilities. Positive screening tests are followed by a diagnostic oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (GTT). A positive diagnosis requires that two or more thresholds be&#xD;
      met or exceeded. Women with the diagnosis of gestational diabetes will receive dietary&#xD;
      counseling and instruction on the performing capillary glucose from a by a nurse educator. If&#xD;
      &gt; 20% of recorded home glucose values are in excess of target range following initiation of&#xD;
      appropriate diet, women will be offered enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who agree to participate in the study will have an ultrasound performed to confirm&#xD;
      gestational age and rule out fetal anomalies, a serum glycosylated hemoglobin A1C to assist&#xD;
      in excluding preexisting diabetes and a fasting insulin level to assist in determining degree&#xD;
      of insulin resistance. A serum glycosylated hemoglobin A1C will be repeated upon admission&#xD;
      for delivery. Subjects randomized into standard therapy insulin arm will have their insulin&#xD;
      dose calculated by established standards. Dosing is based upon a 2 shot combined dose with&#xD;
      long acting and short acting insulin given prior to breakfast and dinner. If the fasting&#xD;
      glucose values remain elevated the dinner NPH will be moved to bedtime. Subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration is recommended in a consistent anatomic region, preferably the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin will be adjusted on a weekly basis in order to maintain optimal glucose control.&#xD;
      Women assigned to receive glyburide will begin with 2.5mg orally with the morning meal.&#xD;
      Glyburide dosage will be increased weekly as indicated to a maximum daily dose of 20mg to&#xD;
      achieve glucose control. If the patient continues to have elevated fasting glucose the may be&#xD;
      split to 12 hr intervals. If maximum daily dose of glyburide does not result in reaching the&#xD;
      threshold values, patients will be administered insulin however data will be analyzed on an&#xD;
      intent-to-treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon admission for delivery additional maternal blood will be collected for hemoglobin A1C,&#xD;
      and glyburide levels. These values will be utilized to determine efficacy of treatment and&#xD;
      for comparison to fetal umbilical cord values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At delivery fetal blood from the umbilical cord will be collected for glucose, hematocrit,&#xD;
      insulin level and, in a representative sample, glyburide level. These values will be utilized&#xD;
      to determine whether insulin or glyburide provides superior efficacy in maintaining these&#xD;
      values within normal limits. Cord blood glyburide levels will be obtained in a representative&#xD;
      sample of exposed subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When clinically indicated labs are performed by the pediatrician on the newborn, such as heel&#xD;
      stick glucose for hypoglycemia, bilirubin levels for neonatal jaundice, calcium levels for&#xD;
      suspected hypocalcemia, these values will be obtained by review of the newborn record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all gestational diabetics, post partum assessment of diabetic status will be assessed with&#xD;
      either a fasting glucose determination or a 2hr glucose tolerance test .&#xD;
