      RATIONALE: Websites for nutrition education may be an effective method to help people eat&#xD;
      more fruits and vegetables which may lower their risk of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized trial is studying how well an internet-based nutrition education&#xD;
      program works in preventing cancer in participants of health maintenance organizations.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the effects of internet-based nutrition education through untailored websites vs&#xD;
           tailored websites (TW) vs TW and tailored human online behavioral interaction (HOBI) on&#xD;
           the change in the number of daily fruit and vegetable servings consumed in participants&#xD;
           of health maintenance organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the proportion of participants reporting consumption of 5 or more servings of&#xD;
           fruits and vegetables per day at each 3-month interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the change in fruit and vegetable servings consumed from baseline to each&#xD;
           intermediate time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the effects of intervention and observation time in these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of HOBI in these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the impact of participant characteristics, in terms of the effect of the&#xD;
           intervention on the change in fruit and vegetable intake, in these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, multicenter study. Participants are&#xD;
      stratified according to participating site, gender, and the participant's stage of change&#xD;
      readiness. Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (untailored websites): Participants are given unlimited access to an&#xD;
           internet-based nutrition education program for up to 6 months. They are provided with 4&#xD;
           serial educational websites at 1, 3, 13, and 15 weeks after initial login. These&#xD;
           internet sites provide general information about fruits and vegetables, new recipes with&#xD;
           emphasis on fruits and vegetables, and how participants can incorporate them into their&#xD;
           diet. Participants complete an online survey at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (tailored websites): Participants are given unlimited access to an internet-based&#xD;
           nutrition education program for up to 6 months. They are provided with 4 serial&#xD;
           educational websites, at the same timepoints as in arm I, with emphasis on vegetable&#xD;
           consumption in weeks 1 and 13 and fruit consumption in weeks 3 and 15. Materials in&#xD;
           these websites, including new recipes with emphasis on fruits and vegetables, are&#xD;
           tailored and then revised (or retailored) based on individual health-risk information&#xD;
           obtained at baseline and at the 3-month online survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III (tailored websites and human online behavioral interaction [HOBI]): Participants&#xD;
           are given unlimited access to an internet-based nutrition education program for up to 6&#xD;
           months. Participants are provided with 4 serial educational websites with tailored&#xD;
           materials as in arm II. They also receive HOBI (tailored e-mail messages) developed and&#xD;
           then revised based on health-risk information obtained at baseline and the 3-month&#xD;
           online survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, participants complete online surveys at 3, 6, and 12 months to measure fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable intake and change in long-term risk behavior. For each survey, participants receive&#xD;
      up to 6 automatically generated reminder e-mails and 1 mailed announcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,619 participants were accrued for this study.&#xD;
