  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to replace the mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) which is our&#xD;
      usual therapy after liver transplantation with sodium mycophenolic acid (Myfortic®) and to&#xD;
      find out the effect this change may have on the development of side effects such as relief of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (stomach) problems. In the past we have had to stop Cellcept (our current&#xD;
      drug) because of these side effects. We will also try to see if improved usage of this drug&#xD;
      (Myfortic®) will allow us to use lower doses of other medications that lower your immune&#xD;
      system. We will do some special tests on your blood to see if the amount of the drug is&#xD;
      related with its effect on the immune system and side effects. Both Cellcept and Myfortic®&#xD;
      are FDA approved medications although Myfortic® is not approved for use after liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Myfortic® is really the same active drug as Cellcept® (Mycophenolic acid)&#xD;
      but has been coated to prevent breakdown of the drug in the stomach and is made to lower the&#xD;
      known gastrointestinal effects of Cellcept such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and nausea.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mycophenolic Acid (MPA) has been shown to be an effective immune suppressant in organ&#xD;
      transplantation. Its gastrointestinal side effects, however, have limited its use in liver&#xD;
      transplantation (OLT). A new form of MPA that is enteric coated (Myfortic) has been developed&#xD;
      to address the issue of GI side effects. While considerable experience has been gained with&#xD;
      this new formulation in kidney transplants (ref) the information regarding the use of&#xD;
      Myfortic in OLT recipients is limited. The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Myfortic in OLT recipients. The study will include a close follow-up of the&#xD;
      patients with regard to side effects and potential adverse effects of the drug. It will also&#xD;
      monitor the rate of compliance with this medication among the patients in the study. The&#xD;
      efficacy of the drug will be determined by the rate of rejection but also and more&#xD;
      importantly by our ability to withdraw corticosteroids and minimize calcineurin inhibitors&#xD;
      (CNI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several tests will be conducted as part of the study. Some of those are &quot;Standard of Care&quot;&#xD;
      tests such as liver function tests and complete blood cell count (CBC). Some tests however,&#xD;
      will be performed specifically for this study. These include a patient questionnaire to be&#xD;
      filled at various time points and blood tests designed to assess the integrity of the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit to the patients is three-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive the medication free of charge for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proven efficacy of MPA as an immune suppressant may allow us to reduce or eliminate the&#xD;
      use of corticosteroids and/or CNI whose long and short-term side effects are major causes of&#xD;
      morbidity in OLT recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avoidance of the GI side effects of non-enteric coated MPA, which is our standard drug in&#xD;
      OLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks for the patient include the potential deleterious side effects of MPA, namely bone&#xD;
      marrow depression, GI side-effects (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain), and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general benefits from the study may be the addition of a better formulation of MPA to the&#xD;
      list of drugs used for immunosuppression in OLT. Additionally, routine use of this drug may&#xD;
      minimize the long-term adverse effects of CNI and corticosteroids thus improving long-term&#xD;
      patient survival and well-being.&#xD;
