  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori in known to be closely associated with the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal&#xD;
      disorders such as peptide ulcer. Eradication of this bacterium is important in the treatment&#xD;
      of these diseases as well as in the reduction of the recurrence. The one-week triple therapy&#xD;
      with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is now considered to be the standard therapies in the&#xD;
      treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, providing more than 80% eradication rates with&#xD;
      few adverse effects. PPIs are mainly metabolized by CYP2C19, which is known to exhibit&#xD;
      polymorphisms in both its genotype and phenotype. Based on the PK/PD results of our study on&#xD;
      PPI, recently, we have proposed that CYP2C19 poor metabolizers might be subject to&#xD;
      advantageous conditions, especially after day-4, for the treatment of H. pylori infection&#xD;
      when 20 mg rabeprazole was given twice daily. Our results also suggest a possibility to start&#xD;
      the triple therapy on day-4 of rabeprazole treatment to ensure the optimal acid suppression&#xD;
      effect for antibiotics to exert the bacteriocidal effect. To find the rationale and the&#xD;
      optimal dosing regimen for the eradication of H. pylori infection using different proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitors, volunteers of four groups would be included in this study. PPI (rabeprazole or&#xD;
      esomeprazole) is given for 7 days. Antibiotics are given starting from day-1 or day-4 of PPI&#xD;
      dosing. The eradication rate of H. pylori infection and the PK/PD of PPIs are also evaluated.&#xD;
