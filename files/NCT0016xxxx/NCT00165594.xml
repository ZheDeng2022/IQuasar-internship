      Phase I study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate primary objective (maximal tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity) and&#xD;
      secondary objectives (pharmacokinetics, safety, estimation of a recommended dose, and&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect by evaluable case) of E7070 in patients with gastric cancer who are&#xD;
      extensive or intermediate metabolizer type (EM/IM) to CYP2C9 and CYP2C9 by intravenously&#xD;
      administering once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IIa study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate primary objective (response rate for efficacy assessment) and secondary&#xD;
      objectives (frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions, and pharmacokinetics) of E7070&#xD;
      in patient with gastric cancer who are EM/IM type by intravenously administering once every 3&#xD;
