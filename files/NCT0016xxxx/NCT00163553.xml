    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that epidural pethidine is an effective form of pain relief following&#xD;
      lumbar spinal surgery, resulting in significantly lower usage of concomitantly administered&#xD;
      (intravenous) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pethidine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale Lumbar laminectomy is commonly performed to alleviate local or nerve root pain in&#xD;
      the lower back and legs. Post-operative pain relief may consist of oral or parenteral&#xD;
      medication, with an increasing body of research focussing on the use of epidural analgesics&#xD;
      and anaesthetics (see references). It is the current practice of surgeons at this hospital to&#xD;
      use an epidural infusion of pethidine in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural medication has sometimes been administered at the conclusion of an operation as a&#xD;
      single dose, in the form of a spray1 2 3, paste 4, or been sponged onto the exposed epidural&#xD;
      space.5 Agents used in this manner have included morphine, tramadol, buprenorphine and&#xD;
      methylprednisolone. In one such study Bourke6 found that a single dose of epidural morphine 3&#xD;
      mg reduced pain scores and analgesic requirements for 24 hours when compared to the same dose&#xD;
      given intramuscularly, suggesting that direct epidural administration is superior to&#xD;
      parenteral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative, analgesics have been infused post-operatively via and epidural catheter&#xD;
      placed at the end of surgery under direct vision. Cohen7 compared an epidural infusion of&#xD;
      morphine and bupivacaine to PCA morphine in 54 patients and found no difference in outcome&#xD;
      between groups. Other studies which have been uncontrolled or unblinded have demonstrated the&#xD;
      efficacy of epidural narcotic administration (morphine, fentanyl and hydromorphone) following&#xD;
      lumbar laminectomy surgery.8 9 10 11 12 Thus there is some evidence supporting the use of&#xD;
      this form of analgesia, despite a report of an incidence of technical failure in&#xD;
      surgically-positioned epidural catheters. 13&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no published study has investigated the use of epidural pethidine following lumbar&#xD;
      laminectomy. Pethidine has some theoretical advantage over other agents used.14 As an opioid&#xD;
      with intermediate lipid solubility, it is less likely to leave the epidural space than&#xD;
      fentanyl. The low lipid solubility of morphine increases its likelihood of causing central&#xD;
      respiratory depression as it crosses the dura to the site of action at a slower rate than&#xD;
      pethidine.14 Pethidine also has an intrinsic local anaesthetic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An early study showed that patients receiving a single dose of epidural pethidine at the end&#xD;
      of major surgery had a longer period before further analgesics were required than patients&#xD;
      receiving equipotent doses of morphine or pethidine. Blake15 compared patient-controlled&#xD;
      epidural pethidine (PCEA) with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pethidine&#xD;
      following abdominal aortic surgery, where all patients also received epidural bupivicaine.&#xD;
      The PCEA group had lower pain scores, despite having lower plasma pethidine concentrations,&#xD;
      confirming the central action of epidural pethidine. In a similar study, Chen16 compared&#xD;
      epidural and PCA pethidine in 37 patients following gastrectomy. Pain and satisfaction scores&#xD;
      were similar, but the epidural group had lower plasma concentrations of pethidine and&#xD;
      norpethidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposed study will compare the efficacy of a continuous infusion of epidural&#xD;
      pethidine through a surgically-placed catheter to PCA pethidine in patients who have&#xD;
      undergone a lumbar laminectomy. Both strategies are considered usual practice for this&#xD;
      institution. PCA pethidine has been used for postoperative analgesia following a variety of&#xD;
      surgeries. Compared to PCA morphine and fentanyl it has been shown to associated with similar&#xD;
      patient satisfaction17. Pethidine also caused less vomiting and pruritis than other agents.18&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential consideration with the use of pethidine is its metabolite norpethidine.&#xD;
      Norpethidine is an excitatory neurotoxin that has been shown to cause seizures in animals. It&#xD;
      is renally excreted, and hence may accumulate in patients with renal failure. There are case&#xD;
      reports of patients experiencing seizures during the use of PCA pethidine.19 20 21 In each of&#xD;
      these cases the patients had received high doses, long-term therapy, or both. The average&#xD;
      reported dose administered in the 24 hours prior to the seizure was 1900 mg. By contrast, the&#xD;
      mean 24-hour dose in the Woodhouse study18 was 410 mg, and none of the 135 patients in those&#xD;
      studies18 17 exhibited any excitatory side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The hypothesis is that epidural pethidine is an effective form of pain relief&#xD;
      following lumbar spinal surgery, resulting in significantly lower usage of concomitantly&#xD;
      administered (intravenous) PCA pethidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A double-blind randomised controlled trial comparing a continuous epidural pethidine&#xD;
      infusion to a placebo normal saline epidural infusion following lumbar laminectomy surgery.&#xD;
      Both groups will receive intravenous PCA pethidine analgesia as well as routine analgesic&#xD;
      adjuvants (paracetamol, diazepam). The follow-up period will be 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults undergoing lumbar spinal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of informed patient consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute or chronic renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known allergy or intolerance to pethidine or tramadol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic respiratory insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidural contraindicated (coagulopathy, systemic infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consenting patients will be randomised to one of two groups, the epidural pethidine group&#xD;
      (group P) or the placebo group (group N). All patients will receive fentanyl 2 - 3 mcg/kg&#xD;
      intra-operatively as part of a balanced anaesthesia. Otherwise the anaesthesia will not be&#xD;
      controlled. At the conclusion of surgery, all patients will have an epidural catheter placed&#xD;
      under direct vision by the consultant surgeon. In the recovery room, all patients will have a&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) machine attached to the side arm of the intravenous&#xD;
      infusion line. All participants will receive written as well as standard verbal instruction&#xD;
      on the use of the PCA. The 30 ml PCA syringe will contain pethidine 10 mg/ml saline. Patients&#xD;
      will be given standard instructions on the use of the PCA machine. The PCA machine will be&#xD;
      set to deliver a one millilitre bolus with a five minute lockout, and a maximum dose of 20 ml&#xD;
      (200 mg) over four hours. In addition, an infusion will be connected to the epidural&#xD;
      catheter, containing either pethidine 250 mg in 250 ml saline (group P) or saline 250 ml&#xD;
      (group N). The infusion will be commenced at 10 -20 ml/h according to the preference of the&#xD;
      attending anaesthetist. This will generally depend on the age and weight of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will in the high-dependency area of the neurosurgical ward and will be reviewed&#xD;
      frequently in the usual manner of patients receiving parenteral narcotics. Patients who&#xD;
      develop pain will be encouraged to use the PCA. Any patient expressing dissatisfaction in&#xD;
      their pain relief will be offered an injection of intramuscular morphine (50 mcg/kg) as a&#xD;
      rescue medication up to every 2 hours. At the same time, the epidural infusion will be&#xD;
      increased by 10 ml/h to a maximum of 40 ml/h. All patients will be visited by blinded study&#xD;
      personnel at 1, 4, 24 and 48 hours for collection of data, and also twice daily by the&#xD;
      hospital acute pain service. At the end of 48 hours, the epidural catheter will be removed&#xD;
      and patients will be treated according to usual hospital pain management practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of a severe adverse reaction, or uncontrollable pain, the patient will be&#xD;
      excluded from further participation in the study, and will be unblinded. Pain management will&#xD;
      be in accordance with the wishes of the acute pain team and treating unit. Data from these&#xD;
      patients will be analysed according to &quot;intention to treat&quot; criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical considerations The study will be powered to detect a difference in cumulative&#xD;
      24-hour pethidine consumption. Based on a baseline 24-hour consumption of 410 mg 18 with a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 100 16 , a power of 0.8 and a significance level of 0.05, the sample&#xD;
      size required to detect a 20% difference in pethidine consumption is 24 subjects per group.&#xD;
      This difference would be considered clinically significant. A total of 60 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled to allow for loss of data due to participant drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. The unpaired Student's t-test and the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test will be used to analyse univariate parametric and non-parametric data&#xD;
      respectively. Serial measurements will be analysed by using repeated measures analysis of&#xD;
      variance; any significant overall differences between groups will be investigated with&#xD;
      t-tests at individual time intervals. The Chi-squared test will be used to compare&#xD;
      categorical data. A p value &lt; 0.05 is considered significant. The number and reason for&#xD;
      participants not completing the study will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event reporting Information concerning adverse events is to be collected as&#xD;
      end-points for the study. This includes pain scores, sedation scores, respiratory depression,&#xD;
      nausea, pruritis, agitation, tremor, hallucinations, and seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other adverse events, whether resulting from the use of study medication or procedural&#xD;
      errors, or apparently independent of the study, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event is defined as one which causes patient death, is life threatening,&#xD;
      prolongs hospital stay or results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity&#xD;
      (TGA). An independent physician will be appointed to review all serious adverse events. This&#xD;
      review will occur within 24 hours of the adverse event occurring. The monitoring physician&#xD;
      may suspend the study if warranted on the basis of the occurrence of adverse events. All&#xD;
      serious adverse events will be reported to the Drug Trial Subcommittee of the Human Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee as soon as possible.&#xD;
