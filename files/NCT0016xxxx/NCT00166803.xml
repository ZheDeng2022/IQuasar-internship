  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death in developed countries worldwide,&#xD;
      including Taiwan. The disruption of atherosclerotic plaques and the subsequent formation of&#xD;
      thrombi are currently recognized as the major cause of morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, early detection of vulnerable plaques is clinically&#xD;
      important for risk stratification and also to provide early treatment. Several imaging&#xD;
      approaches have been adapted to detect vulnerable plaques, however, most of them are based on&#xD;
      morphologic characteristics of atheroma. We hypothesize that PPARγ-induced plaque regression&#xD;
      could be monitored clinically by use of 18FDG PET/CT approach, which could assess the&#xD;
      inflammatory activity, and can be detected noninvasively earlier than previously reported.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The early detection of vulnerable plaques is clinically important for risk stratification and&#xD;
      also to provide early treatment.Inflammation is important in the both pathogenesis and&#xD;
      outcome of atherosclerosis. Plaques containing numerous inflammatory cells, particular&#xD;
      macrophages, have a high risk of rupture. Diabetes is a major risk factor for the development&#xD;
      of atherosclerosis. The discovery of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)&#xD;
      gene led to the hope of favorably influencing the insulin resistance syndrome. The&#xD;
      administration of PPARγ agonists have been shown to reduce insulin resistance, to reduce the&#xD;
      expression of leptin, to lower plasma free fatty acid level and to lower blood pressure.&#xD;
      Moreover, beyond the glucose effect, PPARγ agonists may theoretically affect atherosclerosis&#xD;
      also through the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines secreted from the macrophage, such as&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, etc. These evidences highlight the possibility of PPARγ agonists could be&#xD;
      have great impact on plaque regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18FDG is a glucose analogue that is taken up by cells in proportion to their metabolic&#xD;
      activity. Several papers have reported the potential roles of metabolic imaging in the&#xD;
      assessment of inflammatory vascular diseases, especially in large vessels. However, PET has&#xD;
      limited spatial resolution. Recently, a combined PET/CT is emerged as a promising modality&#xD;
      which could provide both anatomical and functional information. We hypothesize that PPARγ&#xD;
      agonists-induced plaque regression could be monitored clinically by use of 18FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      approach, and providing information of early efficacy PPARγ treatment caused by stabilization&#xD;
      of vulnerable plaque without affecting the lumen size.&#xD;
