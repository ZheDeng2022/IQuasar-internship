      Mother with severe Iodine deficiency are more likely to have neonates with further poor&#xD;
      mental development . In order to select population which could benefit from iodine&#xD;
      supplementation, ioduria has been tested but cannot be routinely practised. Strong background&#xD;
      data suggest that iodine status could be antenatally correlated with foetal thyroid volume.&#xD;
      The aim of that study is to examine correlation between these two parameter in a population&#xD;
      of 130 healthy pregnant women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iodine is an essential element in thyroid homeostasis, particularly in pregnant woman and her&#xD;
      fetus. Various studies have clearly shown that antenatal thyroid disorders at both the mother&#xD;
      and the fetus could cause in extreme situations of neurological consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a broader scale, subtle alterations of thyroid hormone balance has been implicated in&#xD;
      developmental delays and deviations of the IQ bell curve in newborn infants of mothers with&#xD;
      elevated TSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical implications of these basic data and public health are yet to confirm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been clearly established that there is a moderate iodine deficiency in France with a&#xD;
      decreasing gradient from west to east. In the Ile de France, there is a moderate iodine&#xD;
      deficiency, this has led some teams to propose a systematic supplementation of all women in&#xD;
      iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to target women who really need supplements systematic determination of urinary&#xD;
      iodine tongue; this assay is reliable but is difficult to implement in an ad hoc practice at&#xD;
      the individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team has expertise in the field of fetal thyroid, particularly in its sonographic and&#xD;
      reference curves of the perimeter and diameter of the thyroid are now clearly established&#xD;
      reliably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing that iodine deficiency is causing a decline in maternal urine iodine with a&#xD;
      phenomenon goitrigénèse and biological hypothyroidism and that some studies have shown that&#xD;
      neonatal thyroid volumes were higher in iodine deficient mothers . We postulate that the&#xD;
      measurement of fetal thyroid by our criteria can be correlated with maternal urinary iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this were the case, we will have a simple test to identify iodine supplementation in&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;
