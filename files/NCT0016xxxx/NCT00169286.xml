      This study aims to adapt and pilot test two core elements of an organized care program&#xD;
      (systematic telephone outreach and monitoring to improve quality and continuity of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, and structured psychoeducational group programs focused on patient&#xD;
      activation and self-management) in a population-based sample of patients with chronic or&#xD;
      recurrent depression.&#xD;

      This study aims to adapt and pilot test two core elements of an organized care program&#xD;
      (systematic telephone outreach and monitoring to improve quality and continuity of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, and structured psychoeducational group programs focused on patient&#xD;
      activation and self-management) in a population-based sample of patients with chronic or&#xD;
      recurrent depression. Two forms of group self-management training will be evaluated: a&#xD;
      Peer-Led Chronic Disease Self-Management Group (after that developed by Lorig and colleagues)&#xD;
      and a Therapist-Led Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Group. Approximately 100 patients with&#xD;
      chronic or recurrent depression were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) usual&#xD;
      care; 2) phone care management; 3) phone care management plus peer-led self-management group;&#xD;
      or 4) phone care management plus therapist-led CBT group. Blinded assessments will examine&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (SCL depression score, depression diagnosis by SCID), functional outcomes,&#xD;
      and process variables (self-efficacy for managing depression, use of coping strategies) over&#xD;
      12 months. If patients choose not to participate in treatment, reasons for dropout were&#xD;
      assessed. The data collected will provide:1) an evaluation of the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability (including recruitment, intervention uptake and continued participation) of the&#xD;
      intervention programs; 2) preliminary evaluation of effectiveness, i.e., the effects of each&#xD;
      intervention on patient outcomes and process of care; and 3) information to inform the design&#xD;
      and implementation of a full-scale effectiveness trial (refinement of intervention programs&#xD;
      and measurement strategy, necessary sample size).&#xD;
