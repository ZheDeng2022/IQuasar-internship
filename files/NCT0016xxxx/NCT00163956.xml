    <textblock>
      The inferior vena cava (IVC) is a large vein that enters the bottom part of the heart. Venous&#xD;
      blood from the lower portion of the body drains into the IVC. The IVC then returns blood back&#xD;
      to the heart. An IVC filter is placed to help prevent the blood clots moving from the legs to&#xD;
      the heart or lung. The idea behind using a filter in the IVC is to capture potential fatal&#xD;
      pulmonary emboli at an anatomical location where they may pose less risk for the patient.&#xD;
      Early filters, 1960's and 70's were, remained in the vein permanently. More recently,&#xD;
      temporary or retrievable filters have been developed and are being widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications have been demonstrated with long-term placement of IVC filters. In a randomised&#xD;
      study it was found that that patients with IVC filter placement had greater than three times&#xD;
      the incidence of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) compared to their control population at&#xD;
      two years. Blockage of the vein, recurrent pulmonary emboli, filter penetration and filter&#xD;
      fragmentation have all been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of retrievable filters (filters that can be place temporarily and then&#xD;
      removed at a later date) there has been renewed popularity for placement of temporary&#xD;
      filters. To our knowledge, no one has yet to follow the population of intended temporary IVC&#xD;
      filters, who undergo failed retrieval, and consequently end up with a permanent IVC filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to prospectively enrol 40 Alfred patients who have undergone a temporary IVC filter&#xD;
      placement and subsequently have had failed IVC filter retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to evaluate the long term outcomes for patients with failed IVC retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically we will determine the risk, due to failed filter retrieval, of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IVC stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IVC occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of DVT and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analyse the clinical outcomes (symptoms), their prevalence and their distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive routine care and their data will be analysed annually as collected. The&#xD;
      follow-up period is indefinite and will be at the discretion of the treating doctor.&#xD;

      Clinical Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failed Retrieval of Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filters: long-term outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective To evaluate the long term outcomes for failed IVC retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Long-term placement of IVC filters is not without complication. Descosous et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that those patients with IVC filter placement had greater than three times the&#xD;
      incidence of recurrent DVT at two years. Pulmonary Emboli (PE) have been reported. These can&#xD;
      occur when there is no evidence of PE prior to insertion of the IVC filter. This was shown by&#xD;
      Rogers et al where 2.3% of trauma patients receiving prophylactic filters developed a PE.&#xD;
      They can also occur as a recurrence (i.e. where a PE has already been demonstrated prior IVC&#xD;
      filter insertion) in 2.5 to 7.7 % of patients1, 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caval thrombosis resulting in occlusion have been reported to occur in between 1-24% of cases&#xD;
      depending on the type of filter3, 4. Guidewire and catheter entrapment during central venous&#xD;
      and pulmonary artery catheter placement have also been reported as long term IVC filters&#xD;
      become more prevalent. Filter penetration and filter fragmentation have all been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of retrievable filters there is renewed popularity for temporary caval&#xD;
      interruption. To our knowledge, no one has yet to follow the population of intended temporary&#xD;
      caval interruption, who undergo failed retrieval, and consequently end up with a permanent&#xD;
      IVC filter. This study will look at the incidence and degree of caval occlusion, caval&#xD;
      stenosis and incidence of DVT in patients at The Alfred who have had a failed retrieval of an&#xD;
      implanted IVC filter. Patient will be recruited for up to four years, the incidence of failed&#xD;
      retrieval at The Alfred is 10 per year, and follow up will be ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population Alfred patients undergoing temporary IVC filter placement and subsequently&#xD;
      have had failed IVC filter retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective, single-arm study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients identified with failed filter retrieval will be asked to participate in the&#xD;
           study. They will have a CT cavagram and lower limb duplex doppler ultrasound annually&#xD;
           which is part of standard patient management practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical evaluation, history-taking and examination for filter complications and venous&#xD;
           hypertension will be conducted annually, again as part of standard patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collected as per data collection forms and analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment Size 40 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End-Points CT cavagram will be used to evaluate/measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caval occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caval stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic or acute DVT will be evaluated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
       Duplex sonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End-points Adverse events related to IVC filter as established through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the long term outcomes for failed IVC retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the risk of IVC stenosis due to failed filter retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the risk of IVC occlusion due to failed filter retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the risk of DVT due to failed filter retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyse the clinical outcomes (symptoms), their prevalence and their distribution,&#xD;
           produced as a result of failed filter retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-arm clinical study. An will be made to the HREC to obtain&#xD;
      ethics approval for this study. Participants will be enrolled consecutively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive routine care and their data will be analysed annually as collected. The&#xD;
      follow-up period is indefinite and will be at the discretion of the treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the CT cavagram and duplex Doppler will be collected by the research assistant&#xD;
      from the patient's histories and reported onto the 'Investigations' data sheet (see Appendix&#xD;
      I.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the clinical interview and examination will be collected from the patient's&#xD;
      histories and reported onto the 'Examination' data sheet (see Appendix II.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan and Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at the incidence and degree of caval occlusion, caval stenosis and&#xD;
      incidence of DVT in patients at The Alfred who have had a failed retrieval of an implanted&#xD;
      IVC filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management, quality control Non-identifiable information will be collected and securely&#xD;
      stored in the Radiology Department research office. Data will be entered into an excel&#xD;
      spreadsheet and the incidence of the primary and secondary endpoints summarised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications and Reporting of Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no direct medical complications that might arise due to participation in this trial&#xD;
      as patients will have routine care. This study involves data collection and no change to&#xD;
      routine management. Any adverse event in reporting identifiable data will be reported to the&#xD;
      HREC committee within 24 hours from the identification of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications resulting from the CT cavagram include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contrast Allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anaphylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events therefore relate principally to confidentiality. See 'Data Management' below&#xD;
      for procedures related to adverse event reporting for breach of confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collated, stored and analysed by the research coordinator, Dr. Helen&#xD;
           Kavnoudias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All data forms will be de-identified prior to reporting and/or publication of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient medical records will be appropriately labelled as participants of research study&#xD;
           and kept indefinitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All departmental procedures relating to research, ethics and privacy regulations will be&#xD;
           adhered to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events involving data management will be reported to the ethics committee with&#xD;
           24-hours by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-frame:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be ongoing. There are approximately 10 failed retrievals each year.&#xD;
