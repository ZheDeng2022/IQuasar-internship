      Heparin is an anticoagulant or &quot;blood thinner&quot;. Heparin is always given to patients&#xD;
      undergoing open-heart surgery to prevent blood from clotting when a patient is placed on the&#xD;
      heart-lung machine. Heparin works by combining with a protein in blood to prevent other&#xD;
      proteins from working together to form a clot. The protein that heparin combines with seems&#xD;
      to be different in infants and young children compared to adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine which proteins in children have a direct impact on&#xD;
      the way heparin works. We also want to see how this may change at different ages. We will&#xD;
      enroll two age groups of children; birth to 2 years and 10 years or older. A total of 125&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled into this study. These patients will already be scheduled for&#xD;
      open-heart surgery using a heart-lung machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The testing involves taking blood samples when the patient is asleep for surgery; and later&#xD;
      from their intravenous line, IV. They will all have IV's in place already because of the&#xD;
      surgery. Therefore the study will cause no pain or discomfort for the patients who take part.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is necessary to prevent clotting as blood&#xD;
      comes in contact with the unphysiologic surfaces of the extracorporeal circuit, and is&#xD;
      achieved by administration of unfractionated heparin which binds to antithrombin III (ATIII)&#xD;
      to potentiate and accelerate its inhibition of thrombin and other activated coagulation&#xD;
      factors. In adults, heparin dose responses are decreased as ATIII concentrations fall.&#xD;
      Findings in adults indicate that the administration of supplemental ATIII as concentrations&#xD;
      fall below 80 u/dl may help to preserve heparin's effectiveness during CPB(1). Since ATIII&#xD;
      levels in infants do not reach 80 u/dl until 3-6 months of age (2), one would likewise&#xD;
      anticipate that heparin dose-response relationships would be affected. However, preliminary&#xD;
      investigations in children less than one year of age show that there is no correlation&#xD;
      between preoperative ATIII concentrations with the projected heparin dose-response (HDR)&#xD;
      curve or with changes in the activated clotting time (ACT) value after heparin&#xD;
      administration(3). The lack of correlation of ATIII levels with these heparin dose responses&#xD;
      in infants raises important questions for pediatric patients regarding the mechanism by which&#xD;
      heparin exerts its anticoagulant effects as well as the adequacy of heparinization during&#xD;
      CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another coagulation inhibitor, heparin cofactor II (HCII), forms a stable enzyme-inhibitor&#xD;
      complex that inhibits thrombin in a reaction enhanced by heparin(4). Although in the adult&#xD;
      population, the exact role of HCII is unclear, perhaps in neonates its role is more&#xD;
      significant. Alpha-2-macroglobulin (2M), a less important inhibitor of thrombin in adults,&#xD;
      has concentrations well above adult values in newborns and continues to increase in&#xD;
      concentration during the first 6 months of life(2). In neonates, 2M has been shown to have an&#xD;
      important role as a thrombin inhibitor although its association with heparin responses during&#xD;
      CPB is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adequacy of anticoagulation during CPB can be assessed by the extent to which heparin&#xD;
      attenuates the formation and activation of thrombin. However, the very short half-life of&#xD;
      thrombin in the presence of heparin and ATIII prohibits the direct measurement of thrombin&#xD;
      concentration while on CPB. The peptide prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PT1.2), which is formed as&#xD;
      prothrombin is converted to thrombin, is readily measurable and provides a way of evaluating&#xD;
      thrombin formation during CPB(5). One of thrombin's major actions, the conversion of&#xD;
      fibrinogen to fibrin, releases another measurable peptide, fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thereby&#xD;
      providing a means of assessing thrombin activity during CPB(5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to determine the mechanism by which heparin exerts its anticoagulant effect in&#xD;
      children, this investigation proposes to evaluate the relationship between preoperative&#xD;
      ATIII, HCII and 2M levels in pediatric patients of varying age groups with clinical&#xD;
      measurements of heparin response in the operating room, specifically changes in ACT values&#xD;
      with heparin administration and a generated heparin dose-response curve. We also propose to&#xD;
      evaluate the adequacy of heparinization in neonates, whom are known to have a quantitative&#xD;
      deficiency in ATIII, by measuring PT1.2 and FPA that is produced during CPB as compared to an&#xD;
      adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The management of the coagulation system during pediatric cardiac surgery is a&#xD;
      complex task. Cardiopulmonary bypass is a significant thrombogenic stimulus requiring&#xD;
      anticoagulation with heparin prior to its initiation, and after the completion of the bypass&#xD;
      period, reversal of heparin and the reestablishment of hemostasis prior to surgical closure.&#xD;
      These manipulations toward both hypo- and hypercoagulability must be accomplished during the&#xD;
      care of these children. The inability to attain either of these states within precise limits&#xD;
      at specified points during the surgical procedure can have far-reaching implications.&#xD;
      Adequate inhibition of the coagulation cascades is obviously necessary during CPB to prevent&#xD;
      catastrophic clot formation in the CPB circuit. A state of partial, but inadequate,&#xD;
      anticoagulation during this time can still prevent clot formation but will lead to the&#xD;
      formation of coagulation products that can have deleterious effects on coagulation after CPB:&#xD;
      thrombin is generated and subsequently activates plasminogen and the fibrinolytic system;&#xD;
      fibrinolysis prevents the reestablishment of hemostasis and perpetuates the activation of the&#xD;
      coagulation system; and thrombin, plasmin, and fibrin degradation products all severely&#xD;
      disrupt post-CPB platelet function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation during CPB is accomplished by the administration of heparin, which is&#xD;
      empirically dosed on the basis of patient weight. The degree of heparin-induced&#xD;
      anticoagulation during cardiac surgery can be measured in the operating room by assessing&#xD;
      heparin levels or by assessing heparin's anticoagulant effect with activated clotting times&#xD;
      (ACTs). The most commonly used method is ACT monitoring. Unfortunately, the ACT is influenced&#xD;
      by factors other than heparin, such as hemodilution and hypothermia. While not of major&#xD;
      concern in adults and older children, the hemodilution accompanying CPB is extreme in&#xD;
      neonates and young infants. Similarly, while most adult cardiac surgery is performed under&#xD;
      normothermic or mild hypothermic conditions, the surgical procedures in infants are often&#xD;
      conducted at extremely hypothermic temperatures. Therefore, ACT measurements during cardiac&#xD;
      surgery in infants may not be reflective of the degree of heparin-induced anticoagulation.&#xD;
      Indeed, heparin levels in young children are significantly lower than those found,&#xD;
      maintained, and considered safe during CPB in adults while the ACT measurements in these&#xD;
      children remain in the range felt to indicate adequate anticoagulation (6,7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In full term and preterm infants the coagulation system begins to develop gradually during&#xD;
      gestation and continues to mature toward the adult system during the postnatal period. By 6&#xD;
      months of age, most components of the coagulation system, both procoagulants and inhibitors,&#xD;
      are well within the normal adult range(8). However, at birth the coagulation system is&#xD;
      quantitatively immature with significant deficiencies in many factor levels. One of these&#xD;
      deficient factors is AT III. AT III levels are only 60% of adult values at birth and do not&#xD;
      attain adult levels until 3 to 6 months of age. In the face of these low AT III levels, the&#xD;
      ability of heparin to produce adequate anticoagulation during cardiac surgery in infants&#xD;
      becomes a significant concern, and it is reasonable to consider that there are potential&#xD;
      differences in coagulation between neonates and adults undergoing CPB. Questions arise as to&#xD;
      the role that diminished AT III levels have in producing an anticoagulant effect in young&#xD;
      infants. Further questions arise as to the adequacy of anticoagulation during cardiac surgery&#xD;
      in young infants since, the accepted standard of care, only ACT measurements, are routinely&#xD;
      used to make this determination. The first question can be addressed by the comparison of AT&#xD;
      III levels as well as other potential heparin cofactor levels with more specific indicators&#xD;
      of the inhibition of the coagulation system. The second question can be addressed by the&#xD;
      measurement of specific breakdown products released during the formation of thrombin upon&#xD;
      activation of the coagulation system.&#xD;
