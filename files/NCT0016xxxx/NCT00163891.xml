  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest infection is a common complication following lung transplant (LTx). Chest physiotherapy&#xD;
      is widely accepted as an integral part of the management of chest infections, however there&#xD;
      is no evidence available regarding the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy regimes for LTx&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus regarding whether LTx recipients should be instructed to perform&#xD;
      regular daily chest physiotherapy routines regardless of the presence of lung secretions (ie&#xD;
      prophylatically) because of the changes in mucus clearance bought about by lung transplant,&#xD;
      or only when they have a chest infection. Some clinicians believe that a prophylactic regimen&#xD;
      may be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will compare two chest physiotherapy treatment regimens - our current practice&#xD;
      of chest physiotherapy during chest infections only (Treatment A) with an independently&#xD;
      performed daily chest physiotherapy regimen regardless of the presence of a chest infection&#xD;
      (Treatment B). From this research, we aim to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very little is known about the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy protocols in lung&#xD;
      transplant recipients. Clinical practice is based upon the experiences of individual&#xD;
      clinicians and generalisations from other patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is anecdotal evidence (from discussion with physiotherapists at the European Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis Conference, 2001) that some lung transplant centres are advising their patients to&#xD;
      undertake daily (prophylactic) chest physiotherapy as part of their usual routine. They&#xD;
      believe that this may compensate for the reduced stimulus to cough caused by the lack of&#xD;
      vagal nerve supply to the transplanted lung/s.There is no evidence that this time consuming&#xD;
      intervention is of any benefit to the patient in the short or longer term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients have bronchial anastomotic complications and dynamic airway collapse that may&#xD;
      further impair secretion removal. The mechanical effects of Positive Expiratory Pressure&#xD;
      (PEP) mask Physiotherapy, particularly its ability to splint open airways, provides a&#xD;
      theoretical basis for why this technique may be beneficial to lung transplant recipients. We&#xD;
      have also noted a clinical benefit in a small number of patients who have been treated with&#xD;
      PEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate two chest physiotherapy protocols using a variety of outcome&#xD;
      measures and act as a starting point for future/ongoing research in this important clinical&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective randomised two month trail comparing two chest physiotherapy&#xD;
      protocols in lung transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocols are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment A - Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask physiotherapy in upright sitting&#xD;
      carried out only during chest infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment B - Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask physiotherapy in upright sitting&#xD;
      performed twice daily as a prophylactic routine&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparing Treatment A &amp; B, there will be no difference in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lung function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chest X ray (Brasfield scores)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Airway status (Bronchoscopy scores)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Days in hospital due to chest infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Days on antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exercise capacity (6 minute walk test)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be no difference in patient adherence to the alternative protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be no difference in patient satisfaction with the alternative protocols.&#xD;
