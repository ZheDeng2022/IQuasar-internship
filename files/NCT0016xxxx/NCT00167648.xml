  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among males in the U.S. More than&#xD;
      220,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the USA this year and more that 31,000&#xD;
      will die of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgen deprivation, the elimination of testosterone and its active metabolites, remains the&#xD;
      single most effective intervention available for the treatment of advanced prostate&#xD;
      carcinoma. Androgen deprivation induces an immune response to normal prostate and prostate&#xD;
      cancer, which is usually short-lived. Estradiol induces activation of many arms of the immune&#xD;
      system and may be a more effective and long lasting means of inducing immunity to prostate&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will treat clinically localized prostate cancer patients with either estrogens, or&#xD;
      standard androgen deprivation without estrogens, prior to prostatectomy in order more&#xD;
      completely to describe immune regulation by estradiol in men. Control tissue from patients&#xD;
      who have not been treated with androgen deprivation will be procured from the Northwest&#xD;
      Special Projects in Oncology Research Excellence (SPORE) tissue core and used as comparisons&#xD;
      against the cancers treated before prostatectomy. Tumors removed at prostatectomy, tissue&#xD;
      samples and blood samples will be assessed for immune system changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Estrogens are effective means of treating advanced prostate cancer. In randomized studies&#xD;
      estrogens have better cancer control rates than orchiectomy alone, suggesting that estrogen&#xD;
      efficacy is not limited to its ability to suppress testosterone. One hypothesis is that&#xD;
      estrogens modulate immunity to prostate cancer through direct activation of effector cells&#xD;
      and by upregulating cytokines in prostatic stroma. Administration of estrogen in murine&#xD;
      models induces infiltration of normal prostate with T lymphocytes even in castrate male&#xD;
      animals potentially through induction of autoimmunity to normally cryptic prostate antigens.&#xD;
      Estrogens activate multiple immune effectors and autoimmunity in a broad variety of&#xD;
      experimental settings, suggesting upregulation of immune recognition on many levels. Pilot&#xD;
      data demonstrates that estrogens upregulate expression of interferon regulated genes, major&#xD;
      histocompatibility antigens (MHC) on prostate cancer, and increase both number and activation&#xD;
      of natural killer (NK) cells. Other groups have shown that standard forms of androgen&#xD;
      deprivation also induce immunity against both normal and malignant prostate tissue. We&#xD;
      propose to test the hypothesis that administration of estrogen and/or androgen deprivation&#xD;
      induces immune recognition of prostate cancer in humans through upregulation of major&#xD;
      histocompatibility antigens on tumor and induction of tumor specific immunity. The&#xD;
      specificity of estrogen effect will be tested by comparing measures of immunity in patients&#xD;
      treated with estradiol, androgen deprivation or no neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this proposal are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To treat patients with clinically localized, low to intermediate risk prostate cancer&#xD;
           who are candidates for radical prostatectomy with either standard androgen deprivation&#xD;
           prior to surgery (neoadjuvant androgen deprivation) or neoadjuvant transdermal&#xD;
           estradiol. Patients will undergo radical prostatectomy 21 days after initiation of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate radical prostatectomy specimens obtained from these patients for expression&#xD;
           of MHC class I and II, and NK ligands MICA and MICB in prostate carcinoma and adjacent&#xD;
           prostate by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate tumor tissue for infiltration by clonal T lymphocytes, NK cells, and&#xD;
           plasmacytoid dendritic cells using IHC and spectratyping of T cell receptor gene&#xD;
           rearrangements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate patients for the induction of tumor specific antibodies using patient&#xD;
           immunoglobulin collected before and after neoadjuvant therapy (SEREX)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate patients for induction of NK cells and upregulation of the NK receptor NKG2D&#xD;
           on patient lymphocytes by androgen deprivation and estradiol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the effects of androgen deprivation and estradiol on induction of plasma and&#xD;
           tissue levels of interferon gamma, alpha, beta, IL-4 and GM-CSF by ELISA and&#xD;
           ribonuclease protection assay.&#xD;
