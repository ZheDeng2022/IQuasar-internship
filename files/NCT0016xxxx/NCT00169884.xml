  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the proposed cognitive-behavioural&#xD;
      intervention is effective for DSH patients in the age group 15-35 years. In addition, we will&#xD;
      examine which elements derived from the theoretical model can explain the efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      1. The development of treatment interventions for non-fatal deliberate self-harm (DSH)&#xD;
           among young people has received little attention in scientific literature and in mental&#xD;
           health care. This is surprising, considering the relatively high rates of&#xD;
           hospital-referred DSH among adolescents reported in epidemiological studies (Arensman et&#xD;
           al., 1995; Hawton et al., 1997; Hawton et al., 1998; Schmidtke et al., 1996). On the&#xD;
           basis of a four-year monitoring study (1989-1992) in the area of Leiden, the average&#xD;
           rate of DSH among females aged 15-24 was 179 per 100,000 and for males in this age group&#xD;
           the average rate was 91 per 100,000 (Arensman et al., 1995). General population surveys&#xD;
           among adolescents show a self-reported life-time prevalence of 2 to 5 percent (Kienhorst&#xD;
           et al., 1990; De Wilde et al., 2000). Reports from other European countries indicate an&#xD;
           increase of DSH in adolescents and young adults (15-30 years), in particular in young&#xD;
           males (Hawton et al., 1997; Schmidtke et al., 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
           DSH is operationalized as dysfunctional behaviour associated with a heterogeneity of&#xD;
           psychological or psychiatric disorders e.g., affective disorders, anxiety disorders,&#xD;
           substance abuse, and eating disorders (Arensman &amp; Kerkhof, 1996; Arensman, 1997; Ellis&#xD;
           et al., 1996; Engstroem et al., 1996; Kienhorst et al., 1993). However, a common finding&#xD;
           is that depressive symptoms (observer- or self-rated) and major depression appear to be&#xD;
           highly prevalent among young DSH patients (Burgess et al., 1998; Goldston et al., 1998;&#xD;
           Harrington et al., 1994). In these studies, co-morbidity with other types of&#xD;
           psychopathology also appeared to be relatively high.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The risk of repeated DSH is highest in the first year following an episode of DSH. The&#xD;
           repetition rates among young DSH patients vary from 10% (Goldacre &amp; Hawton, 1985) to 27%&#xD;
           (Arensman, 1997) in hospital referred DSH patients. Among DSH patients, prevention of&#xD;
           the first subsequent repeated episode of DSH is important in order to prevent a pattern&#xD;
           of chronic repetition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research findings with regard to risk factors associated with repeated DSH are fairly&#xD;
           consistent. Among young DSH patients, those with an increased risk for repeated DSH are&#xD;
           characterised by suicidal ideation, depression (Harrington et al., 2000; Hawton et al.,&#xD;
           1999), hopelessness (Brent, 1987; Hawton et al., 1999), impulsivity (Kashden et al.,&#xD;
           1993), disturbance of autobiographical memory (Evans et al., 1992), problems with peers&#xD;
           or other relationships, frequent or chronic stress and problem-solving deficits (De&#xD;
           Wilde et al., 2000; Hawton et al., in press; Rudd et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite the fact that many studies report these correlates, the available treatment&#xD;
           studies, which merely comprise evaluations of general treatment interventions, often&#xD;
           without a randomised controlled design, have not incorporated knowledge about risk&#xD;
           factors (Hawton et al., 1998). In addition, existing explanatory and treatment models do&#xD;
           not address the heterogeneity of the group of DSH patients. This is surprising,&#xD;
           considering the variety of characteristics and problems of DSH patients. So far, most&#xD;
           models focus on single psychiatric problems, such as depression or anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this study is to present and test a therapeutic approach for DSH that goes&#xD;
           beyond single psychiatric diagnoses and that addresses the heterogeneity of DSH&#xD;
           patients. It will combine elements from cognitive-behavioural therapy, problem-solving&#xD;
           interventions and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), since these approaches fit in&#xD;
           with the needs of different DSH patients. Patients in which depressive thoughts and&#xD;
           beliefs predominate may especially profit from the elements from cognitive therapy,&#xD;
           while patients who primarily experience problems in regulating their emotions may&#xD;
           especially profit from the elements from DBT. Patients in whom skills deficits&#xD;
           predominate may especially profit from the elements from problem solving interventions.&#xD;
           In addition to this combined treatment approach, attention will be given to specific&#xD;
           developmental issues that play a role among adolescent DSH patients. Furthermore,&#xD;
           knowledge of risk factors for (repetition of) DSH will be incorporated in the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The model of the aetiology and maintenance of DSH on which the treatment protocol is&#xD;
           based addresses interactions between cognitive, affective, behavioural and interpersonal&#xD;
           aspects of DSH. As in other stress-process models, the relationship between&#xD;
           vulnerability factors (negative family experiences and biological characteristics),&#xD;
           triggering factors, and DSH is mediated by moderating variables (interpersonal&#xD;
           problems/lack of social support and individual characteristics: cognitive distortions,&#xD;
           affective dysregulation and skills deficits) and mediating variables (negative&#xD;
           appraisal, inadequate coping and psychological reactions such as impulsivity). In&#xD;
           accordance with Van Praag (1996), we assume that if a person with a marginally&#xD;
           functioning serotonergic-system experiences a stressful event he or she is not able to&#xD;
           cope with, the production of the stress-hormone cortisol increases, which decreases the&#xD;
           level of serotonin. Reduced serotonin activity in the prefrontal cortex as examined by&#xD;
           neuroimaging techniques, may be involved in the destabilisation of the regulation of&#xD;
           fear, aggression (Van Praag, 1996) and impulsivity (Mann, 1999), since this area of the&#xD;
           brain mediates behavioural inhibition. Increased impulsivity may therefore increase the&#xD;
           risk of DSH (Van Heeringen, 2001). We assume that in some patients impulsivity and&#xD;
           carelessness will be the primary features associated with DSH. In particular, if&#xD;
           impulsivity and feelings of hopelessness co-occur, the risk of DSH appears to be high.&#xD;
           The recognition of the association between hopelessness and DSH, described here, is in&#xD;
           line with the cognitive approach of Williams (2002) stating that over time, among people&#xD;
           who perceive they cannot change the stressful situation they are in, despair gradually&#xD;
           gains the upper hand and they will show more marked symptoms of depression and&#xD;
           hopelessness in particular.The approach as outlined by us, will have advantages compared&#xD;
           to approaches based on single psychiatric problems, since it combines the main&#xD;
           biological, cognitive, affective, behavioural and interpersonal aspects of DSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The wide range of problems faced by young people who harm themselves calls for a variety&#xD;
           of different treatment strategies, varying from intensive care for those at very high&#xD;
           risk of suicide, to brief interventions for the group of patients in whom DSH appears to&#xD;
           have been a transient response to temporary difficulties and who have few other problems&#xD;
           (Harrington, 2001). One of the most important obstacles to treating DSH patients that&#xD;
           may play a role in almost every treatment is compliance (Heard, 2000 in: Hawton and Van&#xD;
           Heeringen). Another obstacle in treating DSH patients is the limited availability of&#xD;
           research data on effectiveness of therapy for DSH, especially of randomised controlled&#xD;
           trials. In the section that follows the most common treatment approaches for DSH will be&#xD;
           discussed. Attention will be given to what is known about the effectiveness in terms of&#xD;
           reduction of repeated episodes of DSH. Cognitive therapy for DSH patients generally&#xD;
           focuses on their tendency to evaluate events and the presence and the future in such a&#xD;
           way that this results in the feeling of being entrapped (because of difficulties in&#xD;
           coping) and hopelessness (because they have great difficulty in generating positive&#xD;
           future events) (Heard, 2000 in: Hawton and van Heeringen). Cognitive and cognitive&#xD;
           behavioural therapies directed at cognitive restructuring seem to be promising in&#xD;
           successfully treating patients who harm themselves deliberately (Hawton et al.,&#xD;
           1998).Given that problem-solving deficits appear to be related to increased risk of&#xD;
           self-harm (Orbach et al., 1990), the most commonly used technique for older adolescents&#xD;
           is brief problem oriented counselling, which is a form of cognitive therapy. While&#xD;
           problem-solving therapy seems to be promising to improve depression, hopelessness and&#xD;
           problem-solving skills (Towsend et al., 2001), it is still unclear whether&#xD;
           problem-solving therapy can help not only address current problems but also longstanding&#xD;
           deficiencies in problem-solving skills. Current research focuses almost exclusively on&#xD;
           solving real or hypothetical problems in relationships with other people, yet one of the&#xD;
           major issues for suicidal patients is how they can solve the problem of how to gain&#xD;
           control over their feelings. Linehan (1993a, 1993b) developed an intensive treatment&#xD;
           programme for patients with borderline personality disorder, called Dialectical&#xD;
           Behaviour Therapy (DBT). This treatment method focuses on teaching skills that will help&#xD;
           people to regulate their emotions and that stress the acceptance of pain and crisis. In&#xD;
           a review by Heard (2000 in: Hawton and van Heeringen), in general, a decrease in&#xD;
           repeated DSH was found among patients in DBT treatment. Group therapy seems to be&#xD;
           promising as a treatment for adolescents who repeatedly harm themselves. However, larger&#xD;
           studies are required to assess more accurately the efficacy of this intervention (Wood,&#xD;
           Trainor, Rothwell, Moore, Harrington, 2001). No consensus on how to treat DSH medically&#xD;
           has been reached yet. As for the psychological treatments, most studies on the efficacy&#xD;
           on psychopharmacological treatments are too small to detect significant effects. So far,&#xD;
           it appears that the most promising treatments are high doses of Serotonin Specific&#xD;
           Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), and, in selected cases atypical neuroleptics. SSRIs are&#xD;
           probably the first line medical treatment (Kavoussi et al., 1994). Tricyclics do not&#xD;
           seem to be effective for child and adolescent depressions and are toxic in overdose&#xD;
           (Harrington, 2001). In conclusion, it can be said that there still remains considerable&#xD;
           uncertainty about which type of psychosocial and medical treatments of DSH patients is&#xD;
           most effective, inclusion of insufficient numbers of patients in trials being the main&#xD;
           limiting factor. However, cognitive-behavioural therapies and problem-solving therapies&#xD;
           and DBT seem to be promising. The present study will incorporate elements from&#xD;
           cognitive-behavioural therapy, problem-solving interventions and DBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design. The subjects will be randomly allocated to the cognitive-behavioural&#xD;
           intervention (experimental group) and routine aftercare (control group), stratified with&#xD;
           respect to repetition of DSH and gender.The study subjects are patients aged 15-35 who&#xD;
           are referred to the Leiden University Medical Center, to MCH Westeinde (The Hague), or&#xD;
           to local centers mental healthcare in Leiden (Rivierduinen)and The Hague (Parnassia&#xD;
           PMC), following an act of DSH. DSH patients will be included if they recently have been&#xD;
           engaged in an act of DSH including overdoses of medication, ingestion of chemical&#xD;
           substances and self-inflicted injuries according to the definition which is used in the&#xD;
           WHO/Euro Multicentre Study on parasuicide: &quot;An act with non-fatal outcome in which an&#xD;
           individual deliberately initiates a non-habitual behaviour, that without intervention&#xD;
           from others will cause self-harm, or deliberately ingests a substance in excess of the&#xD;
           prescribed or generally recognised dosage, and which is aimed at realising changes that&#xD;
           the person desires via the actual or expected physical consequences&quot; (Platt et al.,&#xD;
           1992). DSH patients with severe psychiatric disorders requiring intensive long-term&#xD;
           psychiatric treatment will be excluded.&#xD;
