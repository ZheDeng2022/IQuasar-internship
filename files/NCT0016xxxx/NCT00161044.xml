  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if galantamine is an effective agent for the treatment of&#xD;
      the cognitive abnormalities, negative symptoms, and /or behavioral impairments seen in&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this exploratory investigation, we propose to study the adjuvant therapeutic efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of galantamine in 20 patients with chronic schizophrenia, who are maintained on a&#xD;
      stable regimen of antipsychotic medication for at least two weeks prior to enrollment (see&#xD;
      Table 1 for Selection Criteria). Assessments of neuropsychological performance will be made&#xD;
      prior to the start of galantamine therapy and at study endpoint. Upon enrollment,&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests will be administered by the study neuropsychologist, or a trained&#xD;
      and supervised assessment technician; in fixed order, and according to standardized testing&#xD;
      procedures. The following tests will be administered: (1) Repeatable Battery for the&#xD;
      Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) (covering (a) verbal and visual episodic&#xD;
      memory, (b) verbal response generation and self-monitoring, (c) auditory attention and&#xD;
      working memory, and (d) sustained attention and psychomotor speed); and (2) Grooved Pegboard&#xD;
      Test (motor speed). RBANS administration will be counterbalanced (using Forms A and B) across&#xD;
      subjects and assessment points to prevent order effects. Remaining assessments will be&#xD;
      administered at baseline, after galantamine titration, and at weeks 4 and 8 of galantamine&#xD;
      treatment. Psychiatric symptoms and behavior will be assessed using the Brief Psychiatric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the&#xD;
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); the&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI); and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Trained&#xD;
      research nurses, psychologists and psychiatrists, will administer the symptom, behavior and&#xD;
      functional scales with established inter-rater reliability. In this study, adverse effects&#xD;
      will be monitored through self-reporting and observation. Vital signs will be collected on a&#xD;
      weekly basis. Additionally, motor and movement side effects will be rated by trained research&#xD;
      nurses, using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (EPRS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale&#xD;
      (BAS); and the Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale (AIMS). Following their initial&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment patients will enter a ¿three week galantamine titration phase¿&#xD;
      during which galantamine will be added to the stable regimen of antipsychotic medication&#xD;
      according to the following titration schedule: 8 mg/day for the first week, followed by 16&#xD;
      mg/day in the second and 24 mg/day in the third week (Raskin et al., 2000). At the end of&#xD;
      this titration phase, patients will be receiving the maximal allowable dose of galantamine&#xD;
      (i.e., 24 mg/day) or an optimal dose (i.e., the highest tolerable dose devoid of significant&#xD;
      side effects [e.g., 16 mg/day]). Moreover, at the end of this titration phase, patients will&#xD;
      be administered the standard battery of rating instruments prior to entering an 8-week period&#xD;
      of active treatment with the maximal or optimal adjuvant therapeutic dose of galantamine.&#xD;
      During the active treatment phase, the standard battery of rating instruments will be&#xD;
      administered at the end of the fourth and eighth week of active treatment. Patients admitted&#xD;
      to the 364A Unit at Perry Point will have their charts reviewed to see if they meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for the study. After approval by the principal investigator the patient&#xD;
      will be approached by a designated member of the research team for their interest in&#xD;
      participating in the study.&#xD;
