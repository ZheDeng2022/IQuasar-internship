      Part 1: The primary purpose is to determine the recommended dose of E7070 in combination with&#xD;
      capecitabine by dose adjustment. Part 2: The primary purpose is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination in patients with metastatic CRC resistant to 5-fluorouracil and&#xD;
      irinotecan.&#xD;
