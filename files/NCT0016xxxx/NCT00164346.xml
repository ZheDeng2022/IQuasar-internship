  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children will receive comprehensive evaluations through the Children's Research Triangle&#xD;
      (CRT) clinical program. The assessment for the child will be in accordance with the protocol&#xD;
      developed by Astley and Clarren as performed by one of the clinic pediatricians and final&#xD;
      diagnosis will be according to Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria. Children will be&#xD;
      randomized into either a Treatment or Control group. The Treatment group will receive (in&#xD;
      addition to standard referrals) neurocognitive habilitation and psychotherapy services as&#xD;
      well as parent psychoeducation. The Control group will be referred for intervention through&#xD;
      existing community and school-based agencies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurocognitive habilitation, based on the traumatic brain injury literature for teaching&#xD;
      compensatory skills, will be the primary intervention. Interventions will be individually&#xD;
      designed and delivered through individual therapy sessions. Audiotapes will augment the&#xD;
      sessions to facilitate implementation of strategies in the home environment. Didactic therapy&#xD;
      will be used to foster appropriate interactions and relationships between parent and child.&#xD;
      Children will participate in 8-week group sessions that will include neurocognitive&#xD;
      exercises, homework sessions, and possibly group psychotherapy. An educational specialist&#xD;
      will provide school and legal advocacy services as well as observations of the child in the&#xD;
      classroom that could lead to educational modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent Component: Family education programs and parent support groups using psychoeducational&#xD;
      approaches will be the means of intervening with parent behaviors. Parents will be instructed&#xD;
      on becoming advocates for their child. Groups of 8 to 12 parents will meet for one 2-hour&#xD;
      session per week for 8 weeks. Each session will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. neurocognitive exercises (relaxation);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. specific topic discussions; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. general support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last hour of the final two weeks of the program, parent and children will be&#xD;
      combined to practice learned techniques. Children and parents will participate in monthly&#xD;
      &quot;booster&quot; sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Plan: Treatment and control groups will be compared using pre- and post-test&#xD;
      measures. Post-tests will be at the conclusion of the intervention, as well as at 12, and&#xD;
      24-month follow-ups. Process and outcome measures will be evaluated.&#xD;
