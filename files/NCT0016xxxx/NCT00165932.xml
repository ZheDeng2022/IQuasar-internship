    <textblock>
      At Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, children who have irregular heart rhythms are often&#xD;
      referred for evaluation. Sometimes they also need a procedure to correct their irregular&#xD;
      heart rhythm. An echocardiogram is routinely used as part of their evaluation and follow-up.&#xD;
      The echocardiogram including Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) works by bouncing sound waves off&#xD;
      the heart similar to radar. A new echocardiogram technology, Tissue Synchronization Imaging&#xD;
      (TSI), should help doctors look at heart function compared to heart rhythm. All three of&#xD;
      these are noninvasive, which means they work from a probe outside the body and are not&#xD;
      painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see how Tissue Synchronization Imaging works in patients with&#xD;
      heart rhythm problems. We will use patients who have a heart irregularity. We will also look&#xD;
      at children and young adults with normal heart function to establish normal values for TSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pediatric patients we approach for this study will receive an echocardiogram recommended&#xD;
      by their cardiologist (standard of care), plus TSI, a new part of a heart ultrasound The&#xD;
      young adult population will undergo a heart ultrasound plus TSI. This young adult population&#xD;
      will be selected from medical students at Emory University. During the consent process, the&#xD;
      medical students will be informed that participation is voluntary and if they decide not to&#xD;
      participate, it will not affect their grades, etc.&#xD;

      There is a growing body of evidence that interventricular dyssynchrony results in abnormal&#xD;
      ventricular mechanics that may be detrimental to myocardial performance.(1; 2) Adult patients&#xD;
      with LBBB, dilated cardiomyopathy and CHF are increasingly being treated with a novel pacing&#xD;
      technique in order to restore electrical and mechanical synchrony.(3-5) This technique,&#xD;
      biventricular or resynchronization pacing, involves the insertion of a specialized cardiac&#xD;
      pacing system that not only maintains atrioventricular synchrony, but also restores&#xD;
      interventricular synchrony by simultaneously activating the right and left ventricles. There&#xD;
      have been a number of clinical trials (MIRACLE, MUSTT, INSYNC) that have revealed marked&#xD;
      clinical improvement in adult patients with moderate-to-severe CHF.(6-8) There have been a&#xD;
      few small reports of the acute effects of biventricular pacing in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      acquired interventricular dysynchrony either from repair or palliation of congenital heart&#xD;
      defects, or from chronic standard pacing from one ventricular chamber (single-site&#xD;
      ventricular pacing).(9-11) One of the main hurdles encountered when evaluating these patients&#xD;
      is the lack of reliable, reproducible non-invasive imaging modalities. Recent reports have&#xD;
      shown promising results with a relatively new technique known as tissue Doppler imaging&#xD;
      (TDI).(12-14) TDI echocardiography has recently been employed as a non-geometric measure of&#xD;
      myocardial systolic and diastolic performance for both the left and the right ventricles.&#xD;
      Utilizing low velocity signals from discrete points on the myocardial walls, motion can be&#xD;
      assessed under a variety of conditions non-invasively. Additionally when two points along a&#xD;
      ventricular wall are simultaneously assayed, the relative motion between the two points can&#xD;
      estimate myocardial systolic strain in the direction of the Doppler sound beam. This&#xD;
      technique eliminates any variation due to the translational motion of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue synchronization can be assessed by the timing of peak systolic motion of different&#xD;
      points along the myocardium relative either to the QRS of the electrocardiogram or to the&#xD;
      mechanical indicators of systole such as aortic valve opening. Recent advances in software&#xD;
      design have now created technology that simultaneously depicts the peak velocities of the&#xD;
      entire myocardium viewed in a 2-dimensional echo image. This promotes easy identification of&#xD;
      any dysynchronous segments. By subsequently applying discrete cursors to these areas, graphic&#xD;
      patterns of both velocity and direction of myocardial motion can be drawn for quantitative&#xD;
      analysis. The application of these new sophisticated tools will allow better analysis of&#xD;
      electromechanical dysynchrony and may enable definition of criteria, which can be used to&#xD;
      identify those patients who will or will not benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have identified 4 groups of patients that will allow us to prospectively and&#xD;
      systematically evaluate TSI in this young population. The first group is those patients with&#xD;
      supraventricular tachycardia and the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. These patients&#xD;
      have an accessory AV connection (AC) that allows electrical activity to bypass the normal AV&#xD;
      node and excite the ventricles prematurely. In doing so, the result is a loss of the normal,&#xD;
      midline ventricular activation pattern for a dysynchronous activation pattern. There have&#xD;
      been small reports of this chronic ventricular dysynchrony potential playing a role in&#xD;
      depressed myocardial performance.(15) Standard therapy for patients with WPW and clinical SVT&#xD;
      includes invasive intracardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) with possible radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation (RFA) in order to eliminate the AC. These patients are then left with normal&#xD;
      conduction over the AV node, presumably restoring the midline activation sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group of patients is those children with SVT and no evidence of ventricular&#xD;
      preexcitation (i.e., no WPW). These patients have a normal, midline ventricular activation&#xD;
      pattern in sinus rhythm. Standard treatment for children afflicted with these variants of SVT&#xD;
      would also include EPS and RFA. As part of the standard EPS, these patients receive&#xD;
      intermittent atrial and ventricular pacing. The result of the transient ventricular pacing is&#xD;
      presumably a dysynchronous activation pattern that could be evaluated with TSI. With pacing&#xD;
      off, the normal activation pattern should be restored. Therefore, these patients will also&#xD;
      serve as their own controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third group is essentially normal (normal 4 chamber anatomy) pediatric patients who have&#xD;
      been referred for an echocardiogram to evaluate a possible heart murmur, syncope or chest&#xD;
      pain. Their data will be used to establish normal pediatric values for TSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth group is normal (normal 4 chamber anatomy) young adult subjects who will be&#xD;
      recruited for participation in this study. Their data will be used to establish normal adult&#xD;
      values for TSI. These values or results will not be compared to the other three pediatric&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
