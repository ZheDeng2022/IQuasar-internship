  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitral valve regurgitation (leakage of the mitral valve of the heart) is frequent and&#xD;
      currently there is no specific medical therapy. Mitral regurgitation is a slowly progressive&#xD;
      disease that frequently requires surgical treatment. This randomized clinical trial will use&#xD;
      Metoprolol, a common beta-blocker medication, to determine if medical treatment impacts&#xD;
      mitral valve disease progression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is frequent and its prevalence is increasing with aging&#xD;
      of the population. Organic MR, due to primary valvular lesions has severe consequences&#xD;
      determined by its degree, with left ventricular (LV) remodeling and dysfunction, left atrial&#xD;
      (LA) enlargement, leading to poor clinical outcome. Surgery can eliminate MR, but carries&#xD;
      notable risks and is not applicable to all patients. Recent animal data suggest that&#xD;
      beta-blockade in organic MR has significant positive effect, particularly on LV remodeling.&#xD;
      Therefore, chronically decreasing MR, protecting LV and LA with beta-blockade are major goals&#xD;
      of medical therapy. However, effects of chronic oral beta-blockade of human MR are uncertain&#xD;
      and recent practice guidelines underscored these gaps in knowledge and did not recommend&#xD;
      beta-blockade of MR. Hence, a trial of treatment of organic MR is needed. A large trial with&#xD;
      mortality-morbidity end-points is desirable but premature without knowledge of magnitude of&#xD;
      mechanistic effects of beta-blockade. The improvement of these intermediate end-points,&#xD;
      mechanistically linked to outcome, is measurable with non-invasive quantitative techniques&#xD;
      and forms the basis of the present clinical trial proposal. Hypothesis: Chronic beta-blockade&#xD;
      therapy using Metoprolol weighed against placebo produces a sustained reduction of the&#xD;
      consequences of organic MR. Specific aims are that treatment improves a) degree of MR&#xD;
      (decreases regurgitant volume, primary end-point), b) LV remodeling (decreases LV&#xD;
      end-diastolic volume index, second end-point), and c) LA enlargement (decreases LA volume,&#xD;
      third end-point) as compared to placebo. Population: Patients with MR organic (intrinsic&#xD;
      valve disease), isolated (no other valve disease) d moderate (regurgitant volume *30&#xD;
      mL/beat). Methods: A randomized clinical trial, placebo controlled, double-blind, without&#xD;
      crossover, of 12 months oral treatment with potent beta-blockade (Metoprolol XL 50 to 200mg&#xD;
      QD) titrated to the maximally tolerated dose. The trial is preceded by an acute study to&#xD;
      determine tolerance. End-points are measured by Doppler-Echocardiography for quantitation of&#xD;
      MR (regurgitant volume) using combination of 3 simultaneous methods (quantitative Doppler,&#xD;
      two-dimensional echocardiography, proximal flow convergence) and echocardiography for LV and&#xD;
      LA volume measurement. In addition cardiopulmonary exercise testing will measure peak O2&#xD;
      consumption at baseline and follow-up. This study seeks to enroll a total of 60 patients. The&#xD;
      analysis will be based on intention to treat and compare changes in regurgitant volume, LV&#xD;
      end-diastolic volume index and LA volume measured after one year of treatment with active&#xD;
      drug or placebo. The results of this clinical trial should provide strong evidence regarding&#xD;
      medical treatment of patients with organic MR and define future strategies to minimize&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity of organic MR.&#xD;
