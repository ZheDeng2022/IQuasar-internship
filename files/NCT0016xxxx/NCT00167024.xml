      DNA repair plays a key role in carcinogenesis through the removal and repair of DNA damage&#xD;
      induced by endogenous and environmental sources. The DNA repair system included four&#xD;
      pathways: 1) Base Excision Repair (BER), 2) Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), 3) Mismatch&#xD;
      Repair (MMR) and 4) Double-Strand Break Repair, including homologous recombination pathway&#xD;
      and nonhomologous end-joining repair pathway. Decreased and impaired DNA repair capacity has&#xD;
      been reported in various cancers, however, its effect on prostate cancer still under&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common polymorphisms in DNA repair gene may alter protein function and individual's capacity&#xD;
      to repair damaged DNA, hence, influence the cancer susceptibility. Polymorphic variants of&#xD;
      DNA repair gene have been found to be associated with cancer susceptibility, but rare studies&#xD;
      have investigated their effect on prostate cancer. Since variation in the function of these&#xD;
      DNA repair genes also impact a cancer cell's viability or resistance to treatment, genetic&#xD;
      variants in DNA repair might serve as a valuable biomarker in forcasting the result of cancer&#xD;
      treatment. In fact, some reports have demonstrated the association between polymorphisms of&#xD;
      DNA repair genes and results of treatment of various cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the present study proposal, we focused on several DNA repair genes: X-ray repair cross-&#xD;
      complementing group 1 (XRCC1), human oxoguanine glycosylase I (hOGG1), xeroderma pigmentosum&#xD;
      complementation group D (XPD), hMSH2, hMLH1 and X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3&#xD;
      (XRCC3), which might have relevance in prostate carcinogenesis based on their known&#xD;
      functions. XRCC1 is involved in DNA repair in the base excision pathway, the hOGG1 gene&#xD;
      encodes a DNA glycosylase /apurinic-apyrimidinic lyase that catalyzes the excision and&#xD;
      removal the 8-OH-dG (8-hydroxy- 2-deoxyguanine) - which is a major form of oxidative DNA&#xD;
      damage. The XPD gene codes for a DNA helicase involved in transcription and nucleotide&#xD;
      excision repair. The hMSH2 and hMLH1 are genes involved with mismatch repair. The XRCC3 gene&#xD;
      encoded a protein in the double-strand break homologous recombinational repair pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed study, we will also use PCR-based methods to investigate the effects of DNA&#xD;
      repair gene polymorphisms on prostate cancer susceptibility, pathological grade, disease&#xD;
      stage and clinical outcome. With these efforts, we will further understand the association&#xD;
      between DNA repair gene polymorphism and prostate cancer and provided important information&#xD;
      for screening, prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.&#xD;
