  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research outlined in the BEEP proposal aims to test whether a 12 week exercise program&#xD;
      alone or combined with a 12 session education program will benefit the physical, emotional&#xD;
      and social well being of individuals in early to mid stages of Parkinson's Disease compared&#xD;
      to a Control group and whether these benefits are maintained once the programs are complete&#xD;
      and over the following 9 months.&#xD;

      The BEEP proposal tests whether a 12 week exercise program alone or combined with a 12&#xD;
      session education program will benefit the physical, emotional and social well being of&#xD;
      individuals in early to mid stages of Parkinson's Disease and whether these benefits are&#xD;
      maintained once the programs are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single blind randomized control trial with pretest and posttests after a 3 month&#xD;
      intervention and subsequent follow-up testing at 3 months and 9 months post intervention. The&#xD;
      Intervention groups (group exercise, group exercise and education) will be compared to a&#xD;
      control group and to each other. Each group will have 15 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study compares the interventions and control groups to determine the following health&#xD;
      outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  levels of physical and social activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perceived quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perceived self efficacy for managing chronic neurological disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of variance will be used to test for group differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Interventions: Exercise Group: Two, 75 minute sessions per week for 24 sessions. Program&#xD;
      components include flexibility and strengthening exercises, balance and posture training,&#xD;
      practice of functional tasks and endurance training. Education and Exercise Group: Exercise,&#xD;
      same as for Exercise Group, delivered simultaneously to both intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education: One, 75 minute session per week for 12 sessions at RUH, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  disease process and clinical presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medication use in PD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  benefits of exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  managing movement difficulties and tips for performance of functional activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assistive devices for improved independence and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  driving&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prevention of falls: movement strategies and home modifications to increase safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  speech, swallowing and facial expression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nutrition and weight maintenance, managing constipation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  managing changes in mood &amp; emotions, managing personal relationships&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coping with life changes caused by PD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  relaxation methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring will occur to limit &quot;informal&quot; education that might occur during the exercise&#xD;
      program from this group to the pure Exercise Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: no intervention The proposed study will add to the body of evidence evaluating&#xD;
      the immediate and longer term benefits of group exercise programs for individuals with PD and&#xD;
      will evaluate the benefits gained by adding an education program to an exercise program&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
