  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The normal heart has four chambers. There are two upper (or filling) chambers and are called&#xD;
      the atrium. There are two lower (or pumping) chambers and are called the ventricles. One of&#xD;
      the ventricles pumps blood to the lungs to get oxygen. This oxygenated blood is returned to&#xD;
      the heart then pumped to the rest of the body by the other ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sometimes babies are born with heart defects that only allow one of the lower chambers&#xD;
      (ventricle) to work properly. This means that the one ventricle must pump blood to both the&#xD;
      lungs and to the rest of the body. Babies born with this defect must undergo multiple&#xD;
      surgeries, the first of which is usually done during their first week of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a machine that is FDA approved that can measure how much oxygen is delivered to the&#xD;
      brain. This non-invasive (outside the body) machine uses Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS),&#xD;
      which is similar technology used in pulse oximetry and is routinely used to measure the level&#xD;
      of oxygen in blood. At Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, we typically place the NIRS machine&#xD;
      on the baby in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit immediately after their first surgery to&#xD;
      monitor oxygen delivery to the brain. The monitor has proven to be accurate in this&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now want to know if we can use this monitor to assess oxygen delivery to the brain before&#xD;
      and during a routine heart catheterization prior to the child's second surgery. Once consent&#xD;
      is obtained, we will place a probe on the child's forehead during the pre-catheterization&#xD;
      visit and obtain readings for 5 minutes. The probes are about the size of a quarter and are&#xD;
      self-stick (they look like the kind of leads used to measure the babies heart rate [EKG]).&#xD;
      The machine will be disconnected for the rest of the Pre-catheterization visit, however the&#xD;
      probes will stay on the child's forehead. Once the child is in the catheterization suite, the&#xD;
      machine will be reconnected. A sheath or hollow tube is routinely placed in a blood vessel in&#xD;
      the child's neck or groin for the catheterization. The doctor would place a special catheter&#xD;
      in this sheath that measures oxygen levels in blood continuously. This monitor would be&#xD;
      calibrated by using the results of a blood sample that is routinely drawn from the child's&#xD;
      IV. During the same sampling, an additional 2cc's of blood would be collected to measure the&#xD;
      lactate level. The lactate level is an indicator of how well the child is using oxygen. Once&#xD;
      this monitor is calibrated, data will be collected for 5 minutes to compare it with the NIRS&#xD;
      machine. The special catheter will be removed after the 5-minute time period, and the&#xD;
      catheterization will proceed as usual. The NIRS probes will stay on the child's forehead&#xD;
      during the entire catheterization with the data documented. At the end of the&#xD;
      catheterization, the probes will be removed.&#xD;

      The study will be a prospective evaluation of all single ventricle patients as they undergo&#xD;
      their routine cardiac catheterization prior to second stage palliation. Upon arrival to the&#xD;
      pre-catheterization area, NIRS probes will be placed on the child's forehead and data along&#xD;
      with vital signs will be collected at initial placement, 3 minutes and at 5 minutes. The&#xD;
      monitor will be disconnected as the routine pre-catheterization procedures proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the child is in the catheterization suite, the monitor will be reconnected and the&#xD;
      routine catheterization procedures will proceed. After the standard sheath for&#xD;
      catheterization is placed in the child, a routine superior vena cava saturation (COOX) will&#xD;
      be drawn and the NIRS reading along with routine vital signs will be documented. At the same&#xD;
      time the routine saturation is drawn, an additional 2ccs of blood will be drawn for a lactate&#xD;
      level. At 3 and 5 minutes after the routine saturation, a COOX will be drawn and the NIRS&#xD;
      reading along with vital signs will be documented. The catheterization will continue as&#xD;
      usual. At the end of the case, a final NIRS reading and vital signs will be documented prior&#xD;
      to the removal of the probes.&#xD;
