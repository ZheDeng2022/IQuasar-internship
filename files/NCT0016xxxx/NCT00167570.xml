      The overall long-term goal of this project is the development of a clinically practical&#xD;
      system for rapid prosthetic limb provision that integrates computer-aided design with solid&#xD;
      freeform fabrication techniques. This proposal builds on our previous successful&#xD;
      demonstration of the feasibility of SFF socket fabrication and will address several key&#xD;
      issues that underlie its clinical viability. The specific objectives of the proposed work&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop improved designs for SFF transtibial prosthetic sockets that allow the use of&#xD;
           industry standard pylon mounts and incorporate variable compliance elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the clinical effectiveness of variable wall compliance elements in enhancing&#xD;
           the comfort and fit of transtibial prosthetic sockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the durability and functionality of SFF sockets during extended clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These objectives will be met over a three-year period. The initial phase of the proposed work&#xD;
      will use an iterative engineering design - modeling - evaluation process to develop variable&#xD;
      compliance elements and an industry standard pylon mount adapter. During the second phase of&#xD;
      the proposed work, clinical evaluations of SFF prosthetic sockets will be studied. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of variable compliant elements in enhancing comfort and fit will be determined&#xD;
      using a within subject case comparison study of SFF sockets with conventional laminated&#xD;
      sockets. Durability of SFF sockets that incorporate an industry standard pylon mounting&#xD;
      system will be determined during a 12-month clinical field trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Successful rehabilitation for the majority of lower extremity amputees includes prosthetic&#xD;
      limb fitting and training. Critical to the success of prosthetic fitting is a comfortable,&#xD;
      well fitting socket. Accomplishing this remains a clinical challenge with residual limb pain&#xD;
      and socket discomfort affecting 20-55% of lower limb amputees. Achieving an acceptable socket&#xD;
      fit using conventional prosthetic techniques requires individual custom molding and&#xD;
      fabrication in a labor intensive, costly process. Alternative methods of fabricating&#xD;
      prosthetic sockets that can improve efficiency in prosthetic provision, enhance comfort and&#xD;
      fit, or reduce cost are needed to ensure the continued optimal rehabilitation of the amputee.&#xD;
      This project will continue the development of a new promising method of socket fabrication&#xD;
      using solid freeform fabrication (SFF) based on selective laser sintering (SLS) technology.&#xD;
      SFF allows the direct manufacture of a prosthetic socket without the intermediate molds and&#xD;
      laminating process required with conventional techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;

      system for rapid prosthetic limb provision that integrates computer-aided design with solid&#xD;
      freeform fabrication techniques. This proposal builds on our previous successful&#xD;
