      The objective of this study is to assess the TBE antibody persistence approximately three&#xD;
      years after administration of a TBE booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior in&#xD;
      children who received either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL TicoVac for their primary vaccination series&#xD;
      in Study 146A.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female children who participated in Study 146A if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they and/or their parents/legal guardians understand the nature of the study and agree&#xD;
             to its provisions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  written informed consent is available from the child (according to age and capacity of&#xD;
             understanding) and the parents/legal guardians&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they received the complete 3-immunization primary vaccination series with either 0.5&#xD;
             ml or 0.25 ml TicoVac in Study 146A&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they received FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior for their first booster vaccination&#xD;
             approximately 3 to 4 years after their third vaccination in Study IMAG-146A&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who received any further TBE vaccination since their first TBE booster&#xD;
             vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of infection with, or vaccination against, other flaviviruses&#xD;
             (e.g. dengue fever, yellow fever and/or japanese B encephalitis virus) since their&#xD;
             third vaccination in Study 146A&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have suffered from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or have undergone&#xD;
             a form of treatment (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) that can be expected to influence&#xD;
             immunological functions within 30 days before and after their first TBE booster&#xD;
             vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been known to be HIV positive (a special HIV test is not required&#xD;
             for the purpose of the study) since their third vaccination in Study 146A&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 30 days of&#xD;
             study entry&#xD;
