  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Adolescent Impact is to develop and evaluate a developmentally&#xD;
      targeted intervention designed to minimize secondary transmission risk behavior and enhance&#xD;
      adherence to care and treatment. The intervention is delivered in 12 sessions (five&#xD;
      one-to-one, 7 group) over a 3 month period of time. Intervention is delivered in addition to&#xD;
      standard of care treatment at the participant's respective clinic. Participants are&#xD;
      randomized to either an intervention or control arm; the control group receives standard of&#xD;
      care treatment and control group participants are offered the Adolescent Impact intervention&#xD;
      following the completion of the nine-month follow up. It is hypothesized that compared to&#xD;
      control group participants, intervention group participants will evidence (1) improved or&#xD;
      stable virologic and/or immunologic status, mediated by (a) adherence to prescribed&#xD;
      antiretroviral medication and/or (b) adherence to HIV care appointments, and (2)&#xD;
      reduction/minimization of secondary transmission risk behaviors to include (a) unprotected&#xD;
      sex and/or needle sharing, and (b) sexual and drug use behaviors that increase risk for&#xD;
      unprotected sex.&#xD;
