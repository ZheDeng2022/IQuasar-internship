  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with large or otherwise complex renal calculi are commonly treated by percutaneous&#xD;
      nephrolithotomy (PNL; PERC). PERC requires the creation of an approximately 10 mm channel&#xD;
      through the renal parenchyma, into the intra-renal collecting system, in order to effect&#xD;
      stone fragmentation and extraction. Although the nephrostomy tract is confined to a small&#xD;
      fraction of the renal parenchyma (approximately 1%), the trauma associated with the creation&#xD;
      of the tract will affect blood flow and oxygen delivery to regions beyond the immediate site&#xD;
      of injury. It is possible that this could result in a significant functional renal&#xD;
      impairment. There are several reports describing the effect of PERC on renal function, but&#xD;
      interpretation of these studies is difficult, due to a lack of uniformity in patient&#xD;
      selection and variability in the timing of peri-operative evaluation. Recent data from the&#xD;
      investigators' lab, obtained from a porcine model, suggest that, acutely, PERC causes a&#xD;
      significant decrease in renal function as measured by para amino hippurate (PAH) clearance.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine, in a rigorous and standardized fashion, the acute&#xD;
      effects of PERC on renal function, as measured by nuclear renography.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PERC is a commonly used technique to treat patients harboring large or complex renal calculi.&#xD;
      PERC is a particularly effective procedure, and has been associated with few complications.&#xD;
      However, the effect PERC has on renal functional parameters is not well defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of PERC on renal function has been examined in an animal model by several groups.&#xD;
      In one porcine model, the baseline renal function, as defined by PAH and creatinine&#xD;
      clearance, was compared to that measured at one month post-procedure. No acute data were&#xD;
      recorded, but the authors did note that although there was no significant change in renal&#xD;
      function at the one month follow-up point, there was a significant amount of renal scarring&#xD;
      present. This finding of significant renal scarring following PERC in an animal model has&#xD;
      been corroborated by others. One group has studied a canine model, and detected a significant&#xD;
      diminution of renal function (defined by creatinine clearance) at 48 hours following PERC,&#xD;
      and at 6 weeks following PERC renal function returned to normal. In human subjects undergoing&#xD;
      PERC, percutaneous tracts have also been associated with renal scarring. These studies, both&#xD;
      retrospective case series, did not capture strictly defined measures of renal function, such&#xD;
      as creatinine clearance, but rather compared pre- and post-procedure serum creatinine as a&#xD;
      surrogate for renal function. No significant change in serum creatinine was identified in&#xD;
      either study, but blood collections were performed at variable times, in uncontrolled&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuclear renography is an imaging technique that records renal functional parameters. There&#xD;
      has been only one report of nuclear renographic assessment of the effect of PERC on renal&#xD;
      function. This report was an uncontrolled study, and the renograms were performed at a median&#xD;
      of 22 days post-procedure. At this time interval, it is not possible to derive any&#xD;
      conclusions regarding the acute effects of PERC on renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently demonstrated in a porcine model that PERC is associated&#xD;
      acutely with significant deleterious effects on renal function. Following routine PERC,&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) decline by 50% in both the&#xD;
      treated and the untreated kidney and return to normal when measured at 72 &amp; 74 hours (n=3&#xD;
      pigs). Sodium excretion, however, was markedly below baseline at 72 and 74 hours in 2 of the&#xD;
      3 pigs. PAH extraction, a measure of the efficiency of renal tubular secretion of organic&#xD;
      anions, averaged 43.5 ± 9.7% and 42.6 ± 14.1% at 72 and 74 hours for the 3 pigs. These values&#xD;
      are substantially below the baseline value of 80.4 ± 4.0% measured in sham-PNL pigs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the examination of the effect of PERC on renal function has been restricted to gross&#xD;
      measures of function as defined by serum creatinine, and radionuclide studies performed at a&#xD;
      sub-acute interval following PNL, often without differential measurements or controls.&#xD;
      Importantly, the investigators' recent studies in a porcine model demonstrate that PERC may&#xD;
      cause significant alterations in renal function. There is a need to define in a rigorous&#xD;
      fashion the effect PERC has on renal blood flow and renal function. If a deleterious effect&#xD;
      is identified, future efforts can be focused on minimizing this insult.&#xD;
