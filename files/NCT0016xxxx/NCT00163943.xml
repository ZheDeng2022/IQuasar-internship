  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An abdominal distribution of fat is associated with the greatest heart disease risk, because&#xD;
      commonly, several risk factors of metabolic origin (high blood pressure, unfavourable&#xD;
      cholesterol profile, elevated blood sugar, impaired insulin action) cluster in these&#xD;
      individuals. When this occurs the condition is called the 'metabolic syndrome' (MetS). The&#xD;
      cause of the MetS is yet to be fully elucidated. Increased activity of the nervous system&#xD;
      resulting in enhanced release of the stress hormone 'norepinephrine', may be one mechanism by&#xD;
      which adverse cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae of the MetS might be mediated. Dietary&#xD;
      weight loss, and exercise are first-line treatments for the MetS and provide an opportunity&#xD;
      to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in this high risk&#xD;
      group. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the effects of these lifestyle factors&#xD;
      on the nervous system. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether active weight loss ('negative&#xD;
      energy balance') or a stable lower weight (weight loss maintenance) is more important in&#xD;
      modifying MetS components and nervous system activity. The aims of the proposed project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether dietary weight loss in combination with aerobic exercise is more&#xD;
           beneficial than dietary weight loss alone in reducing nervous system activity and&#xD;
           improving metabolic and cardiovascular parameters in middle-aged men and women with&#xD;
           abdominal obesity and the MetS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether weight loss maintenance four months after active weight loss is&#xD;
           associated with a preservation of clinical benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study biological determinants of successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic dysfunction, namely increased sympathetic drive and reduced vagal tone, may&#xD;
      participate in the pathogenesis and complications of the MetS. Weight loss and aerobic&#xD;
      exercise are first-line therapeutic strategies that are known to be beneficial in lowering&#xD;
      blood pressure, enhancing insulin action and preventing the development of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      However, there is a paucity of data regarding their effects on sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      (SNS) activity. In a recently completed Pilot study in 22 MS subjects we demonstrated that&#xD;
      moderate dietary weight loss (7% of initial body weight) is associated with marked reductions&#xD;
      in whole-body norepinephrine spillover rate (by 43%, P= 0.005) and muscle sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      activity (MSNA, by 15%, P=0.01). In the proposed project we wish to extend these observations&#xD;
      by evaluating the clinical benefits of aerobic exercise and weight loss maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether dietary weight loss in combination with aerobic exercise (WL + EX)&#xD;
           is more beneficial than dietary weight loss alone (WL) in reducing SNS activity and&#xD;
           improving cardiovascular and metabolic parameters in middle aged men and women with&#xD;
           abdominal obesity and a diagnosis of the MetS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the determinants of achieved weight loss, with a focus on the roles of&#xD;
           SNS activity, b2-adrenoceptor polymorphisms, resting metabolic rate, plasma and&#xD;
           interstitial adipocytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether clinical benefits during active weight loss (negative energy&#xD;
           balance) are sustained after a 4-month weight loss maintenance program and to&#xD;
           investigate the determinants of successful weight loss maintenance (as above).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the inter-relationships between SNS activity, insulin sensitivity, metabolic,&#xD;
           anthropometric and haemodynamic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary men and women (n= 66) aged 45 to 65 years with a body mass index of 26 to 39 kg/m2,&#xD;
      who fulfil Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for the MetS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, controlled, parallel design comparison of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. WL;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. WL + EX; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control (no treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations will be performed at baseline, and at the end of 3-month lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention, and a 4-month weight-maintenance program (WL and WL + EX groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diets:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified version of the 'DASH' diet will be used at different caloric levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bicycle riding, performed for 40 minutes on alternate days at a moderate intensity of 65% of&#xD;
      maximum heart rate. Compliance will be assessed by VO2 max measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SNS activity measurements (multiunit and single-unit microneurographic recordings of MSNA,&#xD;
      whole-body norepinephrine spillover, and abdominal adipose tissue and skeletal muscle&#xD;
      interstitial noradrenaline concentration determined by microdialysis) will be made before and&#xD;
      during an oral glucose tolerance test, together with haemodynamic (calf blood flow measured&#xD;
      by venous occlusion plethysmography) measurements. Changes in fat mass will be quantitated by&#xD;
      DEXA scan. Metabolic measurements will include resting metabolic rate, insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      lipid profile, non-esterified fatty acids, plasma and interstitial adipokines/cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will provide novel information about whole-body and regional sympathetic&#xD;
      activity; the determinants of sympathetic activity and the relative clinical benefits of&#xD;
      active weight loss, weight loss maintenance and aerobic exercise in middle-aged MetS&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
