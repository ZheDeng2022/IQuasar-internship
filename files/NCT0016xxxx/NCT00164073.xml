  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine gene expression profiles by DNA microarray in&#xD;
      patients who are responders and non-responders to interferon and ribavirin treatment for&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV). Genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis and mediators of the&#xD;
      Th-1 lymphocyte response will be looked for. It is hoped that genetic targets for future more&#xD;
      effective and less toxic treatments will be identified.&#xD;

      Background and Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic HCV infection often follows a progressive course over many years, and can ultimately&#xD;
      result in cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation or hepatocellular carcinoma. The&#xD;
      decision to treat patients with chronic hepatitis C infection is based upon several factors&#xD;
      including the natural history and stage of the disease and the efficacy and adverse effects&#xD;
      related to therapy. As a general rule patients who are considered for treatment should have&#xD;
      histologic and virologic evidence of chronic infection (i.e., HCV RNA detectable in serum)&#xD;
      and an elevated serum ALT (1). Combination treatment with Interferon and Ribavirin is&#xD;
      currently the best available treatment for chronic HCV infection. However, response to&#xD;
      therapy is suboptimal and there are several side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects seen during therapy of patients with Interferon and Ribavirin include flu-like&#xD;
      symptoms mostly due to interferon, cytopenias and haemolysis induced by Ribavirin.&#xD;
      Psychiatric changes due to interferon, occur in up to 50% and thyroid abnormalities requiring&#xD;
      therapy occur in about 1 to 5% treated with interferon. Autoimmune disease and retinal&#xD;
      haemorrhages have also been reported. In addition, combination therapy is associated with&#xD;
      significant risks in patients with renal dysfunction, cardiac disease and haemolytic anaemias&#xD;
      as treatment may be associated with anaemia. Patients who are depressed or suicidal should&#xD;
      also be excluded (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this point little DNA microarray work done has been done with HCV. However, what work has&#xD;
      been done is interesting and shows promise. In studies comparing Hepatitis B (HBV) with&#xD;
      Hepatitis C, HBV infection was found to express genes predominantly involved in inflammation.&#xD;
      In contrast, with HCV infection anti-inflammatory genes were found to be expressed (3). In&#xD;
      another study HCV associated cirrhosis has been shown to be characterized by proinflammatory,&#xD;
      pro-fibrotic and proapoptotic gene expression profiles (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression of HCV infection by gene expression analysis of liver biopsies in acutely&#xD;
      infected chimpanzees that develop persistent infection, transient viral clearance, or&#xD;
      sustained clearance has been examined. Transient and sustained viral clearance were uniquely&#xD;
      associated with induction of IFN-gamma-induced genes and other genes involved in antigen&#xD;
      processing and presentation and the adaptive immune response. The study revealed genome-wide&#xD;
      transcriptional changes that reflect the establishment, spread, and control of infection, and&#xD;
      they reveal potentially unique antiviral programs associated with clearance of HCV infection&#xD;
      (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-vitro studies in the human cell line Huh7 has shown that on exposure of the cells to&#xD;
      Interferon 50 genes were up-regulated by at least twofold in control clones, whereas&#xD;
      induction of 9 of the 50 genes was significantly reduced in those Huh7 clones expressing&#xD;
      NS5A. Interferon-alpha activity has been found to be inhibited by the HCV protein NS5A. The&#xD;
      strongest effect of NS5A on Interferon response was observed on the OAS-p69 gene with reduced&#xD;
      expression. In addition, Huh7 cells expressing NS5A showed an up-regulation of interleukin-8&#xD;
      a proinflammatory cytokine. As a result this study postulated a mechanism for NS5A mediated&#xD;
      interferon resistance (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study microarray gene profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from&#xD;
      hepatitis C patients treated with Interferon-alpha was performed. 88 genes directly relating&#xD;
      to functions of immune cells were up-regulated, including genes involved in antigen&#xD;
      processing and presentation, T-cell activation, lymphocyte trafficking, and effector&#xD;
      functions, suggesting that Interferon-alpha up-regulates multiple genes involving different&#xD;
      aspects of immune responses to enhance immunity against hepatitis C virus (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, treatment for HCV still has a significant non-responder rate and is associated&#xD;
      with side effects which limits many individuals from receiving treatment. Already molecular&#xD;
      profiling by DNA microarrays has identified potential genetic targets which may have a role&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of HCV-associated hepatitis and more importantly possible targets which&#xD;
      have a role in response to Interferon treatment. The work proposed here hopes to build on&#xD;
      this body of knowledge and may lead to improved treatment modalities for HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval from the Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee will be obtained and subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited via the Alfred Hospital's Hepatitis Clinics. Informed consent for the study will be&#xD;
      obtained after its purpose is explained verbally and via a plain English statement. Informed&#xD;
      consent will also include consent for liver biopsies. Initially, a pilot study will be&#xD;
      undertaken in which only one subject will be recruited to both the experimental and control&#xD;
      arm of the study. Once the results from this pilot study have been analysed the study will be&#xD;
      expanded to encompass a greater number of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsies will be performed on the following groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HCV positive patients prior to commencement and at the end of treatment with either&#xD;
           standard or pegylated Interferon plus Ribavirin. This group will be subdivided into&#xD;
           responders and non-responders to treatment. Core liver biopsies under ultra-sound&#xD;
           guidance are already routinely performed on this group prior to the commencement of&#xD;
           treatment. For the purpose of this study non-responders to combination therapy are those&#xD;
           individuals who remain HCV-RNA positive at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control population consisting of patients undergoing laparotomy for diseases not&#xD;
           involving the liver. These biopsies would be obtained at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enough liver tissue (approximately 1-2 mg) will be obtained to isolate messenger RNA (mRNA)&#xD;
      by oligo dT chromatography. Once isolated the mRNA will be reverse transcribed to&#xD;
      complementary DNA (cDNA). This cDNA will then be labeled with a fluorescent reporter&#xD;
      molecule. Hybridization of the labeled liver cDNA will then occur with the DNA microarray. It&#xD;
      is envisaged that the microarray will be commercially obtained and consist of human cDNA.&#xD;
      There is enough DNA on the microarray that two lots of labeled liver cDNA with different&#xD;
      fluorescent markers (i.e. red and green) can be hybridized to the array at the same time&#xD;
      without any interference. The following hybridizations would then be set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporter molecule 1: HCV +ve group. cDNA Reporter molecule 2: HCV -ve group. cDNA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hybridization 1 Responder to Rx. Before Rx Control cDNA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hybridization 2 Responder to Rx. After Rx Control cDNA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hybridization 3 Non responder to Rx. Before Rx Control cDNA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hybridization 4 Non responder to Rx. After Rx Control cDNA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rx = treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hybridized array will then be scanned and commercially available software packages will&#xD;
      be used to help in the interpretation of the results (8). Genes or groups of genes of&#xD;
      particular interest include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pro-inflammatory response genes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Th-1 cytokines such as Gamma Interferon (IFN), Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Tumour&#xD;
                Necrosis Factor-beta (TNF-ÃŸ). Th1 cytokines promote production of opsonizing&#xD;
                antibodies (e.g., IgG1) and induction of cellular cytotoxicity and macrophage&#xD;
                activation. Th1 responses are prominent in the defence against pathogens which&#xD;
                replicate intracellularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) and TNF receptor family of molecules which are&#xD;
                strongly pro-inflammatory and involved in immune regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Interleukin-12 (IL-12) which is a key cytokine that protects the host from viral&#xD;
                and microbial infection. It links the innate and acquired arms of the immune&#xD;
                system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Interleukin-18 (IL-18) which has been shown to act as a chemoattractant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Genes involved in a pro-fibrotic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) which causes fibroblast proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Procollagen I and II.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PDGF beta receptor over-expression have&#xD;
                been linked to development of fibrotic disease as well as cancer and&#xD;
                atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Matrix metalloproteinases play a pivotal role in angiogenesis and have a role in&#xD;
                tumorigenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fibroblast Growth Factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) which is known for its angiogenic&#xD;
                properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Connective tissue growth factor which stimulates collagen production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, novel genes previously unidentified, with differential expression will be looked&#xD;
      for and will be characterized.&#xD;
