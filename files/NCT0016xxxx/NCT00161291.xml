    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine pathological response to a maximum of 18 weeks of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy using a combination of letrozole and Bevacizumab in post-menopausal women&#xD;
      with pathologically confirmed invasive ductal cancer or invasive lobular cancer of the breast&#xD;
      whose tumors are hormone positive.&#xD;

      This is an open label, single arm, and Phase II study of the combination of Letrozole and&#xD;
      Bevacizumab in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Patients meeting the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and who have signed the consent form will start Letrozole 2.5 mg by mouth a day and&#xD;
      Bevacizumab 15 mg per Kg IV every 3 weeks for 18 weeks (24 weeks if still responding at week&#xD;
      18 if approved by the PI). After neoadjuvant therapy, participants will undergo surgical&#xD;
      treatment and will receive adjuvant therapy according to the treating physician.&#xD;
