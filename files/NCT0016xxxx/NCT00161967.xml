    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the seropersistence of TBE antibodies in children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged 1 to 15 years at the time of their first vaccination, 24 months and 34&#xD;
      months after completion of primary immunization with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml (3 vaccinations&#xD;
      during the predecessor study 209), as well as the immune response to a booster vaccination&#xD;
      with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml or FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml administered 36 months after the third&#xD;
      vaccination (in Study 209).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendment of October 2006: The study has been prolonged for children and adolescents&#xD;
      who still showed highly positive TBE virus antibody concentrations at approximately 3 years&#xD;
      after the third vaccination and therefore did not receive a booster vaccination at this time&#xD;
      point. Further follow-up of TBE antibody persistence is now included for these subjects at 46&#xD;
      and 58 months after the third vaccination (in Study 209), as well as a booster vaccination&#xD;
      offered at either 48 or 60 months after the third vaccination (in Study 209), depending on&#xD;
      individual TBE antibody levels.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  They showed an ELISA concentration &gt; 126 VIE U/ml and / or a NT titer &gt;=10 after the&#xD;
             third vaccination in Baxter study 209&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They or their parents / legal guardians agree to keep a Subject Diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have a history of infection with or vaccination against other flaviviruses (Dengue&#xD;
             fever, yellow fever and / or Japanese B-encephalitis virus) since their third&#xD;
             vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml&#xD;

        vaccinated until their body temperature returns to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who received any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to the booster vaccination will&#xD;
        not be vaccinated until an interval of four weeks has passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If subjects received antipyretics within 4 hours prior to the intended TBE vaccination, the&#xD;
