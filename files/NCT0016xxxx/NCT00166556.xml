  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter open-label single arm trial in which recipients of liver&#xD;
      allograft will receive uniform immunosuppressive induction and maintenance regimens.&#xD;
      Participants with end stage liver disease who meets the entry criteria will be consented and&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive Campath-1H and maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus therapy.&#xD;
      After one year of tacrolimus therapy, an assessment of the immunologic status including blood&#xD;
      gene expression and geno-race studies will be performed which will include studies on the&#xD;
      liver graft biopsy. At this time, patients will be selected to undergo immunosuppressive&#xD;
      withdrawal. This will be made on an individual basis with definitive inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive&#xD;
      regimens comprising Campath-1H induction followed by maintenance immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
      with tacrolimus on allograft survival. However, secondary objectives will be to assess&#xD;
      withdrawing tacrolimus after Campath-1H induction in an immune depletion and subsequent&#xD;
      immune reconstitution. This study will evaluate whether a combination of anti-rejection&#xD;
      medications (Campath-1H and tacrolimus) can prevent rejection and allow the body to develop&#xD;
      tolerance to the transplanted liver.&#xD;
