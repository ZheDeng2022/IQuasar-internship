  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quadriceps retraining, especially the vastus medialis oblique muscle strengthening, plays an&#xD;
      important role in clinical management of patellofemoral pain syndrome. Vastus medialis&#xD;
      oblique muscle roles as a dynamic stabilizer during the functional knee movement. It can&#xD;
      generate a medial pulling force to patella against the lateral pulled by vastus lateralis.&#xD;
      Thus it improves the patellofemoral joint compression force, reduces the knee pain, increases&#xD;
      functional abilities, and patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Could vastus medialis oblique be isolation by way of specific exercise without or minimize&#xD;
      the recruitment of vastus lateralisï¼Ÿ According to human anatomy, vastus medialis oblique&#xD;
      muscle origin from hip adductor magnus tendon, thus if incorporate hip adduction with knee&#xD;
      extension as a selective means of training needs more researches. However, literature search&#xD;
      shows that there are only a lot of EMG studies, so we need further clinical research to prove&#xD;
      the treatment effect of this kind of strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the treatment effects of hip adduction combine&#xD;
      knee extension exercise in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. We use muscle&#xD;
      morphology of quadriceps muscle, pain, and functional abilities as the main outcome measures.&#xD;
      Besides, we will make further compare with traditional knee extension exercise. The first&#xD;
      hypothesis of the study is that patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome will get&#xD;
      improvement in muscle morphology of quadriceps muscle, pain, and functional abilities after&#xD;
      hip adduction combine knee extension exercise training . The second hypothesis is that&#xD;
      patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome who receive hip adduction combine knee extension&#xD;
      exercise training will get more improvement in muscle morphology of quadriceps muscle, pain,&#xD;
      and functional abilities than patients who receive traditional knee extension exercise&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome who less than 50 years old will be included in&#xD;
      this study, and randomly distributed to hip adduction combine knee extension exercise group,&#xD;
      knee extension exercise group, and control group. Following 8 weeks exercise training by an&#xD;
      experimental physical therapist, ultrasound measurement of muscle thickness and&#xD;
      cross-sectional area of vastus medialis oblique muscle, vastus lateralis muscle, and rectus&#xD;
      femoris muscle component of quadriceps, 10cm-VAS patellofemoral joint pain evaluation,&#xD;
      including VAS-U, VAS-W, and VAS-activity, and Lysholm scale scores will be measured. A&#xD;
      two-way mixed ANOVA will be used to compare the mean differences between theses three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is aimed to provide an clinical evidence for evidence-based practice of&#xD;
      rehabilitation in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.&#xD;
