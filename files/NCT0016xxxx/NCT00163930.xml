  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of a new post-operative pain relief program&#xD;
      for women who have undergone uterine artery embolisation (UAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      UAE is performed by an interventional radiologist as a treatment of uterine fibroids&#xD;
      (non-cancerous growths of the uterus.) UAE can be associated with a high level of&#xD;
      post-procedural pain and it is the purpose of this study to evaluate a new relief regimen for&#xD;
      dealing with this acute pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two treatment groups into which patients will be randomly assigned. One will&#xD;
      receive the current post-operative therapy (dose-on-demand) and the other will receive the&#xD;
      new therapy (pre-emptive dosing). Otherwise patients will receive standard management&#xD;
      protocol for this procedure. Only patients that are scheduled for UAE will be enrolled (up to&#xD;
      40 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new treatment involves giving the patient their morphine dose orally and sixty minutes&#xD;
      before the procedure begins (pre-emptive dosing) as opposed to current standard treatment&#xD;
      which involves giving the patient a dose of morphine intravenously once they feel pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information to be collected directly from patients includes pain and nausea levels, indicated&#xD;
      on a visual scale (a 10 centimetre line showing a spectrum of no pain to worst pain&#xD;
      imaginable) as well as their opinions of the effectiveness of the pain relief program and the&#xD;
      procedure itself. This information is to be collected immediately post-procedure and at 2, 4,&#xD;
      6 and 24 hours post procedure. Each VAS will take the patient approximately 20 seconds to&#xD;
      complete. Information about concurrent medication and procedure complications, post-operative&#xD;
      vomiting and respiratory depression will be collected from the patient's history.&#xD;

      Post operative Pain Management in Paitents Undergoing Uterine Artery Embolisation for&#xD;
      Symptomatic Leiomyomata&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol (Ver 2.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Research Question Does pre emptive morphine dosing help reduce acute post operative pain&#xD;
      (as expressed on a visual analogue scale, VAS) and/or post operative opioid use in patients&#xD;
      undergoing uterine artery embolisation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Enrolment Patients are enrolled by Prof Ken Thomson or Dr Stuart Lyon during a planning&#xD;
      consultation with each woman. They will be required to sign a consent form if they choose to&#xD;
      participate at this point. 3 photocopies of this consent form will be taken, with one copy to&#xD;
      go with: the patient; the history; and the data file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Exclusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the following should be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contrast allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy to one or more of the treatment drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of alcoholism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed hepatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute pelvic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endometrial carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undiagnosed pelvic mass&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non English speaking patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who require post op non opioid analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Randomisation and blinding The placebo and oxycontinSR tablets have been pre randomised&#xD;
      by the clinical trials pharmacy on LG level (Ann Mak).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Pre medications The trial drug (oxycontin) will be ordered on a yellow clinical trial&#xD;
      prescription form. A day before the patient arrives, this form should be faxed to the&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Pharmacy (Fax No 3305). A registered nurse from the ward or researcher should&#xD;
      then pick up the drugs from the Clinical Trials Pharmacy on LG level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other non trial medications should be either already on the ward or should be ordered via&#xD;
      pharmacy as per normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial drugs and pre medications will all be written up on a prepared drug chart which&#xD;
      will be given to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ward staff will administer the drugs as prescribed on the drug chart 60 +/- 20 minutes&#xD;
      prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences in the treatment is shown on the following table. Dose on demand treatment&#xD;
      Pre emptive treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 hour before surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paracetamol 1.5g&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temazepam 20mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo OxycontinSR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Piroxicam (Feldene) 20mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ondansetron 8mg 1 hour before surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paracetamol 1.5g&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temazepam 20mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OxycontinSR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Piroxicam (Feldene) 20mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ondansetron 8mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCA morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1mg dose with 5 minute lockout Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCA morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1mg dose with 5 minute lockout Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endone 5-10mg oral 4/24 prn Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endone 5-10mg oral 4/24 prn&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ward staff will be blinded as to which treatment the patient receives since the pre meds&#xD;
      are have been randomised and blinded by the pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Post op Pain and nausea measurements will be taken at 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours using the&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire sheets. This can be done either by the researchers,&#xD;
      or if time permits, ward staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug related side effects are also recorded, such as respiratory depression and vomiting and&#xD;
      it is therefore important for these to be carefully documented in the patient's history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Deviations from pain management protocol There may be instances where the PCA does not&#xD;
      deliver adequate pain relief. It may be necessary in these cases to deviate from the pain&#xD;
      management protocol for the comfort of the patient. This does not necessarily exclude the&#xD;
      patient from the study. However, the way in which the data is interpreted once non opioid&#xD;
      analgesia is given should be done with caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviations should be instituted when:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obvious drug related side effects are evident (e.g. respiratory depression, narcosis);&#xD;
           or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain is not at an acceptable level at 6 hours post procedure; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain is not at a level in keeping with routine post UAE pain as reported by nursing or&#xD;
           medical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please notify Dr Stuart Lyon or Dr Jeff Tam (ex 3606) if the Pain Team needs to intervene for&#xD;
      these patients. They will then assess whether or not the patient will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients are deemed ready for discharge they need to take home a discharge pack with&#xD;
      some questionnaires for them to fill out at home. These should be done at 24 hours post&#xD;
      procedure. The pack will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall pain relief rating VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UAE procedure rating VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instructions sheet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reply paid, self addressed envelope&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please check that the 2, 4 and 6 hour questionnaires have been filled out before the patient&#xD;
      is discharged, and that they leave with the discharge pack. Once completed, the&#xD;
      questionnaires should be sent back to the Radiology Research Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients will be discharged within 24 hours of the procedure. In the event that the&#xD;
      patient stays in hospital longer than 24 hours, then the discharge pack should be completed&#xD;
      at the 24 hour mark. The completed data sheets should then be sent back to the Radiology&#xD;
      Research Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the data sheets are not received within 2 weeks of discharge, the researchers should make&#xD;
      a phone call to the patient to enquire whether they have been completed and to answer any&#xD;
      questions the patient may have.&#xD;
