  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind placebo controlled pilot trial will test the hypothesis that prazosin, an&#xD;
      alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduced alcohol consumption and alcohol craving in&#xD;
      alcohol dependent individuals without Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The intervention&#xD;
      period is six weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the project is to determine whether prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, decreases alcohol consumption and/or the subjective experience of alcohol craving&#xD;
      in individuals without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who are seeking treatment for&#xD;
      alcohol dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are: (1) Subjects treated with prazosin will report fewer drinking days&#xD;
      and fewer drinks per drinking day than subjects treated with placebo, (2) subjects treated&#xD;
      with prazosin will report decreased craving for alcohol as compared to subjects in the&#xD;
      placebo condition, and (3) prazosin will be well-tolerated at the proposed dosage by subjects&#xD;
      in the prazosin condition compared to subjects in the placebo condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of prazosin in subjects&#xD;
      who are dependent on alcohol and have used alcohol within the last 30 days prior to&#xD;
      randomization. The treatment phase will last 6 weeks and will include 40 subjects; 20&#xD;
      randomized to each experimental condition (prazosin and placebo). Participants in both the&#xD;
      groups will be provided the same behavioral treatment for alcohol dependence throughout the&#xD;
      course of the study. Participants in both groups will also use daily Interactive Voice&#xD;
      Response (IVR) symptom monitoring technology to track daily fluctuations in alcohol use and&#xD;
      craving, as well as medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Addiction Treatment Center (ATC) at VAPSHCS, Seattle&#xD;
      division.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include 40 alcohol-dependent adults presenting for chemical dependency&#xD;
      treatment at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS) Addiction Treatment Center as&#xD;
      well as subjects recruited from the general public via advertisements in local weekly&#xD;
      newspapers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: Once potential study participants have undergone an initial screen to&#xD;
      insure basic eligibility they will provide informed consent and will undergo a 2-hour&#xD;
      baseline assessment that will include completing a diagnostic interview, paper-and-pencil&#xD;
      packet of measures, and providing urine and blood specimens. After completion of these&#xD;
      assessments, a final determination will be made within three business days as to whether the&#xD;
      potential participant meets inclusion but not exclusion criteria. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      then be randomized to one of the two treatment groups. The participants will be prompted&#xD;
      three times each day by text messaging pages reminding them to take their study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The behavioral treatment to be used in this study is the Medication Management protocol&#xD;
      adapted from the procedure used in Project COMBINE. A clinical rescue strategy will be in&#xD;
      place such that any participants who evidence severe clinical deterioration including&#xD;
      consuming more than 140 standard equivalent drinks in any 7 day period will be removed from&#xD;
      the protocol and offered inpatient treatment at VA PSHCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first two weeks of the study, participants will have twice-weekly orthostatic&#xD;
      vital sign and adverse events monitoring by the study nurse or physician, then weekly&#xD;
      thereafter. All serious or unexpected adverse events will be reported to the FDA and UW Human&#xD;
      Subjects Committee in accordance with requirements. When participants have completed their&#xD;
      medication treatment at 6 weeks post-randomization, they will repeat all the baseline&#xD;
      measures and laboratory tests (urine and blood samples will be requested) except for the PCL&#xD;
      and the California Verbal Learning Test.&#xD;

    <description>Pharmacological treatment: In order to prevent the possible side effect of first-dose hypotension, all participants will receive only 1mg of study medication or placebo nightly for the first two days of study participation. Titration will proceed according to the following schedule:&#xD;
Prazosin Dosing: 9 AM 3 PM 9 PM Days 1-2 1 mg (one capsule) Days 3-4 1 mg 1 mg 1 mg Days 5-7 2 mg 2 mg 2 mg Day 8-10 2 mg 2 mg 6 mg Day 11-14 4 mg 4 mg 6 mg Day 15-42 4 mg 4 mg 8 mg</description>
