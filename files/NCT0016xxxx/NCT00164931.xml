      A prospective randomized study to compare the adjunctive use of high dose omeprazole infusion&#xD;
      against scheduled second endoscopy in prevention of peptic ulcer rebleeding after therapeutic&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have previously performed a prospective randomized controlled trial on the effect of&#xD;
      scheduled second endoscopy upon peptic ulcer rebleeding. We found that the rate of recurrent&#xD;
      bleeding was significantly reduced from 13.8% to 5% with a scheduled second endoscopy and&#xD;
      appropriate therapy performed within 24 hours after initial hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When we look at the studies in the literature employing proton pump inhibitors (PPI) infusion&#xD;
      after primary endoscopic therapy, we found that there was also a significant reduction in the&#xD;
      rate of rebleeding, the number of operation performed and the transfusion requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controversy exists regarding the optimal strategy to minimize recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding&#xD;
      after successful endoscopic hemostasis. A recent cost-effective analysis on various&#xD;
      strategies showed that selective scheduled second endoscopy strategy was probably the most&#xD;
      effective and least expensive to prevent recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conduct a randomized trial on the cost-effectiveness of using omeprazole infusion vs&#xD;
      scheduled second endoscopy on the management of bleeding peptic ulcers.&#xD;
