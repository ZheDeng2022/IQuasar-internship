      This randomized, controlled study will evaluate the effectiveness of a health management (HM)&#xD;
      and supported rehabilitation (SR) intervention for 180 older persons (age 50+) with serious&#xD;
      mental illness. We will address the following specific aims and hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1- To compare the effectiveness of SR/HM to UC in improving independent living&#xD;
      skills and health management. We hypothesize that compared to older individuals with SMI&#xD;
      receiving UC, individuals receiving SR/HM will have better independent living skills and&#xD;
      health management, evidenced by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Better community living skills and better social skills based on performance-based&#xD;
           measures and self-reports of functioning, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Better medication management skills based on performance-based and self-report measures&#xD;
           and greater use of preventive and routine primary health care (including annual&#xD;
           check-ups with a primary care provider and participation in preventive health care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2- To compare the effectiveness of SR/HM to UC in decreasing the use of&#xD;
      high-cost acute and long-term institution-based services. We hypothesize that compared to&#xD;
      older individuals with SMI receiving UC, individuals receiving SR/HM will use fewer high cost&#xD;
      services, including emergency room visits, acute hospitalizations, and nursing home care. In&#xD;
      addition, the reduced use of high cost institution-based services will be associated with&#xD;
      better independent living skills and health management practices resulting from the SR/HM&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also evaluate the following secondary, exploratory hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The SR/HM intervention will be associated with better general health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The effectiveness of SR/HM in improving living skills and community functioning will be&#xD;
           greatest for individuals with low levels of cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will describe outpatient service utilization for SR/HM and UC models within&#xD;
      each study site in order to present a more comprehensive account of services used by study&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about how to provide effective rehabilitation and health management services&#xD;
      to older persons with serious mental illness (SMI) to decrease the use of high-cost&#xD;
      institution-based services. To address this need, we developed a supported rehabilitation and&#xD;
      health management (SR/HM) intervention for older persons with SMI that addresses functioning&#xD;
      in two areas essential for preventing hospitalizations and long-term institutional care: (1)&#xD;
      enhanced independent living skills and (2) improved health management. The supported&#xD;
      rehabilitation (SR) component consists of skills training aimed at improving competence in&#xD;
      everyday functioning, including community living skills and social skills. The health&#xD;
      management (HM) component consists of training in health management skills and health case&#xD;
      management by nurses who monitor and facilitate routine preventive and acute health care.&#xD;
      Results from a pilot study indicate that SR/HM is effective in improving independent living&#xD;
      skills and health management for older persons with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to test the effectiveness of the SR/HM intervention in improving&#xD;
      the functioning and health care of older persons with SMI and in reducing the use of high&#xD;
      cost, acute and long-term institution-based care. The proposed research will compare the&#xD;
      SR/HM intervention to usual care (UC) in a randomized, controlled study of 180 individuals&#xD;
      age 60 and older with SMI living in the community.&#xD;
