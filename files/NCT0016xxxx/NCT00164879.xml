      The aim of this study is to compare the stoma rate, clinical efficacy, and safety of patients&#xD;
      treated by endoscopic stenting followed by elective laparoscopic resection (the&#xD;
      'endolaparoscopic approach') versus immediate emergency surgery for obstructing left-sided&#xD;
      colorectal cancers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In patients who present with obstructing left-sided colorectal cancers, emergency surgery&#xD;
      carries a significant morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, most of these patients would&#xD;
      receive staged operations (Hartmann's procedure). Temporary stoma is often required due to&#xD;
      the edematous bowel wall precluding primary anastomosis as a result of obstruction and the&#xD;
      poor pre-morbid status. A second operation is subsequently required to restore bowel&#xD;
      continuity. Apart from the expensive hospital costs of the staged operations, the patient's&#xD;
      acceptance to the stoma is poor and the social inconvenience associated with the stoma is&#xD;
      obvious. Thus, a significant portion of patients would not be suitable for the second&#xD;
      operation due to poor health or advanced disease and having to bear the stoma for the&#xD;
      remainder of life. Recently, self-expandable metal stents have been used with success in&#xD;
      relieving the acute obstruction in patients with obstructing left-sided colorectal cancers.&#xD;
      Endoscopic stenting may help to relieve the obstruction, avoid emergency surgery, and allows&#xD;
      patients to undergo one-stage elective surgery without the necessity of making a stoma. We&#xD;
      propose to evaluate the clinical benefits of using self-expandable metal stents in patients&#xD;
      with obstructing left-sided colorectal cancers followed by elective laparoscopic resection&#xD;
      and compare its use to immediate emergency surgery.&#xD;
