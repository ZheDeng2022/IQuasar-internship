      This study will evaluate the expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by peptide and mRNA&#xD;
      quantitation and also measurement of its V1 receptor mRNA, in the arteries and veins of&#xD;
      ovarian malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) tissue. The investigators will&#xD;
      examine whether AVP protein and AVP and V1 receptor mRNA expression vary with respect to&#xD;
      tumor histology, intratumoral vascularization and systemic blood pressure.&#xD;

      d. STATUS: Background and Significance/Preliminary Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neovascularization is an obligate early event in cancer growth. Consequently, angiogenesis&#xD;
      appears to play an important role in disease progression and survival of most malignancies in&#xD;
      general and gynecologic malignancies specifically. Ovarian cancer is the second most common&#xD;
      gynecologic malignancy, and the leading cause of cancer related death among the gynecologic&#xD;
      malignancies. It is estimated that 23,300 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed in&#xD;
      the United States in 2003 and that 13,900 women will die from disease. Angiogenesis may serve&#xD;
      as a prognostic indicator in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis in cancer requires the&#xD;
      proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in response to a variety of cytokines to&#xD;
      include angiogenin, endothelial cell growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF). The expression of some of these cytokines have been evaluated in gynecologic&#xD;
      malignancies. Increased expression of VEGF protein by immunohistochemistry has been&#xD;
      associated with decreased disease free survival 18 versus 120 months in early stage&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancers. Conversely any exposure to antiangiogenic factors should inhibit&#xD;
      tumor cell growth in vitro. Angiostatin and endostatin have also been found to inhibit&#xD;
      ovarian cancer growth in mice 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neovascularization required of fast growing malignancies in general, and ovarian cancer&#xD;
      specifically, necessitates that they contain many new vessels that have less smooth muscle in&#xD;
      their walls. Because of the quantitative decrease in vascular smooth muscle these vessels&#xD;
      also have a decreased resistance to blood flow than the vessels found in benign tumors.&#xD;
      Malignant tumors with low vascular resistance have been shown to demonstrate decreased smooth&#xD;
      muscle actin expression and intense Cd34 expression with no differences in microvessel&#xD;
      density (MVD) noted 8. Immunohistochemical analysis using monoclonal antibodies against&#xD;
      smooth muscle actin (SMA) and CD34 (an endothelial cell marker) demonstrated that low&#xD;
      resistance to blood flow in vessels within malignant ovarian tumors may be associated with a&#xD;
      poorly developed muscular coat in the tumor vessels, compared with that observed in benign&#xD;
      tumors. Color-flow Doppler imaging uses the altered blood flow patterns as a marker in an&#xD;
      attempt to differentiate benign from malignant tumors 9. Researchers have evaluated the&#xD;
      presence of intratumoral vascularization in ovarian neoplasms by Color-flow Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound. Benign tumors and cysts have a significantly higher pulsatility index (PI) (mean,&#xD;
      1.93 +/- 1.02; range, 0.23-3.99) and resistive index (RI) (mean, 0.77 +/- 0.22; range,&#xD;
      0.2-1.0) than do malignant tumors (PI: mean, 0.77 +/- 0.33; range, 0.31-1.09; RI: mean, 0.5&#xD;
      +/- 0.17; range, 0.27-0.67). Some overlap, however, exists in individual values for benign&#xD;
      and malignant lesions. The difference in the angiogenic and vascular resistant natures of&#xD;
      benign and malignant ovarian tumors showing intratumoral blood flow may thus be correlated&#xD;
      with the endothelial cell activity of the tumor vessels and not the MVD. This low resistance&#xD;
      to blood flow within tumor vessels and subsequent endothelial cell activity could be&#xD;
      regulated by local, endothelial cell or vascular smooth muscle cell, arginine-vasopressin&#xD;
      (AVP) synthesis and release with subsequent actions on vasopressin receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is a peptide hormone classically known to be synthesized in the&#xD;
      hypothalamus and secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. AVP has a variety of roles in the&#xD;
      body and a variety of systemic physiologic functions to include vasoconstriction,&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis, corticosteroidogenesis, and excretion of water and urea. AVP causes a&#xD;
      peripheral vasoconstriction that is thought to be mediated primarily by the V1 receptor. AVP&#xD;
      is thought to do this by a variety of mechanisms to include activation of the V1a receptors&#xD;
      with stimulation of phospholipase A2 which leads to increased calcium spiking activity. AVP&#xD;
      could also do this by regulating the expression of other hypertensive factors and proteins in&#xD;
      the body. AVP has been shown to play an important role in the development of hypertension&#xD;
      following aortic constriction in rats. When rats were given AVP following constriction of the&#xD;
      abdominal aorta, hypertension developed and these animals had an increased response to&#xD;
      angiotensin II. Therefore AVP is thought to permit the expression of other factors such as&#xD;
      angiotensin II. The presence of AVP is important in other animal models of hypertension such&#xD;
      the spontaneously hypertensive rat and DOCA salt hypertension. For instance, administration&#xD;
      of DOCA salt to Brattleboro rats, genetically incapable of synthesizing vasopressin in the&#xD;
      hypothalamus, will not result in the development of hypertension. However, with&#xD;
      administration of exogenous AVP, these rats will develop hypertension when given DOCA salt&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure of vascular smooth muscle cells to AVP also increases smooth muscle actin through&#xD;
      activation of all three MAP kinase family pathways. Because AVP has the ability to regulate&#xD;
      and increase smooth muscle actin this suggests that AVP may not only regulate growth of&#xD;
      vascular smooth muscle but also promote expression of smooth muscle-specific contractile&#xD;
      proteins . Previous studies have shown that AVP can produce an exaggerated vascular&#xD;
      vasoconstriction in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) relative to normotensive&#xD;
      rats. This exaggerated response was likely associated to a higher density of V1 receptors&#xD;
      associated with increased AVP gene expression. Finally AVP and other neuropepetides have been&#xD;
      shown to serve as autocrine growth factors for some solid tumors. The mitogenic influence of&#xD;
      AVP is thought to involve increases in intracellular calcium. AVP is often expressed in small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (SCLC), and can act as an autocrine growth factor in these cancers. AVP&#xD;
      expression in SCLC is thought to be dependent on the modulation of normal repressor activity&#xD;
      12. Because AVP has been implicated in the physiology of vascular constriction and mean&#xD;
      vascular pressure, and also because it has been shown to be expressed in certain types of&#xD;
      cancer, it may also have a role as an angiogenic factor in intratumoral vascularization in&#xD;
      ovarian cancer carcinogenesis. It is the purpose of our proposed study to investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between AVP expression and its vascular receptor with ovarian neoplasm&#xD;
      histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, our labs have isolated and analyzed human mesenteric arteries for VP mRNA and V1&#xD;
      receptor mRNA analyses. V1R mRNA was strongly positively correlated with diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (r = 0.70, p = 0.0112). V1R mRNA tended to be greater in males than females (5.73 +&#xD;
      1.29 compared to 2.3 + 0.94 relative expression units of V1R mRNA, p = 0.057). Also, arterial&#xD;
      AVP mRNA correlated negatively with age (p=0.0028). These results suggest that alterations in&#xD;
      both VP and V1R expression could be involved in disease states such as ovarian cancer where&#xD;
      blood pressure and flow as well as age may be factors in the development of the malignancy of&#xD;
      the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AVP peptide was measured by radioimmunoassay in other blood vessels23, e.g. radial and&#xD;
      mammary artery and saphenous vein samples, and the immunoactivity was shown to co-migrate&#xD;
      with synthetic AVP on HPLC analysis. The levels of hormone ranged from undetectable to as&#xD;
      high as 60 uU/gr tissue. Thus, we will also be able to verify changes in VP gene expression&#xD;
      by measuring the AVP protein directly in the ovarian neoplasm blood vessels collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. PLAN: Women, 18 years old or greater, who are having their ovaries removed will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the protocol. 110 total specimens will be obtained. At our institution&#xD;
      approximately 200 patients per year have ovaries removed. All patients who have had&#xD;
      gynecologic tissue removed for benign (non cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) indications&#xD;
      will meet inclusion criteria. Patients who have a malignancy that is not a primary&#xD;
      gynecologic malignancy will be excluded from the study. Each patient's intratumoral&#xD;
      vascularity will be assessed by Doppler ultrasound and systemic blood pressure measured&#xD;
      preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE FOR PROCUREMENT, PREPARATION AND SHIPMENT OF TISSUE SPECIMENS Ovarian arterial and&#xD;
      venous specimens will be collected for analysis of AVP peptide and for AVP and vasopressin&#xD;
      receptor mRNA. Operating room personnel will be asked to keep the tissue, ovarian artery and&#xD;
      vein segments, fresh and not put it in fixative. Promptly following removal of the tissue,&#xD;
      the specimens will be prepared as follows: The most sterile primary tissue will be cut to&#xD;
      measure at least 5.0 cm in length. The tumor tissue will then be separated from as much&#xD;
      connective tissue as possible. The specimen will be placed in the RNA preservative&#xD;
      RNAlaterTM, placed on wet ice and sent to the Department of Clinical Investigation&#xD;
      Laboratories quickly. Laboratory analyses of AVP peptide and for AVP and vasopressin receptor&#xD;
      mRNA isolation and quantitation will be performed in the Physiology and Research Pharmacology&#xD;
      laboratories of the Department of Clinical Investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Methods: Vasopressin synthesis (as indicated by VP mRNA) and vasopressin receptor&#xD;
      (V1R or V2R) up or down regulation (as indicated by V1R mRNA or V2R mRNA levels) will be&#xD;
      assessed. Measurement of V2R in addition to V1R mRNA will help clarify whether possible&#xD;
      changes in V1R expression in the ovarian neoplasms are specific to that receptor subtype.&#xD;
      Ovarian artery samples will be isolated and stored in RNA later TM (Ambion, Austin, TX) at&#xD;
      -70oC until extracted for RNA with a commercial kit (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA). VP mRNA, V1R&#xD;
      mRNA, and beta actin mRNA will be quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using an&#xD;
      iCycler (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Reverse transcription of the RNA to cDNA will be&#xD;
      done using Superscript TM (Invitrogen), and PCR will be done with Platinum qPCR SuperMix-UDG&#xD;
      (Invitrogen). Standard curves will be generated using dilutions of a stock of human blood&#xD;
      vessel cDNA and the cycle threshold for each sample will be related to a dilution's assigned&#xD;
      copy number. qPCR data will be expressed as a ratio of VP, V1R, or V2R mRNA copies per&#xD;
      beta-actin mRNA copies. Product generation on all three mRNA segments we are measuring, yield&#xD;
      slopes of approximately 3.3 indicating nearly 100% efficiency of a doubling of product with&#xD;
      each cycle in temperature, and gel electrophoresis indicates one band of product. All&#xD;
      quantitation is done through the detection of increasing intensity of a specific fluorescent&#xD;
      probe for each product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasopressin peptide will be analyzed by radioimmunoassay of vascular tissue extracts. The&#xD;
      tissue will be extracted by first rinsing the tissue free of blood with 0.1 N Acetic Acid,&#xD;
      blotting and weighing the tissue. The specimen will placed in cold 1.0 N HCl (1ml/0.5 g&#xD;
      tissue) and homogenized with a Polytron for 1 min. The homogenate will then be centrifuged at&#xD;
      27,000 G for 45 min. The supernatant will be saved, and the pellet resuspended and&#xD;
      rehomogenized in 1 ml 1.0 N HCl, and centrifuged. The supernatants are then combined. The&#xD;
      supernatants will then be extracted as routinely done with plasma samples by absorption on to&#xD;
      octadecylsilane cartridges (SepPak, C-18, Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted with acidified&#xD;
      ethanol. The eluate is dried by vacuum and suspended in assay buffer. At this point the&#xD;
      sample can be applied to C-18 HPLC column and eluted in a single phase buffer system&#xD;
      consisting of 0.05 M NH4AC in 39% MeOH, and each 1-ml fraction, dried under vacuum, and&#xD;
      suspended in radioimmunoassay buffer and assayed. Alternatively, the HPLC fractionation may&#xD;
      not have to be done after initial confirmation that no interference is present in the initial&#xD;
      sample. In this case, the initial extract will be assayed by radioimmunoassay directly.&#xD;
