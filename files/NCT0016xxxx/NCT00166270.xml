    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, nonrandomized, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of ExAblate in the treatment of uterine fibroids. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      and then followed for 36 months to evaluate the change in their fibroid symptoms.&#xD;

      After the PMA Panel, the sponsor was requested to conduct a post-approval study. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to gather additional data to evaluate the safety and long term&#xD;
      effectiveness of focused ultrasound treatment, and to include a larger cohort of&#xD;
      African-American patients. Patients will be treated following the approved commercial&#xD;
      treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) are the most common neoplasms of the female pelvis. These benign&#xD;
      tumors are generally oval in shape, and often highly vascular. On T2 weighted MR imaging&#xD;
      exams, or T1 exams with contrast, uterine fibroids are easily identifiable. They occur in&#xD;
      20-25% of women of reproductive age and can cause a variety of problems generally described&#xD;
      as either bleeding or mass effects from the fibroid. In general, these symptoms can be&#xD;
      classified into two categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. heavy menstrual bleeding, defined as bleeding on heavy days requiring a change of&#xD;
           sanitary wear every 2 hours or less, significant clot passage, flooding, substantial&#xD;
           prolongation of menstrual periods compared with the patient's prior experience, or&#xD;
           anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. pelvic pain or pressure, heaviness or discomfort, or similar symptoms in the back, flank&#xD;
           or leg attributable to the bulk of the fibroid, urinary frequency, increase in nocturia,&#xD;
           difficulty voiding or compression of the ureters with hydronephrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of the clinical success of patients who elect treatment of fibroids are generally&#xD;
      subjective, and evaluated by the patient in terms of improvement in the initial symptoms that&#xD;
      caused her to seek treatment (decrease in pain, bladder or bowel symptoms, or reduction in&#xD;
      vaginal bleeding), while experiencing a minimum of co-morbidities from the treatment itself.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who present with symptomatic uterine fibroids and are not seeking treatment for&#xD;
             the reason of improving fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to give consent and able to attend all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is pre or peri-menopausal (within 12 months of last menstrual period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to communicate sensations during the ExAblate procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uterine fibroids, which are device accessible (i.e., positioned in the uterus such&#xD;
             that they can be accessed without being shielded by bowel or bone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fibroids(s) clearly visible on non-contrast MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metallic implants that are incompatible with MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensitive to MRI contrast agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe claustrophobia that would prevent completion of procedure in MR unit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who are pregnant or desire to become pregnant in the future. Pregnancies following&#xD;
             ExAblate treatment could be dangerous for both mother and fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pedunculated fibroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active local or systemic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected pelvic carcinoma or pre-malignant conditions, including sarcoma and&#xD;
             adenomatous hyperplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intrauterine device (IUD) anywhere in the treatment path&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dermoid cyst of the ovary anywhere in the treatment path&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extensive abdominal scarring that cannot be avoided by redirection of the beam (e.g.,&#xD;
             due to Caesarean section or repeated abdominal surgeries)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding&#xD;
