      The purpose of this study was to compare the balance strategy, as well as center of pressure&#xD;
      (COP) trajectory and parameters between healthy adults and patients with hemiplegia in&#xD;
      response to slow- and fast-speed waist- pulling perturbations in forward, left, right, and&#xD;
      backward directions.&#xD;

      The ability to quickly respond to external perturbations is an important capacity of stroke&#xD;
      patients to maintain dynamic balance in activities of daily living. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      was to compare the balance strategy, as well as center of pressure (COP) trajectory and&#xD;
      parameters between healthy adults and patients with hemiplegia in response to slow- and&#xD;
      fast-speed waist- pulling perturbations in forward, left, right, and backward directions.&#xD;
