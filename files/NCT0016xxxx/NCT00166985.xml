      Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is the fourth most frequent cancer in women. Surgery is the&#xD;
      treatment of choice in patients with noninvasive or locally advanced disease. The surgical&#xD;
      technique consists of an exploratory laparotomy, with total hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
      oophorectomy, peritoneal washing, and, in selected high-risk patients, omental and peritoneal&#xD;
      biopsies and lymphadenectomy. Therefore, preoperative clinical and instrumental staging of&#xD;
      the local spread of disease, as well as local and distant lymph node involvement, represent a&#xD;
      critical step in tailoring the extent and the radicalness of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of angiogenesis in cancer growth and metastasis has been gaining much attention for&#xD;
      decades. Recent clinical evidence supports this notion. The gradual increase in angiogenesis&#xD;
      intensity with tumor progression in malignant melanoma has been reported. Abulafia et al.&#xD;
      reported that increasing angiogenicity could be noted from simple hyperplasia, complex&#xD;
      hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, and Stage IA endometrial carcinoma to invasive endometrial&#xD;
      carcinoma. The investigators' research team has shown that incremental angiogenesis could be&#xD;
      demonstrated in the tumorigenesis and the possibility of lymph node metastasis in endometrial&#xD;
      malignancy. Besides, other growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),&#xD;
      transforming growth factor- (TGF-), IL-6 and IL-8 have also been reported to correlate with&#xD;
      the angiogenesis and the metastasis of endometrial cancer. It seems that tumor angiogenesis&#xD;
      of endometrial cancer could be utilized as an important parameter to assess the disease&#xD;
      severity of the endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the investigators would like to propose this proposal to focus on the tumor angiogenesis&#xD;
      in endometrial cancer patients. There are several purposes in this study. First, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate and compare tumor angiogenesis surveyed from functional MRI and&#xD;
      power Doppler sonography in endometrial cancer patients who receive surgery. Second, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate whether tumor angiogenesis could be a marker to predict the&#xD;
      disease severity of endometrial cancer. Third, the role of functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) in endometrial cancer will be elucidated.&#xD;

      Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is the fourth most frequent cancer in women. Surgery is the&#xD;
      treatment of choice in patients with noninvasive or locally advanced disease. The surgical&#xD;
      technique consists of an exploratory laparotomy, with total hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;

      the local spread of disease, as well as local and distant lymph node involvement, represent a&#xD;
      critical step in tailoring the extent and the radicalness of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of angiogenesis in cancer growth and metastasis has been gaining much attention for&#xD;
      decades. Recent clinical evidence supports this notion. The gradual increase in angiogenesis&#xD;
      intensity with tumor progression in malignant melanoma has been reported. Abulafia et al.&#xD;
      observed that increasing angiogenicity from simple hyperplasia, complex hyperplasia, atypical&#xD;
      hyperplasia, and Stage IA endometrial carcinoma to invasive endometrial carcinoma has been&#xD;
      found by histopathologic examination. Several articles have reported that transvaginal color&#xD;
      and pulse Doppler ultrasound may be helpful blood in the evaluation of various gynecologic&#xD;
      tumors. Besides, our previous studies have also shown that incremental angiogenesis could be&#xD;
      demonstrated in the tumorigenesis and the possibility of lymph node metastasis in endometrial&#xD;
      malignancy. Other growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-,&#xD;
      IL-6, and IL-8 have also been reported to correlate with the angiogenesis and the metastasis&#xD;
      of endometrial cancer. It seems that tumor angiogenesis of endometrial cancer could be&#xD;
      utilized as an important parameter to assess the disease severity of the endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining microvessel density is regarded as a standard procedure to quantitate tumor&#xD;
      angiogenesis. However, microvessel density always has been assessed retrospectively and in&#xD;
      vitro. Preoperative prediction of the microvessel density would be of value clinically for&#xD;
      evaluating severity and progression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, we would like to propose this proposal to focus on the tumor angiogenesis in endometrial&#xD;
      cancer patients. Endometrial cancer patients who will receive staging surgery will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Functional MRI, and transvaginal sonography will be undergone before&#xD;
      the surgery in each patient. The angiogenesis-related growth factors will be evaluated later&#xD;
      from the surgical specimens. The clinical pathologic items, various angiogenic parameters&#xD;
      obtained from the MRI and sonography, and angiogenesis-related factors will be compared and&#xD;
      correlated together. There are several purposes in this study. First, we will evaluate and&#xD;
      compare tumor angiogenesis surveyed from functional MRI and power Doppler sonography in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer patients who receive surgery. Second, we will evaluate whether tumor&#xD;
      angiogenesis could be a marker to predict the disease severity of endometrial cancer. Third,&#xD;
      we will elucidate the role of functional MRI in endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial cancer patients with histopathologic proof who are arranged to receive staging&#xD;
      surgery are eligible. All patients will undergo surgery, including total abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph node&#xD;
      dissection or sampling. Surgical specimens will be evaluated for tumor size, histologic&#xD;
      grading, depth of myometrial invasion, and presence of lymphovascular emboli and lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis. Stage will be determined using the International Federation of Gynecology and&#xD;
      Obstetrics classification. Tumors of histologic types other than adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
      adenoacanthoma will be excluded. The carcinomas were classified using a three-grade system:&#xD;
      grade 1 carcinomas showed glandular formation in more than 95% of the tumor, grade 2&#xD;
      carcinomas showed a solid growth pattern in 5-50%, and grade 3 carcinomas showed a solid&#xD;
      pattern in more than 50%. All of the patients who will be enrolled into this study need to&#xD;
      sign the consent form and the study protocol will be under the approval of the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board of the patient's hospital.&#xD;
