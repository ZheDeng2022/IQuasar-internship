      The intent of this project is to replicate the POWER pilot campaign using a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with neighborhoods as the unit of randomization and analysis. We plan to&#xD;
      rigorously test the effects of the POWER campaign on women's knowledge of, attitudes toward&#xD;
      and use of female and male condoms for the prevention of sexually transmitted disease (STD)&#xD;
      and unintended pregnancy. We will work in 12 non-contiguous neighborhoods in four&#xD;
      southwestern U.S. cities (four each in Oakland/Alameda County and Los Angeles and two each in&#xD;
      San Diego and Las Vegas). We will complete a baseline assessment in all 12 neighborhoods to&#xD;
      document knowledge of, attitudes toward and use of female and male condoms. We will then&#xD;
      randomly assign six neighborhoods to intervention status and six neighborhoods to control&#xD;
      status. We will adapt the campaign for each city, and implement it in six intervention&#xD;
      neighborhoods for nine months, and will complete a follow-up assessment similar to the&#xD;
      baseline assessment, with added questions regarding exposure to the POWER campaign. Study&#xD;
      partners include Dr. Sheana Bull and research staff from the Colorado Health Outcomes Program&#xD;
      (COHO) of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Educational Message Services&#xD;

      Testing the POWER project: A Neighborhood Intervention Trial PROTOCOL SUMMARY Sheana S. Bull,&#xD;
      Ph.D. Principal Investigator Protocol # 02-978&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The POWER project (Prevention Options for Women Equals Rights) was a social&#xD;
      marketing pilot project Targeting African American and Latina women aged 15-25 to promote the&#xD;
      &quot;mixing&quot; of female and male condoms conducted in Denver, Colorado in 2000 and 2001. The&#xD;
      results of the project show promise for increasing awareness and use of female condoms and&#xD;
      use of male condoms (Bull et al., 2002). Sixty-four percent of the women in the follow-up&#xD;
      study were able to identify one or more unique aspects of the POWER campaign. There was a&#xD;
      significant increase in awareness and use of female condoms and in use of male condoms from&#xD;
      baseline to follow-up. Being exposed to the POWER campaign was significantly correlated with&#xD;
      having heard of (r = 0.13) and seen (r = 0.20) the female condom, and with having talked&#xD;
      about female condoms more frequently with friends, family and acquaintances (r = 0.15).&#xD;
      Chi-square analyses using follow-up study data (n=269) showed that women exposed to the&#xD;
      campaign had significantly greater positive outcome expectancies toward female condom use&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.10) and talked about female condoms more frequently with more people (p&lt;0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDC reports increasing prevalence of Chlamydia among women in Oakland/Alameda County, San&#xD;
      Diego, Las Vegas and Los Angeles and increasing rates of gonorrhea in Los Angeles and Las&#xD;
      Vegas (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000, 2002). National data on teen births&#xD;
      indicate that while teen births have been declining, the number of births to women aged 20-24&#xD;
      are increasing as are births to unmarried women. With the advent of the female condom as an&#xD;
      efficacious female controlled barrier method for STD/HIV and pregnancy prevention in the&#xD;
      early 1990's (Bounds, 1997; Farr, Gabelnick, Sturgen, &amp; Dorflinger, 1994; Fontanet et al.,&#xD;
      1998; McCabe, Golub S., &amp; Lee, 1997; Soper et al., 1993; Trussell, Sturgen, Strickler, &amp;&#xD;
      Dominik, 1994), women at risk for these conditions were given a greater range of choices to&#xD;
      control fertility and prevent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social marketing utilizes marketing and advertising concepts, integrated with social science&#xD;
      theory for the development of behavior promotion campaigns targeted to specific subgroups.&#xD;
      Such targeting is a key element of the social marketing approach. Social marketing approaches&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective for changing blood cholesterol levels (Lefebvre, Lasater,&#xD;
      Carleton, &amp; Peterson, 1987), smoking behaviors (Kotler &amp; Roberto, 1989), and women's and&#xD;
      children's health (Hornick, 1991; Rasmuson, Seidel, &amp; Smith, 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of this project is to replicate the POWER pilot campaign using a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with neighborhoods as the unit of randomization and analysis. We plan to&#xD;
      rigorously test the effects of the POWER campaign on women's knowledge of, attitudes toward&#xD;
      and use of female and male condoms for the prevention of sexually transmitted disease (STD)&#xD;
      and unintended pregnancy. We will work in 12 non-contiguous neighborhoods in four&#xD;
      southwestern U.S. cities (four each in Oakland/Alameda County and Los Angeles and two each in&#xD;
      San Diego and Las Vegas). We will complete a baseline assessment in all 12 neighborhoods to&#xD;
      document knowledge of, attitudes toward and use of female and male condoms. We will then&#xD;
      randomly assign six neighborhoods to intervention status and six neighborhoods to control&#xD;
      status. We will adapt the campaign for each city, and implement it in six intervention&#xD;
      neighborhoods for nine months, and will complete a follow-up assessment similar to the&#xD;
      baseline assessment, with added questions regarding exposure to the POWER campaign. Study&#xD;
      partners include Dr. Sheana Bull and research staff from the Colorado Health Outcomes Program&#xD;
      (COHO) of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Educational Message Services&#xD;
      (EMS), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods In order to achieve our objectives, we will utilize a randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      pre-post test design with the neighborhood as the unit of randomization and analysis. To&#xD;
      avoid introduction of bias, COHO staff will maintain responsibility for all research and&#xD;
      evaluation activities during pre and post test assessment. EMS will implement and maintain&#xD;
      the POWER social marketing campaign in six intervention neighborhoods. CDC will serve as&#xD;
      technical advisors to the project. COHO will first identify &quot;high risk&quot; neighborhoods in each&#xD;
      study city that have higher than US average rates (as defined by the CDC, 2000) of Chlamydia&#xD;
      and Gonorrhea combined with high concentrations of African American and Latina residents aged&#xD;
      15-25. We will then approach contacts in health departments and community organizations in&#xD;
      each city and enlist their help in implementing a venue-based method for sampling&#xD;
      hard-to-reach populations (more on this process described in the recruiting methods and&#xD;
      selection of study population sections below). We will use this method to recruit&#xD;
      participants for a cross-sectional, baseline study to document knowledge of, attitudes toward&#xD;
      and use of female and male condoms. We will then randomly assign six neighborhoods to&#xD;
      intervention status and six neighborhoods to control status. We will adapt the campaign for&#xD;
      each city, and implement it in six intervention neighborhoods for nine months, and will&#xD;
      complete a follow-up assessment similar to the baseline assessment, with added questions&#xD;
      regarding exposure to the POWER campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting methods Participants will be recruited from the selected study neighborhoods for&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up studies using a venue-based application of time-space sampling (Muhib&#xD;
      et al., 2001). The method involves first identifying venues, places at which members of the&#xD;
      target population may be found, then identifying days and times during which members of the&#xD;
      target population are likely to be found at the selected venues. After venue day-time (VDT)&#xD;
      units are identified, forming a sampling frame, a random sample of VDTs is selected and&#xD;
      eligible members of the target population are systematically sampled within selected VDTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the nine month baseline data collection period we will maintain a sampling frame&#xD;
      of VDTs from which to recruit participants. Sampling frames will be updated monthly, with the&#xD;
      addition of sporadically occurring VDTs and the removal of VDTs that are no longer viable&#xD;
      (have failed to yield sufficient eligible participants or are infeasible due to practical&#xD;
      constraints). Each month, after the sampling frame is updated, VDTs will be randomly selected&#xD;
      and placed on the sampling event calendar. At the time of each sampling event, trained staff&#xD;
      will systematically approach (e.g. every third woman appearing to be 15 years or older)&#xD;
      potential participants who enter a predefined sampling area of the venue. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be screened to determine eligibility. Members of the target population who&#xD;
      meet all of the eligibility criteria and who agree to participate in the study will then&#xD;
      complete informed consents prior to enrollment. They will self-administer the study&#xD;
      questionnaire, and will be offered an incentive valued at $10 for their time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process for venue-based sampling will be repeated for the follow-up data collection&#xD;
      process. We will revisit the sampling frame prior to beginning data collection and will&#xD;
      remove no longer viable VDTs while adding new VDTs. Subsequent follow-up sampling activities&#xD;
      will mirror those conducted at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent procedures Training of staff to explain study process. Participants will&#xD;
      self-administer the questionnaire. However, recruitment of participants, explanation of&#xD;
      consent process and study protocols, and distribution of incentives will require trained&#xD;
      staff. We will have a core recruitment director hired by COHO trained in study protocols and&#xD;
      COMIRB 101. Any additional persons hired to assist with data collection will be required to&#xD;
      attend an IRB training in their area, and take the IRB 201 test online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting in which consent will be obtained. Consent will be obtained in multiple community&#xD;
      settings, e.g. bars, community organizations, community businesses (such as beauty salons,&#xD;
      clothing stores, grocery stores), recreation centers. The settings will be selected at random&#xD;
      using the procedure described above. Potential participants will be approached and&#xD;
      eligibility will be determined by asking potential participants a few short eligibility&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of subject comprehension and autonomy. Staff will ask the participant to explain&#xD;
      the study in their own words prior to handing them a questionnaire to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent form copies will be made available to the participant. Staff will ask participants to&#xD;
      sign two copies of the informed consent. They will offer the participant one copy and will&#xD;
      keep one copy. Documentation of the consent process in a medical source document is not&#xD;
      applicable for this study, as the study will take place in community rather than medical&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The POWER campaign will be implemented in six neighborhoods chosen at random&#xD;
      (see methods section above); two neighborhoods in Oakland/Alameda County, two in Los Angeles&#xD;
      and one each in San Diego and Las Vegas. The campaign will last nine months, and will be&#xD;
      implemented by EMS. We will have up to 100 display points in 25 sites in each neighborhood.&#xD;
      Some settings will be larger than others, and will require many more display points (e.g.,&#xD;
      10) while others may be very small and will require fewer display points (e.g., two). Six&#xD;
      control neighborhoods (those not chosen at random to be intervention neighborhoods) will be&#xD;
      involved in the study. No POWER campaign materials will be placed in these neighborhoods. All&#xD;
      study participants at baseline will be asked to complete an assessment to document knowledge&#xD;
      of, attitudes toward and use of female and male condoms. All study participants at follow-up&#xD;
      will complete an assessment similar to the baseline assessment, with added questions&#xD;
      regarding exposure to the POWER campaign. None of these assessments are part of regular&#xD;
      clinical care for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria Persons who meet eligibility criteria include women aged&#xD;
      15-25 who speak English. Children recruited for the study include those women aged 15-17.&#xD;
      Although women who are pregnant will not be excluded from the research, they are not targeted&#xD;
      for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are requesting a waiver of parental permission from COMIRB to include women under age 18&#xD;
      in the study. Per California and Nevada Statutes, minors are allowed to consent for&#xD;
      contraceptive services, STD testing and pregnancy testing without parental consent. Detailed&#xD;
      justification for this request is included in the full protocol. Minors (15-17 years&#xD;
      old-determined at the time of recruitment) will be encouraged to discuss their participation&#xD;
      with a parent or guardian prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient accrual We will enroll 300 women in each of the 12 study neighborhoods at the&#xD;
      baseline study and 300 women in each of the 12 study neighborhoods at the follow-up study,&#xD;
      for a total of 3600 at baseline, 3600 at follow-up and a total of 7200 for the entire study.&#xD;
      This number includes the total number of women who will need to sign a consent form in order&#xD;
      to reach study end points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ the neighborhood as the unit of analysis. Thus, six neighborhoods will&#xD;
      be assigned to intervention status. Baseline data will be collected prior to campaign&#xD;
      implementation. The POWER campaign will be implemented in these neighborhoods for a nine&#xD;
      month period. Follow-up data collection will take place in all 12 study neighborhoods. Thus,&#xD;
      individuals per se are not assigned to intervention or control status, rather the&#xD;
      neighborhoods where people live will be assigned to intervention or control status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated duration of the study The baseline data collection will take place over nine&#xD;
      months, starting in month six of the project. The campaign will last the subsequent nine&#xD;
      months, and the follow-up data collection will take place in the next subsequent nine months,&#xD;
      for a total of 27 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons who enroll in the baseline and/or follow-up studies will spend a total of 20 minutes&#xD;
      in completing the consent process, self-administering the questionnaire, and in receiving&#xD;
      their incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments We will ask all participants at baseline to complete a questionnaire to&#xD;
      document knowledge of, attitudes toward and use of female and male condoms. Participants in&#xD;
      the follow-up study will be asked to complete a questionnaire identical to the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, with added questions regarding exposure to the POWER campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety and Monitoring Plan Analyses for this study will be led by Dr. Sheana Bull, with&#xD;
      input from CDC Colleagues Drs. Sam Posner, Lillian Lin and Sherri Varnell. Three analysis&#xD;
      strategies will be employed: (a) comparison of neighborhood-level (unadjusted) means, (b)&#xD;
      comparison of neighborhood-level adjusted means, and (c) hierarchical modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate no adverse events associated with participation in this study beyond possible&#xD;
      embarrassment and reluctance to answer sensitive questions. That said, any serious and&#xD;
      unexpected adverse event will be reported to the IRB immediately. Dr. Sheana Bull will&#xD;
      oversee this aspect of the study. The informed consent indicates that should medical care be&#xD;
      necessary for any person responding to the questionnaire, we can facilitate access to care by&#xD;
      providing referrals. It also indicates that we will not be able to pay for that care. The&#xD;
      consent also offers two telephone numbers for persons who wish to obtain more information on&#xD;
      the study, referrals or information on their rights as a research subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans for interim analyses. We regularly monitor recruitment and risk behaviors disclosed by&#xD;
      participants on the assessment. Because we will need to continue enrollment up to 7200&#xD;
      persons to determine if the intervention is effective, we do not plan to stop the study prior&#xD;
      to achieving this enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSMB. Because this is a behavioral study, and offers low risk outside of some embarrassment&#xD;
      over answering personal questions, we do not plan to convene a data safety and monitoring&#xD;
      board independently of monitoring this work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduct is monitored each day by Dr. Sheana Bull, who regularly tracks enrollment and&#xD;
      recruitment processes. She is responsible for oversight of all protocol implementation for&#xD;
      the project. Specific monitoring duties include regular contact with persons recruiting&#xD;
      participants to ensure that protocols for recruitment are adhered to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for protecting the privacy of subjects and maintaining confidentiality of data.&#xD;
      All participants in the study are asked to sign a consent form and a receipt acknowledging&#xD;
      they received an incentive for the study. These two forms are the only documents that have&#xD;
      any identifiers on them. We will not scan these materials or keep electronic copies of them.&#xD;
      We will keep signed consent forms separate from completed questionnaires. Persons collecting&#xD;
      data will place signed consent forms and receipts in a separate locked file from completed&#xD;
      questionnaires. All questionnaire data will be entered into a computer on the COHO server.&#xD;
      This is a COHO dedicated server, with firewall, login and encryption security, none of which&#xD;
      are accessible from outside the COHO local area network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses planned for data include development of a database using ACCESS&#xD;
      (Microsoft Corporation, 2002) to store and manage study data, and to import data into SAS&#xD;
      (version 8.1) for quantitative analyses. Analyses of data from the baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      studies will concentrate on establishing knowledge of, attitudes toward and use of female and&#xD;
      male condoms. Analyses of the follow-up study data will also include documentation of&#xD;
      exposure to project material, including open-ended questions on the ability to name a&#xD;
      relevant feature or message related to the material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have planned a nested cross-sectional design with baseline and follow-up observations,&#xD;
      implementing a randomized controlled community-level trial with neighborhood as the unit of&#xD;
      randomization and analysis. Neighborhoods will be block-randomized within cities to achieve&#xD;
      balance between intervention and control conditions on city-level factors. Assuming an&#xD;
      intraclass correlation of 0.02 with a sample size of 300 per neighborhood this study will&#xD;
      have 80% power to detect a difference in proportions between intervention and control&#xD;
      communities of 20% (45% vs. 36%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks-Subjects There are few anticipated risks related to this research. We believe that&#xD;
      participants may experience some embarrassment and or psychological discomfort related to the&#xD;
      subject content. There are no anticipated physical or legal risks faced by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators/Institutions There are no anticipated risks to investigators and institutions&#xD;
      related to this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits It is anticipated that any persons enrolled in the study who live in intervention&#xD;
      neighborhoods will be exposed to project materials that will contain useful information about&#xD;
      how to prevent pregnancy and STD infection. We will make campaign materials available in&#xD;
      control neighborhoods after collecting follow-up data, so this information will be available&#xD;
      for all study participants. If shown effective, this campaign will be an extremely cost&#xD;
      effective way to deliver important information and one that can reach a much larger audience&#xD;
      than that typically seen in clinic settings. If the program is shown not to be effective, we&#xD;
      will have useful data on the limitations of the POWER campaign for promotion of increased&#xD;
      condom use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding All funding for this study is provided by the Association of Teachers of Preventive&#xD;
      Medicine through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the baseline study will receive $10 for completing a questionnaire.&#xD;
      Participants in the follow-up study will receive $10 for completing a questionnaire. These&#xD;
      monies will be prorated, and women who partially complete a questionnaire will receive $5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special consent issues We seek a waiver of parental consent for those women aged 15-17&#xD;
      participating in the study. Justification for said waiver is included in the section on&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria above.&#xD;
