  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combat related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is the most common chronic psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder in the veteran population. Unfortunately, outcome studies of VA PTSD programs have&#xD;
      failed to show efficacy. VA PTSD patients have been significantly less responsive to&#xD;
      conventional therapies than other PTSD populations. Virtual Reality based exposure therapy&#xD;
      (VRE) allows patients to feel immersed in highly interactive computer-generated environments.&#xD;
      Within these environments patients can be exposed to anxiety-provoking stimuli in a gradual&#xD;
      and controlled manner so that they can become desensitized to these stimuli and, in the case&#xD;
      of PTSD, the traumatic memories evoked by these stimuli. The advantages of VRE include less&#xD;
      reliance on the patient's ability to visualize traumatic memories and making it more&#xD;
      difficult for patients to avoid memories during exposure therapy. It is also safer and more&#xD;
      convenient than in vivo exposure. In this study twenty Vietnam veterans are randomly assign&#xD;
      to either VRE or to a Treatment as Usual (TAU) control condition. Treatment would consist of&#xD;
      ten ninety-minute individual psychotherapy sessions for both groups. Assessments would occur&#xD;
      at pre-treatment, immediate post-treatment and at six months post-treatment.&#xD;

      Combat related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is the most common chronic psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder in the veteran population. PTSD is often disabling and is characterized by intrusive&#xD;
      re-experiencing of traumatic memories, avoidance/numbing, and increased arousal. An estimated&#xD;
      830,000 veterans currently have chronic PTSD symptoms. The VA has set up 145 specialized PTSD&#xD;
      programs. Unfortunately, outcome studies of VA PTSD programs have failed to show efficacy. VA&#xD;
      PTSD patients have been significantly less responsive to conventional therapies than other&#xD;
      PTSD populations including traditional Imaginal Exposure Therapy. Virtual Reality based&#xD;
      exposure therapy (VRE) allows patients to feel immersed in highly interactive&#xD;
      computer-generated environments. Within these environments patients can be exposed to&#xD;
      anxiety-provoking stimuli in a gradual and controlled manner so that they can become&#xD;
      desensitized to these stimuli and, in the case of PTSD, the traumatic memories evoked by&#xD;
      these stimuli. VRE therapy produced significant and lasting reductions in PTSD symptoms with&#xD;
      Vietnam veterans (N=14) in two open trials at the Atlanta VA. Two case studies of successful&#xD;
      PTSD treatment (one at the Boston VA and the other of a 9/11 survivor) provide additional&#xD;
      support for VRE. The advantages of VRE include less reliance on the patient's ability to&#xD;
      visualize traumatic memories and making it more difficult for patients to avoid memories&#xD;
      during exposure therapy. It is also safer and more convenient than in vivo exposure. The&#xD;
      proposed study would randomly assign twenty Vietnam veterans to either VRE or to a Treatment&#xD;
      as Usual (TAU) control condition. Treatment would consist of ten ninety-minute individual&#xD;
      psychotherapy sessions for both groups. Assessments would occur at pre-treatment, immediate&#xD;
      post-treatment and at six months post-treatment. VRE would use Virtual Vietnam computer&#xD;
      generated environments to desensitize patients to one or two of their most traumatic combat&#xD;
      related memories. VRE patients would wear a Head Mounted Display (HMD) that fits over their&#xD;
      eyes and ears. While in the HMD patients look into a stereoscopic computer display and&#xD;
      receive audio input through a set of headphones. Patients have reported a strong sense of&#xD;
      being present in a Vietnam-like place when in these environments. The therapist is in&#xD;
      constant contact with the patient through a microphone connected to the HMD. Patients recount&#xD;
      their traumatic experiences while the therapist augments these descriptions with visual and&#xD;
      auditory combat-related stimuli at the appropriate moments in time. The therapist can&#xD;
      control, on a moment-by-moment basis, the type and intensity of the VR exposure. The goal is&#xD;
      to provide the necessary level of stimuli to help the patient become engaged enough, long&#xD;
      enough, to desensitize to a traumatic memory without becoming overwhelmed by either the&#xD;
      external stimuli provided by the VR or the internal stimulus of the traumatic memory. In the&#xD;
      TAU condition therapy will focus on &quot;here-and-now&quot; issues with a problem solving focus of the&#xD;
      type that VA PTSD patients usually receive. The primary outcome measure will be the Clinician&#xD;
      Administered PTSD Scale. An Independent Assessor who will be blind to patients' treatment&#xD;
      conditions will conduct assessments. To insure patient safety, the Scale of Suicide Ideation&#xD;
      will be administered in both conditions once a week. Patients will be paid $75 for each of&#xD;
      the two post-treatment assessments. The hypotheses are: (1) VRE will produce significant&#xD;
      reductions in PTSD symptoms; (2) VRE will be significantly more effective than TAU; (3) VRE&#xD;
      symptom reduction will be maintained on six-month follow-up assessment. VRE may be a powerful&#xD;
      new tool in the treatment of PTSD. Controlled studies, like the one proposed, are needed to&#xD;
      explore its utility.&#xD;
