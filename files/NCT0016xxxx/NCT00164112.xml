  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have previously shown that a broad drug interaction screening can be performed using&#xD;
      enzyme specific probes such as oral caffeine for CYP1A2, N-acetyltrasferase-2 (NAT-2), and&#xD;
      xanthine oxidase (XO), warfarin plus vitamin K for CYP2C9, omeprazole for CYP 2C19,&#xD;
      dextromethorphan for CYP2D6, and midazolam for CYP3A4/5. This combination of probes has been&#xD;
      validated in the Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail (5+1).1 The use of the 5+1 cocktail provides&#xD;
      information on the drug metabolizing enzymes that metabolize 90% of hepatically eliminated&#xD;
      drugs for a fraction of the costs of the individual studies. Using a cocktail of biomarkers&#xD;
      reduces the overall cost of drug interaction screening. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved oral antibiotics&#xD;
      (azithromycin, telithromycin, and levofloxacin) on metabolism of other medications when taken&#xD;
      together. This will be determined by the measuring the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes&#xD;
      following administration of certain drug probes (caffeine, dextromethorphan, omeprazole,&#xD;
      midazolam, and warfarin with vitamin K). A total of 16 subjects will complete four phases of&#xD;
      the study: 1) Cooperstown 5+1 alone, 2) Azithromycin plus Cooperstown 5+1, 3) Telithromycin&#xD;
      plus Cooperstown 5+1, and 4) Levofloxacin plus Cooperstown 5+1.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the purpose of this study? What question is it designed to answer?&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare the effect of azithromycin, telithromycin, and levofloxacin on activity of 7&#xD;
           hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes using the Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Why is this study important?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously shown that a broad drug interaction screening can be performed using&#xD;
      enzyme specific probes such as oral caffeine for CYP1A2, N-acetyltrasferase-2 (NAT-2), and&#xD;
      xanthine oxidase (XO), warfarin plus vitamin K for CYP2C9, omeprazole for CYP 2C19,&#xD;
      dextromethorphan for CYP2D6, and midazolam for CYP3A4/5. This combination of probes has been&#xD;
      validated in the Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail (5+1).1 The use of the 5+1 cocktail provides&#xD;
      information on the drug metabolizing enzymes that metabolize 90% of hepatically eliminated&#xD;
      drugs for a fraction of the costs of the individual studies. Using a cocktail of biomarkers&#xD;
      reduces the overall cost of drug interaction screening. The FDA has indicated that the use of&#xD;
      probe drugs can be done in place of specific drug interaction studies.2 This streamlines the&#xD;
      detection of drug interactions and reduces costs. However, it is important to control for&#xD;
      genetic polymorphism in drug interaction trials so that genetic makeup does not affect the&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods 3) Describe in detail the experimental design and&#xD;
      methodology. What information will be collected and how will it be collected? Provide a&#xD;
      description of the subject's participation from start to finish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any procedure of the study each subject will provide written informed consent. All&#xD;
      the subjects will be genotyped for CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 after obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent for pharmacogenomics. This is to distinguish poor metabolizers from extensive&#xD;
      metabolizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prestudy screening will be conducted within 4 weeks of the first study phase. Subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a complete medical history, social history (including medication, alcohol, and&#xD;
      tobacco use), physical examination, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory&#xD;
      screening to assure that inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. The laboratory screening&#xD;
      data to be obtained are: complete blood count, prothrombin time (PT), international&#xD;
      normalized ratio (INR), macroscopic and microscopic urinalysis, electrolytes, blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT),&#xD;
      total bilirubin, and serum albumin. Women of childbearing potential (defined as premenopausal&#xD;
      with no history of hysterectomy or tubal ligation) will undergo a serum pregnancy test during&#xD;
      the screening visit and a urine pregnancy test prior to each phase of the study. Following&#xD;
      enrollment, subjects will participate in each of the 4 study phases in a random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Procedures This will be a randomized, crossover, open-label study. Prestudy&#xD;
      screening will be conducted within 4 weeks of the first study phase. Screening visits will&#xD;
      involve obtaining informed consent, medical history, social history, physical examination,&#xD;
      ECG, and laboratory tests. Following enrollment, subjects will be randomized (and then&#xD;
      crossed over) to 4 phases as described in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. Study Design Study Drugs and Procedure Phase 1 (control) Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail&#xD;
      alone. The Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail consists of the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Caffeine (2 mg/kg orally, rounded to nearest 50 mg) with collection of a 12-hour urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Warfarin (10 mg + 10 mg vitamin K orally) with collection of plasma over 96 hours.&#xD;
           Plasma collection times are at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 hours after dosing.&#xD;
           The INR will be checked at 48 hours. If the INR is &gt;1.7, 5 mg of vitamin K will be&#xD;
           administered by mouth daily until the INR is 1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Omeprazole (40 mg orally) with collection of a plasma sample 2 hours after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dextromethorphan (30 mg orally) with collection of a 12-hour urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Midazolam (0.075 mg/kg orally) with collection of 8 plasma samples over 6 hours (only&#xD;
           for Phase 1) to determine CYP3A activity (MDZ CL/F mL/min). Samples will be drawn&#xD;
           immediately after midazolam administration (0 minute), then at 5 minute, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5&#xD;
           and 6 hours. Breathing, heart rate, and oxygen saturation will be monitored via pulse&#xD;
           oximetry for the first 90 minutes after midazolam dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 2 Azithromycin 500 mg qAM for 3 days on an empty stomach. On day 4, the&#xD;
           Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail will be administered with a fourth dose of azithromycin given 2&#xD;
           hours after 5+1 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 3 Telithromycin 800 mg qAM for 3 days on an empty stomach. On day 4, the&#xD;
           Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail will be administered with a fourth dose of telithromycin given&#xD;
           2 hours after 5+1 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 4 Levofloxacin 750 mg qAM for 3 days on an empty stomach. On day 4, the&#xD;
           Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail will be administered with a fourth dose of levofloxacin given 2&#xD;
           hours after 5+1 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the azithromycin, telithromycin, and levofloxacin phases, plasma samples for&#xD;
           midazolam will be collected at 0.25, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours to&#xD;
           allow for adequate sampling with drugs that potentially inhibit CYP3A. The 5+1 cocktail&#xD;
           will be administered on day 4 after a minimum of 8-hour fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will not be allowed to eat until 2 hours after administration of study drugs&#xD;
           (5+1 cocktail or antibiotic).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Washout periods: One week after each phase except for the azithromycin phase is required&#xD;
           to ensure the drug is completely eliminated from the body. Three weeks after the&#xD;
           azithromycin phase is required since azithromycin has a longer half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample Collection and Analysis • For caffeine phenotyping, subjects will collect all of&#xD;
           their urine for 12 hours after receiving the dose to determine CYP1A2 activity&#xD;
           [(AFMU+1X+1U)/17U], NAT-2 [AFMU/(AFMU+1X+1U)], and XO [1U/(1X+1U)]. Urine will be&#xD;
           acidified with ascorbic acid (in vitro) to prevent AFMU conversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • For warfarin phenotyping, blood samples will be obtained at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48,&#xD;
           72 and 96 hours following warfarin plus vitamin K administration to determine CYP2C9&#xD;
           activity (S-warfarin CL/F, mL/min). For the first 12 hours, blood will be obtained&#xD;
           through an intravenous (IV) catheter. Thereafter it will be via venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • For omeprazole phenotyping, one 15 mL blood sample will be drawn 2 hours after the&#xD;
           oral omeprazole dose to determine CYP2C19 activity (OMP/5OH OMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           • For dextromethorphan phenotyping, subjects will collect all of their urine for 12&#xD;
           hours after receiving the dose to determine CYP2D6 activity (DM/DX).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For midazolam phenotyping, use of oral midazolam gives an assessment of inhibition&#xD;
                of both gut and hepatic CYP3A.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  For Phase 1 (5+1 cocktail alone), 8 blood samples (10 mL each) will be&#xD;
                     obtained immediately after midazolam administration (0 minute), then at 5&#xD;
                     minutes, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hours to determine CYP3A activity (MDZ CL/F,&#xD;
                     mL/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  During the azithromycin, telithromycin, and levofloxacin phases, blood samples&#xD;
                     will be collected at 0.25, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours (to&#xD;
                     allow for adequate sampling with drugs that potentially inhibit CYP3A).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All blood samples (except 15 mL for omeprazole) will be collected in duplicate in&#xD;
                10 mL EDTA-containing test tubes and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 2800 rpm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Plasma and urine samples will be frozen at -80C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Analysis • Caffeine phenotyping assay: Urine aliquots will be assayed to determine&#xD;
           urinary concentration of 1U, 1X, 17U, and AFMU. Urine aliquots will be analyzed at&#xD;
           University of Missouri, Kansas City. Caffeine demethylation ratios will be used to&#xD;
           express CYP1A2, NAT-2, and XO activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • S- and R-warfarin phenotyping assay: S- and R-warfarin in plasma will be determined&#xD;
           utilizing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis at the University of&#xD;
           North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Warfarin clearance will be determined using&#xD;
           non-compartmental analysis. WinNonlin® 3.1 will be used for pharmacokinetic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Omeprazole phenotyping assay: Blood samples will be analyzed at the University of&#xD;
           North Carolina, Chapel Hill, to determine plasma concentrations of OMP and 5OH OMP. The&#xD;
           ratio of OMP and 5OH OMP at 2 hours following the oral dose of omeprazole will be used&#xD;
           to describe CYP2C19 activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Dextromethorphan phenotyping assay: Urine aliquots will be analyzed at University of&#xD;
           Missouri, Kansas City, to determine urinary concentrations of DM/DX. The&#xD;
           dextromethorphan metabolic ratio will be used to describe CYP2D6 activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Midazolam phenotyping assay: Blood samples will be analyzed to determine plasma&#xD;
           concentration of midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam, and 4-hydroxymidazolam. Analyses will be&#xD;
           performed at Oneida Research Services, Inc. using a proprietary LC/MS/MS method.&#xD;
           Midazolam clearance will be used to reflect CYP3A activity and clearance will be&#xD;
           determined by using non-compartmental analysis of midazolam plasma concentration-time&#xD;
           data. WinNonlin® 3.1 will be used for pharmacokinetic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample size: Using =0.05, four treatment phases, and =0.20 (power of 80%), an&#xD;
                estimated sample size of sixteen volunteers will detect a 25% difference in&#xD;
                metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data will be analyzed using the FDA's standard bioequivalency testing.3 If the drug&#xD;
                phases fall outside of the 0.8-1.25 range versus the control phase, BE will not be&#xD;
                shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) If the research is in part a treatment protocol, identify which parts are routine and&#xD;
      which parts are being done solely for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is for research purposes.&#xD;
