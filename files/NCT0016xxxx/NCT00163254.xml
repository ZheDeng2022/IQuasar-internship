  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Below-Study is a randomized, prospective mono-centre trial on the efficacy and safety the&#xD;
      adjunctive use of a GP IIb/IIIa antagonist for prevention of early reocclusion in arterial&#xD;
      below-the knee interventions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTA below the knee is limited due to subacute reocclusions and uncertain long-term results.&#xD;
      This study is designed as a feasibility trial, which compares the two new treatment&#xD;
      modalities: drug eluting stents and GP IIb/IIIa blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with current ulcers (Rutherford 5, or 6) are randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      treatment groups: [1] ReoPro + Sirolimus coated stent, [2] ReoPro + bare Stent, [3] ReoPro +&#xD;
      PTA, [4] PTA without ReoPro. Angiographic control will be at 2 and 6 months with block wise&#xD;
      randomisation to the treatment groups.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of peripheral artery disease with below the knee artery&#xD;
             occlusion, or stenosis which mandates PTA or stent administration as first treatment&#xD;
             modality. The history of peripheral artery occlusion has to at least 6 weeks, and the&#xD;
             target vessel occlusion has to be no longer than 5 centimeters in length&#xD;
             (corresponding to a maximum of 2 stents per treated lesion). The number of treated&#xD;
             lesions per vessel in this study is limited to three. Only the major lesion will be&#xD;
             allocated to one of the study groups, the other lesions will be treated by&#xD;
             conventional PTA. A documentation of distal outflow (no occlusion until 3 cm above the&#xD;
             upper joint ankle) is mandatory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe stage of PAD with ulceration(s) corresponding to Rutherford stage 5 or 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
