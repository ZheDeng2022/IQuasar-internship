      The study is designed to see if stress echocardiography can be used as a screening exam in&#xD;
      peri-, or post-menopausal women with a risk of developing of coronary artery disease and&#xD;

      The clinical trial is designed to determine the prognostic value of stress echocardiography&#xD;
      as a screening examination in peri-, or post-menopausal female patients with an intermediate&#xD;
      likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) based on risk factors to identify patients at&#xD;
      higher risk of experiencing future cardiac events.Female patients who are able to adequately&#xD;
      exercise will undergo a symptom-limited exercise echocardiogram. Patients who are unable to&#xD;
      adequately exercise or are predicted to be unable to exercise adequately (because of&#xD;
      orthopedic/neurologic limitations, lung disease or debility), will perform dobutamine stress&#xD;
      echocardiography. All patients will receive DEFINITY at rest and stress to enhance wall&#xD;
      motion assessment.&#xD;

    <description>A subset of the study population of peri- or post-meopausal female participants with an intermediate pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) was assessed for brachial artery reactivity at baseline. Brachial diameter was assessed using ultrasound and a pressure cuff both before and after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin.

    <description>Coronary artery calcium scoring assesses calcification of the coronary arteries using electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). It is a sum of lesion scores of area and density above a threshold density. There is no intrinsic upper limit to the calcium score but values above 1000 may not be measurable.&#xD;
A subset of peri- or post-meopausal females with an intermediate pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) received resting EBCT at baseline.

The unenhanced and DEFINITY-enhanced rest and stress echocardiography imaging sessions will be performed on the same day. For the DEFINITY-enhanced imaging sessions all patients will receive diluted DEFINITY intravenously (IV). Diluted DEFINITY will be prepared by mixing 1 mL of activated DEFINITY® with 9 mL of normal saline in a 10 mL syringe.</description>

The unenhanced and DEFINITY-enhanced rest and stress echocardiography imaging sessions will be performed on the same day. For the DEFINITY-enhanced imaging sessions all patients will receive diluted DEFINITY intravenously (IV). Diluted DEFINITY will be prepared by mixing 1 mL of activated DEFINITY® with 9 mL of normal saline in a 10 mL syringe.&#xD;

        <description>In the sub-set of efficacy-evaluable participants who underwent clinically indicated coronary angiography, the accuracy of exercise echocardiography vs. angiography was determined for the detection of CAD. Positive angiography was defined as any stenosis greater than or equal to 50% in any vessel. Wall motion index change indicating abnormal motion was defined as greater than or equal to 13% in 2 or more segments. Angiography was required to have taken place within 60 days following stress echocardiography.</description>

        <description>Prognostic value of stress ECG testing for identifying female patients at increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 5-year follow-up&#xD;
Peri- or post-meopausal female participants with an intermediate pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) received resting ECG at baseline. ECG was evaluated as normal or abnormal. The results were compared to patient history on 5-year follow up to identify the potential for ECG to predict those at higher risk of experiencing future major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 5-year follow up.&#xD;
Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) are defined as&#xD;
Cardiac death&#xD;
Myocardial infarction&#xD;

The unenhanced and DEFINITY-enhanced rest and stress echocardiography imaging sessions will be performed on the same day. For the DEFINITY-enhanced imaging sessions all patients will receive diluted DEFINITY intravenously (IV). Diluted DEFINITY will be prepared by mixing 1 mL of activated DEFINITY® with 9 mL of normal saline in a 10 mL syringe.&#xD;

        <title>Mean Calcium Score of Participants With and Without Major Cardiac Events at 5-year Follow up.</title>
        <description>Coronary artery calcium scoring assesses calcification of the coronary arteries using electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). It is a sum of lesion scores of area and density above a threshold density. There is no intrinsic upper limit to the calcium score but values above 1000 may not be measurable.&#xD;
A subset of peri- or post-meopausal females with an intermediate pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) received resting EBCT at baseline. Images were evaluated for calcium score and results compared to patient history on 5-year follow up, Mean calcium score with confidence interval was summarized for subjects with and without major cardiac events (MACE) at 5-year follow up&#xD;
Calcium score for general population:&#xD;
Score Description Relative Risk 0 No evidence of CAD 0 1-112 Average Risk of CAD 1.9 100-400 Moderate risk of CAD 4.3 400-999 High risk of CAD 7.2 1000 Very high risk of CAD 10.8</description>
