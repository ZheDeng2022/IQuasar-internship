      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge on the same day after uncomplicated trans-radial coronary artery stenting is&#xD;
           safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalized patients can be safely returned to the referring center the same day&#xD;
           following trans-radial coronary artery stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abciximab given as a single bolus with optimal trans-radial coronary artery stenting is&#xD;
           as safe and effective as bolus + 12 hrs perfusion and does not hamper early discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Same-day discharge is cost-effective and increases patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND END-POINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the present study are to assess the effectiveness and safety of same day&#xD;
      hospital discharge after uncomplicated coronary artery stenting when a single bolus of&#xD;
      Abciximab is used. The primary end-point of the study is the composite of death, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, repeat hospitalization, urgent revascularization, severe thrombocytopenia, access&#xD;
      site complications and major bleedings at 30 days following stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end-point is the composite of death, myocardial infarction, repeat target&#xD;
      vessel revascularization at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year following stent implantation. Other&#xD;
      secondary end-points include the total hospital stay (days) between the index procedure and&#xD;
      the first 30 days follow-up, the number of unsolicited medical visits in relation with the&#xD;
      percutaneous procedure, index of patient satisfaction and direct and indirect costs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite significant improvements in clinical results associated with the current use of&#xD;
      stenting and pharmacologic agents there has been little modification in hospitalization&#xD;
      duration after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The main reasons associated with&#xD;
      prolonged hospitalization after PCI remain 1) the fear of abrupt vessel closure and its&#xD;
      associated morbidity 2) the need for prolonged bed rest in case of femoral approach even&#xD;
      after use of device closures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of coronary stents has been associated with a dramatic decrease in vessel&#xD;
      closure once it was recognized that stent deployment required higher pressure balloon&#xD;
      inflation and increased antiplatelet therapy. Trans-radial coronary interventions appear&#xD;
      safer and more cost-effective than femoral PCI. However, the current use of IIb-IIIa&#xD;
      inhibitors prohibits the early discharge of patients following PCI because their pharmacology&#xD;
      generally imposes to pursue drug infusion between 18 and 24 hrs following PCI which does not&#xD;
      allow same day discharge from the hospital. With Abciximab, however, pharmacologic data&#xD;
      indicate that prolonged platelet inhibition (≥ 80%) occurs after a single bolus. Based on the&#xD;
      EPIC trial results, it has been recommended to prolong platelet inhibition by a 12 hrs&#xD;
      perfusion. By analyzing carefully the EPIC trial results, we hypothesized that after optimal&#xD;
      stenting result, a single bolus of Abciximab would suffice. We aim to demonstrate that (1)&#xD;
      with trans-radial coronary stenting at least 50% of the entire population referred for PCI&#xD;
      could be safely discharged after a few hours observation; (2) a single bolus of Abciximab is&#xD;
      at least as effective as current recommended treatment with a bolus + 12 hrs perfusion after&#xD;
      uncomplicated stenting. This new regimen could significantly affect current practice,&#xD;
      decrease hospital costs and increase patient satisfaction after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized single-center study comparing same day hospital discharge to&#xD;
      overnight hospitalization after uncomplicated trans-radial coronary artery stenting.&#xD;
      Out-patients will be randomized after successful stent implantation to same day discharge or&#xD;
      will remain hospitalized at Laval Hospital until the next morning. Hospitalized patients will&#xD;
      be randomized after successful stent implantation to either same day discharge at home or to&#xD;
      overnight hospitalization (either at the referring center or at Laval Hospital). All eligible&#xD;
      patients will be treated with Abciximab that will be administered according to 2 different&#xD;
      arms: For patients randomized to same-day discharge, only a bolus of Abciximab will be given,&#xD;
      whereas for all remaining patients, Abciximab will be given according to current practice&#xD;
      i.e. bolus + 12 hrs perfusion. All patients which will not be eligible post-PCI will enter a&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
