      Urolithiasis is a common condition in the United States, and is associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and even mortality. The most commonly occurring urinary calculi are comprised of&#xD;
      calcium oxalate salts, and until recently, the pathogenesis of calcium oxalate calculi was&#xD;
      poorly understood. New evidence, however, suggests that the development of calcium oxalate&#xD;
      calculi may be intimately associated with hydroxyapatite (HA) plaque, also known as Randall's&#xD;
      plaque, which is located on the renal papillae. The investigators have previously&#xD;
      demonstrated that Randall's plaque originates in the thin ascending limb of the loop of&#xD;
      Henle, and they have shown that Randall's plaque is composed of HA (Evan, Lingeman et al.&#xD;
      2003). As well, the amount of Randall's plaque correlates with elevated levels of urinary&#xD;
      calcium and decreased urinary volume, risk factors for the formation of calcium oxalate&#xD;
      calculi (Kuo, Lingeman et al. 2003). In the course of these previous studies, the&#xD;
      investigators have anecdotally noted that calcium oxalate stones are often found attached to&#xD;
      Randall's plaque, an observation that others have reported as well (Prien 1949; Carr 1954;&#xD;
      Cifuentes Delatte, Minon-Cifuentes et al. 1987). However, there has been no in-vivo, rigorous&#xD;
      documentation of this &quot;attached stone&quot; relationship. Attached calculi represent an important&#xD;
      point in the pathogenesis of calcium oxalate calculi, as they correspond to a moment in time&#xD;
      where there is a continuum between the HA plaque of Randall and the calcium oxalate stone,&#xD;
      thus linking the origin of plaque with the development of stone. A better understanding of&#xD;
      the phenomenon of attached calculi will lead to a better understanding of how and why calcium&#xD;
      oxalate stones form, which may ultimately direct future interventions to attenuate stone&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;

      Urolithiasis is a very common condition in the United States, with an estimated prevalence of&#xD;
      11.7% by age 70. Furthermore, it has been associated with considerable patient morbidity and&#xD;
      occasional mortality (Stamatelou, Francis et al. 2003). Direct costs associated with the&#xD;
      treatment of renal calculi are enormous, as over 600,000 stone related medical procedures are&#xD;
      performed annually in the United States (shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), ureteroscopy (URS),&#xD;
      percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PERC), stone removal, ureteral stents, and stone basketing&#xD;
      (source: Boston Scientific Corporation). Although the last two decades have seen considerable&#xD;
      advances in less invasive techniques for the treatment of symptomatic stone episodes, as well&#xD;
      as progress in mitigating the risks of new stone formation, our knowledge of the inciting&#xD;
      lesion in human urolithiasis remains rudimentary and much debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, the sequence of events that leads to the formation of urinary calculi were&#xD;
      poorly understood, most fundamentally due to the lack of appropriate in-vivo data. Earlier&#xD;
      theories of calculogenesis proposed that stones could result from tubular epithelial injury&#xD;
      due to oxalate toxicity, a lack of urinary inhibitors of crystal formation or crystal epitaxy&#xD;
      on a pre-existing nidus (Khan, Finlayson et al. 1979). Theoretical work on free and fixed&#xD;
      particle growth indicated that a transit time from the collecting duct to the bladder of only&#xD;
      10 minutes provided insufficient time for a crystal to grow to a clinically meaningful size&#xD;
      (Jonassen, Cooney et al. 1999). Morphological classification of the directional growth of&#xD;
      calculi supported the necessity for a fixed point of origin, in the absence of obstruction&#xD;
      (Hinman 1979). These observations suggested that most stones must initiate from a fixed point&#xD;
      or nidus in the collecting system or renal papilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such nidus, first described more than sixty years ago by Alexander Randall, was proposed&#xD;
      to be the originating lesion for the formation of calcium oxalate stones (Randall 1936;&#xD;
      Randall 1937; Randall 1940). In microscopic studies of renal papilla obtained at necropsy, he&#xD;
      demonstrated the presence of 2-3mm lesions in 19.6% of patients that were composed of calcium&#xD;
      phosphate and devoid of evidence of inflammation. Adherent to this, in 65 of 1,514 pairs of&#xD;
      kidneys, he identified nascent stones composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. When&#xD;
      these stones reached sufficient size, he hypothesized that they would break free, taking with&#xD;
      them the underlying plaque. In subsequent work, 256 voided or removed calculi were examined&#xD;
      and 106 gave visible evidence of mural attachment (Randall 1940). Later microradiographic&#xD;
      studies would confirm the presence of plaque in a papillary location that could be&#xD;
      co-localized with stone (Carr 1954). Unfortunately, all earlier studies of stone pathogenesis&#xD;
      have suffered from lack of definition of clear clinical stone-forming phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are intriguing reports to support Randall's, and our, hypothesis that stones originate&#xD;
      from a fixed plaque composed of HA. Earlier microscopic studies of stone structure&#xD;
      demonstrated the presence of concavities on small stones compatible with a point of mural&#xD;
      attachment and indicated that apatite may be present at the attachment point (Rosenow 1940;&#xD;
      Prien 1949). In an early x-ray diffraction and crystallographic study of 10,000 urinary&#xD;
      calculi, Herring noted that HA was frequently found as the nucleus of calcium oxalate&#xD;
      monohydrate, usually as a small discoid plaque which was felt to resemble Randall's plaque&#xD;
      (Herring 1962). Later, Chambers performed an electron probe analysis of 115 small renal&#xD;
      calculi. Of 92 predominantly calcium oxalate stones, he was able to identify small central&#xD;
      areas of HA, usually 10-200 microns in diameter, in 70 (Chambers, Hodgkinson et al. 1972).&#xD;
      Using scanning electron microscopy and x-ray dispersive energy, Cifuentes Delatte found that&#xD;
      63 of 87 passed calcium oxalate stones had evidence of plaque (Cifuentes Delatte,&#xD;
      Minon-Cifuentes et al. 1985). Observation of uncalcified tubular lumens found in conjunction&#xD;
      with these plaques suggested an interstitial papillary tip origin of this material (Cifuentes&#xD;
      Delatte, Minon-Cifuentes et al. 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have noted that when endoscopically examining the renal papillae of patients undergoing&#xD;
      PERC, oftentimes stones attached to renal papillae are encountered. We have collected three&#xD;
      attached stones from three separate patients who were undergoing PERC. The stones were&#xD;
      analyzed with a Micro CT device, and 3-D reconstruction with identification of mineral&#xD;
      components was performed. The stones all showed multiple mineral components, including&#xD;
      calcium oxalate, apatite, and probable regions of poorly mineralized matrix. Although the&#xD;
      significance of these various components, in varying amounts, is not yet well understood, it&#xD;
      is apparent that even at early stages of stone formation, multiple minerals in complex&#xD;
      arrangement are present in papilla-attached stones. It will be only through a rigorous,&#xD;
      prospectively designed protocol that the significance of attached renal calculi will be&#xD;
      understood. By demonstrating that renal calculi in a population of common calcium oxalate&#xD;
      stone formers originate from an HA plaque, we would link in a substantive way the origin of&#xD;
      plaque with the subsequent development of stone.&#xD;
