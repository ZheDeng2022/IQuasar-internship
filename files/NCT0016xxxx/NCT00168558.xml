      The specific aims are to examine in Guinea-Bissau:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether the standard titre Schwarz (SW) or standard-titre Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) measles&#xD;
           vaccine will be the best vaccine strain for use in a routine one-dose measles&#xD;
           vaccination schedule and a two-dose measles vaccination schedule in terms of antibody&#xD;
           response, protection against measles and child survival, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether the standard-titre Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) vaccine will be suitable for use in a&#xD;
           very early two-dose schedule vaccinating at 4½ and 9 months of age&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two dose schedules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the failure of the high-titre measles vaccine, which was to be administered at 6 months&#xD;
      of age it was suggested to perform trials of early two-dose measles vaccination schedules to&#xD;
      lower the age of vaccination. The standard titre SW measles vaccine has been shown to be&#xD;
      associated with a non-specific beneficial effect on child mortality that cannot be ascribed&#xD;
      to the protection against measles. The two measles vaccines most commonly used in the&#xD;
      Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) are the standard titre SW and the standard titre EZ&#xD;
      vaccine. Surprisingly, these two vaccines have never been compared in a randomised trial with&#xD;
      child mortality as end-point, and it is not clear which would be most suitable for use in a&#xD;
      two-dose vaccination schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 1995 to 2002, all children in the BHP study area were included in an early two-dose&#xD;
      measles vaccination trial from 6 months of age. The children were randomised to either a&#xD;
      one-dose group receiving an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) at 6 months of age and a measles&#xD;
      vaccine at 9 months of age, or a two-dose group receiving two doses of measles vaccine at 6&#xD;
      and 9 months of age. For the first 6 months of the trial, the standard-titre EZ measles&#xD;
      vaccine was used, for the rest of the trial the standard-titre SW vaccine was used. Results&#xD;
      from the trial showed that an early two-dose schedule increased coverage considerably and&#xD;
      provided better protection against measles among infants than the recommended one-dose at 9&#xD;
      months of age schedule. The EZ and the SW vaccine were used in two different cohorts - so a&#xD;
      direct comparison was not possible, but the EZ vaccine seemed to boost a secondary immune&#xD;
      response better than the SW vaccine. Further, the SW vaccine was less able to induce a&#xD;
      protective level of antibodies when used from 6 months of age than the EZ vaccine. The&#xD;
      preliminary data that we have on long-term vaccine efficacy supports that the SW vaccine&#xD;
      might be less suitable than the EZ vaccine for use in very early measles vaccine schedules&#xD;
      (unpublished data). On the other hand, trials performed during the 1980's in Mexico and&#xD;
      Bangladesh have shown that administration of the standard-titre EZ vaccine to infants as&#xD;
      young as 4-6 months of age gave good seroconversion results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Global Measles Strategic Plan 2001-2005 developed by the WHO and UNICEF states that all&#xD;
      children should be guaranteed a second opportunity for measles vaccination either through&#xD;
      campaigns or routine immunisation. The best strategy for protection of infants living in&#xD;
      overcrowded urban African societies and who run a great risk of contracting measles before&#xD;
      the recommended age of immunisation, will probably be early vaccination followed by a second&#xD;
      vaccination later in childhood. If, in a vaccination campaign strategy, administration of the&#xD;
      first vaccine is postponed this could dramatically increase the measles incidence in children&#xD;
      below the age of vaccination. To this add that vaccination campaigns have not yet been&#xD;
      evaluated in Africa in terms of childhood mortality relative to the routine schedule. Some&#xD;
      children might get two, three or even more measles vaccines in an uncontrolled and not&#xD;
      necessarily beneficial manner. Thus finding the best schedule and vaccine strain for use in a&#xD;
      routine two-dose schedule seems a better approach for this region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We thus propose to conduct a study comparing the standard-titre SW measles vaccine and the&#xD;
      standard-titre EZ measles vaccine in a one- or two-dose schedule providing the first dose at&#xD;
      9 months of age, and then randomising the children at 18 months of age to receive either an&#xD;
      additional dose of vaccine or nothing. The groups will be compared in terms of&#xD;
      seroconversion-rate, proportion with an non-protective antibody level, geometric mean titer&#xD;
      antibody level, vaccine efficacy, and child mortality. Further we plan to test the&#xD;
      standard-titre EZ vaccine in a very early two-dose schedule providing the first dose at 4½&#xD;
      months of age and the second dose at 9 months of age (see also non-specific effect of&#xD;
      vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that measles elimination vaccination campaigns will take place in the study area&#xD;
      during the trial. The date of vaccination and the type of measles vaccine used in such&#xD;
      campaigns will be noted, as well as simultaneous vitamin A supplementation; and the&#xD;
      information will be included in the final data-analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-specific effect of vaccination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measles vaccine has in several community studies from different parts of the world been&#xD;
      shown to have a non-specific beneficial effect on child mortality. That means that the&#xD;
      protection against death mediated by the vaccine exceeds the disease specific effect, ie the&#xD;
      vaccine not only prevents deaths caused by measles, but also other deaths, presumably due to&#xD;
      a non-specific immune stimulation providing protection from other infections than measles.&#xD;
      For example, during the war in Guinea-Bissau that broke out on June 7, 1998, the population&#xD;
      fled and the health care system broke down. There was no routine vaccination for at least a 3&#xD;
      months period. Hence, when the war started there was a group of infants who had been&#xD;
      randomised to early SW measles vaccination at 6 months or IPV and who did not receive the&#xD;
      standard-titre SW measles vaccine at 9 month that they would otherwise have been given. This&#xD;
      natural experiment represents the first randomised study of the mortality effect of SW&#xD;
      measles vaccine. The mortality ratios for measles vaccinated children were 0.29 (0.08-1.03,&#xD;
      p=0.041) and 0.31 (0.10-0.94) over the first 3 and 7 months of the war.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to measles vaccination, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccination has been&#xD;
      associated with a negative effect on child mortality. Current studies indicate that the&#xD;
      negative effect of DTP may be neutralized by a subsequent measles vaccination. The design of&#xD;
      the proposed trial will allow us to test whether the negative effect of the DTP vaccine,&#xD;
      which is administered by the EPI-programme at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, can be reverted by&#xD;
      administration of a measles vaccine 4 weeks after the last DTP vaccination at around 4½&#xD;
      months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-specific effects of vaccination are sex-specific. Girls benefit most from beneficial&#xD;
      non-specific effects, and suffer most from apparently harmful non-specific effects of&#xD;
      vaccination. Non-specific effects of measles vaccination may also show interaction with&#xD;
      season, the beneficial effect of measles vaccination being largest in the dry season&#xD;
      (unpublished), suggesting that some unknown immunological factors play a role. Season has a&#xD;
      large influence on health in West Africa, and both morbidity and mortality, as well as&#xD;
      immunologic parameters such as delayed-type hypersensitivity, T-cells, thymus size and&#xD;
      measles antibody levels which are associated with season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to investigate the interactions of sex and season with measles vaccination and will&#xD;
      assure that data on morbidity and immunologic parameters will be collected both in the dry as&#xD;
      well as in the rainy season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time table:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study began in July 2003, and with a sample size of 5.755 and a possible 2.000 children&#xD;
      included per year, the inclusion period for the trial will be about 3 years.&#xD;
