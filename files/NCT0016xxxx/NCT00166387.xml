  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several non-genetic and genetic factors that could influence the risk of inhibitor&#xD;
      development in hemophilia A have been discussed but not fully explored. The aim of the HIGS&#xD;
      is to identify these genetic factors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the HIGS is to determine host genetic factors, other than mutations within&#xD;
      the factor VIII gene, that are associated with the development of inhibitors in severe&#xD;
      hemophilia A and response to antigenic challenge by factor VIII. The study will involve three&#xD;
      phases, enrolling family groups composed of brother pairs and their parents (Phase I) and&#xD;
      siblings, a family group composed of a person with severe hemophilia and his parents (Phase&#xD;
      II), and a group of unrelated people with severe hemophilia for the purpose of confirming&#xD;
      associations identified in Phases I and II.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe hemophilia A is defined as a baseline factor VIII level &lt;1%. A history of&#xD;
             inhibitor is defined as ever having a Bethesda titer &gt; 1 BU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with hemophilia are eligible for Phase I of the study if all of the following&#xD;
        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An informed consent form, approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC, has been administered,&#xD;
             signed, and dated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has severe hemophilia A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a history of inhibitor or the subject has no history of inhibitor but&#xD;
             has at least 100 exposure days to factor VIII products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient documentation exists to identify the subject's maximum lifetime Bethesda&#xD;
             titer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a history of inhibitor and has one or more full brothers with severe&#xD;
             hemophilia A, with or without an inhibitor, who are eligible for and have agreed to be&#xD;
             in the study, and two parents who have agreed to be in the study or the subject does&#xD;
             not have a history of inhibitor but has one or more full brothers with severe&#xD;
             hemophilia A and a history of inhibitor who are eligible for and have agreed to be in&#xD;
             the study, and two parents who have agreed to be in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects without hemophilia are eligible for Phase I of the study if all of the following&#xD;
        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An informed consent form, approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC, has been administered,&#xD;
             signed, and dated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is the parent (mother or father) of, or the full sibling of, a subject&#xD;
             with hemophilia who is eligible for Phase I of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase II.&#xD;
