  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and refine an observational assessment tool called the Personal&#xD;
      Computer Keyboard Style (PeCKS). When completed this assessment tool will provide researchers&#xD;
      and clinicians with a valid and reliable method to describe computer keyboarding postures and&#xD;
      kinematics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be divided into two phases. Phase I will be devoted to developing and&#xD;
      refining an instrument, the Pre-PeCKS, into a valid and reliable data gathering observational&#xD;
      tool. In Phase II the Pre-PeCKS will be used to develop a predictive model that can&#xD;
      discriminate between those with and without MSD-UE. The model developed will be used to&#xD;
      select the construction and weighting of the subscales of the final instrument, the PeCKS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - PeCKS psychometrics - reliability and validity Specific Aim 1: To evaluate inter-&#xD;
      and intra-rater reliability and the concurrent criterion-related validity of the Pre-PeCKS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.1.1 The Pre-PeCKS will demonstrate acceptable reliability for the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.1.1a. Intra-rater reliability (stability within one rater) H.1.1b. Inter-rater reliability&#xD;
      (stability across raters) H.1.1c. Test of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) (stability&#xD;
      across items)&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.1.2 The Pre-PeCKS will demonstrate good concurrent criterion-related validity - Parameters&#xD;
      selected by raters using the Pre-PeCKS will significantly correlate with biomechanical&#xD;
      measures (VICON™ motion recording and analysis system and force plate):&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.1.2.a. Angles and displacements identified by raters using the Pre-PeCKS will correlate&#xD;
      with angles and displacements measured by the VICON™ motion recording and analysis system;&#xD;
      H.1.2.b. Number of times spent performing actions as specified by raters using the Pre-PeCKS&#xD;
      will correlate with number of times measured by a VICON™ motion recording and analysis&#xD;
      system; H.1.2.c. Level of forceful keying as specified by raters using the Pre-PeCKS will&#xD;
      correlate with levels of forceful keying measured with a force plate under the keyboard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - PeCKS psychometrics - diagnostic tool development&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To use information gathered using the Pre-PeCKS to develop a diagnostic&#xD;
      instrument that can identify those with and without MSD-UE. The major hypothesis related to&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.2.1. Using information gathered with the Pre-PeCKS and knowing the disease outcome of the&#xD;
      subjects, predictive models can be developed that discriminate between those who do and do&#xD;
      not have MSD-UE.&#xD;

      This three-year study will be divided into two phases. Phase I will be devoted to developing&#xD;
      and refining an instrument, the Pre-PeCKS, into a valid and reliable data gathering&#xD;
      observational tool. In Phase II the Pre-PeCKS will be used to develop a predictive model that&#xD;
      can discriminate between those with and without MSD-UE. The model developed will be used to&#xD;
      select the construction and weighting of the subscales of the final instrument, the PeCKS.&#xD;
      The specific aim of Phase I is to evaluate the inter- and intra- rater reliability and the&#xD;
      concurrent criterion-related validity of the Pre-PeCKS; the specific aim of Phase II is to&#xD;
      use information gathered using the Pre-PeCKS to develop a diagnostic instrument that can&#xD;
      identify those with and without MSD-UE. In Phase I, 50 subjects will be digitally recorded&#xD;
      while typing while at the same time the kinematics of their hands will be recorded using a&#xD;
      VICON™ motion analysis system and a keyboard force plate. The video of the typing performance&#xD;
      will be rated by independent raters using the Pre-PeCKS and reliability statistics will be&#xD;
      calculated. Concurrent validity will be obtained by comparing the results of the VICON™ with&#xD;
      the results of the Pre-PeCKS. In Phase II, 20 typists with MSD-UE and 20 typists without&#xD;
      MSD-UE will be rated using the Pre-PeCKS. Variables from the Pre-PeCKS along with other&#xD;
      variables of interest will be used to build models that can discriminate between those with&#xD;
      and without MSD-UE. The best model will be used to assign weights to Pre-PeCKS parameters and&#xD;
      to develop how subscores will be combined to best identify those with MSD-UE. This&#xD;
      information will be integrated into the final tool, the PeCKS. The PeCKS can then be used to&#xD;
      identify an individual who have keyboarding styles that have been associated with MSD-UE.&#xD;
