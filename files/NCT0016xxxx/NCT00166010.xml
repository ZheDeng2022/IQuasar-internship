  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with severe heart failure need immediate appropriate care. New and better drugs are&#xD;
      constantly being developed. As these drugs are approved for adult use, they are used&#xD;
      off-label for children. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages clinical studies of&#xD;
      drugs in children to further extend appropriate use of new medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves nesiritide, which was approved as a congestive heart failure treatment in&#xD;
      adults in August 2001. The investigators' use of this drug in a pediatric population with&#xD;
      severe heart failure has been encouraging. The investigators now wish to formally determine&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetic and safety of Nesiritide in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 30 patients who are in the cardiac intensive care unit with&#xD;
      severe heart failure. The data collected will include weights, vital signs, laboratory&#xD;
      results, and echocardiography results. A research lab test called B-type natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      (BNP) will be done several times during this study. If the patient still has an intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) catheter, the blood sample will be taken from the IV. If the patient does not have an&#xD;
      IV, the sample will be taken from a fingerstick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be the first 2 days of the patient's stay in the cardiac&#xD;
      intensive care unit and thru discharge to evaluate the endpoint safety of Nesiritide.&#xD;
      Additional information will also be collected if patient gets re-admitted within 30 days of&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nesiritide (human recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide) has been recently approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration for the intravenous treatment of patients with decompensated&#xD;
      congestive heart failure. Nesiritide has been studied in a broad range of patients, including&#xD;
      the elderly, women, and African Americans, and patients with a history of various&#xD;
      cardiovascular conditions including hypertension, diabetes, post myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation/flutter, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, and acute coronary syndrome. However, clinical experience in the pediatric&#xD;
      population has been limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nesiritide is a human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) produced by recombinant technology&#xD;
      having the same amino acid sequence as the naturally occurring human BNP. BNP is&#xD;
      predominantly secreted by the cardiac ventricles in response to increased cardiac volume and&#xD;
      pressure overload. Its pharmacologic effects include hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and renal.&#xD;
      In adult studies, hemodynamic effects are characterized by balanced venous and arterial&#xD;
      dilation, resulting in decreased preload and afterload demonstrated by a reduction of&#xD;
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance while neurohormonal effects of nesiritide favorably inhibit the&#xD;
      renin-angiotension-aldosterone system, leading to decreased plasma aldosterone and&#xD;
      norepinephrine levels. The renal effects most often seen with nesiritide use is increased&#xD;
      urine output and lower diuretic utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no published articles discussing the use, including pharmacokinetics, of&#xD;
      nesiritide in children. However, there are several centers that are currently using the drug&#xD;
      - Columbus, Missouri; San Diego, California; Charleston, South Carolina; Loma Linda,&#xD;
      California. Our experience in the infant after cardiac surgery and the older child with heart&#xD;
      failure is encouraging. In children receiving nesiritide therapy, we noted significant&#xD;
      clinical improvement with no appreciable side effects. Based on our initial experience,&#xD;
      further prospective studies need to be performed in order to determine the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and safety of using this therapy in the pediatric cohort.&#xD;
