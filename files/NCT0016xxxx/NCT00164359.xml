  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is the current first-line therapy for uncomplicated malaria in&#xD;
      Malawi. Significant resistance of the P. falciparum malaria parasite to this drug has led to&#xD;
      an imminent need for the government of Malawi to identify a new first-line therapy for&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria and to implement that new therapy as policy. This protocol is the&#xD;
      second of two protocols whose combined purpose is to provide efficacy and side effect data on&#xD;
      four antimalarial drug combinations that are candidates for the next first-line therapy for&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria in Malawi. This protocol aims to assess the acceptability and&#xD;
      tolerability of amodiaquine in Malawi. It is a double-blind study comparing amodiaquine plus&#xD;
      artesunate (AQ-Art, one of the candidate combination therapies) to chlorproguanil/dapsone&#xD;
      plus artesunate (CD-Art, another of the candidate combination therapies) in persons 5 years&#xD;
      and older, to see if there is a higher incidence of abdominal pain and/or refusal to take the&#xD;
      therapy in the AQ-Art group. Amodiaquine was removed from the Malawian national drug registry&#xD;
      in 1995 because of a perceived association with abdominal pain. Although no studies were&#xD;
      conducted to substantiate this, consensus among clinicians was that patients were refusing&#xD;
      amodiaquine with increasing frequency, citing abdominal pain as the reason, so the drug was&#xD;
      removed from the registry. Results from this study, along with the efficacy data from the&#xD;
      sister protocol in children under five years of age, will help guide the National Malaria&#xD;
      Control Program of Malawi in selecting their next first-line antimalarial therapy.&#xD;
