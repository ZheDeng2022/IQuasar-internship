  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although tarry stool is a common feature of peptic ulcer bleeding, it can also be a&#xD;
      manifestation of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Examples include colonic cancer, small&#xD;
      bowel tumors, and small or large bowel ulcers induced by aspirin or painkillers (NSAIDs).&#xD;
      However, clinicians are often misled by the finding of peptic ulcers as the source of GI&#xD;
      bleeding. It is not uncommon to detect peptic ulcers incidentally but the source of bleeding&#xD;
      is actually in the lower GI tract (e.g. NSAID- or aspirin-induced small or large bowel&#xD;
      bleeding ulcers, small bowel tumors, or colorectal cancer). Delay in diagnosis of lower GI&#xD;
      bleeding often leads to serious consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preferred investigations for lower GI bleeding are colonoscopy plus video capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy. Colonoscopy has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of colonic bleeding. The&#xD;
      risk of colonoscopy-induced complications such as bleeding or perforation is less than 1 in&#xD;
      3500. Video capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive, safe and accurate technology that has been&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for investigation of small bowel diseases. The video capsule is an 11x&#xD;
      26mm capsule that encases a digital camera, light-emitting diodes, batteries, and a&#xD;
      transmitter. The patient needs to swallow the video capsule after an overnight fast and wear&#xD;
      a recording device for eight hours. Images are taken twice-per-second and transmitted to the&#xD;
      recording device. Oral feeding can be resumed after four hours. There is no restriction to&#xD;
      daily activities. The swallowed capsule will be expelled naturally after 5 to 12 hours&#xD;
      virtually in all patients. The risk of capsule retention is very low and only occurs in&#xD;
      patients with severe small bowel stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the incidence and etiology of lower GI bleeding in patients&#xD;
      presenting with tarry stool. The result will provide important information about the&#xD;
      magnitude of the problem of lower GI bleeding that will improve our patient care.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding will be&#xD;
        enrolled if they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of melena or melena concomitant with PR bleeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Gastroscopic findings not accountable for the upper GI bleeding including: (i) clean&#xD;
             base ulcers /erosions (refer to User Groups below) without high-risk stigmata, fresh&#xD;
             or altered blood but can have grade A or B esophagitis concomitantly ; and (ii) meet&#xD;
             the criteria of either the User groups or Non-user group as below&#xD;

             User Groups Definition: Patients who used any dose of NSAIDs or aspirin via oral or&#xD;
             systemic (intramuscular, Per rectal) route within 2 weeks prior to the onset of upper&#xD;
             GI bleeding NSAID group: Clean base gastric or duodenal ulcer is required (i.e.,&#xD;
