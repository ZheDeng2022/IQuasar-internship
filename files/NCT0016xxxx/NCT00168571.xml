  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few data exist on long-term persistence of measles antibodies after vaccination of West&#xD;
      African infants. The data that do exist indicate that the antibody titres decline very&#xD;
      rapidly. Our data would be the first to describe the persistence of measles antibodies after&#xD;
      two doses of measles vaccine, and the study would allow us to identify unprotected children&#xD;
      and offer them revaccination. Since persistence of measles antibodies is of crucial&#xD;
      importance to measles control, the study will contribute significantly to the existing&#xD;
      knowledge and might have important implications for future eradication programmes.&#xD;

      Objective To determine persistence of measles antibodies among children who received either&#xD;
      one or two doses of Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) or Schwarz (SW) measles vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The World Health Organization has targeted measles for eradication by the year&#xD;
      2010, and although measles incidence has fallen drastically in many parts of the world,&#xD;
      several factors could hinder the eradication goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, there is no indication of improved measles immunisation coverage world wide,&#xD;
      vaccination coverage fell in all regions of the world from 1997 to 1998, except in the&#xD;
      Western Pacific, so the general measles immunisation coverage came down to 72%. Very high&#xD;
      vaccination coverage of ≥ 95% is needed to interrupt transmission of the highly contagious&#xD;
      measles virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary vaccine failure constitute another significant problem to measles&#xD;
      control, and the HIV pandemic contributes to increased vaccine failure, and permits&#xD;
      transmission of measles virus despite high rates of immunisation coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-clinical measles has been found to contribute to measles immunity by boosting of the&#xD;
      antibody level, and with less circulation of wild measles virus secondary vaccine failure may&#xD;
      represent a special problem in terms of waning immunity, a problem which is probably more&#xD;
      pronounced among those vaccinated early, but there are still few data relevant to this&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, although effective measles vaccines are available, there is still a need to find the&#xD;
      optimal way of immunising in different epidemiological settings. In areas with high measles&#xD;
      transmission early two-dose measles vaccination schedules have been recommended for&#xD;
      prevention of measles in the age group below the normal age of vaccination, and as a means of&#xD;
      raising vaccination coverage in general. We conducted such a two-dose trial with two&#xD;
      different strains of measles vaccine in Guinea-Bissau, and found that the risk of not being&#xD;
      vaccinated was lower in the two-dose group than in the one-dose group, and the relative&#xD;
      efficacy of a two-dose versus a one-dose schedule was high among children below the normal&#xD;
      age of vaccination. Further, we found that both one or two doses of the EZ vaccine resulted&#xD;
      in 1% of the children being unprotected at 18 months of age, while one or two doses of SW&#xD;
      resulted in 3% and 9% unprotected, respectively. The EZ vaccine, but not the SW vaccine, was&#xD;
      able to boost the antibody response significantly after revaccination at 9 months of age in&#xD;
      children with moderate levels of antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to study long-term persistence of measles antibodies in this cohort&#xD;
      where we found rather striking differences in protection at 18 months of age according to&#xD;
      vaccine strain and number of doses to find out whether the measles antibody level is&#xD;
      maintained over time or waning immunity is a problem, since this could have important&#xD;
      implications for global measles control and elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods With 85% seroconverters in the one-dose group we would be able to detect a difference&#xD;
      of 10% in number of non-seroconverters with a sample size of 400 children to be blood sampled&#xD;
      in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among 6,900 children with an 18 months blood sample (10% loss to follow-up between 6 and 18&#xD;
      months of age), we will include all the children who received the EZ vaccine to be blood&#xD;
      sampled at 6-7 years of age. Available are 450 samples from 18 months of age, and with 20%&#xD;
      loss to follow-up we will have a total of 360 children in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among children who received the SW vaccine we plan to follow up half of the children at 6-7&#xD;
      years of age, and the other half 3 years later at 9-10 years of age. Including the first&#xD;
      2,000 children with an 18 months blood sample we will be able to include about 1,600 children&#xD;
      in the study with 20% loss to follow-up. Thus we will have 400 children in each arm of the&#xD;
      study (one dose / two dose) at 6-7 and at 9-10 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with unprotective measles antibody level will be offered revaccination.&#xD;
