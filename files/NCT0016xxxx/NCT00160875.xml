  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the esophagus is a very serious cancer. Studies have shown that using chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiation before surgery is the most promising treatment approach, with one quarter to&#xD;
      one half of tumors shrinking by 50% or more in size after chemotherapy and radiation. In&#xD;
      patients who have a very good response to this treatment, survival following esophagectomy&#xD;
      has increased, although the amount of increase has varied quite a bit between the different&#xD;
      studies. Older studies have used the drugs Cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil. Although this&#xD;
      combination of drugs has been beneficial, we wish to use a newer combination of drugs which&#xD;
      may be more effective for esophageal cancer. The chemotherapy drugs used in this study are&#xD;
      Cisplatin and Irinotecan. We also want to find out what side effects these drugs cause when&#xD;
      given with radiation, and how often these side effects occur.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historical surgical series have reported that the chance of cure with surgery alone is&#xD;
      approximately one in four. Many phase II studies and some phase III studies have examined the&#xD;
      role of induction (preoperative) chemotherapy and radiation. In general, these studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a trend to improved survival using an induction regimen with one phase III study&#xD;
      reporting a significant improvement in survival. Two meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate&#xD;
      a clear advantage of an induction regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When these trials are reviewed, it is apparent that there is a subgroup of patients who are&#xD;
      found at the time of resection to have had a complete pathological response to their&#xD;
      treatment, and these patients clearly experience improved survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These previous trials have used older chemotherapy agents. Nevertheless, cisplatin remains&#xD;
      one of the most active drugs available for treating solid tumours. Irinotecan is a newer drug&#xD;
      that has demonstrated significant activity in colorectal cancer and more recently in&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. A previous single institution trial of cisplatin and irinotecan in&#xD;
      esophageal cancer demonstrated a significant response and acceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By giving one cycle of chemotherapy alone first, it is expected that the dysphagia usually&#xD;
      experienced by these patients will improve sufficiently and that nutritional support, i.e.&#xD;
      feeding tube, will not be required (as has been demonstrated in a previous study of this drug&#xD;
      combination). The same drugs will then be given concurrently with external beam radiation in&#xD;
      order to take advantage of the radiosensitizing properties of both these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be followed by a boost dose of radiation, which will provide a total dose in the&#xD;
      tumourcidal range. Surgery will follow the boost dose of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to combine two drugs with demonstrated activity in esophageal cancer,&#xD;
      cisplatin and Irinotecan, with radiation prior to surgery, with the hypothesis that these&#xD;
      more active agents will offer better control of distant metastatic disease. Their&#xD;
      radiosensitizing properties, when combined with radiation, will improve local control and&#xD;
      provide an increased rate of pathological complete response in patients with surgically&#xD;
      resectable esophageal cancer.&#xD;
