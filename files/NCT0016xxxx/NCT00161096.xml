  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate several aspects of chronic use of acid&#xD;
      suppressing medication: dependence on maintenance therapy, the possibilities for on-demand&#xD;
      use, and predictors (patient characteristics) for daily need, for on-demand use and for&#xD;
      termination of chronic use.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2-5% of the general population is chronic user of acid suppressing medication (proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists), mostly because of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease&#xD;
      (GORD). Prescription data from health insurances show that the number of chronic users&#xD;
      increases every year, which has large economic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are indications however that on-demand and intermittent therapy can be as effective as&#xD;
      daily use. No evidence exists regarding patients who are likely to benefit from intermittent,&#xD;
      on-demand therapy or even termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study several aspects of chronic use of acid suppressive therapy are investigated in&#xD;
      family practice patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic users are transferred to pantoprazole 20 mg for 4 weeks. Patients with adequate&#xD;
      relief of symptoms are randomized in two groups for a period of 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      group 1: daily pantoprazole 20 mg, placebo on-demand (indicative for placebo-dependency)&#xD;
      group 2: daily placebo, pantoprazole 20 mg on-demand (indicative for pharmacological&#xD;
      dependency) Patients visit the research nurse at the beginning of the study and at week 4, 5,&#xD;
      10 and 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we are looking for patient characteristics indicative for the dependency on&#xD;
      acid suppressive drugs and for possibilities to reduce the dose of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, aspects described in &quot;secondary outcomes&quot; will be addressed.&#xD;
