      The purpose of the research is to study the effects of two different injection therapies for&#xD;
      the treatment of lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow). Specifically, we will look at which&#xD;
      therapy provides better short and long-term relief of pain, which treatment allows better&#xD;
      function and less disability, and which treatment gives back better strength in the affected&#xD;
      hand. Each subject will receive only one of the two treatments. Although both of these&#xD;
      treatments are usually very well tolerated, it is important to make this comparison because&#xD;
      it is believed that one of these therapies may have better long term effectiveness, with a&#xD;
      lower cost, and smaller number of potential side effects.&#xD;

      Lateral Epicondylitis or tennis elbow is one of the most commonly diagnosed upper-extremity&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders seen in general practice. It is characterized by painful&#xD;
      enthesopathy or tendinosis of the common extensor tendon at the outer region of the elbow at&#xD;
      the fibro-osseous junction. &quot;Although tennis elbow&quot; was originally made note of in the&#xD;
      medical literature by Runge in 1873, the term derives from &quot;Lawn Tennis Arm&quot; later described&#xD;
      by Morris in 1882.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, lateral epicondylitis causes characteristic pain in the lateral elbow region&#xD;
      and is often associated with significant morbidity. It occurs most commonly in individuals&#xD;
      between 40 and 50 years and equally affects both men and women. The dominant arm is involved&#xD;
      in 75% of patients. While other etiologies have been proposed, including radial nerve&#xD;
      entrapment, it is generally agreed that tennis elbow is the result of repetitive mechanical&#xD;
      micro-trauma and overuse, but many cases have no biomechanical association, nor vocational or&#xD;
      avocational correlation. This condition is often brought about by repeated flexion and&#xD;
      extension of the wrist or by a direct injury to the epicondyle or elbow. However, most&#xD;
      patients are unable to recall or to identify a precipitating event. The average duration of&#xD;
      an episode of lateral epicondylitis is 6 to 24 months, and 10% to 30% of cases result in work&#xD;
      absenteeism, leading to a high loss of productivity. Numerous treatment options have been&#xD;
      described for lateral epicondylitis. Most cases are managed in primary care settings, and&#xD;
      although there are more than forty possible treatments, there is still a lack of consensus&#xD;
      about optimal therapeutic management. Moreover, most of these treatments lack sound&#xD;
      scientific evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preferred method of treatment of lateral epicondylitis often involves corticosteroid&#xD;
      injections with or without the addition of local anesthetic. In general, injection of local&#xD;
      corticosteroids is commonly used to reduce inflammation in patients with chronic&#xD;
      tendinopathies such as lateral epicondylitis. However, since inflammation is not necessarily&#xD;
      a major feature in this lesion, and if present, may present a vital component of the healing&#xD;
      response. Inhibiting this process may result in a suboptimal outcome. Thereby, despite their&#xD;
      popularity, the rationale for use of corticosteroids is controversial and the evidence for&#xD;
      long-term benefit lacks. Likewise, potential side effects such as infection, tissue atrophy,&#xD;
      pigmentation changes, hyperglycemia, etc. do exist. Moreover, many of the recommendations for&#xD;
      the use of corticosteroid injections are anecdotal. In a review by Labelle et al, it was&#xD;
      concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support the use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids injections for lateral epicondylitis. Assendelft et al came to similar&#xD;
      conclusions in his review when he found that existing evidence on corticosteroid injections&#xD;
      for lateral epicondylitis was unclear and that questions regarding the optimal timing,&#xD;
      dosage, injection, technique, and injection volume remained unanswered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolotherapy, though not as yet extensively studied, is another emerging therapy presenting&#xD;
      as an alternative to corticosteroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. It&#xD;
      continues to rise in popularity, especially by clinicians who commonly treat musculoskeletal&#xD;
      injuries. With its early origins dating back to the time of Hippocrates, prolotherapy is&#xD;
      defined as the iatrogenic stimulation of wound healing and tissue repair process through the&#xD;
      injection of an irritant solution into damaged ligaments, tendons, and joints thus&#xD;
      encouraging their healing and repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essentially, this occurs as a result of a localized inflammatory reaction with stimulation of&#xD;
      rounds cell infiltration with resultant collagen synthesis, and formation of firm permanent&#xD;
      fibrous tissue and bone. The new collagen runs parallel to existing ligaments and tendons and&#xD;
      has a linear orientation, resulting in ultimate strengthening and stabilization of the&#xD;
      ligament, tendon, or joint with subsequent reduction of pain. It is generally safe and very&#xD;
      well tolerated and has been used throughout the western medical community for over 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing research on prolotherapy began in the 1930s when Lerich first described the rich&#xD;
      supply of nerve endings in articular ligaments. This was re-introduced by Gardner in 1953.&#xD;
      Also in the 1950s, Hackett, who described most joint pain as ligamentous, was the first to&#xD;
      scientifically demonstrate a method of strengthening ligaments by injection of a proliferant&#xD;
      solution. At that time, the use of an irritant solution was thought to work by creation of a&#xD;
      scar tissue rather than by development of a proliferative response. As pain was perceived to&#xD;
      arise when normal tension on a ligament stretched the relaxed ligament fibers, which resulted&#xD;
      in abnormal tension and stimulation of the sensory nerves because the nerve fibers did not&#xD;
      stretch, reduction of pain was thereby thought to arise with stabilization of these relaxed&#xD;
      ligaments through generation of a strong scar tissue about that structure. Reduction of pain&#xD;
      was realized by Hackett who reported an 82% success rate in the treatment of chronic spinal&#xD;
      pain in 1816 patients treated during a 20-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsequent study in 1982 on rabbit ligaments by Lui et al showed that prolotherapy might&#xD;
      have a positive effect on mass, thickness, enthesis strength, and weight-to-length ratio of&#xD;
      injected ligaments, as compared to controls. A different study by Klein et al in 1989 showed&#xD;
      histological documentation of ligament proliferation in human subjects. This was in response&#xD;
      to proliferative injections, which objectively increased the diameter of collagen fibers with&#xD;
      an associated decrease in pain as well as an objective increase in range of motion. In&#xD;
      another study, Ongley et al found a statistically significant reduction in ligamentous laxity&#xD;
      9 months after injecting the ends of collateral and cruciate ligaments of knees that had&#xD;
      substantial ligamentous laxity as measured by a computerized knee analysis device. All of&#xD;
      these studies found decreases in pain levels of patients involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to early studies, which focused on the mechano-proliferative effects, later&#xD;
      studies in proliferant injection therapy considered its affect on both subjective pain levels&#xD;
      and more objective outcomes such as functional status. For example, in Ongley's study, more&#xD;
      patients in the experimental group showed improvements in pain with a concomitant decrease in&#xD;
      levels of disability. Faber et al, using a dextrose, phenol, and glycerin containing&#xD;
      proliferant, were able to document an increase in the size of sacroiliac ligaments. They also&#xD;
      were able to show a moderate to marked improvement in pain and function in subjects who&#xD;
      received prolotherapy in concert with manipulation versus controls who received saline&#xD;
      injections and sham manipulations. Reeves et al showed that prolotherapy solution consisting&#xD;
      of 10% dextrose resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements in patients&#xD;
      with knee osteoarthritis. The clinically significant changes were seen in joint pain,&#xD;
      subjective joint swelling, flexion range of motion, and in tendency to buckle, all signs&#xD;
      which significantly impact level of function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these and other studies have shown positive effects of proliferant therapy on&#xD;
      mechanical properties of ligaments as well as subjective improvements in pain and function,&#xD;
      most have suffered from small sample size, inadequate controls, and inconsistency of study&#xD;
      design and methodology. Kim et al reviewed and critically analyzed three randomized,&#xD;
      controlled studies on the use of dextrose, glycerin, and phenol prolotherapy for chronic low&#xD;
      back pain. They found inconclusive data to support its use due to the lack of adequate&#xD;
      controls, heterogeneity in patient diagnoses, and variations in solutions injected.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, clinical use of prolotherapy warrants further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As lateral epicondylitis involves a cascade of injury at or about the insertion of the common&#xD;
      extensor tendon at the fibro-osseous junction, the patho-physiologic response to&#xD;
      proliferation at this joint seems promising. Based on previous studies, prolotherapy would&#xD;
      theoretically strengthen and stabilize the overstretched and torn strands of fibrous tissue&#xD;
      that cause the cascade of instability and generation of pain at this junction. Not only would&#xD;
      prolotherapy thereby improve subjective pain, it would improve objective strength and&#xD;
      stability of the joint with resultant increase in function. Moreover, in doing so,&#xD;
      prolotherapy would benefit both the patient and society at large by offering a relatively&#xD;
      safer, less expensive, and longer lasting alternative to corticosteroids.&#xD;
