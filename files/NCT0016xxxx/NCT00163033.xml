  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estetrol is a natural compound that is produced by the fetus during fetal life and circulates&#xD;
      in the unborn child and the mother. It is an estrogenic compound. In this study the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of 28 days of the oral administration of estetrol in healthy postmenopausal&#xD;
      women are investigated. In addition, the pharmacokinetics and some pharmacodynamic parameters&#xD;
      are studied. The lowest dose of 2 mg estetrol is directly compared with 2 mg estradiol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a partly randomized open-label study in healthy postmenopausal women. Groups are&#xD;
      treated in the following sequence: first a 2 mg estetrol group together with a 2 mg estradiol&#xD;
      group. When the dose of 2 mg estetrol is safe and the tolerability is good, a next higher&#xD;
      dose group of estetrol will start, possibly followed by two next higher dose groups if the&#xD;
      previous dose group is safe and the tolerability is good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of estetrol&#xD;
      during multiple dosing for 28 days. Furthermore steady state pharmacokinetics and some&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic parameters of estetrol will be investigated. In addition, the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of the 2 mg estetrol group will be compared with&#xD;
      those of the 2 mg estradiol group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group 5 postmenopausal women will be included with &gt; 50 hot flushes per week and 5&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with &lt; 10 hot flushes per week. These criteria are set to get a more&#xD;
      homologous composition in each group.&#xD;
