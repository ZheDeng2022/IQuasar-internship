      The purposes of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. study the nature and longitudinal course of psychiatric symptoms in children with the&#xD;
           22q11.2 deletion syndrome and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identify genes that contribute to the occurrence of these symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study of genes that are implicated in various mental diseases is increasingly relevant.&#xD;
      The association between a gene and a disease can provide valuable information on how the&#xD;
      neurobiology of the brain is altered, by studying the function of the protein encoded by the&#xD;
      gene. This information is important for the development of new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the identification of these &quot;disease&quot; genes is difficult, due to the complexity of&#xD;
      human behavior and the interaction of multiple genes. Moreover, the human genome consists of&#xD;
      approximately 35,000 genes, further complicating the matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The situation is simplified when a psychiatric disorder and a genetic anomaly co-occur;&#xD;
      assuming a causative relation, one can focus on the implicated genetic region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 22q11-deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is an example of this type; this syndrome is caused by&#xD;
      a disappearance (&quot;deletion&quot;) of 20-30 genes in a well-defined region on chromosome 22. People&#xD;
      with 22q11DS have a high risk of autism and psychosis, therefore one or more genes in the&#xD;
      22q11DS region must be associated with these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we aim to identify these genes, by carefully studying psychiatric symptoms (and&#xD;
      additional parameters of brain functioning) in a large sample of 22q11DS children and&#xD;
      subsequently statistically correlate these findings to specific genes within the 22q11DS&#xD;
      region. If genes associated with autism and/or psychosis in the 22q11DS population can be&#xD;
      found, they may help to understand the underlying neurobiology that cause these diseases, not&#xD;
      only in 22q11DS patients but in the general population as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. STUDY NATURE AND DEVELOPMENTAL COURSE OF PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS. To perform a prospective&#xD;
           longitudinal follow up study of a sample of children with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome&#xD;
           with specific attention to a) possible predictors for psychosis in psychiatric and&#xD;
           neuropsychological profile and b) a possible correlation between autistic symptoms and&#xD;
           psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ASSESS THE CORRELATION OF 22q11.2 DELETIONS WITH THE PSYCHOSIS / AUTISTIC PHENOTYPE AND&#xD;
           ASSOCIATED ENDOPHENOTYPES: To evaluate whether the size of the deletion and / or&#xD;
           polymorphisms at selected candidate genes within the 22q11.2 deleted region contribute&#xD;
           to the psychosis and or autistic phenotype or to related psychophysiologic /&#xD;
           neuropsychological impairments in 22q11DS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large sample (a final sample size of 100-120 is anticipated) of children with 22q11DS, aged&#xD;
      10 - 20 year, is broadly phenotyped using standard psychiatric assessment methods,&#xD;
      intelligence and selected neuropsychological tests as well as psychophysiological&#xD;
      assessments. Approximately 4 years after the initial assessment a follow up assessment is&#xD;
      planned. Age and IQ matched children without the deletion (or any other apparent genetic&#xD;
      abnormality) are used as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phenotypes: Individuals with a certain endophenotype (&quot;cases&quot; e.g. the presence of&#xD;
           autistic symptoms or a decreased Pre Pulse Inhibition or impaired performance on&#xD;
           executive tasks) will be compared to children without that particular phenotype&#xD;
           (&quot;controls&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Genotyping consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. assessment of the size of the deletion and&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the deleted genomic&#xD;
                     region. Genotyping will be performed using approximately 75 previously&#xD;
                     characterized SNPs, with an increased density of SNPs in the target candidate&#xD;
                     genes (~3-5 SNPs per candidate gene). In order to determine whether a&#xD;
                     haplotype and/or variants of genes within region 22q11.2 contribute to the&#xD;
                     autistic phenotype and related neuro-psychological impairments in patients&#xD;
                     with the deletion, we will identify DNA polymorphisms using existing&#xD;
                     databases. We will then genotype patients with the 22q11.2 deletion for the&#xD;
                     selected polymorphisms and compare the allele frequencies and haplotype&#xD;
                     combinations in 22q11DS patients with the phenotype (&quot;cases&quot;) to those deleted&#xD;
                     patients without these findings (&quot;controls&quot;) applying chi-square, Fisher's&#xD;
                     exact test, and other statistical genetic methods as appropriate.&#xD;
