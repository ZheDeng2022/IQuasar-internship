  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if orlistat (Xenical) therapy in overweight&#xD;
      patients with NASH leads to enhanced weight loss over time, with subsequent improvement in&#xD;
      the underlying necroinflammatory and fibrotic changes that are typical of NASH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have suggested that steady weight loss over time will result in improvement&#xD;
      in aminotransferases, and more importantly, underlying histopathology in patients with NASH.&#xD;
      A total of 50 biopsy-proven NASH patients will be enrolled in a prospective, randomized&#xD;
      fashion. Twenty-five patients have been enrolled at the primary study site at Saint Louis&#xD;
      University. Recruitment of the next 25 patients is taking place at a study subsite at Brooke&#xD;
      Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open-label study comparing an established weight loss program (1400-calorie&#xD;
      diet with 30% fat) plus daily vitamin E (800 IU) and a daily multivitamin to the same weight&#xD;
      loss program, daily vitamin E (800 IU) and multivitamin, plus orlistat (120 mg), three times&#xD;
      daily for 36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected from prospective patients includes demographic information, such as age,&#xD;
      sex, past medical history, medications, height and weight. Biochemical data to be collected&#xD;
      from prospective patients includes liver enzymes, measures of insulin resistance to include,&#xD;
      insulin levels, lipid panel, hemoglobin A1C, free fatty acids, complete blood count,&#xD;
      coagulation studies, and vitamin E levels. Blood will also be collected and stored for&#xD;
      markers of inflammation and fibrosis, such as C reactive protein and TNF-alpha. A liver&#xD;
      biopsy will be obtained at the completion of the study for both histopathologic analysis and&#xD;
      RNA analysis.&#xD;
