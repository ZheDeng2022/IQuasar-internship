      prospective evaluation of topoisomerase II alpha gene amplification and protein&#xD;
      overexpression as markers predicting the efficacy of epirubicin in the primary treatment of&#xD;
      breast cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical evaluation of topo II a as a predictive marker: Preliminary results from a clinical&#xD;
      study suggest that complete remission after treatment with anthracyclines for advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer is observed only in case of topo II a gene amplification (7 complete remissions, all&#xD;
      in patients with topo II a gene amplified tumors, no complete remissions in patients with a&#xD;
      normal or deleted topo II a gene).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, our group has analyzed the predictive value of topo II a in a population of&#xD;
      node-positive breast cancer patients randomly treated either with anthracyclines or with CMF&#xD;
      (Belgian cooperative trial). In a first study, topo II a was evaluated by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, which allows the detection of topo II a protein expression. The results&#xD;
      of this study suggested that patients deriving the highest benefit from anthracyclines were&#xD;
      those in which topo II a protein is immunostained in more than 10% of tumor cells. The main&#xD;
      findings of this study should be seen as hypothesis-generating because of the limited number&#xD;
      of patients evaluated (about fifty in each study arm) and because topo II a protein levels&#xD;
      depend on gene amplification as well as on tumor proliferation rate. Therefore, topo II a&#xD;
      protein expression does not necessarily reflect topo II a gene status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second study run by our group was based on the same series of patients evaluated in the&#xD;
      first study, but, this time, both HER-2 and topo II a genes were evaluated by fluorescence&#xD;
      in-situ hybridization (FISH), which allows the detection of gene aberrations. The main&#xD;
      findings of the second study were quite consistent with the pre-clinical data suggesting that&#xD;
      only HER-2 amplified/topo II a amplified tumours show great sensitivity to anthracyclines&#xD;
      while the efficacy of these same agents in HER-2 amplified/topo II a non-amplified tumors is&#xD;
      comparable to the efficacy of other drugs or regimens like CMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, although the results reported in this study bring some additional support to&#xD;
      the hypothesis of topo II a as a marker predicting the efficacy of anthracyclines, no&#xD;
      definitive conclusions can be drawn because of the fairly limited number of patients&#xD;
      evaluated, and the retrospective nature of the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study protocol: Supported by &quot;in-vitro&quot; and preliminary &quot;in-vivo&quot; data, briefly&#xD;
      summarized above, this study is designed to test prospectively the value of topo II alpha&#xD;
      gene amplification and protein overexpression in predicting the efficacy of anthracyclines.&#xD;
      To our knowledge this is the only prospective trial worldwide which is attempting to&#xD;
      prospectively clarify the predictive value of this interesting biological marker. This study&#xD;
      could have important practical implications in the daily clinical management of early breast&#xD;
      cancer patients because, if the trial confirms that topo II a gene amplification and/or&#xD;
      protein overexpression are associated with high efficacy of anthracyclines, while topo II a&#xD;
      normal/deleted gene and low protein content are associated with modest efficacy, an important&#xD;
      step forward in the direction of anthracycline &quot;tailoring&quot; would be accomplished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practical advantage of this approach would be to use anthracyclines primarily in patients&#xD;
      who are supposed to derive the largest benefit, thus sparing the long-term&#xD;
      anthracycline-related toxicity (i.e. secondary acute myeloid leukemia, cardiac dysfunction,&#xD;
      and amenorrhea/sterility in case of fertile women) to those patients for whom no significant&#xD;
      gain in antitumor activity is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach this ambitious aim, early breast cancer patients with tumors of at least 2 cm&#xD;
      (defined by breast ultrasound) will be evaluated for topo II a gene and protein expression.&#xD;
      For this purpose, a pre-treatment biopsy (tru-cut) will be performed and topo II a gene will&#xD;
      be evaluated on fixed samples by FISH. The use of a triple probe will allow the concomitant&#xD;
      evaluation of the HER-2 gene status. Topo II a protein will be evaluated by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC). Afterwards, all patients, independently of the topo II a gene and&#xD;
      protein status, will be treated with single-agent epirubicin Eligibility criteria will allow&#xD;
      the participation of patients for whom the use of an anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      would have been most probably proposed after breast cancer surgery, mainly because of&#xD;
      estrogen receptor (ER) negativity. Therefore, no overtreatment with anthracyclines will occur&#xD;
      in this group of patients. Pathological complete response (pCR) to epirubicin will be&#xD;
      correlated with the topo II a gene and protein status. The study has two biological&#xD;
      hypotheses, one for the subgroup of patients with ER negative/HER-2 amplified tumors, the&#xD;
      other one for the subgroup of patients with ER negative/HER-2 non amplified tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st hypothesis: Patients with ER negative/HER-2 amplified tumors: In this subgroup of&#xD;
           patients, topo II a gene will be amplified in about 40% of cases. We hypothesize that in&#xD;
           topo II a amplified tumors a three-fold increase in pCR rate will be observed, as&#xD;
           opposed to the pCR rate in tumors with topo II a normal or deleted gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd hypothesis : Patients with ER negative/HER-2 non amplified tumors: In this subset of&#xD;
           patients, almost no topo II a gene aberrations will be found based on previous data&#xD;
           discussed above. However, recent data reported by C. Sotiriou et al using cDNA&#xD;
           microarrays, suggest that in this subset of ER-negative HER-2 negative tumors, also&#xD;
           defined as the basal-like subset, two distinct subgroups can be identified (i.e.&#xD;
           basal-like 1 and 2). While basal-like 1 tumors show a high proliferation rate and high&#xD;
           levels of topo II a RNA, basal-like 2 tumors have a moderate-low proliferation rate and&#xD;
           normal levels of topo II a RNA. We hypothesize that the topo II a RNA overexpression in&#xD;
           basal-like 1 tumors is not related to topo II a gene amplification because no&#xD;
           concomitant HER-2 gene amplification is reported in this subset of tumors. The second&#xD;
           study hypothesis is that in ER negative/HER-2 non amplified tumors with topo II a&#xD;
           protein overexpression, a 2.5 fold increase in pCR rate will be observed, as opposed to&#xD;
           the pCR rate in tumors with low topo II a protein content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tumor sample drawn at the time of pre-treatment biopsy will be frozen and used to perform&#xD;
      oligonucleotide based microarrays (Affymetrix). This technique allows the evaluation of&#xD;
      thousands of genes and ultimately provides us with the tumor genetic profile. Homogeneous&#xD;
      genetic profiles (genetic clusters) that might be identified, will be correlated with the&#xD;
      efficacy of single-agent epirubicin. This correlation will allow us to address the secondary&#xD;
      end-point of this study, which is the identification of other genes or eventually a genetic&#xD;
      profile playing a role in the determination of sensitivity to anthracyclines. Among the genes&#xD;
      that could interfere with sensitivity to anthracyclines, p-53 seems to deserve special&#xD;
      attention. Indeed, &quot;in-vitro&quot; data suggest that at least some p-53 mutated tumors are poorly&#xD;
      sensitive to anthracyclines, primarily because anthracycline-induced apoptosis is prevented.&#xD;
      Interestingly, p-53 mutated tumors display frequently HER-2 gene amplification and therefore&#xD;
      topo II a gene amplification (23). Accordingly, p-53 mutations could hamper response to&#xD;
      anthracyclines even in tumors carrying topo II a gene amplification. This hypothesis will&#xD;
      also be explored in the present study, because p-53 mutations will be evaluated by DNA&#xD;
      sequencing, and the efficacy of epirubicin in topo II a amplified and non-amplified tumors&#xD;
      will be correlated with p-53 status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, patients with inflammatory breast cancer will be treated with dense&#xD;
      administration of epirubicin (100 mg/m2/2 weeks). We keep the same drug as for early breast&#xD;
      cancer but we use a slightly more aggressive regimen with a higher dose-density. The&#xD;
      feasibility of the administration of epirubicin 100 mg/m2 every two weeks with&#xD;
      granulocyte-growth factor support has been shown in the neoadjuvant, metastatic and adjuvant&#xD;
      settings with acceptable toxicity. This neoadjuvant epirubicin regimen may be completed by&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy, such as taxane-based regimens, since the sequential approach&#xD;
      (anthracyclines and taxanes) has been suggested superior to anthracyclines regimen in LABC.&#xD;
