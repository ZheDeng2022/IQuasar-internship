      All surgical procedures carry with them the risk of infection. Even a minor infection can&#xD;
      extend the hospitalization after cardiac surgery. The average minimum increase in length of&#xD;
      stay for a single infection is three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the many means used to reduce post-operative infections is the preventative, or&#xD;
      &quot;prophylactic&quot;, administration of antibiotics just before and just after surgery. Because&#xD;
      antibiotics, and for that matter surgery itself, alter the body's natural immune and&#xD;
      inflammatory responses and the makeup of the bacteria in the intestine, there is a great deal&#xD;
      of scientific interest in using the supplementation of bacteria that naturally reside in the&#xD;
      intestine. It is felt that by doing so, the alterations in the immune response may be&#xD;
      corrected and the patient better able to fight infections. There are studies using probiotics&#xD;
      that have demonstrated a reduction in infection rates in patients undergoing abdominal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be patients at high risk for infection including those with any one or more of&#xD;
      the following characteristics: over 65 years old, poor heart function (ejection fraction&#xD;
      &lt;40), diabetes (insulin dependant or non-insulin dependant), peripheral vascular disease,&#xD;
      kidney dysfunction (creatinine level &gt;2mg/dl), obesity (body surface area &gt; 2 m2), low serum&#xD;
      protein levels (albumin &lt; 2.5 mg/dl), infection of the heart valve (endocarditis), or on any&#xD;
      antibiotics other than standard prophylaxis before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of these products has been very well established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to enter the study will receive the synbiotic mix, or a placebo, which&#xD;
      comes in a powder that may be mixed with a drink, or washed down into the stomach through the&#xD;
      NG tube if the patient is still on a ventilator. Dosing will be initiated within four hours&#xD;
      of patient arrival in the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit and will continue on a twice&#xD;
      daily basis for the duration of their admission days. Infection and diarrhea data will be&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite progress in surgical methodology, infections remain one of the most difficult&#xD;
      post-operative complications to prevent. In cardiac surgery, the presence of an infection can&#xD;
      make the difference between a brief hospital stay and a life-threatening illness. The average&#xD;
      minimum increase in length of stay due to a single infection is three days and can extend to&#xD;
      months. Nationally, the average rate of deep sternal wound infection is 3% and conduit&#xD;
      harvest site infection 1.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the intimate relationship between intestinal bacterial flora and normal gut and&#xD;
      immunologic function, current research is investigating the relationship between the&#xD;
      preservation or augmentation of certain naturally occurring bacterial strains in the&#xD;
      intestine and clinical outcomes, particularly infectious. We propose to examine the efficacy&#xD;
      of immediate post-operative supplementation with a product containing four bacterial strains&#xD;
      and four different fibers, putatively fuel for bacterial growth, in reducing infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, most studies performed with LAB have selected strains for their palatability&#xD;
      and usability in yogurts. For this reason, most studies have been based on LAB, such as&#xD;
      Lactobacillus acidophilus, L.casei, L. delbrueckii och Bifidobacillus adolescentis,&#xD;
      B.bifidum, B.longum and Bifidobacterium infantis, which are common in yogurts and kefirs. It&#xD;
      is only recently that interest has been focused on developing criteria for selecting LAB&#xD;
      based on intraluminal biology, such as the ability to adhere to mucus or mucosal cells, the&#xD;
      ability to ferment resistant fibers, and antioxidant capacity. For example, L.plantarum,&#xD;
      which is often recovered from fermented fruits, vegetables, sourdoughs and silage, has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to have a strong ability to adhere to mucosa and to break down resistant fibers.&#xD;
      L. plantarum is the commonest LAB in human gastrointestinal tract and has shown the greatest&#xD;
      ability of all LAB tested to survive in the gut (106 times that of L.rhamnosus for example)&#xD;
      and activate cytokine secretion after passage through the stomach and the small intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical impact of a particular LAB is strongly associated with its ability to colonize&#xD;
      the intestinal mucosa. LAB common in dairy products such as yogurts (L.Acidophilus,&#xD;
      L.bulgaris and bifidobacteria) have very limited ability to colonize intestinal mucosal&#xD;
      cells. L.rhamnosus (GG) and even more so L.plantarum (299) have been shown to remain viable&#xD;
      up to 28 days post supplementation. L.plantarum is unique as it uses carbohydrate receptors&#xD;
      (mannose) similar to those of gram-negative bacteria (E.coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella,&#xD;
      Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas and Vibrio cholerae). L. plantarum has also been shown to&#xD;
      prevent adhesion of enteropathogenic E.coli through induction of mRNA expression for the&#xD;
      intestinal mucins MUC2 and MUC3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the present study 75 consecutive patients deemed at high risk for post-operative&#xD;
      infection will be prospectively and blindly randomized to one of the following three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lactic acid bacteria and fermentable fiber&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fermentable fiber alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Non-fermentable (placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sachets containing LAB plus fiber, fiber alone, or placebo will be provided by the&#xD;
      manufacturer and will be randomized, coded, and assigned to patients in order. Patients will&#xD;
      begin receiving doses within 4 hours of arrival to the CSICU and will remain on treatment&#xD;
      twice daily for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Infection control data are collected on all patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery using established institutional definitions for infections. Incidence of sternal&#xD;
      infections, donor site infections, vein harvest site infection, pneumonia, urinary tract&#xD;
      infection, catheter and blood stream infections, and clostridium difficile colitis will be&#xD;
      considered. In addition, the incidence of diarrhea, defined as stools of liquid or gelatinous&#xD;
      consistency, or more than three stools in one day, will be monitored. Data will be collected&#xD;
      during hospital stay and at one-month follow-up. Finally, C-reactive protein levels, which&#xD;
      are commonly assessed during hospitalizations and used as part of the assessment for coronary&#xD;
      risk, will be drawn pre-operatively and four days post-operatively.&#xD;
