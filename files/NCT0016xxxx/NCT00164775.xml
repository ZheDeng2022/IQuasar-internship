      The aim of this study is evaluate the efficacy of Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, in&#xD;
      treatment of functional dyspepsia. This is a double blind randomised placebo controlled trial&#xD;
      in which consecutive patients with diagnosis of functional dyspepsia will be studied. After&#xD;
      exclusion of organic cause of dyspepsia by endoscopy, these patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either imipramine or placebo. All the patients will enter an additional 4 weeks&#xD;
      of drug withdrawal phase after the initial 12 weeks of study drug treatment. They will be&#xD;
      evaluated for treatment response, which is defined as satisfactory relief of dyspeptic&#xD;
      symptoms at the end of 12-week treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder that consists of a variety of upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms such as postprandial fullness, early satiety, pain, bloating,&#xD;
      belching, or nausea. The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is not fully understood and&#xD;
      the correlation of those proposed mechanisms with the clinical characteristics and treatment&#xD;
      response is poor. Owing to the poor understanding on the mechanism, treatment of functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia has been far from satisfactory. There are numerous modalities of medical treatment&#xD;
      that has been reported to be effective but the results are conflicting. Large and&#xD;
      well-controlled studies in functional dyspepsia have shown that proton pump inhibitor had a&#xD;
      therapeutic gain of about 10%-15% better than placebo in patients with functional dyspepsia.&#xD;
      However, this positive effect was restricted to patients with reflux-like dyspepsia, a&#xD;
      subgroup that actually is no longer considered to belong to functional dyspepsia. Prokinetic&#xD;
      agent is another class of drug that has been widely used in functional dyspepsia. Although&#xD;
      recent reviews suggest that prokinetics are more effective than placebo, most trials were&#xD;
      flawed with significant heterogeneity among studies. Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) is&#xD;
      another important class of drug that is commonly used in various functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders (FGID) and chronic pain disorders. The effectiveness of TCA in FGID has been&#xD;
      supported by a meta-analysis, which reported that improvement in global GI symptoms against&#xD;
      placebo was highly significant. The mechanism of TCA in treatment of FGID is poorly&#xD;
      understood but the therapeutic effect is evident even in low dose, suggesting that it is&#xD;
      independent of its anti-depressive action. To date, clinical trial of TCA in treatment of FD&#xD;
      with sufficient sample size and well-defined clinical endpoint is still lacking. So the&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of imipramine, a tricyclic&#xD;
      antidepressant, in treatment of functional dyspepsia.&#xD;
