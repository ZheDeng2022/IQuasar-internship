      Phase I: The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      Maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose of ALIMTA plus oxaliplatin when given&#xD;
      with folate and vitamin B-12 supplementation in the treatment of patients with unresectable,&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. The Phase I component of the study will be&#xD;
      activated for enrollment of Mayo Clinic patients only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      tumor response rates to ALIMTA plus oxaliplatin and oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil and&#xD;
      leucovorin in patients with locally advanced unresectable or Stage IV colorectal cancer that&#xD;
      have not received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive either ALIMTA plus oxaliplatin (Arm A) or Oxaliplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil and&#xD;
      Leucovorin (Arm B). The Phase II component of the study will be activated for enrollment of&#xD;
      patients via the Mayo Clinic Cancer Research Consortium mechanism. A comparison will be made&#xD;
      of the side effects between regimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALIMTA, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (alone or with leucovorin) have shown activity as&#xD;
      single agents in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Their different mechanisms of action&#xD;
      make the combination of ALIMTA with oxaliplatin attractive as potential first-line therapies&#xD;
      in terms of improving response rates and overall survival in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Current reports of the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-FU as first-line&#xD;
      therapies suggest that there may be advantages in combining oxaliplatin with other&#xD;
      antifolates in the treatment of colorectal cancer. ALIMTA is an attractive candidate to&#xD;
      replace other drugs such as 5-FU in the combinations with oxaliplatin in the treatment of&#xD;
      locally advanced and metastatic colorectal cancer. ALIMTA has potential advantages over 5-FU&#xD;
      when combined with oxaliplatin because it requires a single short injection and inhibits&#xD;
      multiple targets in the folate pathway. Therefore, we propose to conduct a trial reporting&#xD;
      the clinical effectiveness and side effects of ALIMTA plus oxaliplatin and one of the current&#xD;
      standards of care, the FOLFOX 4 regimen (Oxaliplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin).&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.11 Phase I and II Required Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.111 Pathologic or cytologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. Patients&#xD;
        must have locally advanced unresectable or Stage IV colorectal cancer that is not amenable&#xD;
        to curative therapy. See Protocol Appendix VI, American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging&#xD;
        Criteria for Colorectal Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.112 Measurable disease as defined by RECIST criteria (see Section 11.0). Patients who do&#xD;
        not have measurable disease, but who do have evaluable disease, may be enrolled in the Ph I&#xD;
        portion of the study only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.113 Prior radiation therapy allowed to &lt;25% of the bone marrow (see Protocol Appendix&#xD;
        VII, Distribution of Active Bone Marrow in the Adult), and patients must have recovered&#xD;
        from the toxic effects of the treatment prior to study enrollment (except for alopecia).&#xD;
        Patients are allowed to have received standard postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy for&#xD;
        rectal cancer. Prior radiotherapy must be completed &lt; 30 days before study entry. Lesions&#xD;
        that have been radiated in the advanced setting cannot be included as sites of measurable&#xD;
        disease unless clear tumor progression has been documented in these lesions since the end&#xD;
        of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.114 ECOG performance status (PS) of 0, 1or 2 (see Protocol Appendix IV).&#xD;

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alk Phos (AP), AST less than or equal to 3.0 x ULN (AP and AST less than or equal to 5&#xD;
             ULN is acceptable if liver has tumor involvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal: calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;= 45 mL/min based on the standard&#xD;
             Cockcroft and Gault formula (see table below) or on measured glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rate (GFR) using the appropriate radiolabeled method (51-CrEDTA or Tc99m-DTPA).&#xD;
             Enrollment and dosing decisions based on creatinine clearance may be made using local&#xD;
             lab values (calculated using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula [see below]) The&#xD;
             serum creatinine must be assayed at the same local lab each time for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cockcroft and Gault Equation Creatinine clearance for males = (140 - age)(weight&#xD;
                  in kg) (72)(serum creatinine in mg/dL) Creatinine clearance for females = 140 -&#xD;
                  age)(weight in kg)(0.85) (72)(serum creatinine in mg/dL) Moderate renal&#xD;
                  impairment is calculated creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min (32). Mild renal&#xD;
                  impairment is calculated creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min (32).&#xD;
