  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the efficacy of montelukast&#xD;
      in the treatment of adults ≥50 years of age with persistent asthma and/or COPD. Primary&#xD;
      outcomes included forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and daytime asthma symptoms&#xD;
      scores. Nocturnal symptoms, asthma control, health-related quality of life, peak flow&#xD;
      measurements, and health care utilization were also assessed as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Participants were recruited from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest member population. One&#xD;
      hundred forty-nine subjects were randomized to treatment with montelukast (10 mg per day) or&#xD;
      placebo, and were followed for a six-week period. No differences in lung function measures,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, health care utilization, and asthma symptom scores were&#xD;
      observed; however, the montelukast group had slightly improved asthma control scores compared&#xD;
      to the placebo group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asthma and COPD are common chronic conditions in older adults. Adherence to therapy is an&#xD;
      important consideration since patients typically take two or more medications a day and often&#xD;
      have difficulties with inhaled breathing medications. Therefore, oral preparations, such as&#xD;
      leukotriene modifiers, have considerable appeal for older adults with asthma or COPD. Phase 3&#xD;
      primary studies of the leukotriene modifier, montelukast sodium (Singulair), for the&#xD;
      management of asthma have included very few older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed as a pilot&#xD;
      study to evaluate the efficacy of montelukast, in addition to usual therapy, in the treatment&#xD;
      of older adults with asthma and/or COPD. Primary outcomes included pre-bronchodilator forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and average daytime asthma symptom scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were recruited from Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), an HMO with 450,000&#xD;
      members in Portland, OR. All were adults ≥50 years of age with asthma and/or COPD who were&#xD;
      symptomatic despite using daily breathing medications. They were screened by phone to collect&#xD;
      information on asthma symptoms, medications, health care utilization, and co-morbid&#xD;
      illnesses. Eligible persons attended a baseline visit to further assess eligibility and&#xD;
      collect baseline data, including smoking status, co-morbidities, and participant&#xD;
      demographics. Spirometry was performed before and twenty minutes after administration of four&#xD;
      puffs of inhaled albuterol delivered by metered dose inhaler. All participants received&#xD;
      instructions about the use of a peak flow meter; maintenance of a daily asthma diary with&#xD;
      peak flow measurements, symptoms, and medications; and optimal use of an MDI by spacer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants completed a two-week run-in period with placebo pills and used diaries to record&#xD;
      peak flow each morning, use of inhaled ß-agonist, nocturnal awakenings for asthma, and&#xD;
      occurrence of asthma attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 149 participants were randomized and received either montelukast(one 10 mg&#xD;
      tablet/day) (N=71) or placebo(one tablet/day) (N=78). Spirometry was repeated at the&#xD;
      randomization visit, and information on health status, asthma quality of life, and asthma&#xD;
      control was collected. Participants were followed for 6 weeks after randomization. A&#xD;
      telephone call was made at three-weeks to collect information about adverse experiences. At&#xD;
      the final visit, participants completed spirometry, and answered questions on health status,&#xD;
      asthma QOL and asthma control. Unscheduled health care visits for asthma during the six-week&#xD;
      study period were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results showed that improvement in asthma control was mixed. A small improvement in the&#xD;
      montelukast group was seen using one of the two control measures. There was no difference in&#xD;
      lung function, asthma symptom scores, health care utilization, or health-related quality of&#xD;
      life between the treatment and control groups.&#xD;
