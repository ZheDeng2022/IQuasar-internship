      This study is being performed so that tumor and blood samples from patients who will receive&#xD;
      breast cancer treatment prior to surgery can be collected and stored for future research.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients must have a primary measurable invasive breast cancer with the primary&#xD;
             tumor intact (T1, 2, 3, or 4, any N, M0 or M1). Recurrent disease in the breast is&#xD;
             also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient's clinical plan will include neoadjuvant systemic therapy (chemotherapy,&#xD;
             hormonal therapy, biologic therapy), prior to surgery on the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The clinical plan for patients with recurrent or M1 disease must include breast&#xD;
             surgery after neoadjuvant systemic therapy. This would include patients with non-bulky&#xD;
             M1 disease who the treating physicians feel would benefit from local control of&#xD;
             disease after neoadjuvant systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have had mammography performed at the University of Michigan, OR outside&#xD;
             film review prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All patients are required to sign an informed consent regarding the experimental&#xD;
             purpose of the research biopsies and serum banking, in accordance with the University&#xD;
             of Michigan Institutional Review Board standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Breast tumors that are not measurable by any of the modalities, including physical&#xD;
             examination, mammography, or ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Tumors diagnosed by excisional biopsy, or incisional biopsy that does not leave&#xD;
             measurable disease by physical examination, mammography, or ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must not have received any prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation&#xD;
             therapy for their current breast cancer. Patients who received tamoxifen or other&#xD;
             agents for prevention of breast cancer may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with another active systemic malignancy in the past year.&#xD;
