      Many options currently exist to relieve the symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia&#xD;
      (BPH). At present, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) serves as the surgical&#xD;
      standard to which all other operative treatments are compared. Although TURP provides&#xD;
      excellent short and long-term results, this procedure has many potential risks and&#xD;
      complications. The desire to avoid the potential risks of TURP and still achieve results of&#xD;
      comparable durability has led to the development of alternative surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such surgical alternative in the treatment of BPH is holmium laser ablation of the&#xD;
      prostate (HoLAP). HoLAP has been compared to TURP in a randomized clinical trial with&#xD;
      comparable outcomes in both uroflow rate and symptom score improvements (Mottet, et al 1999).&#xD;
      Use of the holmium laser in treating BPH provides specific advantages over TURP. The risk of&#xD;
      dilutional hyponatremia is eliminated, as the holmium laser can be used in conjunction with a&#xD;
      normal saline irrigant. In addition, the hemostatic properties of the holmium laser results&#xD;
      in superior hemostasis, thus minimizing the risk of bleeding. HoLAP has been utilized for&#xD;
      prostate glands up to 60 grams in volume, as larger glands become more inefficient to treat&#xD;
      using a tissue vaporization technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, another laser technology has been introduced for the surgical treatment of BPH, the&#xD;
      potassium titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser. This modality can also be used to vaporize&#xD;
      obstructive prostate tissue, and has been studied through single arm clinical studies.&#xD;
      Short-term results are promising, with significant improvements in voiding symptoms and urine&#xD;
      flow rates as well as minimal associated morbidity. However, to date a randomized comparison&#xD;
      study between HoLAP and KTP laser vaporization of the prostate has not been reported. A group&#xD;
      of investigators with extensive experience with both procedures intends to objectively&#xD;
      compare these two procedures in a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

      The traditional surgical therapy for BPH is a transurethral resection of the prostate&#xD;
      (McConnell et al, 1994). This surgery involves the insertion of a telescope (resectoscope)&#xD;
      transurethrally into the prostate and bladder. An electrocautery loop attached to the&#xD;
      resectoscope is then used to core out the inside of the prostate until the surgical capsule&#xD;
      of the prostate is reached. A large catheter is left in the bladder for at least 1 day and&#xD;
      saline irrigation of the bladder is often required for post-operative bleeding. Once the&#xD;
      urine is clear, the catheter is removed and the patient undergoes a voiding trial. If voiding&#xD;
      is successful, the patient is discharged home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TURP produces excellent short and long-term results and remains a standard of care for the&#xD;
      surgical treatment of BPH. Unfortunately, this durable procedure has many potential risks and&#xD;
      complications including bleeding requiring blood transfusion (~5%), intraoperative&#xD;
      complications (e.g. prostate capsule perforation), urethral and bladder injury, dilutional&#xD;
      hyponatremia and the TUR syndrome, urinary tract infection (~5-10%), incontinence (~1%),&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction (~5%), bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture (~5%), and delayed&#xD;
      bleeding resulting in clot retention or secondary procedures to control bleeding. (American&#xD;
      Urological Association [AUA] Guideline on Management of Benign Hyperplasia (2003). Chapter 1:&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations Journal of Urology, 170: 530, 2003.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      One alternative to TURP that has been shown in a randomized clinical trial to reproduce the&#xD;
      excellent results of TURP has been holmium laser ablation of the prostate (HoLAP) (Mottet et&#xD;
      al, 1999). HoLAP is a simple procedure to perform in smaller prostate glands (ideally &lt; 60&#xD;
      gm) and recently reported results suggest that this procedure produces good results that are&#xD;
      durable up to 7 years (Gilling et al, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new technology for use during prostate ablation is the high power potassium&#xD;
      titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser (Malek et al, 2000). This surgical procedure involves the use&#xD;
      of the Laserscope™ KTP laser (San Jose, CA) to vaporize obstructing prostatic tissue in a&#xD;
      technique similar to HoLAP. Most investigators have reported no significant complications&#xD;
      with this new technology and in most cases, significant improvements in American Urological&#xD;
      Association symptom scores and urine flow rates have been documented (Malek et al, 2000).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, no randomized comparison study between HoLAP and KTP laser prostatectomy has&#xD;
      been performed.&#xD;
