    <textblock>
      Brushite kidney stones are a unique form of calcium phosphate stones that have a tendency to&#xD;
      recur quickly if patients are not aggressively treated with stone prevention measures. Little&#xD;
      research has been undertaken to better understand the clinical history and potential urinary&#xD;
      abnormalities that may predispose one to these troublesome kidney stones.&#xD;

      Multiple treatment options are available for the treatment of kidney or ureteral calculi.&#xD;
      Treatment options include shock wave lithotripsy (SWL; shock waves are transmitted through&#xD;
      the body wall and focused onto the stone to break the stone into gravel), percutaneous&#xD;
      nephrolithotomy (PNL; a small flank incision is made and a telescope inserted into the kidney&#xD;
      to allow stone fragmentation and removal from the patient), and ureteroscopic lithotripsy&#xD;
      (URS; a small telescope is inserted into the ureter or kidney and a laser is used to break up&#xD;
      the stone into gravel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brushite is a unique form of calcium phosphate kidney stone that often has sub-optimal stone&#xD;
      fragmentation with shock wave lithotripsy (Heimbach et al, 1999). Due to its SWL resistance,&#xD;
      brushite patients often undergo more invasive treatments such as URS or PNL to achieve a&#xD;
      stone free status. Brushite patients often have multiple stones and have a high likelihood of&#xD;
      developing recurrences (new stone formation or regrowth of existing stone fragments), often&#xD;
      within the first year after surgery. These patients may also have a history of anatomical&#xD;
      abnormalities of the urinary tract or a history of prior renal or ureteral surgery (Klee et&#xD;
      al, 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thorough review of the clinical, radiological and metabolic data of brushite patients has&#xD;
      the potential to clarify a number of important points. Many patients with brushite stones&#xD;
      often have a history of non-brushite stones (e.g. calcium oxalate) predating the development&#xD;
      of brushite stones and historical review is needed to define the factors contributing to this&#xD;
      shift in stone composition. In addition, it has been shown that CT attenuation values can be&#xD;
      used to predict stone composition (Joseph et al, 2002). As a result, it is crucial to review&#xD;
      the radiologic appearance of known brushite stones to identify specific radiographic&#xD;
      characteristics and possibly allow a radiographic diagnosis of brushite to be established.&#xD;
      Finally, very little information has been reported on the urinary abnormalities in brushite&#xD;
      patients. By carefully examining 24 hour urine data in a large population of brushite&#xD;
      patients, information may be identified that can be used to provide improved management of&#xD;
      specific abnormalities to prevent stone recurrences.&#xD;
