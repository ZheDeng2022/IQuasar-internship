  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective psychosocial interventions for individuals with an alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      co-occurring with a severe mental health problem such as bipolar disorder are lacking.&#xD;
      Treatment engagement, adherence, and retention are a major challenge and crucial to achieving&#xD;
      a favorable outcome. The early phase of recovery is a key period during which an effective&#xD;
      intervention exerts its most significant impact. Our proposed treatment intervention is aimed&#xD;
      at addressing early recovery issues, engagement, and treatment and medication adherence in&#xD;
      bipolar alcoholics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to develop and refine a theoretically based and procedurally specified individual&#xD;
      adherence therapy intervention for co-occurring alcohol use and bipolar disorder in early&#xD;
      recovery, to develop standardized procedures, methods, and techniques so that treatment is&#xD;
      delivered with a high degree of fidelity and competence, and to test the efficacy of this&#xD;
      intervention through a randomized, parallel-group design comparing this new intervention with&#xD;
      current regular clinical care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Co-occurring alcoholism and bipolar disorder is a significant comorbid condition representing&#xD;
      serious clinical challenges and treatment difficulties and is associated with severe&#xD;
      disabilities, morbidity, and heightened risk for suicide. Despite the recent increased&#xD;
      attention to the problem of psychiatric comorbidity with alcoholism and other substance use&#xD;
      disorders, little research has been conducted on this complex form of comorbidity, especially&#xD;
      in regard to effective treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhancing treatment engagement, adherence, and retention is perhaps the most challenging&#xD;
      clinical concern faced by clinicians caring for this population. Poor adherence is a major&#xD;
      clinical problem among bipolar disorder with alcoholism. Poor adherence is associated with&#xD;
      substantial medical expenses and loss of productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors interfering with treatment adherence range from access to treatment, to health care&#xD;
      providers disposition towards these patients, and to symptoms related to both bipolar&#xD;
      disorder and alcoholism. Enhancing motivation for treatment and improving treatment adherence&#xD;
      are essential components for an initial treatment intervention for this population. Our&#xD;
      proposed treatment intervention is based on the principles of Motivational Enhancement&#xD;
      Therapy and also integrates psychosocial and pharmacotherapy interventions that have been&#xD;
      successfully used with alcoholism and other addictive disorders. It is practical and easy to&#xD;
      learn and administer in the framework of general clinical care by health professionals with&#xD;
      varied educational backgrounds.&#xD;
