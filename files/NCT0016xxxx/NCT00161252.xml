  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The widespread availability of screening coupled with high risks of over diagnosis, over&#xD;
      treatment, and a rising risk of dying from competing causes of deaths pose a major challenge&#xD;
      for prostate cancer patients and our health care system. Data on outcomes and identification&#xD;
      of patients who are likely to benefit from therapies are urgently needed to empower patients&#xD;
      and health professionals and to allocate limited health resources wisely. The long-term goal&#xD;
      of this population-based study is to improve prostate cancer care for elderly patients. In&#xD;
      2004, approximately thirty percent of the 230,110 new prostate cancer cases diagnosed will be&#xD;
      in men over age 75. Elderly men have a high risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer, but&#xD;
      a relatively low risk of dying of this disease, and are often excluded from cancer trials.&#xD;
      While the value of primary androgen deprivation for localized prostate cancer remains&#xD;
      questionable, this treatment is widely used among elderly patients. Currently, there is&#xD;
      insufficient outcomes data to guide treatment choices for elderly patients.The following are&#xD;
      the key background considerations that provide the rationale for this proposed project:·&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is prevalent among elderly men. · Over diagnosis and competing causes of&#xD;
      death are important issues for elderly men with prostate cancer.· Androgen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy (ADT) is being increasingly used as primary therapy among elderly patients with&#xD;
      localized disease· There are insufficient outcomes data to support the use of primary&#xD;
      androgen deprivation for non metastatic prostate cancer· Preliminary dataThe study population&#xD;
      in this sub-project is a sub-sample of the large study (IRB # 5177 ) and the research methods&#xD;
      are identical in both studies.&#xD;

        To compare overall and prostate cancer specific survival among elderly patients receiving&#xD;
        primary androgen deprivation therapy and conservative management for non-metastatic&#xD;
        prostate cancer diagnosed in 1992-1999&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed at age 75 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer in 1992-1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled in Medicare for the 12 months before diagnosis for an adequate assessment of&#xD;
             baseline comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B through death or the end of the study period to&#xD;
             have an adequate claim history of cancer treatment over the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alive for at least 6 months after cancer diagnosis. This criterion will remove men who&#xD;
             are diagnosed at death or who are dying and have severe comorbidities, and are&#xD;
             therefore poor candidates for 'aggressive' cancer interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled in Medicare managed care plans during the study period since no Medicare&#xD;
             claims are available during the period of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have other types of cancer. This criterion will ensure that all cancer therapies&#xD;
             identified from the Medicare claims are for prostate cancer exclusively.&#xD;
