  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that ABPM can be used to improve&#xD;
      study design for interventional trials in children with hypertension.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ABPM is a standard technique in adult antihypertensive trials to study the magnitude and&#xD;
      duration of effect of investigational drugs. These methods are needed for pediatric studies.&#xD;
      Before such methods can be developed, preliminary information must be collected to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the device can be used for antihypertensive studies in children (i.e, to&#xD;
      determine the dropout rate following the first ABP study, to determine the frequency of white&#xD;
      coat hypertension in a selected population, to compare casual (office) blood pressures&#xD;
      commonly used to diagnose hypertension in children with those obtained by ABPM, and to assess&#xD;
      the placebo effect in children with borderline and mild hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete 24 hour ABPM on two occasions within one week.&#xD;
      During the ABPM parents and children will be asked to keep a diary recording the times that&#xD;
      the child slept. A crossover design will be used, where subjects are initially randomized to&#xD;
      either drug or placebo and then will be crossed over to the other intervention at a set time&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female children 5-16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Borderline or mild systolic and or diastolic hypertension as defined by 1996 Task&#xD;
             Force criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No current drug therapy for hypertension being taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be ambulatory and willing to wear an ABP monitor for 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to refrain from swimming, showering and other activities that might result in&#xD;
             damage to ABP monitor during the two 24 hour intervals that the monitor is worn.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Standing height between 45 inches and 73 inches&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed parental consent and patient assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe or life threatening hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any drug therapy that may raise or lower the blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any severe bleeding disorder or concurrent treatment with anticoagulant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-ambulatory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous history of significant non-compliance with prescribed medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the&#xD;
             accurate measurement of the blood pressure or place the subject at risk unnecessarily.&#xD;
