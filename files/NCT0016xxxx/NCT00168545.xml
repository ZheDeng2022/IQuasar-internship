      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General: To investigate the immunological background for the non-specific effects of&#xD;
           diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and measles vaccines on child mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific: Examine the cytokine responses and possible association with morbidity in a&#xD;
           study of DTP vaccinated children who will be randomised to receive a measles vaccine or&#xD;
           no vaccine at 4½ months of age. (All children will receive a measles vaccine at 9 months&#xD;
           of age)&#xD;

      Non-specific effects of vaccines The idea of vaccines having non-specific effects was first&#xD;
      proposed in 1991 from a study in Senegal, West Africa. It was discovered that children&#xD;
      receiving high-titre measles vaccine (HT) at 6 months of age had higher mortality than&#xD;
      children who received the standard titre measles vaccine (STD) at 9 months of age. The&#xD;
      difference was found only for girls. A study from Haiti confirmed the effect. Since children&#xD;
      vaccinated with HT had lower mortality than their equivalents who had not received any&#xD;
      measles vaccine, the difference in mortality between recipients of HT vaccine and STD vaccine&#xD;
      was explained by a non-specific beneficial effect of the STD measles vaccine rather than a&#xD;
      harmful effect of the HT vaccine. The non-specific beneficial effect of STD measles vaccine&#xD;
      on child mortality has been reconfirmed in many data-sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the BCG vaccine is associated with striking effects on child mortality reducing&#xD;
      mortality by about 50%. Further, among BCG vaccinated children, having a BCG scar or a&#xD;
      positive tuberculin reaction was associated with about 55% lower mortality in the following&#xD;
      12 months than among children who had a negative tuberculin reaction or who did not have a&#xD;
      BCG scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of OPV is difficult to separate from the effects of BCG and DTP vaccines since OPV&#xD;
      is normally given together with these vaccines. There have, though, been some periods without&#xD;
      DTP in Bissau due to global shortage of vaccines, and we have compared the case fatality at&#xD;
      the hospital for children who received only OPV and children who received both the prescribed&#xD;
      OPV and DTP. Children having received OPV had 3-fold lower mortality than children having&#xD;
      received both vaccines. Data from an OPV vaccination campaign that took place in&#xD;
      Guinea-Bissau also suggested a non-specific beneficial effect for the recipients. Further,&#xD;
      studies from Chile and the Soviet Union have suggested that OPV had a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, DTP, HBV and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) seem to exert a non-specific&#xD;
      detrimental effect on child mortality, although the findings on DTP were considered&#xD;
      controversial by a recent review. Current studies indicate that the negative effect of DTP&#xD;
      may be neutralized by a subsequent measles vaccination. It is striking that all the vaccines&#xD;
      with a non-specific beneficial effect are live, whereas the vaccines with an apparently&#xD;
      harmful effect are killed. Results from animal studies have shown that attenuated live&#xD;
      vaccines tend to induce a Th1 response and offer better protection against severe disease&#xD;
      than the corresponding inactivated vaccines, which tend to induce a Th2 response. So far,&#xD;
      very few studies have examined whether these effects differ between male and female animals.&#xD;
      One study reported that BCG-vaccinated female mice were better protected against malaria&#xD;
      parasites than male mice (31). There is therefore an urgent need to conduct studies that can&#xD;
      help uncover the immunology behind the non-specific effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sex-specific effects All epidemiological studies carried out so far confirms the observation&#xD;
      that non-specific effects are sex-specific. Live vaccines (measles, BCG, OPV) have a&#xD;
      beneficial effect that is particularly good for girls whereas inactivated vaccines (DTP, HBV,&#xD;
      IPV) have a negative effect for girls. To date, there are no immunological studies which have&#xD;
      examined whether routine vaccines affect the immune system differently for boys and girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We thus propose to study, in a randomised controlled trial of measles vaccination taking&#xD;
      place in Guinea-Bissau, the immunology of non-specific effects of vaccination, and their&#xD;
      interaction with sex. Specifically, among children who have received the 3 recommended doses&#xD;
      of DTP, we will be able to compare the cytokine and antibody profiles of children who receive&#xD;
      an early dose of measles vaccine at 4½ months of age with children who receive no additional&#xD;
      vaccine at this age.&#xD;
