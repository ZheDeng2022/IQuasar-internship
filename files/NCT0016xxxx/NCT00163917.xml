    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a sub-population of patients with burn&#xD;
      injuries needing dressing changes respond to virtual reality (VR) utilising relaxation themes&#xD;
      with improved pain and anxiety scores, when added to PCA morphine and background analgesic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain associated with burn dressing changes does not arise purely from a physical source; it&#xD;
      is also commonly influenced by psychological factors. The anticipation that accompanies a&#xD;
      dressing change has the potential to set up fear and heightened anxiety as the patient is&#xD;
      aware that at a predetermined time other people will manipulate injured areas on his/her&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many techniques of analgesia have been advocated in burn dressing changes. Opiates have been&#xD;
      the mainstay, and many techniques for their administration have been described. In particular&#xD;
      the use of background plus PCA administration of opiates has been demonstrated to be superior&#xD;
      to PCA administration alone. Another analgesic/dissociative agent commonly described for&#xD;
      these procedures is Ketamine. Both opiates and ketamine have limitations in that they cause&#xD;
      unfavourable side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation and nausea and vomiting in&#xD;
      the case of opiates and respiratory depression, hallucinations and unpleasant dreams in the&#xD;
      case of ketamine. Other problems relating to the use of opiates and ketamine relate to the&#xD;
      approach of treating a multifaceted experience such as burn dressing pain solely with&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for psychological interventions in burn dressings has been highlighted by many&#xD;
      researchers. In particular, Ptacek noted that burn patients experiencing more anxiety tended&#xD;
      to have higher ratings of pain, while those with larger areas of burns reported more&#xD;
      affective pain and greater variability in pain ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong consistency among reviewers for recommending the addition of adjunctive&#xD;
      therapies of a psychological nature for managing patients having burn dressing changes.&#xD;
      Patterson et.al in particular is of the belief that burn patients having dressing changes are&#xD;
      more amenable to hypnotherapy as an analgesic adjunct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of psychological interventions examined by researchers have included hypnosis&#xD;
      (where strong suggestions were aimed at reducing tension, anxiety, and sensation of pain),&#xD;
      rapid induction analgesia, simple stress reducing strategies, attention and information, and&#xD;
      autohypnosis. While some have conducted prospective trials which involve large numbers of&#xD;
      patients, only one trial actually made mention of randomizing participants. Most other&#xD;
      reports examining psychological therapies have been at the case report level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While most of these trials and case reports have reported favourable outcomes, no single&#xD;
      trial has been able to consistently show a significant reduction of pain scores and anxiety&#xD;
      ratings and analgesic consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Reality (VR) assisted techniques that modify psychological well-being are beginning&#xD;
      to play a role in clinical practise and in research. There are currently two publications,&#xD;
      one a case report and another a prospective randomized trial which specifically examine the&#xD;
      role of VR in the context of painful procedures associated with burn injuries. The randomized&#xD;
      crossover trial by Hoffman et.al in 6 patients having physical therapy utilising immersive VR&#xD;
      found a significant reduction in pain ratings in all patients, while Patterson et.al&#xD;
      described the successful use of VR hypnosis in one &quot;difficult&quot; patient which had lasting&#xD;
      effects for up to 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews of psychological therapies for patients having burn dressing changes have addressed&#xD;
      the need for more systematic controlled trials to supplement existing evidence and more&#xD;
      clearly define the role of such interventions. Coupled with this is the need for more&#xD;
      knowledge as to the most appropriate psychological intervention and the ideal situations&#xD;
      where it will prove most beneficial. Patterson feels that there is good anecdotal evidence&#xD;
      that burn patients have a particular propensity to respond to adjunctive therapies&#xD;
      incorporating hypnosis. Hypnosis screening among burn patients involving the hypnotic&#xD;
      induction profile demonstrated a link between high hypnotizability and the experience of more&#xD;
      intense arousal, greater avoidance and more significant feelings of intrusiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a prospective randomized trial which looks at the effect that VR&#xD;
      relaxation has when combined with PCA morphine in a group of patients having potentially&#xD;
      painful dressing changes. In addition we want to isolate patients who have high&#xD;
      susceptability to hypnosis and compare their ratings of pain, anxiety and opiate requirement&#xD;
      with patients of lesser susceptibility. Our hypothesis is that patients with higher&#xD;
      susceptibility to hypnosis stand to gain most from the addition of VR to their&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
