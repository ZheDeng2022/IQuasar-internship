      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new antipsychotics, quetiapine (300-500mg/day)&#xD;
           and risperidone (3-4mg/day) compared to each other and to fluphenazine (10-15mg/day), a&#xD;
           high potency typical antipsychotic in patients who meet the DSM IV criteria for&#xD;
           schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine (1200mg/day) in patients who have not&#xD;
           responded to conventional and newer antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine (300-500mg/day), and risperidone (3-5mg/day)&#xD;
           compared to each other and fluphenazine (10-15mg/day) in the treatment of hostility and&#xD;
           aggression in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine (300-500mg/day) and risperidone (3-5mg/day)&#xD;
           compared to each other and fluphenazine (10-15mg/day) on rates of discharge, quality of&#xD;
           life, and independent living skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess prolactin levels and to evaluate any relationship with sexual dysfunction and&#xD;
           menstrual irregularities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the possible differential impact of treatment conditions on cognitive&#xD;
           functioning including measures of attention, motor speed, problem solving, verbal and&#xD;
           visual memory, and verbal processing speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To measure changes in weight and health consequences associated with weight changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three arm multi-center randomized double-blind study. After open label treatment&#xD;
      with each individual being optimized with routine antipsychotic treatment for 4-6 weeks to&#xD;
      prospectively establish lack of response to conventional antipsychotic therapy, approximately&#xD;
      180 patients with schizophrenia who are experiencing clinically significant psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms will be recruited (minimum 150 enrolled) in the double-blind period of the study.&#xD;
      All participants will sign consent forms before participating in this research study. If&#xD;
      participants choose to enroll in the high dose quetiapine arm (period IIIb), they will sign&#xD;
      an additional consent form before entering period IIIb.&#xD;
