  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric patients under the mental impaired influences, their living function were&#xD;
      disabled, and their social lives were handicapped consequently. Idea psychiatric treatment is&#xD;
      to control the psychiatric symptoms in a better way, to develop efficient psychiatric&#xD;
      adjustment, to manage living stress into a lower level, to gradually develop the meaning and&#xD;
      value of the patients' lives, and to obtain the satisfaction and happiness in life for them.&#xD;
      In order to investigate the satisfaction for psychiatric patients under the current treatment&#xD;
      and to evaluate their psychiatric health, it is necessary to measure the mental health status&#xD;
      for the psychiatric patients, and to ensure the ideological status of psychiatric treatment.&#xD;
      If there is a mental health measurement for the psychiatric patients, we may precisely&#xD;
      identify the mental health levels of the patients and their mental disturbances degrees.&#xD;
      Accordingly, we may develop efficient procedure to manage the mental health for the&#xD;
      psychiatric patients, and to achieve the goal for the idea psychiatric treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we established the mental health assessment data sheet according to the&#xD;
      clinical experiences. It includes mental health index data sheet, mental-and-physical stress&#xD;
      response data sheet, mental sustentation data sheet, and supplemented with a general living&#xD;
      satisfaction assessment data sheet. We will evaluate the reliability and validity of this&#xD;
      study to ensure the usability of these data sheet in clinics. We will also recruit the&#xD;
      continuous treated and mentally stabilized patients as subjects. After obtaining their&#xD;
      written informed consents, we will go through these mental health assessments to discover the&#xD;
      mental health status of these psychiatric patients, and use it as a reference to develop idea&#xD;
      psychiatric treatment. We will use ICC test for the repeated measurement validity, Pearson r&#xD;
      correlation coefficient within our data analyses to evaluate the validity of the same&#xD;
      measurement, and independent t-test to assess the differences between the patient group and&#xD;
      the society group (from previously established data files). This study result may evaluate&#xD;
      the possible deficits existing in the traditional psychiatric treatment and may be used as a&#xD;
      reference for the development of idea psychiatric medicine.&#xD;
