  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7974 after&#xD;
      bolus IV administration, on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle, to patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      that have progressed following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MTD for the Day 1 21-Day schedule was defined at the 0.45 mg/m2 dose level. The study was&#xD;
      terminated prior to full enrollment of the colorectal cancer (CRC) expansion cohort, due to a&#xD;
      lack of demonstrated activity resulting in Principal Investigator (PI) loss interest to&#xD;
      continue enrollment. Collection of all outstanding data is ongoing and database lock is&#xD;
      estimated to be complete in June 2008.&#xD;

        for entry into the study. Patients must:&#xD;

             creatinine clearance &gt;= 40 mL/minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count &gt;=&#xD;
             1,500/µL, hemoglobin of &gt;= 9 g/dL (may be transfused), and platelet count (not&#xD;
             transfused) &gt;= 100,000/µL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x ULN and alanine&#xD;
             transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;= 3 times the upper limits of&#xD;
             normal (ULN), unless related to liver involvement by tumor, in which case &lt;= 5.0 x&#xD;
