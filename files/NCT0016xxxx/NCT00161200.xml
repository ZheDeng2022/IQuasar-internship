  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, we are trying to identify patients with the earliest signs of abnormality in&#xD;
      the lining of the lower part of the food pipe (or esophagus) known as intestinal metaplasia&#xD;
      (IM); also commonly called Barrett's esophagus or Barrett's Epithelium (BE). IM is sometimes&#xD;
      difficult to diagnose by routine microscopic examination (called histology). We have&#xD;
      developed a specific antibody, a protein called immunoglobulin that specifically reacts with&#xD;
      another partner protein, if it exists. Using this marker antibody (called mAb Das-1) that has&#xD;
      been patented (US patent #5,888,743), we have shown that this marker can detect the abnormal&#xD;
      changes in the distal esophagus before it is evident by histology. IM usually develops in the&#xD;
      face of long-term acid reflux from the stomach to the esophagus and causes the lining to&#xD;
      change from the normal squamous type (like that of skin) to a type of lining normally seen in&#xD;
      the small intestine and colon. A subgroup of patients with IM may, subsequently, develop&#xD;
      histologically evident Barrett's Epithelium and a small percent of these patients may develop&#xD;
      cancer of the esophagus. Thus, BE is considered as a pre-cancerous condition. We already have&#xD;
      an ongoing IRB for the portion of the project involving taking biopsies and performing the&#xD;
      antibody staining to identify patients that react with the antibody but histologically&#xD;
      negative for BE.&#xD;

      We propose to study prospectively 68 patients who have been identified as positive with mAb&#xD;
      DAS-1 immunostaining without histological evidence of specialized columnar epithelium (&quot;True&#xD;
      Barrett's&quot; epithelium) during routine endoscopy for dyspepsia or GERD symptoms. These&#xD;
      patients have been studied for initial screening for antibody staining under IRB protocol&#xD;
      #1698. This number is based on the statistical analysis by Fisher's exact test and has 90%&#xD;
      power to detect a 30% negativity (mAb Das-1 positive to negative) at a p&lt;0.05 level. During&#xD;
      participation in IRB Protocol #1698, initial biopsy specimens were taken at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the squamo-columnar junction (at least 2 sites - 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions and&#xD;
           any other area with mucosal &quot;tongues&quot; of columnar epithelium),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  one from squamous epithelium at the distal esophagus to seek for the presence of&#xD;
           esophagitis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  one from antrum for the presence or absence of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and one from the gastric cardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following endoscopy and participation in IRB Protocol #1698, for the symptomatic patients who&#xD;
      are not taking any proton pump inhibitor, an H2 blocker, Ranitidine (Zantac√í) 150 mg twice&#xD;
      daily, will be started while the biopsy is being analyzed for histology and&#xD;
      immunocytochemical stainings. This is usually completed within 2 weeks. Patients who showed&#xD;
      positive reactivity in at least one biopsy sample taken during participation in Protocol&#xD;
      #1698 with mAb Das-1 will be included in this study. Patients who have been taking a proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor (PPI) for longer than 3 months preceeding study entry are not eligible to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Patients who have been taking proton pump inhibitors for 3 months&#xD;
      or less at the time of the endoscopy and biopsy screening for mAb Das-1, may participate in&#xD;
      this study 4 weeks after discontinuing the PPI (i.e., a 4 week washout period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive either Pantoprazole, 40 mg&#xD;
      twice daily (34 patients), or continued on Ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily (34 patients) for a&#xD;
      total period of 6 months. Pantoprazole and Ranitidine will be provided by Wyeth and the code&#xD;
      will be kept by the pharmacy department at The Cancer Institute of New Jersey. The drugs will&#xD;
      be provided free of cost to the patients for the entire period. Patients will be followed as&#xD;
      out-patients at three-month intervals up to 6 months. Patients will be advised to return any&#xD;
      unused capsules during the follow-up visits. The number of unused capsules as well as review&#xD;
      of the patient's medication diary will allow assessment of non-compliance. Patients must be&#xD;
      at least 75% compliant to remain on the study. If any patient complains of persistent&#xD;
      symptoms, an effort will be made to provide relief with antacids, as much as needed. However,&#xD;
      if the patient is still symptomatic, they will be taken off the study and unblinded. If the&#xD;
      patient is on Ranitidine they will be switched to open label Pantoprazole and will be&#xD;
      followed and further treated in a routine manner. If the patient is taking Pantoprazole, pH&#xD;
      monitoring to document acid reflux and planning of further management will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a follow-up endoscopy at 6 months, with no cost to the patient. This&#xD;
      cost will be born by the grant received by Dr. Das. Additional endoscopy will be performed at&#xD;
      12 months and 24 months, which is the current &quot;standard care&quot; procedure for surveillance in&#xD;
      such patients. Follow-up biopsy specimens will be taken the same way as the initial specimens&#xD;
      and processed to see any changes in histology and mAb Das-1 reactivity.&#xD;
