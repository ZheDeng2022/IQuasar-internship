  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the optimum injection rate for E7337 (Iomeron 350) in dynamic CT in patients who&#xD;
      have hepatic lesions.The primary endpoint for efficacy is the contrast enhancement effect in&#xD;
      the early arterial phase, and the primary safety endpoints are warming sensation and vascular&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteira:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients scheduled for a dynamic CT scan of the liver who have at least one hepatic&#xD;
             lesion that has been confirmed by diagnostic imaging (ultrasonography, etc.) between 1&#xD;
             and 35 days before the start of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are 20 years or older at the time of obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Items that may affect the safety evaluation of E7337&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who have undergone or are scheduled to undergo an examination using&#xD;
                  another contrast agent between 7 days before administration of E7337 and the time&#xD;
                  of follow-up examinations on Day 8 after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients for whom follow-ups seem to be difficult to conduct until the time of&#xD;
                  examination on Day 8 (i.e. when it may fail to evaluate delayed adverse drug&#xD;
                  reactions).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients who have undergone or are scheduled to undergo surgical treatment or a&#xD;
                  therapy such as percutaneous ethanol injection therapy, percutaneous microwave&#xD;
                  coagulation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, or transcatheter arterial&#xD;
                  embolization, etc., from the time diagnostic imaging such as abdominal&#xD;
                  ultrasonography is performed up until follow-up examinations are conducted on Day&#xD;
                  8 after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients who continuously need to take analgesics between the morning of&#xD;
                  administration of E7337 and the completion of CT examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patients who are currently participating in another clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Patients who participated in another clinical study within 3 months prior to&#xD;
                  providing informed consent for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  consent).&#xD;
