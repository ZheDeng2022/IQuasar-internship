  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall response to standard therapies and to the newer antiangiogenesis therapies is not&#xD;
      curative, and treatment-associated toxicities may be severe. Therefore, continued evaluation&#xD;
      of therapies, with different mechanisms of action, is needed for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      RCC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 31,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) occur each year in the United&#xD;
      States, with a death rate of about 11,600 annually. Many patients present with advanced or&#xD;
      unresectable disease, and up to 30% of patients who are treated with nephrectomy will&#xD;
      relapse. The 5 year survival rate for metastatic renal RCC is estimated at &lt; 10%. Surgical&#xD;
      resection of discernible disease is the only potentially curative treatment. No significant&#xD;
      improvement in survival has been demonstrated for patients with metastatic RCC who have been&#xD;
      treated with systemic hormonal, chemotherapeutic, and radiation therapy. Interferon alpha has&#xD;
      about a 15% objective response rate in appropriately selected patients. Administration of&#xD;
      interleukin 2 (IL 2) has shown a similar response rate; however, approximately 5% of highly&#xD;
      selected patients had durable complete remissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies demonstrated that RCC cells harbor abnormalities of the von Hippel-Lindau&#xD;
      (VHL) gene, playing a key role in the stimulation of angiogenesis by vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF) in this highly vascularized tumor. The novel agents sunitinib (Sutent)&#xD;
      and sorafenib (Nexavar) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced RCC, and both bevacizumab (Avastin) and temsirolimus have shown&#xD;
      significant activity in treatment-naïve patients. Prolonged progression-free survival has&#xD;
      been reported with sorafenib and sunitinib in randomized, controlled phase 2 and 3 studies,&#xD;
      and improved survival has been reported with temsirolimus in poor-risk patients in a phase 3&#xD;
      randomized study.&#xD;
