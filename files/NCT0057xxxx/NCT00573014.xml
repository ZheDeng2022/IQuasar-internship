    <textblock>
      The optimal method of clearing the cervical spine in obtunded trauma patients is unclear.&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) identifies most injuries but may miss ligamentous injuries. Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (MR) imaging has been widely used to exclude ligamentous injuries. We postulate&#xD;
      that with the new generation of CT scanners, MR imaging is not needed to rule out significant&#xD;
      injuries. Our protocol for clearing the cervical spine in obtunded trauma patients depends on&#xD;
      CT alone. We are prospectively following these patients and performing a clinical examination&#xD;
      when they are awake to show this is a safe approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All OBTPs with gross movement of all four extremities admitted to MetroHealth Medical Center&#xD;
      (MHMC), the regional Level I Trauma Center in Cleveland OH, who underwent a CT CS at MHMC&#xD;
      between October 2006 and September 2008 will be included. Prospective data will be collected&#xD;
      on these patients including age, gender, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on&#xD;
      admission, results of CT CS, GCS at the time of collar clearance, day of collar clearance,&#xD;
      collar complications, date of reexamination, and results of reexamination. We will define an&#xD;
      obtunded patient as a patient who was unable to reliably describe the presence or absence of&#xD;
      CS symptoms in the opinion of the examining physician. Patients needed to have gross movement&#xD;
      of all four extremities to be included in the study; if they did not, they were excluded. The&#xD;
      presence or lack of sensory examination was not evaluated for the purposes of this study. We&#xD;
      will define cervical collar complications as skin breakdown identified either by the skin&#xD;
      care team during weekly rounds in the intensive care unit or by the treating physician at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

    <description>One hundred ninety-seven patients had their collars removed and CS cleared at a mean of 3.3 days. Removal of CS precautions in OBTPs with gross movement of all extremities is safe and efficacious if CT CS is negative for injury. Supplemental MRI CS is not needed in this patient population.

        Subjects will include all patients (including children) after blunt trauma in whom cervical&#xD;
        spine injury has not been ruled out admitted to MetroHealth Medical Center from&#xD;
        10/1/2004-9/30/2006. We are excluding patients with an obvious neurologic deficit&#xD;
        attributable to the cervical spine. We are excluding patients with abnormalities of the&#xD;
        cervical spine that are identified on either plain films or CT. We are also excluding those&#xD;
        patients in whom the cervical spine can be cleared clinically due to normal mental status.&#xD;
