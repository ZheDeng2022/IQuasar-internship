  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the toxicity/safety of CHOP chemotherapy given concurrently with&#xD;
      rituximab, followed by maintenance PEG Intron in patients with anthracycline naïve indolent&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study will also evaluate response rates, time to progression,&#xD;
      molecular response, and immunologic parameters related to this treatment.will have an ocular&#xD;
      exam prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study will receive 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy with the standard&#xD;
      CHOP regimen given in conjunction with rituximab. Cycles are repeated at 21-day intervals for&#xD;
      six to eight cycles. Patients achieving at least a partial response to chemotherapy will&#xD;
      begin PEG Intron at a dose of 2g/kg/week subcutaneously. PEG Intron treatment will be&#xD;
      continued for 12 months in the absence of signs of progressive/recurrent disease, or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity/intolerance of therapy. PEG Intron dosing will be adjusted based on the&#xD;
      presence of symptoms or other clinical manifestations of toxicity. Patients will undergo bone&#xD;
      marrow evaluation for molecular testing at baseline. Those found to be positive will have&#xD;
      repeat assessments performed post induction therapy, and after six months of PEG Intron.&#xD;
      Patients will also undergo immunologic evaluation at baseline, post induction therapy, and&#xD;
      after six months of PEG Intron. At the end of PEG Intron therapy, patients will have disease&#xD;
      reevaluation and then annual data collection for long-term toxicity, duration of response and&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;

      This study will assess the toxicity/safety of CHOP chemotherapy given concurrently with&#xD;
      rituximab, followed by maintenance PEG Intron in patients with anthracycline naïve indolent&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study will also evaluate response rates, time to progression,&#xD;
      molecular response, and immunologic parameters related to this treatment. Adult patients with&#xD;
      indolent, advanced stage, anthracycline naive NHL requiring treatment may be eligible.&#xD;
      Patients must have measurable disease, no severe organ dysfunction, and normal ejection&#xD;
      fraction in older patients. Patients also must have adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal&#xD;
      function, performance status, and life expectancy of at least 18 months. Patients may not&#xD;
      have CNS lymphoma, uncontrolled co-morbid conditions, pregnancy, HIV, and active psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions. Additionally, patients may not have had prior hypersensitivity to&#xD;
      interferon-alpha, other cancer within 5 years, significant heart disease or myocardial&#xD;
      infarction within the last 6 months, and history of thrombosis. Additionally, patients will&#xD;
      have an ocular exam prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study will receive 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy with the standard&#xD;
      CHOP regimen given in conjunction with rituximab. Cycles are repeated at 21-day intervals for&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed, or refractory disease are eligible as long as&#xD;
             they have symptoms or signs which require treatment in the opinion of the treating&#xD;

             estimated ejection fraction &gt; 0.45 (45%) by MUGA or echocardiography, performed within&#xD;
             two months of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             &lt; 2.0 mg/dl, Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl; AST &lt; 3 x upper normal; ALP &lt; 3 x upper normal (if&#xD;
             liver function abnormalities are felt to be due to hepatic involvement by lymphoma,&#xD;
             bilirubin &lt; 6 mg/dl; AST &lt; 4 x upper normal; ALP &lt; 4 x upper normal will be accepted).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. All patients will have a complete eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist at&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        14. Patients with negative HBSAg are eligible. In the absence of HBSAg negative results,&#xD;
        the following will apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with positive HBSAg must be further evaluated for potential risk of hepatitis&#xD;
             B reactivation (see baseline evaluations). If it is felt that the benefits of&#xD;
             rituximab-based therapy outweigh the risks of Hepatitis B reactivation, the patient&#xD;
             may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator and will be referred to&#xD;
             gastroenterology for evaluation and possible prophylactic therapy (see baseline&#xD;
             evaluations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If the patient requires immediate treatment prior to determination of HBSAg results,&#xD;
             and the risk of lymphoma outweighs the potential risk of hepatitis B reactivation, the&#xD;
             patient may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
