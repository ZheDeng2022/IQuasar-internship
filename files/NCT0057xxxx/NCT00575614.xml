  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether prucalopride is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prucalopride given at a dose of 1 mg o.d. for 4 weeks to female patients with chronic&#xD;
      constipation shows a favourable effect on most of the efficacy parameters assessed in this&#xD;
      trial. This dosage can be considered safe and generally well-tolerated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase II trial set up&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy, safety and physiological effects of prucalopride 1 mg&#xD;
      administered o.d. for 4 weeks to female patients with chronic idiopathic constipation. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this trial was to assess the effect of prucalopride 1 mg on whole gut&#xD;
      transit (measured as changes from baseline in total number of markers).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  female subjects of 18 years or over;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of chronic constipation during at least 6 months before selection,&#xD;
             characterized by either two or fewer spontaneous (ie, without using laxatives) bowel&#xD;
             movements in a week or straining at defaecation at least a quarter of the time;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  within 20% of her body weight as specified in the Metropolitan Life Insurance&#xD;
             Company's 1983 Height and Weight Table2;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  healthy on the basis of a pre-trial physical examination, medical history,&#xD;
             anamnesis,electrocardiogram and the results of biochemistry, haematology and&#xD;
             urinalysis, carried out within 3 weeks of randomization. If the results of the&#xD;
             laboratory tests were not within the reference ranges, the subject could only be&#xD;
             included on condition that the investigator did not judge the deviations to be&#xD;
             clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  use of disallowed concomitant medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who had undergone surgery for their constipation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects with faecal impaction;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects suffering from different types or causes of constipation other than&#xD;
             idiopathic constipation, ie, presence of secondary causes, eg, endocrine disorders,&#xD;
             metabolic disorders, neurologic disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects with a megacolon/megarectum;&#xD;
&#xD;

             inflammatory bowel disease. If complaints of constipation were of recent onset, ie,&#xD;
             had been present for less than one year, and the subject was 40 years or older,&#xD;
             results of a Ba-enema or of colonoscopic examination were required;&#xD;
&#xD;

             disease, neurologic or psychiatric disorders (including substance abuse/dependence,&#xD;

             serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) concentration of &gt; 2 times the normal&#xD;
             limit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnancy or wish to become pregnant in the course of the trial. Lack of an acceptable&#xD;
             birth control method;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  breast-feeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who had received an investigational drug in the 30 days preceding the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who were unable or unwilling to return for required follow-up visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects whose reliability and physical state would prevent proper evaluation of a&#xD;
             drug trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history or suspicion of alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
