  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a common and important health issue. Although effective treatment is often&#xD;
      available for localized disease, metastatic prostate cancer remains incurable. The initial&#xD;
      treatment for metastatic prostate cancer often includes medical or surgical treatments that&#xD;
      deprive the tumor of male hormones (androgens) required for growth. Although this treatment&#xD;
      is successful for many patients, the cancer may eventually return in others. Recurrent&#xD;
      prostate cancer may be treated with additional hormonal agents, but these agents usually do&#xD;
      not result in long-term control of the disease. Eventually most patients with recurrent&#xD;
      prostate cancer progress to a state where the cancer grows despite very low level of&#xD;
      circulating male hormones known as androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC).&#xD;

      Patients will undergo a screening procedure to determine eligibility of trial. During the&#xD;
      treatment period, the patient will be given docetaxel/bevacizumab on day 1 followed by RAD001&#xD;
      continuously on days 2-21 and this is called a treatment cycle. Patients will be able to&#xD;
      continue to receive multiple treatment courses as long as the cancer does not get worse and&#xD;
      the person does not develop other problems that would prevent him from staying in the study.&#xD;
      The final part of the research is the study completion period which includes an end of&#xD;
      treatment visit and subsequent follow-up visits. These visits take place whenever the&#xD;
      research medication is stopped, even if it is stopped early. For the patient's safety, he/she&#xD;
      should at least complete the end of treatment visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Bone Scan Progression: Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan attributable&#xD;
             to prostate cancer&#xD;
