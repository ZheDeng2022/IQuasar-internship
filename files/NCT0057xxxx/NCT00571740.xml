      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth&#xD;
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find&#xD;
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may&#xD;
      also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving monoclonal antibodies together with combination chemotherapy may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together&#xD;
      bevacizumab works as first-line therapy, followed by combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab&#xD;
      with or without cetuximab as second-line therapy in treating patients with stage IV&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of bevacizumab and cetuximab as first-line treatment for&#xD;
           metastatic colorectal cancer, as measured by percentage of patients who remain&#xD;
           progression-free at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate adverse events, confirmed response, duration of response, time to disease&#xD;
           progression, time to treatment failure, and survival of patients treated with&#xD;
           bevacizumab and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate adverse events, confirmed response, duration of response, time to disease&#xD;
           progression, time to treatment failure, and survival of patients who are refractory to&#xD;
           dual-agent bevacizumab and cetuximab and are subsequently treated with modified FOLFOX7&#xD;
           chemotherapy and bevacizumab with or without cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate quality of life parameters in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the direct medical resource utilization and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the reliability of FDG-PET as a measurement of early treatment response, as&#xD;
           measured by percentage of patients who are progression-free at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify circulating angiogenesis biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assay the activity of pro-angiogenic factors in plasma angiogenic assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study*. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance&#xD;
      status (0-1 vs 2) and number of metastatic sites (1 vs &gt; 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Participating site must be PET-qualified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First-line therapy: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and cetuximab IV&#xD;
           over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease proceed to&#xD;
           second-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second-line therapy: Patients are randomized* to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I (modified FOLFOX7 with bevacizumab only): Patients receive bevacizumab IV&#xD;
                over 30-90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV over 2&#xD;
                hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
                repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
                toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II (modified FOLFOX7 with bevacizumab and cetuximab): Patients receive&#xD;
                bevacizumab and modified FOLFOX7 as in arm I. Patients also receive cetuximab IV&#xD;
                over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
                progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Randomization occurs prior to receiving first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for translational studies. Samples are&#xD;
      analyzed for circulating endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells via flow&#xD;
      cytometry; angiogenic activity of serum/plasma in angiogenesis-dependent diseases via&#xD;
      endothelial proliferation assay and matrigel tube formation assay; and circulating&#xD;
      angiogenesis biomarkers (i.e., free VEGF, soluble FLT-1, and KDR) via ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed periodically using the UNISCALE, Skindex-16, and Skin Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
