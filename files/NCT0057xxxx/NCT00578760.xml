  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin (ASA) has been shown, in an animal model, to attenuate the ototoxic properties of&#xD;
      cisplatin. The researchers plan to investigate this in patients undergoing cisplatin&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesise that low-dose aspirin can prevent cisplatin induced ototoxicity&#xD;
      in the clinical setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin has the highest ototoxic potential of all platinum containing compounds. It is used&#xD;
      in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, germ cell tumours of the&#xD;
      testis and bladder carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      42% of 400 patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (70-85 mg/m2, median cumulative dose 420mg)&#xD;
      experienced common toxicity criteria (CTC: appendix 1) grade 3 or 4 symptoms (De Jongh 2003).&#xD;
      Ototoxicity is dose related: 75-100% of patients receiving a very high dose and 20-40% with a&#xD;
      low dose regime will develop significant ototoxic symptoms. In one study, 50% of head and&#xD;
      neck cancer patients treated with cisplatin develop ototoxicity (Blakley 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin ototoxicity can present as a variable collection of symptoms and signs. These&#xD;
      include bilateral and symmetrical hearing loss that is permanent and irreversible. High&#xD;
      frequency sensorineural hearing loss with progression towards lower frequencies. Tinnitus,&#xD;
      that is also permanent and irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of known factors that can predispose to cisplatin ototoxicity. They&#xD;
      include: Dose, duration and mode of administration, age extremes, previous or concurrent&#xD;
      cranial irradiation, previous history of hearing loss, renal disease, concomitant use of&#xD;
      other ototoxic drugs, noise exposure with concomitant cisplatin administration, decreased&#xD;
      serum albumin level, low hemoglobin level, low red blood cell count and a low haematocrit.&#xD;
      Interestingly, cisplatin ototoxicity is considered to be exclusively confined to the&#xD;
      cochlear, the vestibular system is unaffected (Myers 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ototoxicity from chemotherapeutic agents is due, in part, to reactive oxygen species.&#xD;
      Reactive oxygen species can be attenuated by antioxidants. Salicylates are antioxidants that&#xD;
      can be administered as aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown, in an animal model, that aspirin can protect hearing from cisplatin&#xD;
      induced ototoxicity (Li 2002). In this set of experiments, the rat was used to evaluate the&#xD;
      protective role of aspirin in both the acute and chronic setting. Auditory evoked brain stem&#xD;
      responses were used to determine pre- and post-intervention hearing thresholds. In the acute&#xD;
      experiments (n=23), one dose of cisplatin (16mg/kg) was administered and the animals were&#xD;
      given aspirin (100mg/kg) starting the day before cisplatin treatment and continuing 4 days&#xD;
      thereafter. There was a significant difference in hearing thresholds between the treatment&#xD;
      and control groups at 3, 8 and 14kHz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the chronic experiments cisplatin was given on days 1, 4 and 7 (5mg/kg). Aspirin was given&#xD;
      from 2 days before to 3 days after cisplatin treatment (100mg/kg bd). The hearing thresholds&#xD;
      were compared before the first dose and 10 days after the last treatment. In those animals&#xD;
      treated concurrently with aspirin, their hearing did not differ form control animals at 16&#xD;
      and 24 kHz. This was correlated to a significant reduction in inner hair cell loss from 20%&#xD;
      (cisplatin) to 8% (cisplatin and aspirin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salicylates also protected renal function as determined by both plasma blood urea nitrogen&#xD;
      and creatinine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salicylates did not affect tumour mass or metastasis. The rats were inoculated with malignant&#xD;
      breast cancer cells (metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma). Aspirin protected against&#xD;
      cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, without affecting the oncolytic action of the cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gentamicin and cisplatin both have a similar ototoxic mechanism of action. Aspirin has been&#xD;
      shown to prevent gentamicin-induced hearing loss without compromising its anti-bacterial&#xD;
      efficacy in both animal models and the clinical setting (Sha 2006, Chen 2007). Sha's group&#xD;
      reported a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial with 200 patients. The patients all&#xD;
      required gentamycin for clinical indications. In the 'treatment' arm of the study, the&#xD;
      patients also received aspirin (1g tds for 14 days). A significant difference in hearing was&#xD;
      shown at 6 and 8kHz of &gt;15dB if aspirin was not given.&#xD;
