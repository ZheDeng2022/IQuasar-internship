      The purpose of this research study is to apply new non-invasive, no-risk techniques to a&#xD;
      cardiac transplant population for assessment of their reliability in detecting heart&#xD;
      transplant rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft rejection remains a major factor limiting long-term survival despite continued&#xD;
      advancement in the use of immunosuppression. Aggressive surveillance for the detection of&#xD;
      acute rejection is therefore necessary. Repeated endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) (at least 11&#xD;
      times the first year after transplantation) remains the only reliable surveillance method&#xD;
      available. EMB is expensive, invasive, inconvenient to the patient, and associated with a&#xD;
      significant incidence of serious complications. Therefore, it would be very important for&#xD;
      patient care if new no-risk methods would prove to be effective in surveillance of rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is designed to measure non-invasive ways to assess rejection along with&#xD;
      the standard planned endomyocardial biopsies you will have after heart transplantation.&#xD;
      First, the investigators plan to test the effectiveness of the investigational use of the CMI&#xD;
      2406 Magnetocardiograph that has been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
      While the device used in the study is FDA-approved for the non-invasive measurements and&#xD;
      recordings of the heart's magnetic field reflecting the heart's electrical currents, it is&#xD;
      not yet approved for the specific use of detection of transplant rejection.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to test the hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tissue Doppler Imaging, Real time 3D segmental volume measurements, Magnetocardiographic&#xD;
           Imaging plus serum markers and T-cell response change when transplant rejection occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tissue Doppler Imaging, Real time 3D segmental volume measurements, Magnetocardiographic&#xD;
           Imaging plus serum markers and T-cell response remain stable when no rejection occurs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart transplantation is an advantageous procedure for selected patients with end-stage heart&#xD;
      failure. All patients remain on lifetime calcineurin immunosuppressive medications such as&#xD;
      cyclosporine or tacrolimus to prevent rejection and extend graft function. Currently, the&#xD;
      common practice in managing these patients has been titration of immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications to establish trough levels and clinical response. However, despite the diligent&#xD;
      efforts to balance &quot;adequate&quot; immunosuppressive levels with prevention of end-organ toxicity&#xD;
      or opportunistic infection; patients still experience acute rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft rejection remains a major factor limiting long-term survival despite continued&#xD;
      advancement in the use of immunosuppression. Aggressive surveillance using the gold standard&#xD;
      of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) for the detection of acute rejection is therefore necessary.&#xD;
      Repeated EMB (a minimum of 11 times the first year after heart transplantation) remains the&#xD;
      only reliable surveillance method available. EMB is expensive, invasive, inconvenient to the&#xD;
      patient, and associated with a significant incidence of serious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperacute rejection occurs rarely since screening of recipient for anti-donor antibodies has&#xD;
      been introduced. However, the focal or diffuse acute cellular rejection is more common and is&#xD;
      diagnosed by EMB. The degree or severity of rejections is graded on a scale from 0 to 4 with&#xD;
      a grade 3 or more being considered severe. Most acute cellular rejections occur within the&#xD;
      first year after transplant. Chronic rejection or allograft arteriopathy occurs later and is&#xD;
      monitored by coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiogram:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiograms are routinely performed in transplant patients. The findings of increased&#xD;
      wall thickness decreased isovolumetric relaxation time and decreased compliance as well as&#xD;
      decreased right ventricular (RV) or left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction may indicate&#xD;
      rejection, and these parameters may normalize when the rejection resolves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) measurements are relatively new Doppler techniques for assessing&#xD;
      left ventricular diastolic function. Selective measurements of tissue contraction and&#xD;
      relaxation velocities at the mitral annulus can detect left ventricular dysfunction more&#xD;
      accurately than conventional echocardiography. As left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is&#xD;
      an early event during allograft rejection, these techniques may be useful for detecting&#xD;
      rejection non-invasively. Few studies have shown that Doppler tissue imaging of the mitral&#xD;
      annulus is useful in diagnosing heart transplant rejection (1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real time 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography (RT-3D) may be a useful tool in evaluation of&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular apical thrombi, valvular disease, in&#xD;
      guiding intracardiac catheter placement and mitral valvuloplasty. RT-3D, which has recently&#xD;
      become widely available, provides dynamic pyramidal data structures that encompass the entire&#xD;
      heart and allows four-dimensional assessment of cardiac anatomy and function. It has been&#xD;
      shown that this technique is very precise in determination of LV volume, mass and EF&#xD;
      measurement and is well correlating with MRI (4-6). Mild changes in LV volume, LV mass and&#xD;
      function occur during acute cardiac rejection. This very sensitive technique for assessment&#xD;
      of regional volumetric changes has not yet been used for heart transplants monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetocardiogram:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Magnetocardiograph (MCG) is a novel imaging modality that may provide a sensitive and&#xD;
      objective means to assess alterations in the heart tissue. Because the acute inflammatory&#xD;
      process of rejection deleteriously affects myocyte structure and function, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that either or both the de- and re-polarization changes will occur in the cardiac cycle with&#xD;
      subsequent changes in the cardiac magnetic fields and may give altered readings in the&#xD;
      affected patient over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a new modality which utilizes superconducting quantum&#xD;
      interference devices for the detection of the weak magnetic fields (picoTesla range)&#xD;
      generated by the heart's electrical currents. The magnetic field map picture, which is&#xD;
      created by the measurements of the magnetic field, reflects the electrophysiological state of&#xD;
      the heart. When there is an abnormality in cardiac depolarization or repolarization, such as&#xD;
      in ischemia or myocarditis, this is reflected in an abnormality in the magnetic field map&#xD;
      (7). Although MCG and ECG both measure the cardiac depolarization and repolarization&#xD;
      patterns, they have fundamental differences. MCG is most sensitive to tangential currents&#xD;
      whereas ECG is most sensitive to radial currents in relation to the chest surface (7-10).&#xD;
      Cardiac abnormalities, which interfere with the normal activation and deactivation sequence,&#xD;
      such as may occur in acute rejection, increase the contribution of tangential currents. In&#xD;
      addition, the MCG detects the vortex currents which are not evident by ECG. Finally, the MCG&#xD;
      is less affected by conductivity variations caused by lungs, skin, and muscles and there is&#xD;
      no skin electrode contact problem since the device does not come in direct contact with the&#xD;
      skin. Therefore, the MCG may be able to detect differences in depolarization and&#xD;
      repolarization in a different manner and with a higher sensitivity than the ECG. We speculate&#xD;
      that the variation in the magnetic field pattern is due to early subtle changes in cellular&#xD;
      mechanisms or metabolism. These changes create a heterogeneous repolarization pattern&#xD;
      probably caused by local currents appearing at the border zones between normal and diseased&#xD;
      myocardium. This implies that changes in the MCG may appear even earlier in the cascade of&#xD;
      rejection than wall motion abnormalities, ECG changes, or changes in serum markers such as&#xD;
      troponin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schmitz et al reported a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 93% for the detection of&#xD;
      acute rejection episodes in 15 transplant patients (11). Another study, utilizing a different&#xD;
      analysis method, found a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 84%, respectively for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of graft rejection in 12 patients and 6 controls (12).&#xD;
