  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with schizophrenia abuse cannabis at the onset of their illness, portending&#xD;
      a poorer course of illness and poorer treatment response. Preliminary evidence suggests that&#xD;
      clozapine may uniquely reduce substance use in patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to establish an effective methodology for studying early treatment with&#xD;
      clozapine in patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder, while&#xD;
      generating pilot data comparing clozapine vs. risperidone on substance use, psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms, side effects, and treatment discontinuation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a relapsing disorder that produces profound effects on those afflicted once&#xD;
      it becomes chronic, often leading to a severe and long-term disability. However, during the&#xD;
      initial years of illness many patients are more treatment responsive and may achieve&#xD;
      substantial periods of remission. Comorbid substance use disorder, a common concomitant of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, is associated with increases in morbidity and mortality. Within the early&#xD;
      phases of schizophrenia, comorbid cannabis use disorder (CUD), the most common comorbid&#xD;
      disorder (approximately 50%), appears to be linked to a poor outcome in these patients, and&#xD;
      may be a factor in their long-term deterioration. While data indicate that first episode&#xD;
      patients presenting with comorbid CUD have an earlier onset of illness and a poorer outcome&#xD;
      than those without CUD, continued cannabis use after antipsychotic treatment, which occurs in&#xD;
      approximately 50% of these patients in the initial months after hospitalization, is&#xD;
      associated with an even worse outcome. The apparent &quot;toxicity&quot; of cannabis use in first&#xD;
      episode patients is paralleled by data from chronic patients, in whom CUD is associated with&#xD;
      clinical exacerbations, non-compliance with treatment, poor global functioning, and increased&#xD;
      relapse. A growing body of data suggests that a critical period exists in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia during the early phases of psychosis in which symptoms and functioning continue&#xD;
      to worsen, and that treatment with antipsychotic medications during this period may improve&#xD;
      the natural course of the disorder. While the availability of novel antipsychotic medications&#xD;
      has sparked further research in the early phases of schizophrenia, there have been few&#xD;
      studies including clozapine (CLOZ). We hypothesize that CLOZ may be more effective than other&#xD;
      novel agents in controlling cannabis use in patients with first episode schizophrenia who are&#xD;
      comorbid for CUD. We postulate that standard antipsychotic medications do not decrease&#xD;
      substance use in this population largely because they do not restore normal functioning of&#xD;
      the dysfunctional dopamine (DA) pathways. CLOZ, by contrast, through its varied actions on&#xD;
      dopaminergic, serotonergic and, particularly, noradrenergic neurons, coupled with its weak D2&#xD;
      and potent noradrenergic alpha2 blocking ability, may tend to have a &quot;normalizing&quot; effect on&#xD;
      the signal detection capability of these dysfunctional DA systems. CLOZ is rarely used in&#xD;
      first episode patients even though it is generally considered a highly effective medication,&#xD;
      and more likely to prevent relapses than typical antipsychotics in both treatment refractory&#xD;
      and non-refractory populations. While side effects of CLOZ are a clinical concern and need to&#xD;
      be taken seriously, experience over the past 2 decades has increased the comfort level for&#xD;
      its use. For example, agranulocytosis has actually occurred in 0.37% with implementation of&#xD;
      the required white count monitoring system, and granulocyte stimulating therapy has provided&#xD;
      an effective treatment for those few patients who do develop agranulocytosis. Gradual dose&#xD;
      titration schedules appear to reduce risk for seizure and myocarditis, and experience in&#xD;
      first episode patients suggesting that the clinically effective dose of CLOZ is lower than in&#xD;
      chronic patients indicates that these risk should be even lower. If our hypothesis is&#xD;
      correct, CLOZ, despite its side effect profile, may have a key therapeutic role in these&#xD;
      patients, a role with important public health implications. Yet without a clear demonstration&#xD;
      of the benefit/risk and benefit/burden profiles of its use, the naturalistic experiment of&#xD;
      assessing the overall effectiveness of CLOZ in first episode patients who are comorbid for&#xD;
      CUD is unlikely to be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is enrolling individuals who are in their first episode of schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder and who are currently using cannabis. Study participants undergo a&#xD;
      screening visit including the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) for diagnostic evaluation, and a physical examination,&#xD;
      blood tests, and review of medical, psychiatric, and substance use history. Following the&#xD;
      screening visit, eligible participants are randomly assigned to single-blind treatment with&#xD;
      clozapine or risperidone for 24 weeks. Participants assigned to clozapine initially receive a&#xD;
      daily dose of 12.5 mg, which is carefully titrated to the lowest dose necessary to manage&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms and well tolerated. Participants assigned to risperidone initially receive&#xD;
      0.5 mg daily and are carefully titrated in the same fashion. Cross titration off of the&#xD;
      previous antipsychotic (if any) and onto study medication is completed within 2-4 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants on clozapine have weekly blood tests. Concomitant medications are minimized and&#xD;
      kept stable throughout the protocol except as needed to manage side effects or urgent&#xD;
      clinical symptoms. Study medication, psychiatric visits, assessments and labwork are all&#xD;
      provided without charge to participants. Study visits take place once a week. At study&#xD;
      visits, medication side effects, physical and psychiatric symptoms, substance use, and&#xD;
      treatment services received are assessed. A Lifestyle Intervention is also provided to help&#xD;
      prevent metabolic side-effects in this vulnerable population, and assist with recovery. The&#xD;
      investigators meet weekly to review clinical care and manage any variations in study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

        <description>Based on the small sample size, it was not possible to test the differences between the two groups for statistical significance. Data on cannabis use were gathered weekly using the Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) method. At the end of the study, graphs were plotted showing days of cannabis use per week and rated as &quot;Improved,&quot; &quot;Unchanged,&quot; or &quot;Worse&quot; by a pair of expert judges. Raters were instructed to rate the graph &quot;Improved&quot; or &quot;Worsened&quot; if it appeared to be &gt;20% better or worse and to rate it &quot;Unchanged&quot; if there was little or no change (less than ~20%).</description>

        <description>Based on the small sample size, it was not possible to test the differences between the two groups for statistical significance. Data on psychiatric symptoms were gathered using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; weekly), Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGIS; weekly) and Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS; bi-weekly).
