  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether magnetic resonance (MR) techniques can detect&#xD;
      changes caused by chemotherapy in the livers of patients who have been treated for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. Some patients who undergo chemotherapy for colorectal cancer may experience&#xD;
      side-effects in their livers. These side effects may influence further treatment options. If&#xD;
      this study finds that MR techniques detect changes in the liver due to chemotherapy, then MR&#xD;
      methods may eventually be used to help patients and physicians plan further treatment.&#xD;

      Each patient will have 4 MR exams: prior to or within one week of the start of the&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen, one after 6 weeks of chemotherapy, a third after completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (between 12 and 24 weeks post-initiation of chemotherapy) and a long term&#xD;
      followup study at least 4 months after the completion of chemotherapy. Normal volunteers will&#xD;
      be recruited and studied by MR for comparison to patient data.&#xD;

    <description>You will have two MR exams on two different days. There will be no injection of contrast material. An MR exam requires about 1 hour. The second MR exam will take place 2-3 weeks after the first one. This second MR exam will take about 1 hour and will look at whether the results from the MR exams are reliable and repeatable.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  21 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma (patients only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resected primary colorectal cancer and no metastatic disease or primary colorectal&#xD;
             cancer with no metastatic disease and planned resection after neo-adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy or metastatic colorectal carcinoma considered by the attending physician&#xD;
             to have resectable or potentially resectable hepatic metastases (patients only). Each&#xD;
             patient will be staged by his/her attending physician in the Department of Medicine or&#xD;
             Surgery. Hepatic metastases are considered resectable if they are expected to be&#xD;
             completely removable with negative margins by a procedure that leaves behind&#xD;
             sufficient liver parenchyma with arterial/portal blood supply, venous drainage and&#xD;
             biliary drainage for subsequent regeneration and survival. Potentially resectable&#xD;
             indicates that a reduction in tumor size due to chemotherapy could render the tumors&#xD;
             resectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to cooperate for an MR exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to MR:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aneurysmal clips&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any ferrous metallic implants which could be deflected by the magnet&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metal implants in field of view which could distort the images and spectroscopy&#xD;
                  data&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age and mental status wherein he/she is unable to cooperate for MR study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are considered to have unresectable hepatic metastases will be excluded.&#xD;
             Hepatic metastases are considered unresectable if their removal would leave behind&#xD;
             insufficient liver parenchyma for subsequent regeneration and survival. In addition,&#xD;
             hepatic metastases are considered unresectable if their removal would be expected to&#xD;
             leave behind residual disease (positive margins). Also, patients are considered&#xD;
             unresectable if they have any comorbid conditions which would jeopardize successful&#xD;
             recovery from hepatic resection.&#xD;
