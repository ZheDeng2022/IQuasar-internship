  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is find whether the addition of N-acetylcysteine (antioxidant)&#xD;
      to dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade involving angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitor and AT-1 angiotensin II receptor blocker leads to the reduction of proteinuria,&#xD;
      main prognostic marker of chronic kidney disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the progression of&#xD;
      chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) may retard CKD&#xD;
      progression. Dual pharmacological blockade of the RAAS with ACEI and ARB is recommended as a&#xD;
      standard renoprotective management at least in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD.&#xD;
      However, neither ACEI nor ARB, even in high doses or in concomitant usage, abrogate the&#xD;
      progression of CKD completely. Innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with CKD off&#xD;
      dialysis. Additional antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine) may prove to be such beneficial&#xD;
      therapeutic concept. To shed more light on this issue, we performed a randomised open&#xD;
      controlled study to evaluate the influence of triple N-acetylcysteine and RAAS therapy on&#xD;
      surrogate markers of kidney injury, i.e. proteinuria, markers of tubular involvement and&#xD;
      kidney fibrosis.&#xD;

    <description>N-acetylcysteine (ACC) 1200 mg In the 8-weeks run-in period angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonists were administered to achieve the target blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg. Next, they were randomly assigned to add (or not) 1200 mg N-acetylcysteine in two active treatment periods lasting 8 weeks each</description>
