    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective cohort study describing pregnancy outcomes in women&#xD;
      with pre-existing (prior to pregnancy) type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to any&#xD;
      formulation of exenatide during pregnancy. The pregnancy registry will compare the occurrence&#xD;
      of the pregnancy outcomes of interest with those collected from a prospective group of women&#xD;
      with pre-existing type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to one or more antidiabetic&#xD;
      medications other than exenatide during pregnancy. Insulin exposures are acceptable in both&#xD;
      groups but must be in addition to one or more other antidiabetic medications in the&#xD;
      non-exenatide group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to evaluate the percentage of major birth defects (i.e., those&#xD;
      that caused significant functional or cosmetic impairment, required surgery, or were&#xD;
      life-limiting) following use of exenatide during pregnancy for treatment of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      compared to the percentage of major birth defects following use of one or more antidiabetic&#xD;
      medications other than exenatide during pregnancy for treatment of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the Exenatide Pregnancy Registry are to evaluate the percentage&#xD;
      of other adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth)&#xD;
      and any potential impact of exenatide use during breastfeeding among pregnancies or births in&#xD;
      women who used exenatide for pre-existing type 2 diabetes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted in the United States (US). Enrollment in the Registry is&#xD;
      voluntary. The Exenatide Pregnancy Registry is sponsored by AstraZeneca and is managed by INC&#xD;
      Research, LLC. The scientific conduct and analysis of the Registry is overseen by a Registry&#xD;
      Review Committee (RRC) consisting of experts in maternal and fetal medicine,&#xD;
      teratology/genetics, epidemiology, type 2 diabetes in pregnancy and/or pediatrics.&#xD;
