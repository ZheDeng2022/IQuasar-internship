    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 escalating-dose study is designed to assess, the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the novel proteasome inhibitor CEP 18770, given&#xD;
      intravenously as single agent, in patients with advanced, incurable solid tumours or NHL, and&#xD;
      to identify the recommended dose of CEP 18770 to be used in Phase 2 studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalating study to determine the MTD and dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) of CEP 18770, a novel proteasome inhibitor. The study will also&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of CEP&#xD;
      18770, and assess the safety and tolerability of CEP-18770 treatment as well as any effect on&#xD;
      tumour response whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated intravenously with CEP 18770 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day&#xD;
      cycle period. Additional cycles may be administered, up to 6, as long as patients are&#xD;
      maintaining their performance status and appear to be receiving clinical benefit from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data will be collected for all patients in order to determine the toxicity and&#xD;
      reversibility of toxicity of CEP 18770. Formal assessments will be performed throughout the&#xD;
      study including at baseline, prior to each dose of study medication every week, and 30 days&#xD;
      following the last dose of study drug. Patients with drug-related toxicities will continue to&#xD;
      be reviewed until resolution or stabilization of the toxicity. Pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic parameters will also be assessed in each cohort of patients during cycle 1.&#xD;
      Where applicable, tumour measurements will be documented and any observed anti-tumour&#xD;
      activity will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow a conventional MTD design with patients recruited in cohorts of 3&#xD;
      patients, with criteria to expand to 6 patients. Enrolment for each cohort will begin when&#xD;
      the required number of patients in the prior cohort have completed one 21-day cycle of study&#xD;
      drug treatment at the current dose level without experiencing a DLT. Once the MTD has been&#xD;
      determined, additional 10 patients will be treated at the MTD to further explore the toxicity&#xD;
      of this dose, and its suitability for Phase II studies.&#xD;
