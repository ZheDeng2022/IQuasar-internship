  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) results in thickened secretions in multiple organ systems including the&#xD;
      lungs and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Patients commonly suffer from nutritional deficiency,&#xD;
      and achieving and maintaining adequate nutrition is an important goal of therapy because it&#xD;
      is positively correlated with lung function. Lubiprostone activates chloride channels in the&#xD;
      GI tract. Because its mechanism of action closely parallels the disease pathology,&#xD;
      lubiprostone has the potential to provide GI benefits beyond the relief of constipation. This&#xD;
      project is an observational study to examine the effects of lubiprostone on nutritional&#xD;
      status and lung function in adults with CF. Our hypothesis is that lubiprostone will have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on nutritional status.&#xD;

      Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 30,000 people in the United States. It&#xD;
      is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane&#xD;
      regulator (CFTR). This protein functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells of&#xD;
      multiple organ systems. The mutation results in a dysfunctional or absent CFTR channel and a&#xD;
      decrease in chloride secretion, which results in thickened secretions in multiple organ&#xD;
      systems including the lungs and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This patient population commonly&#xD;
      suffers from nutritional deficiency, and achieving and maintaining normal nutritional status&#xD;
      is an important goal of therapy as body mass index (BMI) is positively correlated with forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), a measure of pulmonary function. Lubiprostone activates&#xD;
      type 2 chloride channels (ClC-2) on the apical membrane of GI epithelial cells. Because its&#xD;
      mechanism of action closely parallels the disease pathology, lubiprostone has the potential&#xD;
      to provide GI benefits beyond the relief of constipation. Objectives: The proposed pilot&#xD;
      project is a prospective observational study to examine the effects of lubiprostone in adults&#xD;
      with CF. The specific aims are to determine the effects of lubiprostone on: 1) nutritional&#xD;
      markers and 2) pulmonary function in adults with CF. Methods: Adults with CF who are&#xD;
      currently taking lubiprostone chronically will be sought for enrollment. Study subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for approximately 3-months with serial assessment of indicators of nutrition and&#xD;
      pulmonary function. Nutritional markers to be measured include body weight, albumin,&#xD;
      prealbumin, and vitamins A, D, and E. Pulmonary function will be assessed by pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests, a survey to monitor for symptoms of pulmonary exacerbation, and monitoring of&#xD;
      the frequency of hospitalizations and IV antibiotic use. Expected Results: We expect to see a&#xD;
      beneficial effect on nutritional markers, body weight, and BMI. We hope this translates into&#xD;
      a concomitant improvement in pulmonary function.&#xD;
