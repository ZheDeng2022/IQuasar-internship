  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to determine whether adjunctive intranasal insulin will exert&#xD;
      an antidepressant effect when compared to placebo in adults with major depressive disorder&#xD;
      (MDD), insufficiently responsive conventional antidepressants. There are three secondary aims&#xD;
      of the study (1) to determine whether adjunctive intranasal insulin will alter emotional&#xD;
      processing (i.e., cognitive-affective interface); (2) to determine whether early changes in&#xD;
      emotional processing (i.e., after a single dose at 40IU intranasal insulin) predicts&#xD;
      symptomatic improvement at study endpoint; and (3) to determine the effect of intranasal&#xD;
      insulin on neurocognitive performance (e.g., learning and memory). This initiative represents&#xD;
      a proof-of-concept study that insulin is important to depressive symptoms, neurocognitive&#xD;
      functioning, and emotional processing deficits in MDD, representing a novel and safe&#xD;
      therapeutic avenue.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence for impairments at the cognitive-affective interface, frequently defined as&#xD;
      affective cognition, are increasingly being recognized as a core feature of mood disorders,&#xD;
      particularly MDD. Individuals with MDD consistently exhibit abnormalities in verbal memory&#xD;
      with particular difficulty in memory tasks such as list learning and free recall. The&#xD;
      administration of intranasal insulin has been reported to improve verbal memory, declarative&#xD;
      memory in individuals with Alzheimer's disease or Mild Cognitive Impairment as well as&#xD;
      measures of mood (e.g., overall feeling of well-being, self-esteem, and depression) in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. The effect of intranasal insulin on any measure of neurocognitive&#xD;
      function and emotional processing in MDD is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty participants between the ages of 18 and 60 with DSM-IV-TR defined MDD [confirmed by&#xD;
      the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)] will be enrolled. Individuals below&#xD;
      the age of 18 and over 60 are excluded as they are not seen at the recruiting center.&#xD;
      Enrollment into the study is voluntary. Eligible participants will provide written informed&#xD;
      consent. Participants will be enrolled from the outpatient Mood Disorders Psychopharmacology&#xD;
      Unit (MDPU), University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MDPU case report form will gather information on the participant's course of illness&#xD;
      variables. Conventional pharmacological treatments for MDD will be permitted (e.g.,&#xD;
      conventional antidepressants). Conventional unimodal antidepressants modulate cerebral&#xD;
      glucose metabolism; as such, they will be kept consistent throughout the duration of the&#xD;
      study and will not be altered from the point of randomization to study endpoint.&#xD;
      Antidepressants and augmentation strategies with significant anti-cholinergic potential&#xD;
      (e.g., paroxetine, tricyclic antidepressants) as well as benzodiazepines will be exclusionary&#xD;
      as they may negatively affect neurocognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be excluded if they are receiving corticosteroids or antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications; misused substance or alcohol in the past 3 months; received electroconvulsive&#xD;
      therapy in the last 1 year; or have a neurological or medically unstable condition. Another&#xD;
      exclusion criterion includes the inability to provide written informed consent. The&#xD;
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      17-Item (HAM-D-17) will be administered at baseline and weekly throughout the 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment assignment. Participants who are actively suicidal or evaluated as being a suicide&#xD;
      risk will also be excluded. Other reasons for discontinuation are impaired fasting glucose&#xD;
      (i.e., 6.1 - 6.9 mmol/L), and non-compliance (i.e., failure to administer â‰¥ 80% of the&#xD;
      assigned treatment in any week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing provision of care is not contingent on enrollment and/or completion of the study&#xD;
      protocol. Furthermore, there will be ongoing communication with the participant's primary&#xD;
      care provider in regards to their participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. The initial visit&#xD;
      entails the provision of detailed study information to the patient and obtainment of written&#xD;
      informed consent from the participant. The participant will then meet a research team member&#xD;
      at a later date for a screening visit. This study requires a total of 12 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full neuropsychological testing will be conducted at 4 time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline1 (Visit 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endpoint1 (Visit 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline2 (Visit 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Endpoint2 (Visit 12)&#xD;
