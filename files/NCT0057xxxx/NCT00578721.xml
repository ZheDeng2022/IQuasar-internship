    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand the effects of oral aspirin taken daily&#xD;
      with an arginine-restricted diet on certain colorectal cancer biomarkers in treated&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients. Patients with colorectal cancer are at high risk for recurrence&#xD;
      and for development of secondary colorectal cancers in the future. Specific chemicals&#xD;
      (polyamines, prostaglandins) in the body referred to as biomarkers can be measured to help&#xD;
      understand a person's risk for developing colorectal cancer. Specific biomarkers associated&#xD;
      with colorectal cancer have been identified in prior laboratory studies. By measuring these&#xD;
      predefined biomarkers before and after the study intervention, we can assess how they are&#xD;
      affected by the intervention, and gain knowledge about their usefulness in colorectal cancer&#xD;
      patients on clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase IIa clinical biomarker study, using oral aspirin 325 mg taken daily&#xD;
      with an arginine-restricted diet designed to reduce arginine intake by at least 30% during&#xD;
      the 12-week study period. The biomarkers will be obtained from patient by performing&#xD;
      endoscopy (a procedure used to look at the inside of the bowel, rectum and colon) and biopsy&#xD;
      (taking samples of tissue), phlebotomy (drawing blood), and urine collection. Biopsies are&#xD;
      done to evaluate changes in tissue content that may relate to early events in colon cancer&#xD;
      formation. This was the procedure used to diagnose your condition initially. There will be 24&#xD;
      patients enrolled into this study performed through University of California Irvine Medical&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be 18-80 years of age with a history of surgically removed colon or&#xD;
             rectal cancer, and have received treatment for their disease using drugs (adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have colon or rectal cancer with stage I, II, or III disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should not have further treatment with radiation therapy. Subjects having&#xD;
             already received adjuvant (i.e., post-operative) radiation therapy to the colon or&#xD;
             rectum will be excluded. However, subjects receiving radiation therapy prior to&#xD;
             surgery for rectal cancer are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's tumor must have been completely removed within the past 12 months, with&#xD;
             first surveillance colonoscopy anticipated 12 weeks after study treatment start date&#xD;
             (i.e. one-year after surgical removal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be in good physical status&#xD;
