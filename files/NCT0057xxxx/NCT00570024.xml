      This research is being done because sudden and unexpected cardiac death remains a significant&#xD;
      problem in patients with established coronary heart disease and accounts for 30% of deaths in&#xD;
      this group (150,000 deaths annually) despite recognition and treatment of their heart&#xD;
      disease. A large body of evidence implicates psychosocial stress as a risk factor and trigger&#xD;
      for reduced blood flow in the heart, heart attack and sudden cardiac death, yet the specific&#xD;
      mechanisms of this relationship remain under investigation. The nervous system, which plays a&#xD;
      role in regulation of the heart, can influence cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beats).&#xD;
      There are several studies that suggest that acupuncture improves anginal symptoms (like chest&#xD;
      pain or tightness) and blood pressure, while reducing stress and improving overall quality of&#xD;
      life. The reason that acupuncture seems to have a positive effect on these factors is thought&#xD;
      to be that it helps the arteries and the nervous system to work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to measure these effects in a systematic way. The functioning of the artery&#xD;
      can be measured by Peripheral Arterial Tonometry, (PAT) a simple monitoring device that&#xD;
      measures blood flow using finger probes and a blood pressure cuff. Changes in the nervous&#xD;
      system can be measured by using a 24-hour Holter monitor to record the heart rate. The&#xD;
      24-hour Holter monitor will also show if oxygen flow to the heart is decreased, as would&#xD;
      happen during stress, by recording a continuous electrocardiogram (ECG). Feelings about&#xD;
      stress can be established by questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare three groups of people with known coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. One group will receive traditional acupuncture, one group will receive alternative&#xD;
      acupuncture, and a third group will receive usual care only.&#xD;

      A. SPECIFIC AIMS Sudden and unexpected cardiac death remains a significant problem in&#xD;
      patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD), and accounts for 30% of deaths in&#xD;
      this group (~150,000 deaths annually) despite recognition and treatment of their disease.&#xD;
      These sudden deaths are due to myocardial infarction and ischemic or nonischemically mediated&#xD;
      arrythmias. Traditional risk factors do not completely account for the excess of CHD deaths.&#xD;
      Although treatment of cardiac risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia, has been shown to&#xD;
      significantly reduce cardiac events in populations with established coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (e.g. by 34% in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study1) a majority of patients continue&#xD;
      to have sudden and unexpected cardiac events including sudden cardiac death. Indeed, up to&#xD;
      50% of patients with established CHD will have recurrent events despite aggressive management&#xD;
      of traditional risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, tobacco use and hypertension. This&#xD;
      suggests that additional risk factors or mechanisms participate in the pathophysiological&#xD;
      cascade underlying acute CHD events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large body of evidence implicates psychosocial stress as a risk factor and trigger for&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia, infarction and sudden cardiac death, yet the specific mechanisms(s) of&#xD;
      this relationship remain under investigation.2-9 The mechanisms may include hemodynamic,&#xD;
      hemostatic and neuronally mediated effects on the cardiovascular system. Specifically they&#xD;
      may include a prominent role of the cardiac autonomic nervous system, including the&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS).10 Indeed, cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias have been implicated both as a risk factor and an etiology for sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death, suggesting that alteration of cardiac autonomic nervous system tone may provide an&#xD;
      opportunity for reducing acute cardiac events and sudden cardiac death. Prior work by&#xD;
      ourselves and others has also demonstrated that sympathetic activation from psychosocial&#xD;
      stress results in vascular constriction that, in the presence of impaired nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
      production and endothelial dysfunction, contributes to myocardial ischemia and adverse&#xD;
      cardiac events, including sudden death. 6,8,11-15 Traditional Acupuncture (TA) is a&#xD;
      Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) practice with documented effects of improving&#xD;
      physiologic imbalances and reducing psychosocial stress. For example, the TA technique has&#xD;
      been shown, to significantly reduce mental stress in humans16, hypertension in an animal&#xD;
      model17 and angina pectoris in CHD patients.18 These changes are consistent with the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the TA technique directly alters autonomic nervous system tone, likely by&#xD;
      reducing SNS activity, and possibly also by increasing PNS activity. We also hypothesize that&#xD;
      TA may beneficially alter CHD indirectly by reducing psychosocial stress. Either of these&#xD;
      hypotheses suggests that this CAM practice may serve as a complement or alternative to&#xD;
      medical treatment for the prevention of acute cardiac events and sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate the effect of TA on arterial vasomotor function and autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system tone, two physiologic variables involved in the pathophysiological cascade underlying&#xD;
      acute cardiac events and sudden death in CHD patients. To test for both the hypothesized&#xD;
      direct and indirect effects of this CAM modality, we propose to compare an active TA&#xD;
      intervention to two control groups: 1) an Alternative Acupuncture control group, and 2) a&#xD;
      waiting control group, in patients with CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess effects of the TA technique (compared to Alternative Acupuncture and waiting&#xD;
           control) on cardiac autonomic nervous system tone, as measured by heart rate variability&#xD;
           (HRV) using Holter monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess effects of the TA technique (compared to Alternative Acupuncture and waiting&#xD;
           control) on CHD variables including a marker of inflammation (high sensitivity C&#xD;
           reactive protein), symptoms (Seattle Angina Questionnaire), functional status (Duke&#xD;
           Activity Status Inventory), blood lipoproteins, and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess effects of the TA technique (compared to Alternative Acupuncture and waiting&#xD;
           control) on measures of perceived psychological stress, depression, hostility, anxiety,&#xD;
           social support, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploratory Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To estimate effect size of the TA technique (compared to Alternative Acupuncture and&#xD;
           waiting control) on arterial vasomotor dysfunction, as measured by mental&#xD;
           stress-brachial artery reactivity testing (BART) using high frequency ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will: a) provide an improved understanding of the hypothesized&#xD;
      beneficial physiological and psychological effects of this CAM practice, and b) serve as&#xD;
      potential pilot data for a multi-center TA proposal to evaluate the impact of TA on acute&#xD;
      cardiac events, including sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
