  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past two decades there have been great strides made in understanding the biological&#xD;
      changes resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI). The future holds promise of the development&#xD;
      of therapies that will promote degrees of repair and recovery of function for people living&#xD;
      with SCI. Lessons learned from past &quot;failed&quot; SCI clinical trials, however, demonstrate that,&#xD;
      in order to accurately evaluate the overall effectiveness of SCI therapies, more sensitive&#xD;
      outcomes measures are needed. Specifically, and reflecting the ultimate goal of clinical&#xD;
      interventions - inducing functional recovery - the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM),&#xD;
      has been recommended for further testing and development for use as a measure of functional&#xD;
      ability in future SCI clinical studies. The SCIM is a very simple questionnaire and score&#xD;
      sheet that an evaluator uses to determine how independently a person with SCI can perform&#xD;
      certain tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A panel of SCI researchers recommended the SCIM as the most suitable among four candidate&#xD;
      measures of functional recovery reviewed at a special meeting sponsored by the National&#xD;
      Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) at a joint meeting of the&#xD;
      American Spinal Injury Association and the International Spinal Cord Society (ASIA-ISCoS) in&#xD;
      Boston, MA, in June 2006. It was recommended that a large-scale, multi-center, prospective&#xD;
      trial be conducted in the United States, which would mirror a recently published multi-site&#xD;
      international study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research on the SCIM III, the latest and most sensitive version of the SCIM,&#xD;
      would test the hypothesis that the SCIM III is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure of&#xD;
      functional ability in persons with SCI. Twenty-two rehabilitation centers throughout the&#xD;
      United States will enroll a maximum of 660 subjects. Functional ability will be measured with&#xD;
      the SCIM III during the first week of admittance into inpatient acute rehabilitation and&#xD;
      within one week of discharge from the same rehabilitation program. Statistical analyses will&#xD;
      be used to test the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the SCIM III. The results will&#xD;
      demonstrate whether the SCIM III is a suitable outcome measure to assess SCI specific&#xD;
      functional ability in future clinical trials.&#xD;

      STUDY PURPOSE This clinical research study will be performed to assess the validity,&#xD;
      reliability, and sensitivity of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III) in measuring&#xD;
      functional ability in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall hypothesis - The SCIM III is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure of functional&#xD;
      ability in persons with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine the validity of the SCIM III as an outcome measure to assess functional&#xD;
      ability in persons with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Criterion-related validity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Construct validity of components&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the reliability of SCIM III evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inter-rater reliability&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Internal consistency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Examine the sensitivity of the SCIM III to functional change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sensitivity to functional change compared to the Functional Independence Measure (FIM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sensitivity to functional change over time&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a multi-center, prospective clinical research study performed to assess&#xD;
      the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III)&#xD;
      in measuring functional ability in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      UCI will act as the coordinating center for this study, collecting and performing statistical&#xD;
      data analysis. There will be approximately 22 rehabilitation centers participating in this&#xD;
      study. De-identified data will be transferred from these sites to Dr. Kim Anderson at UCI.&#xD;
