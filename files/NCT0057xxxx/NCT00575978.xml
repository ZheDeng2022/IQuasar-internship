      This study will be conducted as a phase I/II clinical trial. In addition to determining the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydralazine, the phase I trial will be performed to identify&#xD;
      unexpected toxicities that may occur when hydralazine is used in conjunction with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in normotensive women with breast cancer. Once the phase I trial is successfully&#xD;
      completed, the phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of hydralazine in producing a&#xD;
      demethylation effect will begin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the MTD for hydrazaline added to standard&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer. Four dose levels of hydrazalline are&#xD;
      planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level 1: 150 mg/d 50 mg PO TID Dose Level 2: 200 mg/d 50 mg PO QID Dose Level 3: 225&#xD;
      mg/d 75 mg PO TID&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated in cohorts of 3 and no patient may be treated at more that one dose&#xD;
      level. Additional cohorts may not be initiated until toxicity has been fully evaluated in the&#xD;
      current cohort of patients. The MTD is exceeded when a dose level produces a dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) in at least two of the three patients in a cohort. Dose escalation will&#xD;
      proceed by increasing the dose according to the following table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Events/Number in Cohort Action 0/3 Proceed to next dose level 1/3 Accrue 3 more&#xD;
      patients at the same dose 1/3 + 0/3 Proceed to next dose level 1/3 + 1/3 Stop: Previous dose&#xD;
      level is MTD 1/3 + 2/3 Stop: Previous dose level is MTD 1/3 + 3/3 Stop: Previous dose level&#xD;
      is MTD 2/3 Stop: Previous dose level is MTD 3/3 Stop: Previous dose level is MTD&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the MTD has been exceeded by dose escalation and only one cohort with no observed&#xD;
      toxicities was tested at the previous dose level, an additional cohort of 3 patients will be&#xD;
      tested at the previous dose level. Thus, six patients must be treated at the dose declared&#xD;
      the MTD. In the unlikely event that 150 mg/day of hydralazine, the starting dose, produces&#xD;
      two or more DLTs, the daily dose of hydralazine will be reduced by 50mg to100 mg/day. If two&#xD;
      or more toxicities are observed at this reduced dose level, the study will be stopped and the&#xD;
      phase II study will not be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I study will require between 9 to 24 patients. The cohort of six patients treated&#xD;
      at the MTD will be used in the subsequent phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the study drug is not a cytotoxic agent, is being &quot;added&quot; to a toxic chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen in women likely to be normotensive, and because the drug has been evaluated in the&#xD;
      cardiovascular literature with maximum clinical doses at 300 mg/d, we made the following&#xD;
      decisions that deviate from classic &quot;cytotoxic&quot; agent schemes. The deviations are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation beyond the &quot;CLINNICALLY MAXIMAL&quot; dose of 250 mg/d are not planned, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The definition of a DLT will not adhere to the NCI CTC - designed for cytotoxic agents,&#xD;
           but will rather be simply the tolerability of the drug by the patient as documented in&#xD;
           the protocol and reproduced below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Symptomatic hypotension,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Blood pressure recording of &lt; 90 mmHg systolic, or &lt;55 mgHg diastolic,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Other side effects deemed unacceptable either to the patient or the treating&#xD;
                physician, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Patient request/refusal to continue on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients having to go off the drug will be considered as DLT events.&#xD;

             anti-hypertensives. There is no age limit for this study. Inclusion criteria are as&#xD;
             follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Operable &quot;invasive&quot; breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Baseline blood pressure OFF antihypertensives &gt; 110/60 mmHg&#xD;
