  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke, traumatic head injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral anoxia are main causes of&#xD;
      a coma condition implying severe brain damage and thus, poor prognosis. Clinicians are often&#xD;
      in need for a tool able to predict the awakening of these patients. Multimodal MRI,&#xD;
      associating the traditional morphological sequences with spectroscopy-MRI (MRS) and the&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging, could provide such a prediction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Predicting the awakening of patients in comas is one of the principal stakes of the current&#xD;
      neurointensive care unit (neuroICU). Several studies and clinical practice suggest that the&#xD;
      multimodal MRI, which associates the traditional morphological sequences (T1, T2*, FLAIR/T2),&#xD;
      the spectroscopy-MRI (MRS) and the diffusion tensor imaging, is a tool allowing such a&#xD;
      prediction. However, this strategy has not been yet validated. Additionally, currently there&#xD;
      is no method of analysis including the 4 different sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The goal of this study is to develop a composite score able to predict the&#xD;
      awakening of coma patients following events such as a severe cranial trauma, ischemic or&#xD;
      hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident and cerebral anoxia. This composite score will be built&#xD;
      from the results of the multimodal MRI (quantified indicator) in combination with clinical&#xD;
      covariables (e.g., age of the patient, the mechanism of the accident (high versus low speed),&#xD;
      etc.). The final score will aim to predict the outcome of patients at 1 year, evaluated by&#xD;
      one of the following categories: favourable (Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS 3+, 4, and 5) or&#xD;
      unfavourable outcome (GOS 1, 2, and 3). GOS 3- score has been defined as minimally conscious&#xD;
      state and GOS 3+ score as severe disability excluding cognitive sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Analysis: The lesions present on the MRI will be quantified by a neuroradiologist and a&#xD;
      dedicated clinical engineer from the coordination centre (Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital) in a&#xD;
      blinded way regarding patients' clinical data. Lesion load-indicators will be calculated on&#xD;
      the sequences of FLAIR/T2, T2*, MRS and diffusion tensor imaging from a predefined analysis&#xD;
      grid allowing the regional study of the lesions as well as the appreciation of their nature,&#xD;
      their uni- or bilateral character and if bilateral, their symmetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and applicability: The multivariate analysis of morphological MRI, MRS and&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging data, combined with the clinical covariables, will aim to develop a&#xD;
      statistical algorithm, able to predict the clinical outcome of the patients. In the long&#xD;
      term, it will be integrated into an expert system which will be the subject of a patent&#xD;
      submission. The final objective is to provide the clinicians a diagnostic tool able to&#xD;
      determine outcome of patients with severe cranial trauma and other neurological conditions&#xD;
      such as stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral anoxia.&#xD;
