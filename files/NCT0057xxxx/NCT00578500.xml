    <textblock>
      Success rates of cancer treatment have increased significantly resulting in many girls and&#xD;
      young women who are treated now and will be cancer survivors. Nevertheless, cancer treatment&#xD;
      may result in long term side effects. Damage to the ovaries may result in serious difficulty&#xD;
      to become pregnant in the future. The risk of this happening depends, among others upon&#xD;
      patient's age, disease and type of treatment she undergoes. Medical research is continuously&#xD;
      looking into ways to preserve female fertility by using less toxic protocols. Yet, keeping&#xD;
      your eggs outside the body during treatment is an interesting option which as is routine for&#xD;
      boys preserving sperm before cancer treatment. This research attempts to freeze eggs either&#xD;
      in the ovarian tissue or individually.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in early detection and increasing success of chemotherapy have made cancer therapy a&#xD;
      curable disease. In children and adolescents with cancer, cure rates approach 75%. These cure&#xD;
      rates are achieved in great part due to the use of intensive chemotherapy, and in some cases,&#xD;
      radiation. The use of these treatment modalities is associated with significant toxicity,&#xD;
      including the potential for gonadal damage and subsequent reduced fertility. Aggressive&#xD;
      chemotherapy is, however, usually gonadotoxic and results in infertility in many pediatric&#xD;
      patients. Ovarian damage is drug and dose dependant and increases with patient age at&#xD;
      treatment. Increasing numbers of young cancer survivors are therefore experiencing&#xD;
      infertility related to their past cancer treatment. Having children thus becomes an important&#xD;
      issue for young cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryopreservation of sperm is an effective method that is offered to pre- and post-adolescent&#xD;
      males. Female gametes were however, not readily amenable to cryopreservation though the use&#xD;
      of vitrification recently resulted in improved results. Nevertheless, this method is not&#xD;
      applicable for young girls as it requires prolonged induction of ovulation and vaginal&#xD;
      sonography to complete aspiration of oocytes. Similarly, In vitro fertilization (IVF) may be&#xD;
      offered only to patients beyond adolescence. Ovulation induction requires a few weeks delay&#xD;
      in the initiation of cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since ovarian stimulation is generally not a feasible option for young girls and adolescents,&#xD;
      strategies for preserving fertility in these patients usually include ovarian&#xD;
      cryopreservation, an experimental technology with some success in animal studies, recently&#xD;
      resulting in few deliveries following human transplantations. Although the technique remains&#xD;
      investigational, it is being increasingly offered to women undergoing cancer treatment. In&#xD;
      prepubertal girls ovarian cryopreservation is the only option for potentially preserving&#xD;
      ovarian function. As we and others have shown, it is probable that methods of ovarian&#xD;
      transplantation with vascular anastomosis will be applied in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently recommended that following individual consultation by a multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      team, all female pediatric cancer patients and their families should be counseled regarding&#xD;
      side effects of chemotherapy and be offered ovarian preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology of ovarian cortex preservation, pioneered by Gosden is currently routine in&#xD;
      many centers in a few countries. Nevertheless, it is realized that the future use of this&#xD;
      cryopreserved ovarian cortex may be limited due to cellular injury during cryopreservation&#xD;
      and due to the tissue ischemic damage following transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, cryobanking of ovarian cortex preserves only the smallest (primordial and&#xD;
      primary) follicles, since all preovulatory antral follicles, which contain GV stage oocytes&#xD;
      will not survive the procedure. We thus currently propose to all patients undergoing ovarian&#xD;
      cryopreservation to perform integrated oocyte aspiration from antral follicles of the tissue,&#xD;
      followed by in vitro maturation (IVM) and oocyte cryopreservation as an additional&#xD;
      fertility-preserving method. The aim of this study was to analyze oocyte detection and IVM&#xD;
      success rates in young girls and adolescents using this combined method.&#xD;
