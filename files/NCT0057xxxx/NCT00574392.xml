  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to image skin and skin lesions with a new imaging technology&#xD;
      called &quot;multiwavelength and coherence confocal reflectance microscopy&quot;. This technology uses&#xD;
      low intensity laser to image below the surface of the skin. This technology may provide a new&#xD;
      way of looking at skin and skin lesions. The goal of this study is to evaluate the images of&#xD;
      your skin taken by this microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The techniques being evaluated in this study use multi wavelength and coherence confocal&#xD;
      reflectance microscopy invivo. The term &quot;in vivo&quot; means in/on a living subject. In this study&#xD;
      you will be the living subject and the multi wave length and coherence confocal microscope&#xD;
      will be placed on your skin to look at your skin lesions and your normal skin. The confocal&#xD;
      microscope uses a weak laser light and a sophisticated lens to image the individual cells&#xD;
      that make up the skin. Your lesion will be photographed with high resolution photography. An&#xD;
      area near your skin lesion that is clinically normal will also be imaged in the same manner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be imaged with the Vivascope 1500m multiwavelength coherence microscope during&#xD;
      a single patient visit. The lesion will be photographed with high resolution photography and&#xD;
      surface epiluminescence microscopy. The clinically uninvolved site will be imaged in the same&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lesion will then be prepped for RCM imaging. A skin contact device consisting of a metal&#xD;
      ring and template will be applied to the skin surrounding the lesion of interest with a&#xD;
      disposable medicalgrade adhesive plastic disc. A wetting solution will be placed into the&#xD;
      metal ring. The wetting solutions include water, mineral oil and other over the counter&#xD;
      products (e.g. hairstyling gel and moisturizing agents). Application of these agents&#xD;
      diminishes artifacts caused by light scattering at the skin surface. RCM images of the lesion&#xD;
      will be captured through the contact device using the Vivascope 1500m surface confocal&#xD;
      microscope provided by Lucid Technologies, Inc. Two types of images will be collected,&#xD;
      VivaBlocks and VivaStacks. VivaBlocks are a 4x4 mosaic of confocal images that measure 2mm x&#xD;
      2mm in total area. These VivaBlock images are optically combined or &quot;stitched&quot; together by&#xD;
      the VivaScope 1500m to create a seamless representation of 4 mm 2 area at a specific depth&#xD;
      within the skin. VivaStacks are eight 0.5mm x 0.5mm confocal images taken at 3 micron&#xD;
      intervals from the keratin layer to the superficial dermis. VivaStacks and VivaBlocks will be&#xD;
      acquired for both the skin lesion and for the clinically uninvolved area of the skin. The&#xD;
      total estimated imaging time for a patient in this study is about 30 minutes for the lesion&#xD;
      and the clinically uninvolved site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confocal imaging session and the dermatologic visit for the punch biopsy do not have to&#xD;
      occur during the same patient visit. All lesion images will be saved on a network server for&#xD;
      later review and analysis. All imaging will be completed by trained research staff familiar&#xD;
      with confocal imaging.&#xD;
