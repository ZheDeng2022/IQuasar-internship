    <textblock>
      This is a study on how to activate the immune system with a vaccine. The vaccine is made up&#xD;
      of two proteins found in breast cancer: telomerase and survivin. The vaccine is given in&#xD;
      combination with other drugs that may also have an effect on the immune system and attack the&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to test the safety of the combination of agents&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to find out what effects the treatment has on advanced breast cancer&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced breast cancer may often fail standard of care treatments for&#xD;
      metastatic disease. This research is studying a combinations of agents that impact the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About &gt;85% of all human cancers, including breast cancer, express telomerase (hTERT)&#xD;
      activity. Targeting hTERT immunologically may also minimize immune escape due to antigen loss&#xD;
      because mutation or deletion of hTERT may be incompatible with sustained tumor growth. hTERT&#xD;
      Multi-Peptide Vaccine is made up of 1540 hTERT peptide and cryptic peptides selected for&#xD;
      &quot;low-affinity&quot; binding to HLA-A2 in order to increase the likelihood that the host immune&#xD;
      system would ignore them, and then they have been modified by changing the first amino acid&#xD;
      of the peptides to tyrosine in order to increase HLA - A2 affinity. The two &quot;heteroclitic&quot;&#xD;
      peptides are R572Y (YLFFYRKSV) and D988Y (YLQVNSLQTV), which bind HLA-A2 with high avidity&#xD;
      and elicit specific CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) responses using healthy donor mononuclear&#xD;
      cells in vitro. In addition, in mouse models, these peptide vaccines elicit lytic CTL&#xD;
      responses which are protective against tumor challenges using a TERT-expressing murine tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be immunized with a peptide vaccine derived from survivin, an important&#xD;
      anti-apoptotic protein which is overexpressed in a broad range of malignancies including&#xD;
      breast cancer. Survivin may be an ideal and &quot;universal&quot; tumor antigen since it is&#xD;
      overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers yet terminally differentiated adult cells do not&#xD;
      express the protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV derived CTL epitopes will be used as positive control peptides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daclizumab is a humanized anti-human CD25 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to CD25&#xD;
      expressing cells, including Treg cells, and inhibits its proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevnar is designed to augment T-helper cell immunity.&#xD;
