  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to help us learn more about the roles of genes in cancers that run&#xD;
      in families. Sometimes, we are born with genes that are changed or altered. Gene changes are&#xD;
      called mutations. Mutations may be passed down from parent to child. Some mutations cause a&#xD;
      high risk for cancer. There are two major genes for breast and ovarian cancer. These genes&#xD;
      are called BRCA --for breast cancer. If you have a mutation in these genes special actions&#xD;
      may be needed. For a person with a known mutation, we will suggest ways to screen for cancer&#xD;
      or prevent it. Not everything is known about cancer genes and mutations. The cancer screening&#xD;
      we suggest may not always be effective. The aim of this study is to explore these questions.&#xD;
      If you agree we will stay in touch with you to follow your medical history. We will also ask&#xD;
      you about your family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow us to measure the cancer risks of known mutations. The study will also look&#xD;
      for other cancer genes we do not know about. Whether or not you take part in this study, you&#xD;
      may have gene testing. If you take part in this study and wish to know, we will tell your&#xD;
      BRCA gene test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in 2019, a subset of participants will be given a follow-up questionnaire regarding&#xD;
      their health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators may perform genetic testing on the blood or saliva sample in one of two&#xD;
      ways: analysis for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes alone or as part of a panel of&#xD;
      genes associated with breast cancer predisposition. New technologies are being employed for&#xD;
      identification of patients with a susceptibility for developing breast cancer and thus&#xD;
      analysis of multiple genes at one time may be offered to you. If this multi-gene testing&#xD;
      applies to the patient, a question and answer sheet about this testing will be provided to&#xD;
      them by their genetic counselor.&#xD;
