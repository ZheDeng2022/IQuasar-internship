      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the relationships among findings in&#xD;
      structural and functional neuroimaging, cognitive testing and HPA&#xD;
      (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis dysregulation in psychotic depression.&#xD;

      Eligibility Procedures: Before entering the study and prior to any other procedures, you will&#xD;
      be asked to read and sign this consent form. To determine if you are eligible for our study,&#xD;
      you will then have a general medical (including menstrual cycle history on female patients)&#xD;
      and psychiatric history taken, a physical examination your vital signs (blood pressure,&#xD;
      pulse), height, weight, waist/hip ratio will be measured, and various psychiatric evaluations&#xD;
      will be conducted. We will be video recording the psychiatric diagnostic assessment of every&#xD;
      5th patient who enrolls in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, your mood will be evaluated using a series of commonly used diagnostic instruments&#xD;
      and rating scales. We will repeat the medical exam, blood and urine lab tests you had at your&#xD;
      initial screening visit if it has been more than 4 weeks (30 days) since your eligibility&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rest of the study includes an MRI, neuropsychological testing, questionnaires, and blood&#xD;
      draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI (called magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) involves having a picture of your brain&#xD;
      taken using a magnet while a series of tasks is administered to you. The MRI scan procedures&#xD;
      will take approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuropsychological testing consists of a series of tests to assess your memory and&#xD;
      concentration (neuropsychological means the way your brain processes and completes specific&#xD;
      tasks.) This testing, including directions, will take approximately 3 hours of your time. You&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete several questionnaires during your hospital stay. These&#xD;
      questionnaires ask for your views about your personality, your childhood experiences your&#xD;
      quality of life, your mood and a variety of aspects of your daily functioning. The&#xD;
      questionnaires may be completed anytime during your stay and will take about 2.5 hours to&#xD;
      finish&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood draws are done at the GCRC, where you will stay for 2 nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following blood draw procedures will be performed for all participants on Day 1: At 4pm&#xD;
      on Day 1, an intravenous line (IV; needle inserted into a vein) will be placed in your arm to&#xD;
      draw hourly blood samples used for the measure of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol.&#xD;
      ACTH is a hormone that controls the release of cortisol (a stress hormone) in your system and&#xD;
      both of these hormones levels change under stressful conditions. The blood samples are taken&#xD;
      in small amounts (approximately 1/2 teaspoon) and will be collected at 2pm and 4pm on&#xD;
      Baseline Day 1, and then on the hour, every hour, starting at 6pm and ending at 9am the next&#xD;
      day. A total of 72 ml(approximately 5 tablespoons) of blood will be drawn. The IV line will&#xD;
      be removed following the last blood draw. If you presently live in a time zone different from&#xD;
      the Pacific Standard Time zone (for example, Eastern Standard Time zone), we may begin taking&#xD;
      hourly blood samples as early as 3pm on Baseline Day 1 in order to more accurately measure&#xD;
      your body's daily rhythm of hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following blood draw procedures will be performed for all participants on Day 2: At 2pm&#xD;
      on Baseline Day 2, you will have another IV line placed in your arm to draw hourly blood&#xD;
      samples used for the measure of ACTH and Cortisol. At 3pm, you will be given 0.5mg (five&#xD;
      0.1mg tablets) of Fludrocortisone. Cortisol and ACTH are taken in small amounts&#xD;
      (approximately 1/2 teaspoon) and will be collected on the hour, every hour, starting at 2 pm&#xD;
      and ending at 7pm, then every 30 minutes until 12 midnight. Melatonin will be collected at&#xD;
      6:00pm, 7:00pm and then every 30 minutes until 12 midnight. Following the last blood draw, a&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken for a clinical laboratory assessment to ensure your safety&#xD;
      following Fludrocortisone administration. A total of 66ml's (4 1/2 tablespoons) of blood will&#xD;
      be drawn. At 12 midnight, the IV line will then be removed and your vital signs will be&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
