      The purpose of this study is to check the Effects of JNJ-26489112 on the Photic Induced&#xD;
      Paroxysmal electroencephalogram (EEG) Response in Patients with Photosensitive Epilepsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-randomized (participants are assigned deliberately), single-blind&#xD;
      (patients do not know which treatment they are receiving), within patient placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study. Up to 32 male or female patients will participate in this study. The duration of&#xD;
      subject participation is approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the oral doses of study drug in the mornings of Days 1, 2, and 3. All&#xD;
      patients will receive a single dose of placebo on Day 1, a single dose of JNJ-26489112 on Day&#xD;
      2, and a second single dose of placebo on Day 3. Blood samples will be taken for evaluation&#xD;
      of JNJ-26489112 drug concentrations in plasma and blood. Blood samples will also be collected&#xD;
      for laboratory safety assessments and measurement of antiepileptic drug concentrations.&#xD;
      Further safety will be assessed by the reporting of adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
      physical and neurological examinations. Patients will be discharged on the evening of Day 3&#xD;
      after the pharmacokinetic samples have been collected, and after assessment by the&#xD;
      investigator, unless there are any ongoing adverse events which require in-house monitoring.&#xD;
      EEG tracings, recorded during intermittent photic stimulation sessions, will be digitally&#xD;
      recorded on a CD-ROM, coded and evaluated independently by one blinded clinical expert to&#xD;
      determine the effects on the photosensitivity range. If complete suppression of&#xD;
      photosensitivity or reduction of the photosensitivity range by at least 3 points on the&#xD;
      photosensitivity scale in at least one eye condition (during closure, closed, open) is not&#xD;
      observed in at least 3 of the 4 patients and a maximum tolerated dose has been reached, the&#xD;
      study will be stopped. If reduction of the photosensitivity range by at least 3 points on the&#xD;
      photosensitivity scale in at least one eye condition (during closure, closed, open) is&#xD;
      observed in at least 3 of the 4 patients (with complete suppression in at least 2 patients)&#xD;
      in the first cohort, the dose level of JNJ-26489112 may be reduced in subsequent cohorts&#xD;
      until the reduction or suppression of photosensitivity is seen in fewer than 2 out of 4&#xD;
      patients in one cohort. Once an effective dose has been reached an additional open-label&#xD;
      cohort may be enrolled in which no study drug (JNJ-26489112 or placebo) will be administered&#xD;
      to patients. Study drug (i.e., JNJ-26489112 or placebo) will be administered orally as single&#xD;
      doses on Days 1 to 3. Placebo will be administered on Days 1 and 3, and a single dose of&#xD;
      JNJ-26489112 will be administered on Day 2.&#xD;
