  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      *The purpose of this study is to develop a more accurate, reliable, specific and more&#xD;
      acceptable alternative clinical test to the 72-hour stool and diet collection for quantifying&#xD;
      fat malabsorption in people with CF and pancreatic insufficiency.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Nine subjects with CF will be recruited to complete the MBT on two separate occasions,&#xD;
           with different doses of pancreatic enzymes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each MBT visit, subjects will receive a specific enzyme dose just before they drink&#xD;
           the test meal (shake)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fat absorption is maximized when the enzymes are taken with the shake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If subjects usually receive brands of pancreatic enzymes different from Creon, their&#xD;
           dose will be converted to an equivalent dose of Creon 20 for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each study visit all subjects will be required to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eat their usual diet for 2 days prior to MBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refrain from consuming alcohol or dairy products for 24 hours prior to MBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refrain from non-routine physical exercise for 20 hours prior to MBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adhere to a 12-hour fast prior to MBT (from 8 PM previous night)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can drink water from 8:00 PM on the night before the test to 2:00 AM on the day of the&#xD;
           test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visits 1 and 2, blood samples will be obtained at hourly intervals over a period of&#xD;
           eight hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples will be analyzed for PA, HA and Triglyceride concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be permitted to ingest non-caloric and non-caffeinated beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At hour 6, patients will be provided 1000 Kcal, low fat (12 grams of fat) lunch meal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency (n=9), 8 years of age or&#xD;
             older, in usual state of good health will be eligible to participate in this Aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be screened for genotype and a history of pancreatic insufficiency (PI).&#xD;
             PI will be confirmed by measurement of fecal elastase 1&lt; 200 mg/g stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be ineligible if they have an FEV1 % predicted of &lt; 40%, a history of&#xD;
             fibrosing colonopathy or any significant bowel resection (&gt;10 cm) with the exception&#xD;
             of a routine, uncomplicated appendectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with diabetes mellitus or disorders associated with altered energy metabolism&#xD;
             (i.e. hypothyroidism), or any major illnesses that affect the gastrointestinal tract,&#xD;
             will not be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with significant liver disease, or significant developmental delay will also&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be excluded if they have a food allergy related to any components of the&#xD;
             experimental shake (i.e., soy or chocolate) or the stool marker, carmine red.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant are not eligible. Subjects with a history of intolerance or&#xD;
             allergy to Creon 20 will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
