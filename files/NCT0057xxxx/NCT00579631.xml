  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the health behaviors of young adults who have been&#xD;
      treated for cancer, leukemia, or similar illnesses. We will also ask you some questions about&#xD;
      your family members' and friends' health behaviors. We plan to use the findings from this&#xD;
      study to design new programs to help teenage cancer survivors resist doing things that might&#xD;
      harm their health.&#xD;

      This study proposes to explore cancer-risk behaviors and future behavioral intentions among&#xD;
      adolescent cancer survivors (i.e., 14-19 years old) and compare them to their &quot;healthy&quot; peers&#xD;
      using population-based normative data. Additionally, it seeks to determine the significant&#xD;
      theory-driven covariates related to adolescent survivors' health behaviors, which will aid in&#xD;
      the design of future behavioral interventions.&#xD;
