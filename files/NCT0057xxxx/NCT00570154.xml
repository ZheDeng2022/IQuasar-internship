      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are pre-diabetic or have adult onset (type 2) diabetes have a significantly&#xD;
      greater risk of developing heart, blood vessel, or kidney diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that abnormalities in white blood cell function may increase the&#xD;
      chances of developing insulin resistance, the underlying problem in diabetic or pre-diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine levels of insulin sensitivity in selected volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the white blood cells of non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, and type 2 (adult onset)&#xD;
      diabetic volunteers to evaluate possible differences in white blood cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals between 21 and 60 years of age who (1) are non-diabetic, (2) are pre-diabetic&#xD;
      (glucose intolerant or insulin resistant), or (3) have type 2 diabetes that is controlled by&#xD;
      diet and/or medications other than insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations before treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests, including screening procedures for blood-transmitted diseases such as&#xD;
           hepatitis B and C, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance tests, and liver and kidney&#xD;
           function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy tests for women of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two tests will be performed during the study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose tolerance test to determine how well the body uses glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood drawn to study white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be financially compensated for the time spent during the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type II diabetes mellitus is rapidly becoming a global pandemic with a deleterious impact on&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Understanding its pathophysiology is important for&#xD;
      the development of future therapeutic interventions. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction&#xD;
      in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue are early events in the development of type II diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and are proposed to play a role in exacerbating insulin resistance. The genetic&#xD;
      disruption of macrophage mitochondrial biology in preclinical studies results in the&#xD;
      development of insulin resistance and concurrent mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral&#xD;
      tissue including skeletal muscle and the liver. Whether this disruption of mitochondrial&#xD;
      function is evident in human mononuclear cells is unknown. We propose that the disruption of&#xD;
      mitochondrial function in circulating cells may contribute to not only peripheral insulin&#xD;
      resistance but may also evoke the myriad of vascular complications associated with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these assumptions, we propose an initial proof of concept study to evaluate&#xD;
      mitochondrial biology in circulating monocytes in normal volunteers, pre-diabetic and&#xD;
      diabetic subjects to assess whether mitochondrial disruption/dysfunction evolves with the&#xD;
      progression to type II diabetes. In parallel, gene expression and proteomic analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate whether the development of insulin resistance and diabetes confers a&#xD;
      specific modulation in the biological signature of monocytes with disease progression. To&#xD;
      delineate these concepts we will evaluate study subjects' glucose tolerance and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and draw blood to examine peripheral monocytes. Biological readouts will include:&#xD;
      1) the quantification of the mitochondrial genomic and electron transfer chain content; 2)&#xD;
      the determination of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species capacity and defenses; 3) the&#xD;
      pattern of monocyte differentiation and 4) the unbiased assessment of monocyte gene&#xD;
      expression and proteome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the mitochondrial hypothesis is operational, this study will show that the mitochondrial&#xD;
      disruption/dysfunction is a more generalized finding in type II diabetes. This would&#xD;
      establish targeting the modification of mitochondrial function in various tissue/cell types&#xD;
      as a novel strategy in the prevention and/or reversal of insulin resistance and diabetes.&#xD;
