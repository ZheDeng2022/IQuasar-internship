      Low-dose Oral Imatinib in the Treatment of Scleroderma Pulmonary Involvement: a Phase II&#xD;
      pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare, multisystem connective tissue disease&#xD;
      characterised by widespread microvascular lesions and by the increased deposition of matrix&#xD;
      components in the skin and internal organs, with varying degrees of severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of scleroderma appears to have increased from 0.6 new cases annually per&#xD;
      million in 1947 to 19 new cases annually in 1991 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The median survival have been calculated to be approximately 60% at 5 years and 50% at 10&#xD;
      years. The U.S. collaborative study reported a 12 years survival of 30% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, patients with scleroderma have double standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of&#xD;
      developing cancer compared to the general population .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden for the National Health System is relevant, with a cost of Euro 2.900 for a&#xD;
      five-days hospitalization per patient and an annual indirect cost of Euro 2.066 per patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, despite advances in the therapy of single clinical manifestation of&#xD;
      scleroderma, no proven disease-modifying interventions exist for patients at this time.&#xD;
      Therapy is symptomatic consisting on vasodilators, steroids, anti-secretive agents is not&#xD;
      very effective and immunosuppressive therapy consisting mainly in high-dose cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      is associated with serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our purpose is to treat scleroderma skin and pulmonary fibrosis using a therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      based on pathogenetic mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of the disease is unknown, but abnormal oxidative stress has been implicated in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of scleroderma and linked to fibroblast activation. Platelet-derived growth&#xD;
      factor (PDGF) seems to be a stimulator of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#xD;
      which are key cell transducers of fibroblast proliferation and collagen gene expression . In&#xD;
      more details, it has been observed that ROS generation is strictly related to Ha-Ras, and&#xD;
      growth-factor activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Ha-Ras, ERK1/2), with the&#xD;
      Ha-Ras- ERK1/2-ROS circuitry amplified in scleroderma fibroblasts . In fact, over-expression&#xD;
      of Ha-Ras or ERK 1/2 or high ROS levels induce collagen gene transcription and senescence in&#xD;
      normal fibroblasts 6. Since platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can induce ROS and&#xD;
      Ras-ERK1/2 signaling and since IgG derived from scleroderma patients (SSc IgG) react with&#xD;
      human fibroblasts , Svegliati and co-workers sought Ha-Ras-ERK1/2 and ROS stimulatory&#xD;
      molecules in the serum of scleroderma patients and provided evidence that serum of&#xD;
      scleroderma patients contains stimulatory IgG autoantibodies directed to the PDGF receptor&#xD;
      (PDGFR) 5. These autoantibodies trigger the PDGFR, which induces ROS via Ha-Ras and ERK 1/2&#xD;
      signaling and is ultimately responsible for fibroblast activation, a distinctive feature of&#xD;
      scleroderma 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary involvement is present in a considerable part of the patients and is characterized&#xD;
      by typical interstitial lung disease. Most of the patients present bilateral basal alveolitis&#xD;
      evolving to diffuse fibrosis and restrictive respiratory failure. Lung fibrosis or pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension is the main cause of death in systemic sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imatinib mesylate (STI571 or Gleevec) is a specific inhibitor of the fusion protein Bcr-Abl,&#xD;
      the causal agent in chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Other targets ATP-binding site of tyrosine&#xD;
      kinases are for PDGF, PDGF-receptor, c-Kit, and SCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daniels and coll. investigated the role of TGF-beta-induced fibrosis mediated by activation&#xD;
      of the Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinase, and using a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis, found a significant inhibition of lung fibrosis by imatinib .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since imatinib mesylate exerts selective, dual inhibition of the transforming growth factor&#xD;
      beta (TGFbeta) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathways a recent study was&#xD;
      undertaken to test the potential use of imatinib mesylate as an antifibrotic drug also for&#xD;
      the treatment of dermal fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc). The authors found that imatinib&#xD;
      at biologically relevant concentrations has potent antifibrotic effects in vitro and in vivo,&#xD;
      without toxic side effects. They conclude that its favorable pharmacokinetics and clinical&#xD;
      experience with its use in other diseases, imatinib mesylate is a promising candidate for the&#xD;
      treatment of fibrotic diseases such as SSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent smooth muscle cell mitogen that&#xD;
      may contribute to smooth muscle hyperplasia during the development of chronic pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and selective PDGF inhibition may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic PH. Pulmonary arterial hypertension, a disorder limited to the pulmonary&#xD;
      circulation, is characterized by pulmonary vascular obstruction and variable pulmonary&#xD;
      vasoconstriction leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and death. Pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension is a frequent complication of lung fibrosis in systemic sclerosis, but can also&#xD;
      occur without overt fibrotic pulmonary involvement in particular in the limited form of&#xD;
      scleroderma. The PDGF receptor antagonist STI571 (imatinib) reversed advanced pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular disease in 2 animal models of pulmonary hypertension regardless of the initiating&#xD;
      stimulus and it has been used successfully in single patients resistant to conventional&#xD;
      therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, is approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia 7 and progressed&#xD;
      malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors; since altered PDGF signaling play an important&#xD;
      role in the skin and pulmonary fibrosis, Imatinib can have therapeutic potential in the&#xD;
      treatment of disorders accompanied by overexpression of this growth factor. Since fibrotic&#xD;
      complication are disfiguring and responsible for great suffering and mortality, we expect&#xD;
      that this drug can confer substantial benefit in patient with scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this study is to verify effect and tolerability of a new therapy on&#xD;
      pulmonary and skin fibrosis in patients affected by systemic sclerosis. This therapy is based&#xD;
      upon recent data regarding the pathogenesis of scleroderma and is intended to interfere with&#xD;
      PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity which plays a central role in type I collagen gene&#xD;
      expression. The proposed action has the following other objectives: 1. strengthening of a&#xD;
      national network composed of centres trained in the use of experimental drugs for this&#xD;
      disease, with a special focus on the development of uniform criteria for outcome evaluation,&#xD;
      enforcement of communication channels, creation of strategic synergies for the future,&#xD;
      through ideas, projects and data exchange; 2. training of young investigators; 3. sharing of&#xD;
      advanced experimental techniques and 'rare' biological samples to improve knowledge about&#xD;
      pathogenesis of scleroderma, avoiding as well costly overlap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of the Imatinib treatment the study will follow a 'Simon's optimal&#xD;
      two-stage design'. This is a typical Phase II design, whose aim is to limit the number of&#xD;
      subjects who will undergo an ineffective therapy. This design consists in two subsequent&#xD;
      enrolment phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients (variable: n1) are entered into the study in the first stage of the trial. Their&#xD;
      outcome will be evaluated after six months of experimental therapy. If there will be fewer&#xD;
      than 10% of good responses (variable: P0), then accrual will terminate and the drug will be&#xD;
      rejected as being of little interest. Otherwise, accrual will continue to a total of 30&#xD;
      patients (variable: n). All patients will undergo the same experimental treatment and outcome&#xD;
      evaluation. At the end of the study the drug will be rejected if the observed response rate&#xD;
      will be less than 30% (variable: P1) of evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables n1, n, P0, P1 have been calculated to provide a design with a probability of 0.05&#xD;
      or less of accepting a drug worse than P0 after the first stage and a probability of 0.2 or&#xD;
      less of rejecting a drug better than P1 at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison with historical controls (SSc with lung disease who underwent immunosuppressive&#xD;
      treatment) will be also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-five historical controls are needed to have a probability 80% or higher to reveal a&#xD;
      true difference &gt; 20% (favour experimental drug), hypothesizing a good response rate 0.1 or&#xD;
      less in the control population (one-sided, alpha=0,05)3.&#xD;
