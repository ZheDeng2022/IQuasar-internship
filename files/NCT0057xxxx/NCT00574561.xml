      The investigators wish to study the magnetic field map using magnetocardiography (MCG) in&#xD;
      subjects undergoing computed tomographic angiography (visualization of the heart arteries&#xD;
      using CT scanning, CTA). The main purposes is to investigate if MCG is capable of detecting&#xD;
      the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) as detected by CT angiography (CTA)&#xD;
      as well if the MCG can exclude the presence of CAD as defined by CTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily the investigators will look at the correlation of MCG with non-obstructive CAD&#xD;
      and the correlation of MCG with other tests (treadmill testing, stress echo or nuclear scan,&#xD;
      coronary angiography) done as part of the work up for CAD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiomagnetism refers to the detection, analysis and interpretation of the magnetic fields&#xD;
      generated by the electrical activity of the heart. The peak value of the magnetic fields of&#xD;
      the heart is more than a million times smaller than the Earth's magnetic field. A major&#xD;
      breakthrough in the capability of measuring such small fields came with the invention of the&#xD;
      SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) in the late sixties. The first&#xD;
      magnetocardiograms (MCGs) measured with the SQUID were recorded by Cohen et al. in 1970.&#xD;
      These earlier measurements were performed in very expensive magnetically shielded rooms,&#xD;
      initially utilizing only one or two SQUID probes. In the eighties this technology was tested&#xD;
      in several laboratories creating a magnetic field map by moving one SQUID sequentially above&#xD;
      the chest to create an image of the whole hearts magnetic field. These maps were then&#xD;
      attempted correlated with various pathologies (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then the technology has been greatly improved and several multi-channel machines are in&#xD;
      use across the world for research purpose for arrhythmia localization and ischemia detection.&#xD;
      However, at present time, only one company (CardioMag Imaging, Schenectady, New York) has&#xD;
      developed a machine that operates outside a shielded room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CardiomagImaging (CMI) Magnetocardiograph (MCG) is capable of noninvasive recording of&#xD;
      magnetic fields arising from the electrical activity of the heart with very high spatial and&#xD;
      temporal resolution. The temporal trace of the MCG is analogous to an ECG, and, similarly,&#xD;
      can be recorded in multiple leads. This MCG device has been specifically developed for the&#xD;
      general purpose (outside shielded room) of non-contact, non-invasive diagnostics of ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CMI MCG device has been approved by the FDA as a safe tool to measure and record the&#xD;
      magnetic field arising from the heart's electrical currents. It is awaiting FDA approval for&#xD;
      the specific diagnosis of ischemia in chest pain patients (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have been using the CMI 9-channel MCG for detection of ischemia in patients admitted to&#xD;
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for acute chest pain syndrome. The results are very exciting and&#xD;
      have been published in abstracts and one manuscript, with another manuscript in submission&#xD;
      (4,5). In summary, we studied 75 patients with acute chest pain and 65 healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      found a very strong association with an abnormal MCG scan and ischemia (p&lt;0.0001). The&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV was 87.1%, 85.7%, 64.3%, and 95.7%, respectively. In&#xD;
      comparison, the diagnostic value of the stress SPECT imaging was 91.3%, 75.0%, 75.0%, and&#xD;
      91.3%, for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, respectively.&#xD;
      These results were achieved without the use of stress provocation, contrast administration,&#xD;
      or any ionizing radiation, and the results were available immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since starting the chest pain protocol another diagnostic imaging technology has become more&#xD;
      widespread used, 64-slice CT angiography. This technology utilizes a fast CT scanner and&#xD;
      involves administration of a contrast agent, but avoids the invasiveness of a heart&#xD;
      catheterization. The accuracy of detection of CAD and its exclusion is very high as compared&#xD;
      with angiography (6). Although minimally invasive, the CT angiogram does involve a radiation&#xD;
      dose similar to that used with stress nuclear testing, approximately 900 to 1100 mrem (6) and&#xD;
      the iodine contrast used may cause contrast nephropathy, especially in diabetics and those&#xD;
      with already impaired renal function. The use of this technology provides an opportunity to&#xD;
      find subjects with normal coronary arteries with accuracy close to as high as for invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography. To date, this population has been hard to study, since subjects with a&#xD;
      normal stress test rarely will undergo more invasive studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we wish to conduct this correlative study with CT angiography and the entirely&#xD;
      noninvasive and risk free MCG to see if we in the future may be able to avoid some of the&#xD;
      risks associated with CTA. We think that we may find that subjects with a clearly abnormal&#xD;
      MCG may not need CTA, but could proceed directly to angiography and possible angioplasty.&#xD;
