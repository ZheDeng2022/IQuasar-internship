      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of ocular physical properties on&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements in eyes with healthy corneas using the following&#xD;
      instruments to measure IOP: Goldmann applanation tonometer, pneumotonometer, ocular blood&#xD;
      flow pneumotonometer, Tono-Pen, Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer and the Schiotz Tonometer.&#xD;
      Ocular physical properties to be evaluated are:varying (CCT), corneal curvature (CC), axial&#xD;
      length, anterior chamber depth and scleral rigidity. The secondary purpose of this is to&#xD;
      determine if there is a correlation between CCT and other ocular properties, and which&#xD;
      instruments that measure these other ocular properties are most affected by CCT.&#xD;

      Accurate estimation of intraocular pressure is an essential aspect in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      management of glaucomatous eye disease. Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and a&#xD;
      leading cause of blindness in the United States. In glaucoma, vision is lost through&#xD;
      apoptosis (programmed cell death) of retinal ganglion cells, a type of cell in the retina&#xD;
      that transmits visual information to the brain. Diagnosis of glaucoma is usually based on a&#xD;
      combination of progressive, characteristic vision loss (measured using visual field testing)&#xD;
      and progressive optic nerve head damage (as detected through dilated fundus examinations or&#xD;
      disc photography). While a high pressure inside the eye (ocular hypertension, OHT) is not&#xD;
      sufficient for a diagnosis of glaucoma, it is the greatest single risk factor for disease&#xD;
      onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades, the gold standard for intraocular pressure measurement has been the Goldmann&#xD;
      applanation tonometer. The Goldmann tonometer is calibrated based on a central corneal&#xD;
      thickness of 500 micrometers. But, it is known that CCT varies between individuals and even&#xD;
      between individual eyes. The various central corneal thicknesses (CCT)s are thought to&#xD;
      influence the accuracy of IOP measurements and thus the diagnosis, screening, and treatment&#xD;
      of patients with glaucoma. A study performed by Copt (1999) showed that ocular hypertensive&#xD;
      patients have relatively thick corneas and normal tension glaucoma patients have relatively&#xD;
      thin corneas. Thus it is thought that a thicker cornea creates falsely high IOP readings and&#xD;
      a thinner cornea creates falsely low IOP readings. This was followed by a study performed by&#xD;
      Lleo et al (2003) which showed that applanation tonometry and CCT positively correlated in&#xD;
      normal eyes. More recently the following studies have also found a positive correlation&#xD;
      between CCT and tonometry: Lui et al (2005), Tonnu et all (2005), Pourjavan et al (2005),&#xD;
      Doyle et al (2005), Gunvant et al (2005), Brunsini et al (2005) and Rask et al (2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further evaluate the effect of CCT on IOP measurement, the method and instruments used to&#xD;
      measure IOP were compared. In a clinical setting IOP's are measured by four instruments,&#xD;
      Goldmann applanation tonometer, ocular blood flow pneumatonometer, pneumatonometer or&#xD;
      Tono-Pen. Singh et al (2001) concluded that the effect of central corneal thickness on&#xD;
      Goldmann applanation tonometry accuracy appears not to be clinically relevant. However, Bhan&#xD;
      et al (2002) showed that in eyes with normal corneas, the ocular blood flow pneumatonometer&#xD;
      appears to be more affected by variation in CCT than the Goldmann tonometer, and the Tono-Pen&#xD;
      is least affected by CCT. A limitation of this study is that corneal curvature (a measure of&#xD;
      astigmatism) was not performed prior to measuring IOP. High amounts of astigmatism can impact&#xD;
      IOP readings obtained from the Goldmann tonometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PASCAL Dynamic Contour Tonometer is a new digital tonometer that provides a direct&#xD;
      trans-corneal measurement of IOP and is sensitive enough to detect the ocular pulse amplitude&#xD;
      (OPA) due to the patient's heartbeat. Supposedly, when using the principle of contour&#xD;
      matching instead of applanation, the PASCAL eliminates the systematic errors inherent in all&#xD;
      previous tonometers, such as the influence of corneal thickness and rigidity. Ku et al (2005)&#xD;
      demonstrated that the Pascal tonometer was effective in reducing corneal thickness bias&#xD;
      during IOP measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been thought that there is a significant positive correlation of scleral rigidity&#xD;
      to IOP, thus with increasing pressure in the eye, a resulting increase in rigidity is noted.&#xD;
      (1960). A study completed by Pallikaris et al. (2005) investigated a possible correlation of&#xD;
      rigidity to other ocular found no correlation between the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of CCT on IOP measurement is a clinical concern as erroneous IOP measurements may&#xD;
      lead to misdiagnosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether IOP measurements by&#xD;
      Goldmann applanation, pneumotonometryocular blood flow pneumotonometry, y, Tono-Pen and the&#xD;
      PASCAL Dynamic Contour Tonometer are affected by central corneal thickness, and if so, to&#xD;
      what extent.&#xD;
