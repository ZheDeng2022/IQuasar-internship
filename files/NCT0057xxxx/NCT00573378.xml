    <textblock>
      To investigate whether patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) who have&#xD;
      achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) on imatinib (IM) or nilotinib (N) can then be&#xD;
      treated with a combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and interferon-α2b&#xD;
      (PEG-IFN-a2b, [IFN]) for 2 years, subsequently have their therapy discontinued, and then&#xD;
      maintain a durable molecular response off all therapy. Relapse-free survival (RFS) rate 1&#xD;
      year after discontinuation of the TKI and IFN will be the measurement of this objective.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive pegylated interferon α-2b (Pegintron®) (PEG-IFN-α2b) 150 µg subcutaneously, once a week. Patients and/or caregivers identified by the patient will be taught how to perform subcutaneous injections of the PEG-IFN-α2b by trained nurses in the chemotherapy infusion center at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. Those patients who do not feel comfortable receiving the injections outside of the cancer center, or are deemed unreliable in administering injections per the training nurse, will return to the cancer center infusion room on a weekly basis to receive subsequent injections.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic&#xD;
             myeloid leukemia in chronic phase by having met all of the following criteria at the&#xD;
             time of their initial diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytogenetic confirmation of Philadelphia chromosome or variants of the t(9;22)&#xD;
             translocations. Patients may have secondary chromosomal abnormalities in addition to&#xD;
             the Philadelphia chromosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral blood or bone marrow blast count &lt; 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral blood basophil count &lt; 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the peripheral blood counts are unavailable from the time of their original&#xD;
             diagnosis, but there is no evidence of accelerated- or blast-phase disease from prior&#xD;
             clinical or other medical records, then they will be allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be eighteen years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be actively receiving treatment for their CML with a a tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitor, either imatinib or nilotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be receiving imatinib mesylate. Patients must be on imatinib mesylate for&#xD;
             a minimum of 2 years, and be on a stable dose for at least one consecutive year&#xD;
             leading up to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be receiving nilotinib (Tasigna) as frontline therapy or as second line&#xD;
             therapy if the reason for the switch from imatinib to nilotinib was intolerance to&#xD;
             imatinib. Patients cannot have been switched from imatinib to nilotinib because of a&#xD;
             concern or demonstration for resistance to frontline imatinib. Patients must be on&#xD;
             nilotinib for a minimum of 2 years, and be on a stable does for at least one&#xD;
             consecutive year leading up to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ongoing complete hematologic response (CHR) on a a TKI (imatinib&#xD;
             or nilotinib), defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WBC ≤ 10 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &lt; 450,000 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;

             nilotinib) for a minimum of 1 year leading up to enrollment. Complete cytogenetic&#xD;
             response is defined as 0% Ph+ cells in metaphase, in the bone marrow and/or a negative&#xD;
             peripheral blood FISH analysis for the Bcr-Abl gene fusion, and an ongoing CCyR must&#xD;
             be confirmed by bone marrow aspirate cytogenetics and/or peripheral blood FISH for&#xD;
             Bcr-Abl within 4 weeks of starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have a negative quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) for BCR-ABL at the time of&#xD;
