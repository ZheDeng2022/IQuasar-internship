  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women suffer disproportionately than men from Cardiac Syndrome X ( chest pain in the absence&#xD;
      of flow limiting coronary artery stenosis). Coronary microvascular disease is hypothesized to&#xD;
      mediate chest pain in this syndrome. This disorder of the small heart vessels (arterioles)&#xD;
      compared to the large vessels (arteries) is not diagnosed during routine heart&#xD;
      catheterization. This results in delays in diagnosis, missed opportunities for treatment, and&#xD;
      likely contributes to the increased death rate from coronary heart disease in women compared&#xD;
      to men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current testing for small vessel disease is performed in the cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      laboratory using specialized testing and is not performed routinely. Accordingly, women with&#xD;
      this condition are either falsely reassured, or misdiagnosed as another non-cardiac&#xD;
      condition. Unnecessary healthcare costs related to re-hospitalization and repeat angiography&#xD;
      are incurred, while women are often not initiated on appropriate lifesaving treatment. We and&#xD;
      others have demonstrated in randomized controlled trials that therapies that target the&#xD;
      endothelium, e.g. statins, ACE inhibitors, and exercise are effective in this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Majority of women with Cardiac Syndorme X go undiagnosed. Recent studies have shown&#xD;
      significant increased health care costs, morbidity and mortality related to this disease. It&#xD;
      is becoming more important to further characterize this group of patients and we hope to do&#xD;
      that with our study.&#xD;

      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish prevalence of microvascular disease in women and men with Cardiac Syndrome&#xD;
           X&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the predictive value and utility of noninvasive tests like Peripheral Artery&#xD;
           Tonometry (PAT) and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) in diagnosing Cardiac Syndrome X.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish prognosis in women and men with Cardiac Syndrome X.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To elucidate the risk factors, clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment, and&#xD;
           prognosis of patients with microvascular angina (MVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this research study, we want to specifically study a group of patients who have chest&#xD;
      pain or other signs or symptoms suggestive of heart disease but don't have visible blockages&#xD;
      in the large heart arteries. Patients with chest pain who undergo heart catheterization but&#xD;
      have no blockages of large heart arteries will be consented and enrolled. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out questionnaires about their medical history, including family, reproductive&#xD;
      and, social histories. They will also be asked to undergo testing during heart&#xD;
      catheterization that would test for abnormalities in their small heart arteries using&#xD;
      medications, acetylcholine and adenosine. This testing is a standard of care procedure given&#xD;
      at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients would receive this test whether they&#xD;
      participate in the research or not. The test is performed by infusing acetylcholine and&#xD;
      adenosine through the same catheter that is used for routine heart catheterization. This test&#xD;
      may add an additional 15 minutes to the heart catheterization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will be asked to undergo a non-invasive test called Peripheral Arterial&#xD;
      Tonometry or PAT for research purposes and in some cases, if clinically indicated a Cardiac&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging test as a standard of care. Patients will be followed up&#xD;
      using phone questionnaires at 6 months and than annually thereafter. It is proposed that&#xD;
      problems with the function of the large and small arteries may be responsible for giving some&#xD;
      patients their symptoms of chest pain and put them at risk for heart attacks. PAT may help us&#xD;
      more easily and non-invasively measure this function by testing the arteries in the arm.&#xD;
      Selected patients will also undergo CMR imaging that may be useful to detect abnormalities in&#xD;
      the inner layer of the heart muscle resulting from the abnormal function of the large and&#xD;
      small heart arteries. These non-invasive tests will be corroborated with results from&#xD;
      invasive testing during heart catheterization, which is considered the gold standard for&#xD;
      testing for function of the large and the small heart arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three tests (heart catheterization with adenosine coronary flow reserve testing,&#xD;
      acetylcholine provocative vasomotor testing during heart catheterization, cardiac MRI) are&#xD;
      performed for standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine collection have been added to this protocol as a secondary outcome for future&#xD;
      tests and for testing whether impaired Endothelial Progenitor Cell (EPC) number is related to&#xD;
      the presence and severity of microvascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from our study will help confirm the need to test patients with chest pain and open&#xD;
      large arteries during heart catheterizations for abnormalities in the function of the large&#xD;
      and small heart arteries, and to validate the usefulness of using non-invasive techniques&#xD;
      like PAT and CMR for detecting this problem. The study will also help confirm the increased&#xD;
      risk of heart attack associated with the abnormal function in the large and small arteries in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked if they are interested in receiving information on Pro00015124&#xD;
      (repository/collection). If they are interested, they will be consented under Pro00015124. No&#xD;
      specimens collected as part of this study will be forwarded to Pro00015124.&#xD;
