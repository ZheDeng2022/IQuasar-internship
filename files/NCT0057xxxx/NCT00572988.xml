      The major purpose of this experimental study is to test the effects of the symptom management&#xD;
      home care nursing intervention (SMHCNI) on recovery outcomes of elderly CABG patients, using&#xD;
      a randomized, two group (n=284) repeated measures design with measurements at discharge, at 3&#xD;
      and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. One group will receive the intervention and&#xD;
      routine care (RC) and the other group will receive RC only. The major aim will be to&#xD;
      determine if the intervention group will demonstrate: better physiological functioning&#xD;
      (decreased symptom interference on physical functioning; better scores on the SF36 subscales:&#xD;
      physical, role-physical and vitality, and increased activity and exercise energy&#xD;
      expenditure); better psychosocial functioning (decreased symptom interference on enjoyment of&#xD;
      life; and better SF36 subscales; role-emotional, social, mental, and vitality); and fewer&#xD;
      postoperative problems (e.g. infections, fluid in lungs, heart rate rhythm problems).&#xD;
      Additional outcomes for secondary aims are: lower levels of health care utilization (HCU)&#xD;
      (i.e., fewer number of visits to health care providers, fewer number of emergency department&#xD;
      visits, fewer number of home health visits, fewer rehospitalizations); and higher patient&#xD;
      satisfaction (with level of functioning and care received). In addition this study will&#xD;
      examine the potential effects of mediating (evaluation of symptoms, and perceived&#xD;
      self-efficacy), and moderating variables (participation in cardiac rehabilitation) with the&#xD;
      intervention on outcomes identified.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Effective follow-up and management of elderly post-CABG patients is important in the overall&#xD;
      recovery process. Specifically, this study will attempt to bridge the gap in current&#xD;
      literature related to the impact of follow-up interventions to enhance recovery outcomes in&#xD;
      the CABG population. The major purpose of this experimental study is to test the effects of&#xD;
      the symptom management home care nursing intervention (SMHCNI) on recovery outcomes of&#xD;
      elderly CABG patients using a randomized, two group (N=284) repeated measures design with&#xD;
      measurements at discharge, at 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post- operatively. One group&#xD;
      will receive the intervention and routine care (RC) and the other group will receive only RC.&#xD;
      The major aim will be to determine if the intervention group will demonstrate: better&#xD;
      physiological functioning (decreased symptom interference on physical functioning (decreased&#xD;
      symptom interference on physical functioning; better scores on the SF 36 subscales: physical,&#xD;
      role-physical and vitality, and increased activity and exercise energy expenditure); better&#xD;
      physiological conditioning (decreased symptom interference on physical functioning; better&#xD;
      scores on the SF 36 subscales; role-emotional, social, mental, and vitality); and fewer&#xD;
      post-operative problems (e.g., infections, fluid in lungs, heart rate rhythm problems).&#xD;
      Additional outcomes for secondary aims are: lower levels of health care utilization [HCU]&#xD;
      (i.e., fewer number of visits to health care providers, fewer number of emergency department&#xD;
      visits, fewer number of home health visits, fewer rehospitalizations); and higher patient&#xD;
      satisfaction (with level of functioning and care received). In addition this study will&#xD;
      examine the potential effects of mediating (evaluation of level of functioning and care&#xD;
      received)&gt; In addition this study will examine the potential effects of mediating (evaluation&#xD;
      of level of functioning and care received). In addition this study will examine the potential&#xD;
      effects of mediating (evaluation of symptoms, and perceived self-efficacy, and moderating&#xD;
      variables (participation in cardiac rehabilitation) with the intervention on outcomes&#xD;
      identified above. The intervention will be delivered using a device called the Health Buddy&#xD;
      that is attached to the patient's telephone line, able to download to a free secure Internet&#xD;
      site daily, and cannot be used by health care providers for post-hospital follow up care. The&#xD;
      6- week SMHCNI was designed using Bandura's (1986) definition of self- efficacy which is to&#xD;
      enhance the beliefs in ones capabilities to organize and execute the sources and actions&#xD;
      required to manage prospective situations. Preliminary data have shown that these patients&#xD;
      are going home with symptom management problems, but that complications arising from these&#xD;
      problems might be prevented with early detection and management. Using a follow-up&#xD;
      intervention such as the SMHCNI is expected to result in better functioning, management of&#xD;
      symptoms and fewer post-operative problems. Also, a better understanding of HCU, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, and self-efficacy as variables will be described.&#xD;
