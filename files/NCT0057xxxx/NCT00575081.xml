    <textblock>
      The NIH grant has funded the development of a physiological brain atlas registry that will&#xD;
      allow us to significantly improve the data collectioin and use of physiological data into a&#xD;
      normalized brain volume. This initially was used to improve DBS implants for Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease, Dystonia, Essential Tremor, and OCD, but now includes data acquired during all&#xD;
      stereotactic brain procedures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To create a brain atlas that will allow physiological and clinical information to be&#xD;
           assigned to anatomical locations in MRI space, utilizing non-rigid MRI normalization&#xD;
           algorithms. These data will specifically be acquired from the population of patients&#xD;
           undergoing stereotactic brain procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collate and analyze the brain data placed in the atlas in a statistical manner that&#xD;
           allows doctors to understand and treat brain disease more precisely and based on&#xD;
           population data. For example, this would allow surgeons to predict optimal targeting&#xD;
           locations for DBS implants, neurologists to program implants based on multiple&#xD;
           physiological variables, including pre-operative severity of disease, intraoperative&#xD;
           neurophysiological observations, and post-operative responses to previous therapies in a&#xD;
           larger population of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To allow precise relationships to be visualized in one anonymized MRI volume, which can&#xD;
           lead to new findings across larger populations of subjects in the field of brain&#xD;
           science.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To locate all the data in a HIPAA compliant, anonymized location that clinicians and&#xD;
           researchers can access securely without compromising personal healthcare information&#xD;
           (PHI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who have consented to undergo or have undergone a stereotactic brain procedure&#xD;
           for any reason will be asked to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Permission from the patient will be sought to allow the entry of all related data to be&#xD;
           entered into the atlas database. Specifically, this includes any and all related&#xD;
           pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative clinical, radiographic, and&#xD;
           psychologic testing done for the purposes of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The data must be entered in a confidential fashion and secured within a section of the&#xD;
           database that can be accessed only by persons authorized to view patient healthcare&#xD;
           information (PHI). Persons authorized to enter and view individual PHI must have taken&#xD;
           and passed the CITI certification and presented documentation of this credential to the&#xD;
           IRB study investigator (Dr. Konrad) or his Clinical Trials Specialist (Melba Isom).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Access to individual patient data within the database can be done through a secure login&#xD;
           linked to the person's qualifications to access PHI. The list of authorized persons&#xD;
           (such as treating physicians and members of the surgical team) will be determined by Dr.&#xD;
           Konrad and updated at least on an annual basis within the database by Dr. Dawant. Dr.&#xD;
           Dawant will be responsible to ensure that PHI is physically and virtually secure within&#xD;
           the atlas database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Once in the database, patient identifiers will be codified and not accessible for any&#xD;
           queries outside of those certified in step 3. Non-patient specific information can be&#xD;
           analyzed, sorted or queried in response to specific statistical questions by any&#xD;
           investigator of the research team or authorized person, as designated by the database&#xD;
           developer (Dr. Dawant) or his designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data contained within the atlas will be analyzed and regularly reported to members of&#xD;
           the Atlas research team regarding accurate display and representation of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Clinical and physiological data will continue to be entered for every subject who&#xD;
           consents to participate in this study for the duration of their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. If subjects no longer wish to have their data tracked within the atlas, they can call&#xD;
           the study coordinator (Melba Isom) and have their name removed from any further data&#xD;
           collection from the time of notification forward. All previously collected data will&#xD;
           still be accessible and not expunged from the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. We plan to recruit 5,000 patients from Vanderbilt and participating sites.&#xD;
