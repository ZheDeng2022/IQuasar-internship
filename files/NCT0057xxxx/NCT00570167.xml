      While many problems associated with endoprosthetic surgery have been solved, there are still&#xD;
      some open questions: In hip replacement one of the most controversial issues is the role and&#xD;
      the indications for &quot;resurfacing&quot; (Schmalzried 2005, Hungerford 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resurfacing In traditional hip replacement, the head of the femur is replaced with a metal&#xD;
      head secured to a stem in the femoral canal. In hip resurfacing, the neck of the femur is not&#xD;
      cut, and instead the head of the femur is capped with a hemispherical metal ball articulated&#xD;
      with an acetabular cup. The concept of resurfacing was developed as early as the 1970s, but&#xD;
      it was abandoned due to unsatisfactory results. The procedure started to spark new interest&#xD;
      in the 1990s as the results improved due to improvements in the articulation surfaces and&#xD;
      fixation techniques (Amstutz 1998), and it has become considerably more common in the 2000s.&#xD;
      In Australia, for example, resurfacing procedures accounted for 9% of all hip replacement&#xD;
      operations carried out as a consequence of primary osteoarthritis, and their use has&#xD;
      increased 17-fold in the 2000s (Australian Orthopedic Association National Joint Replacement&#xD;
      Registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The partly assumed benefits of hip resurfacing include less bone resection in connection with&#xD;
      the procedure, easiness of reoperation (a &quot;conventional&quot; replacement is carried out if&#xD;
      reoperation is necessary), smaller risk of dislocation due to the larger head, and more&#xD;
      physiological flexibility of the femur as the neck of the femur is not replaced with an&#xD;
      inflexible metal stem. The short-term and mid-term results of modern resurfacing procedures&#xD;
      presented in the reports of the developer clinics have been encouraging (Daniel 2004, Beaule&#xD;
      2004), but long-term results are lacking. Resurfacing procedures are technically more&#xD;
      challenging and have given rise to complications that are not associated with conventional&#xD;
      hip replacement, such as fractures of the femoral neck (Shimmin 2005). On the other hand, the&#xD;
      socket and the diameter of the ball used in resurfacing procedures and conventional hip&#xD;
      replacements are similar, and excellent results have been reached with modern conventional&#xD;
      cementless stems (Eskelinen 2005). There are no published studies comparing modern&#xD;
      resurfacing prostheses to solutions involving cementless stems with a large head and&#xD;
      metal-on-metal articulation surfaces.&#xD;
