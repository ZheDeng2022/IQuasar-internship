  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant patients having a cesarean section (CS) under spinal anesthesia experience a variety&#xD;
      of hemodynamic changes, such as hypotension due to decreases in cardiac output (CO), stroke&#xD;
      volume (SV) and/or systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Measurement of these hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters classically requires insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) into the&#xD;
      heart. However, this invasive method carries significant complications and its use is now&#xD;
      reserved for the more critically ill patients. We hypothesize that the Physioflow Impedance&#xD;
      device can be used as a reliable non-invasive monitor to measure hemodynamic parameters&#xD;
      during elective CS under spinal anesthesia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Physioflow Impedance device employs a continuous non-invasive method of measuring ten&#xD;
      cardiac hemodynamic parameters including flow, resistance, contractility and fluid content.&#xD;
      It involves the application of electrocardiogram (ECG) leads on the neck and the thorax to&#xD;
      measure resistance of pulsatile blood flow. Its benefits are that it is non-invasive, low&#xD;
      cost, and easy to operate. Thoracic impedance has been validated against the gold standard&#xD;
      method of PAC. Although the Physioflow device has been validated in non-pregnant patients,&#xD;
      its use in pregnant patients is very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate to severe hypotension, experienced by these awake patients, can cause significant&#xD;
      undesirable symptoms of dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, and also&#xD;
      compromise fetal well-being. The etiology of hypotension is multi-factorial,and it is&#xD;
      postulated that decreases in cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and/or systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance (SVR) may precede decreases in blood pressure. Continuous measurement of CO and SV&#xD;
      by the Physioflow Impedance device may provide a better understanding of the cause of&#xD;
      hypotension so that future management of these patients may include pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions used prior to hypotension in order to avoid any undesirable symptoms.&#xD;
