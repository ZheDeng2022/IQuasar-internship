  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the applicability of a new SSFP-based BOLD sensitive&#xD;
      MRI sequence in evaluating endothelial function. Endothelial function will be tested in a&#xD;
      setting of reactive hyperemia in the forearm. In a setting of ischemia-reperfusion, the&#xD;
      effect of transient endothelial function impairment will be tested. Comparison with&#xD;
      endothelial function assessment by brachial ultrasound (FMD) and finger tip plethysmography&#xD;
      (PAT) will be incorporated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: BOLD-MRI is a feasible tool to assess endothelial function in the human forearm&#xD;
      during reactive hyperemia. There is significant correlation to established flow-mediated&#xD;
      dilation (FMD).&#xD;

      This is a single center study on healthy volunteers. The subjects will be seen by the study&#xD;
      coordinator in the SCMRC to obtain written informed consent and to assess the co-variable&#xD;
      data (vitals, medication, history, contraindications for MRI). The study nurse will schedule&#xD;
      two visits for endothelial function assessment that are at least one but not more than three&#xD;
      weeks apart. Both visits are to be at the same time of day. The initial volunteer will be&#xD;
      assigned an endothelial function assessment with MRI first followed by FMD in the endothelial&#xD;
      function lab. Subsequent volunteers will alternate assignment to FMD or MRI first to rule out&#xD;
      pre-conditioning effects. Simultaneous to FMD assessment, plethysmographic pulse volume will&#xD;
      be evaluated with finger probes on the index finger of each hand. Subjects will be studied in&#xD;
      a temperature-controlled room with minimal background distraction and in a fasting state for&#xD;
      the previous 4 hours. Subjects will also refrain from ingesting caffeine or nicotine in these&#xD;
      preceding 4 hours. Each study day volunteers will undergo two endothelial function&#xD;
      assessments. The first baseline assessment takes place after a 10 minute accommodation&#xD;
      period. The volunteer is then subjected to a 15 minute upper arm tourniquet. The second&#xD;
      assessment takes place 15 minutes after the release of the tourniquet. This so called&#xD;
      'ischemia reperfusion' is known to markedly impair endothelial function for approximately one&#xD;
      hour without affecting the early bloodflow responses to reactive hyperemia. This effect is&#xD;
      reversible and will help to determine the actual endothelial component of measured BOLD&#xD;
      signal changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One day: 2 CMR studies without contrast agent to assess endothelial function during reactive&#xD;
      hyperemia. Each will last 15 minutes. A 15 minutes upper arm occlusion with a pressure cuff&#xD;
      in between the 2 measurements will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another day: 2 FMD studies with ultrasound to assess endothelial function during reactive&#xD;
      hyperemia. Each will take 15 minutes. Simultaneously a PAT hyperemic index will be measured.&#xD;
      A 15 minutes upper arm occlusion with a pressure cuff in between the 2 measurements will be&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood work (fasting glucose, creatinine, lipids, hsCRP), performed by Calgary Labs Services&#xD;
      (CLS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the reperfusion ischemia will be tested by individually comparing the BOLD&#xD;
      signal change (BC) at baseline with BC after reperfusion ischemia. Since these are paired,&#xD;
      related data a Wilcoxon rank sum test will be performed and a p value &lt; 0.05 will be regarded&#xD;
      as significant. The same will be done for the FMD and PAT index before and after reperfusion&#xD;
      ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMD as the most accepted technique and will be considered as gold standard and a linear&#xD;
      regression analysis of FMD with MBC and TBC will be performed. r2-value will be calculated&#xD;
      and a value of &gt; 0.25 will be considered as reasonable of &gt; 0.5 as good correlation. If the&#xD;
      correlation does not appear linear a Spearman's correlation test will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlations between PAT index and FMD and PAT index and TBC will also be assessed with&#xD;
      linear regression analysis.&#xD;
