      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-response (50% decline) to Testosterone&#xD;
      Replacement Therapy (TRT) in men with &quot;intermediate and good-risk&quot; Castration-Resistant&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer (CRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the objective response and time-to-progression with TRT in CRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess serial changes in quality of life with TRT in these CRPC subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Translational: To study kinetics of circulating tumor cells with TRT and molecular&#xD;
           correlates of response to TRT in CRPC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generally, castration therapy has been used indefinitely for prostate cancer patients because&#xD;
      some tumors seem to grow faster with testosterone present. Researchers want to study the&#xD;
      effect of testosterone only in patients whose tumors have had a maximum response to&#xD;
      castration therapy. Researchers want to find out if these patients' disease may be better&#xD;
      controlled with testosterone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests&#xD;
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. Your complete&#xD;
      medical history will be recorded and there will be a review of all medicines you may be&#xD;
      currently taking. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs&#xD;
      (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate). You will have blood drawn&#xD;
      (about 4 teaspoons) and urine collected for routine tests. You will have a chest x-ray, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG--a test to measure the electrical activity of the heart), a bone scan,&#xD;
      and a computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis. If the study doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is necessary, you may have an assessment of your mental status. For this assessment, you will&#xD;
      be asked questions about your attention span, memory, and mood disturbances. It will take&#xD;
      about 25 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin receiving&#xD;
      testosterone enanthate replacement therapy every 2 weeks by an injection into a muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks, you will go to the clinic for your testosterone injection, and blood (about 2&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be drawn to check the testosterone level in your blood. This will help the&#xD;
      study doctor learn what dose you will receive for the next 2 weeks. After your Week 8 visit,&#xD;
      blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the testosterone level in your blood every 4&#xD;
      weeks for the rest of your time on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Week 8 and 24 visits, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your&#xD;
      vital signs. You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing. Your disease&#xD;
      status will be evaluated to learn its response to treatment. Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will&#xD;
      be drawn for routine tests, and you will have repeat imaging scans (like the ones you had at&#xD;
      your screening visit) to evaluate your disease. If the study doctor thinks that your mental&#xD;
      status should be assessed again, you will have another assessment (at or around Week 24) like&#xD;
      the one completed during your screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on this study indefinitely unless your disease gets worse or you experience&#xD;
      any intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your participation ends on this study for any of the above reasons, you will have an&#xD;
      end-of-study visit. During this visit, you will have blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons) for&#xD;
      routine testing. You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing, and your&#xD;
      disease response to treatment will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Testosterone enanthate is commercially available.&#xD;
      Testosterone replacement therapy is not FDA approved for this disease, and in some cases, has&#xD;
      been disallowed for use in prostate cancer. Up to 40 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a history of histologically or cytologically confirmed&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had a history of a response to medical or surgical castration&#xD;
             therapy for prostate cancer with a serum PSA nadir of &lt;/= 0.2 ng/ml and must not have&#xD;
             had any known subsequent rise in serum PSA level of any magnitude above this nadir&#xD;
             within the first 24 months of hormonal therapy. Nadir PSA value following hormonal&#xD;
             therapy in combination with non-hormonal therapy such as radical prostatectomy,&#xD;
             radiation therapy or chemotherapy do not count towards eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have current evidence of progressive castration-resistant disease that&#xD;
             is asymptomatic. Progressive disease is defined by a) radiological evidence of&#xD;
             progression: any increase of &gt; 25% in the products of diameters or 30% in maximum&#xD;
             diameter of any measurable lesion; or appearance of an unequivocally new lesion OR b)&#xD;
             two consecutive rises in serum PSA of any magnitude measured at least 2 weeks apart,&#xD;
             to a level above 2 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a minimum serum PSA level of 1 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have palpable disease or radiological evidence of metastatic disease but&#xD;
             without the following high-risk features: lymphangitic lung disease on chest X-ray or&#xD;
             CT scan; bilateral hydronephrosis related to prostate cancer, palpable disease in the&#xD;
             prostate, known brain metastases or suspicion of impending spinal cord or nerve root&#xD;
             compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a documented castrate level of testosterone (&lt;/= 50ng/ml). For&#xD;
             patients who are medically castrated, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog&#xD;
             will continue. The purpose is to simplify and harmonize exogenous testosterone&#xD;
             therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on anti-androgens should be discontinued from such therapy for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks (for bicalutamide for at least 6 weeks), prior to initiation of testosterone&#xD;
             therapy and must have had documented progression of disease as in #3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must satisfy the following laboratory criteria: serum total bilirubin &lt; 2 *&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST or&#xD;
             SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) &lt;/= 2.5 * institutional ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Small cell or sarcomatoid prostate cancers are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy for CRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or hormonal therapy&#xD;
             besides that specified in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or&#xD;
             electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infections defined as requiring IV antibiotics on day 1 of treatment or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable because of comorbid conditions to tolerate intramuscular&#xD;
             injections of testosterone every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Overt psychosis, mental disability or otherwise incompetent to give informed consent&#xD;
             or history of non-compliance.&#xD;
