    <textblock>
      Heart disease is not just the number one killer of women, it is also a leading cause of&#xD;
      disability. While it is generally believed that heart disease in women is a disease of old&#xD;
      age, the stark reality is that heart disease is responsible for more deaths than breast&#xD;
      cancer AT ALL AGES. Also, when young women develop heart disease, they are more likely to die&#xD;
      or become disabled than their male peers. Identifying women at risk for heart disease is an&#xD;
      important step toward reducing the impact of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although women can develop heart disease at any age, most women show signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      disease about 10 years after men. For years, it has been thought that the reason for this lag&#xD;
      is that women's hearts are protected by estrogen, and that when women go through menopause&#xD;
      and lose their natural estrogen, they also lose their protection from heart disease. It has&#xD;
      been assumed that if estrogen is replaced then protection will continue. These assumptions&#xD;
      have not been proven. In fact, three large, randomized trials have shown no benefit from&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy in women known to have heart disease, and in fact have shown that&#xD;
      hormone replacement may be harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the role of hormones and heart disease, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      look at markers of heart disease in healthy women and compare this to their natural hormone&#xD;
      levels. One of the markers known to be related to heart disease is carotid artery&#xD;
      intima-medial thickness (c-IMT) which can be measured by creating an ultrasound picture of an&#xD;
      artery in the neck. The investgators will use c-IMT scans and serum blood samples from women&#xD;
      in the NIH-sponsored Los Angeles Atherosclerosis Study (LAAS), a large epidemiologic study&#xD;
      that followed participants for 8 years. The proposed study will use risk factor information,&#xD;
      serum samples and c-IMT scans collected from the female participants (about 269 women) over&#xD;
      the 8 years of follow-up. The total sample size is 269 subjects, each of whom donated 3 blood&#xD;
      specimens for the LAAS study. This research will examine those specimens (800 in total). It&#xD;
      will also measure other markers of heart disease, including inflammation (hsCRP) and diabetes&#xD;
      (insulin and glucose). All information has been obtained and there will be no need to collect&#xD;
      additional information from participants nor additional blood specimens.&#xD;
