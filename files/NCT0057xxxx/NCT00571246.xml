      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of topiramate (250mg) or lamotrigine&#xD;
      (250mg) versus placebo in reducing alcohol consumption and decreasing symptoms of PTSD in&#xD;
      patients with comorbid AD and PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a high rate of comorbidity with alcohol dependence (AD) and post traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD). The rates of PTSD among individuals with AD are at least twice as high as&#xD;
      those in the general population. In addition, alcohol dependence is the most common comorbid&#xD;
      condition in men with PTSD. Despite this, little is known about how to best treat individuals&#xD;
      with comorbid AD and PTSD. The use of anticonvulsants represents a novel approach to&#xD;
      treatment that may target symptoms of both AD and PTSD. Both Topiramate and Lamotrigine act&#xD;
      on the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems. Topiramate has GABAergic effects by robustly&#xD;
      increasing brain GABA, and antiglutamatergic effects by inhibiting glutamate function that&#xD;
      might antagonize alcohol's rewarding effects in AD and could contribute to the regulating of&#xD;
      reexperiencing and arousal symptoms in PTSD. Lamotrigine is a glutamate-inhibiting&#xD;
      anticonvulsant that has shown efficacy in some dually diagnosed patients with alcohol&#xD;
      dependence, and in patients with PTSD. Neither topiramate nor lamotrigine have been used to&#xD;
      treat patients with comorbid PTSD and AD. Methods: Ninety men and women with a current&#xD;
      diagnosis of AD and PTSD will be enrolled in a 16-week trial. They will be assigned, in a&#xD;
      double-blind fashion, to either topiramate, lamotrigine or placebo. Significance: This&#xD;
      project will be the first to compare anticonvulsants (topiramate and lamotrigine) to placebo&#xD;
      as effective treatments for reducing alcohol consumption and PTSD symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      AD and PTSD.&#xD;
