  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FMS), defined as the presence of both chronic widespread pain and the finding&#xD;
      of 11/18 tender points on examination, affects 2% of the general population. Drug therapy for&#xD;
      FMS is largely symptomatic as there is not yet a complete understanding of the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of the disease. In the past 17 years, supervised aerobic exercise has emerged as an important&#xD;
      treatment modality to improve pain, aerobic capacity, function, and well-being. Individuals&#xD;
      who are able to adhere to exercise almost always maintain the symptomatic benefits of&#xD;
      exercise. Unfortunately, the rate of exercise adherence six months after the completion of a&#xD;
      well-structured supervised exercise program is disappointingly low. Furthermore, although the&#xD;
      efficacy of supervised aerobic exercise in the research setting is well documented, the&#xD;
      applicability of such intervention in the clinic setting is doubtful. Therefore, we propose&#xD;
      to conduct the Research to Encourage Exercise for Fibromyalgia (REEF), a randomized&#xD;
      attention-controlled trial whose primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      telephone-delivered motivational interviewing (MI) to encourage exercise, in improving&#xD;
      exercise adherence and self-report physical function (co-primary outcome measures) for FMS&#xD;
      patients. REEF will enroll 200 FMS patients, randomizing them to either the MI group or the&#xD;
      attention-control (AC) group. Participants from each group will receive a total of 6&#xD;
      telephone calls within a 12-week period. Prior to the phone calls, participants from both&#xD;
      groups will receive an individualized exercise prescription and 2 supervised exercise&#xD;
      training sessions to get them started on an exercise program. All subjects will undergo&#xD;
      comprehensive outcome assessment at baseline, week 12, week 24, and week 36. The secondary&#xD;
      aim of this proposal is to determine the mediators between MI and improvement in self-report&#xD;
      physical function. The proposed research is significant because our focus is the promotion of&#xD;
      adherence to an exercise program, of adequate intensity, in order to maximize functioning and&#xD;
      well-being for patients with FMS. The use of a predominantly home-based exercise program and&#xD;
      telephone-delivered MI by a trained licensed practice nurse (LPN) could potentially make the&#xD;
      proposed intervention more accessible to the greater majority of FMS patients. Furthermore,&#xD;
      if proven efficacious, MI could readily be applied to other chronically painful conditions&#xD;
      (e.g. chronic back pain).&#xD;

    <description>Telephone Call for the Attention Control Group Each AC call will follow the same format as the MI call. During the AC call, study subjects will receive health information on important topics relevant to their illness. Specifically, there will be one topic during each phone call that includes the following: (a) overview of FMS, (b) pain, (c) fatigue (d) sleep, (e) stress, and (f) living well with FMS. The AC calls will be an avenue to transfer relevant health information from the RA to the study subject. The scheduled topics during each contact will give the call face validity (i.e., establish a credible pretense for the contact) while being neutral with respect to encouragement of exercise.</description>

    <description>Telephone-delivered Motivational Interviewing Participants will receive 6 telephone calls throughout the study. Harland et al reported that the most effective intervention for promoting exercise in the primary care setting was the most intensive treatment arm that included six MI sessions (208). Importantly, in our pilot study, participants who completed 5 to 6 phone calls achieved greater symptomatic benefits than participants who had ≤ 4 phone calls. The phone calls will be scheduled at week 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 of the study. Telephone sessions may run for 30 minutes on the average</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for FMS(203)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has been on stable doses of FMS medications (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, tramadol,&#xD;
             gabapentin, pregabalin, venlafaxine, duloxetine, pramipexole, tricyclic&#xD;
             anti-depressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) for at least 4 weeks and&#xD;
             willing to limit the introduction of new medications for FMS symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age between 18-65 years old. Because the prevalence of sub-clinical coronary artery&#xD;
             disease increases with older age, we are excluding those who are ≥ 66 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. FIQ-PI score &lt; 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. BPI-PS &lt;4&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known cardiovascular disease, including congestive heart failure; previous episodes of&#xD;
             angina pectoris; previous myocardial infarction; or previous revascularization&#xD;
             procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Moderate-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Orthopedic or musculoskeletal conditions that would prohibit moderate-intensity&#xD;
             exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active suicidal ideation&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Planned elective surgery during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ongoing unresolved disability claims&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Other major rheumatic conditions (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus, scleroderma and other connective tissue disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Use of medications that may affect chronotropic response to exercise, i.e.&#xD;
             beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Schizophrenia or other psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Exercising 3 days a week or more. The US Surgeon General considers a physically active&#xD;
             person as somebody who does at least 3 times a week of moderate to vigorous level of&#xD;
             exercise(204). Thus, we are excluding the already physically active individuals from&#xD;
             the study. In the pilot study, only 4% (2 out of 50) of the potential participants&#xD;
             were excluded due to being physically active.&#xD;
