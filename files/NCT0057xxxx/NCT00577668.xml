      In this study, researchers want to find out if using the VTD regimen, along with higher doses&#xD;
      melphalan, in subjects who have relapsed or progressed after previous transplant(s), can be&#xD;
      given safely to subjects who have failed previous transplant(s).&#xD;

      Autologous transplant is now considered a standard treatment for many patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. An autologous transplant is a procedure in which stem cells are removed from a&#xD;
      patient and then given back to the patient following intensive treatment. Doctors remove&#xD;
      healthy stem cells from a patient's circulating blood system and store them before the&#xD;
      patient receives high-dose chemotherapy. The stem cells are then returned to the patient,&#xD;
      where they can produce new blood cells to replace cells destroyed by the treatment. The drug&#xD;
      usually used before transplant is melphalan alone in 1 or 2 high doses. In past studies&#xD;
      conducted at UAMS, researchers have shown that a chemotherapy treatment regimen called &quot;VTD&quot;&#xD;
      is effective in patients with multiple myeloma who have failed previous treatments. VTD is a&#xD;
      combination of drugs consisting of VelcadeTM (also known as bortezomib), Thalidomide, and&#xD;
      Dexamethasone. In this study, researchers want to find out if using the VTD regimen, along&#xD;
      with higher doses melphalan, in subjects who have relapsed or progressed after previous&#xD;
      transplant(s) can be given safely to subjects who have failed previous transplant(s).&#xD;
