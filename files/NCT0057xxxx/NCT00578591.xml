  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label pilot study in which 4 doses of Rituximab are administered&#xD;
      to patients who have developed SR-aGVHD following allogeneic hematopoietic transplant (AHT).&#xD;
      The study is designed to determine the overall survival at 180 days after treatment with&#xD;
      rituximab, and evaluates the safety and clinical response to rituximab in this study&#xD;
      population. Study entry: Patients must enter study on or before day +100 posttransplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), one of the most important complications of&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Grades II to IV aGVHD occur in 30% to 50% of matched related donor&#xD;
      recipients and 50% to 70% of unrelated donor recipients. Standard first-line treatment&#xD;
      consists of methylprednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d or equivalent that produces response&#xD;
      rates of 63% to 95% for grade II, 17% to 39% for grade III, and 0% to 6% for grade IV aGVHD.&#xD;
      In aggregate, approximately 40% to 50% of patients with acute GVHD experience a complete or&#xD;
      partial response with primary therapy, whereas 20% to 60% require salvage treatments. The&#xD;
      1994 consensus conference on acute GVHD grading reported 100-day survival rates of 78% to 90%&#xD;
      with grade I, 66% to 92% with grade II, 29% to 62% for grade III, and 23% to 25% for grade&#xD;
      IV. The higher mortality rates were directly attributable to acute GVHD or to the subsequent&#xD;
      immunosuppression from high-dose corticosteroids and other medications required for treatment&#xD;
      of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite several studies seeking to improve first-line therapy for acute GVHD, standard care&#xD;
      remains moderate-dose corticosteroids. Higher initial doses of corticosteroids, a more&#xD;
      prolonged steroid tapering course, and addition of murine or equine anti-T-cell antibodies to&#xD;
      standard GVHD therapy all failed to improve response rates. Acute GVHD therefore remains an&#xD;
      unfavorable complication of transplantation that is difficult to manage. Various&#xD;
      immunosuppressants including, Anti-thimocyte globulin (ATG), Denileukin Diftitox,&#xD;
      Mycophenolate mofetil, Pentostatin, Infliximab, Rapamycin, Inolimomab and Daclizumab have&#xD;
      been tried with variable success (table-1 in full protocol); there remains no consensus on&#xD;
      the second-line treatment of aGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) is mediated by donor T-cells. The preventative and&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies described above have therefore focused on quantitative reduction in T&#xD;
      cells or reduction of their function through immune-modulation. The role of B-lymphocytes in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of GHVD is unclear. Recent reports of successful use of rituximab in cGVHD&#xD;
      support the hypothesis that a coordinated B and T cell response is instrumental in cGVHD. The&#xD;
      significance of B-cells in pathogenesis of aGVHD is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroid Refractory Acute Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (SR-aGVHD) Initial treatment for aGVHD&#xD;
      routinely consists of intensifying the dose of corticosteroids. This condition is called&#xD;
      steroid-resistant (SR) aGVHD and requires secondary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab is a human/murine chimeric monoclonal anti CD-20 antibody that is extensively used&#xD;
      in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or with autoimmune disease. The incidental&#xD;
      observation of improvement in aGVHD following rituximab infusion for transplant-associated&#xD;
      thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TA-TTP) and subsequent complete resolution of&#xD;
      multi-agent refractory aGVHD in two patients forms the basis of this proposed pilot study.&#xD;
      Table-2 (in full protocol) describes the patients and their responses to rituximab at our own&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
