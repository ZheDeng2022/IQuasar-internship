      We will enroll 20 patients to evaluate the effectiveness of a new operation known as&#xD;
      videothoracoscopic splanchnicectomy (VSPL) for management of chronic kidney pain. This study&#xD;
      is being done to test if this procedure is effective in controlling chronic kidney pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have intractable&#xD;
      disabling chronic kidney pain. Among methods used to manage these patients, removal of the&#xD;
      nerve supply to the kidney by Videothoracoscopic excision of Splanchnic nerve&#xD;
      (videothoracoscopic splanchnicectomy - VSPL) is one of the most promising procedures. Few of&#xD;
      these procedures have been performed in ADPKD patients (and in only one patient using the&#xD;
      less invasive thoracic approach). We recently performed VSPL on two patients who had chronic&#xD;
      pain. Both had initial improvement but have had very short follow up. This study should&#xD;
      improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms and mediators of kidney pain and provide&#xD;
      the hope of an effective procedure to ADPKD patients with chronic kidney pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are now enrolling patients to study the effectiveness of the VSPL operation, collecting&#xD;
      information on pain intensity, quality of life, kidney blood flow, kidney/cyst volume and&#xD;
      also to study the involved pain pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit - The patient will also have a complete physical exam and have the kidney's&#xD;
      filtration rate measured. Urine and blood tests are performed at each evaluation. You will&#xD;
      have an MRI performed of your kidneys. There is no radiation exposure associated with this&#xD;
      procedure. You will also be asked to complete Quality of Life (QOL), HALT Pain, and&#xD;
      Depression Score questionnaires. These will take approximately 15 minutes to complete and&#xD;
      will be repeated at each evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VSPL operation will be done within approximately 1 week of your Baseline Visit and is&#xD;
      considered part of your clinical care and not part of the research.In this procedure the&#xD;
      surgeon approaches the nerves supplying the kidneys through the chest wall, using 3 small&#xD;
      incisions. He locates these nerves, then cuts a piece of them and removes it from the chest&#xD;
      cavity.You will be released from the hospital when your pain is controlled on oral&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Month Visit-You will be asked to return to the Mayo Clinic one month after your VSPL&#xD;
      procedure for a physical exam and completion of the questionnaires.If unable to return to the&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic this evaluation can be done with your local doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Month Visit-The 3 Month Visit will be identical to the Baseline visit. You will have a&#xD;
      physical exam, blood and urine samples, MRI of your kidneys, Iothalamate Clearance, and the&#xD;
      three questionnaires to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Months: The questionnaires will be mailed to you for completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 Month Visit-The 12 Month Visit is identical to the 1 Month visit. You will be asked to&#xD;
      return to the Mayo Clinic for a physical exam and completion of the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Year Visit-The 2 Year Visit will be identical to the Baseline visit. You will have a&#xD;
      physical exam, blood and urine samples, MRI of your kidneys, measurement of kidney filtration&#xD;
      and complete the three questionnaires.&#xD;
