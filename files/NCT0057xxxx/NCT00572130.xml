    <textblock>
      Rexin-G is a tumor-targeted gene medicine that is designed to seek out and destroy both&#xD;
      primary tumors and metastatic cancers without the side effects of standard chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      objectives of the study are: (1) to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of intravenous&#xD;
      injections of Rexin-G, a tumor-targeted gene vector, in controlling tumor growth and&#xD;
      prolonging life, and (2) to evaluate its over-all safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The adaptive trial design of this advanced Phase II study incorporates (i) a dosing schedule&#xD;
      based on the patient's estimated tumor burden and not on standard dosing per kilogram body&#xD;
      weight or body surface area, and (2) a tumor response evaluation process that is unique to&#xD;
      the manner in which osteosarcoma responds favorably to therapy, i.e., with necrosis and&#xD;
      increasing calcification in metastatic tumors and decreased glucose utilization using PET-CT&#xD;
      imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty to thirty patients will receive Rexin-G at either Dose Level 1 or 2. Patients will be&#xD;
      assigned a dose level based on the estimated tumor burden as measured by PET-CT imaging&#xD;
      studies. Estimated tumor burden is measured by multiplying the sum of the longest diameters&#xD;
      of target lesions in cm by 10e9 cancer cells. If the tumor burden is less than 10 billion&#xD;
      cells, the patient will be assigned to Dose Level 1, if the tumor burden is greater than 10&#xD;
      billion cells, the patient will be assigned to Dose Level 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Treatment Cycle Dose Level Vector Dose/Day Max.Volume/Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two times a week 1 1.0 x 10e11 cfu 200 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three times a week 2 1.0 x 10e11 cfu 200 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Each treatment cycle will be six weeks (four weeks of treatment and two weeks of rest).&#xD;
      Patients who have resolution of toxicity to &lt; grade I may have repeat cycles. After one or&#xD;
      more treatment cycles, the principal investigator may recommend surgical debulking or&#xD;
      complete surgical removal. If residual disease is present either by histopathological&#xD;
      examination or by PET-CT scan, repeat treatment cycles may be given 3-4 weeks after surgery,&#xD;
      if the surgical incision has healed, and if the patient has &lt; grade I toxicity.&#xD;
