    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together&#xD;
      with irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with cancer that has spread to other parts&#xD;
      of the body or that cannot be removed by surgery. Irinotecan hydrochloride can kill cancer&#xD;
      cells by damaging the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that is needed for cancer cell survival and&#xD;
      growth. Veliparib may block proteins that repair the damaged DNA and may help irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride to kill more tumor cells. Giving irinotecan hydrochloride together with&#xD;
      veliparib may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      cells (PBMC) by measurement of PAR levels. (ORIGINAL DOSE ESCALATION PORTION) II. DNA&#xD;
      damaging effects of irinotecan and the combination of irinotecan with ABT-888: levels of&#xD;

      irinotecan and/or ABT-888. (ORIGINAL DOSE ESCALATION PORTION) IV. To explore whether a&#xD;
      positive gamma-H2AX response in tumor tissue at 4-6 hours (hrs) is reflected in circulating&#xD;
      tumor cells (CTCs) between 8-24 hrs but not at 4-6 hrs, as predicted. (EXPANSION PORTION) V.&#xD;
      To explore whether PARP inhibition increases gamma-H2AX response of CTCs to plasma drug by&#xD;
      4-6 hrs after CPT-11 administration. (EXPANSION PORTION) VI. To explore whether PARP&#xD;
      inhibition increases gamma-H2AX response of tumor cells to tissue drug level, as indicated by&#xD;
      CTCs at 8-24 hrs after CPT-11. (EXPANSION PORTION) VII. To explore when the gamma-H2AX&#xD;
      response peak in CTCs occurs, indicating a response in tumor. (EXPANSION PORTION) VIII. To&#xD;
      explore whether there is a tumor switch between gamma-H2AX and excision repair&#xD;

      (i.e., repeat initial PBMC and tumor findings). (EXPANSION PORTION) IX. To perform analysis&#xD;
      of CTCs at day 15 to help guide alteration in ABT-888 drug administration schedule&#xD;
      (continuous administration). (EXPANSION PORTION) X. To sequence the genome and transcriptome&#xD;
      from both normal and tumor tissue from each study patient in the expansion cohort to evaluate&#xD;
      point mutations, structural changes and copy number events. (EXPANSION PORTION) XI. To&#xD;
      evaluate the damaging effects of irinotecan and the combination of irinotecan with ABT-888 by&#xD;
      examining levels of Rad51 formation in tumors. (EXPANSION PORTION) XII. To evaluate the&#xD;
      percentage of breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) in serial breast tumor biopsies before and&#xD;
      after irinotecan alone and after 1 cycle of treatment with the combination of irinotecan and&#xD;
      ABT-888. (EXPANSION PORTION) XIII. To perform molecular profiling of the tumor cell and BCSC&#xD;
      populations before and after irinotecan alone and after 1 cycle of treatment with the&#xD;
      combination of irinotecan and ABT-888. (EXPANSION PORTION) XIV. To compare Rad51 foci in&#xD;
      aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive (ALDH+) stem cell populations to the bulk tumor cells.&#xD;
      (EXPANSION PORTION) XV. To develop assays to detect trapping of PARP1 and 2 in tumor biopsy&#xD;
      tissue in response to treatment with irinotecan plus a PARP inhibitor, in this case ABT-888.&#xD;
