    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile of 4 mg prucalopride in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic constipation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the potential differences in the adverse event (safety) profile between 4 mg of&#xD;
      prucalopride daily for 4 weeks; titration up to a 4-mg total daily dose of prucalopride by&#xD;
      starting at 1 mg for 2 days, 2 mg for 2 days, to 4 mg thereafter; and placebo given as oral&#xD;
      tablets once daily for 4 weeks in patients with chronic constipation&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and non-pregnant, non-breast feeding female subjects at least 18 years of age (no&#xD;
             upper age limit);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of constipation. The subject reported having on average, 2 or fewer&#xD;
             spontaneous bowel movements per week that resulted in a feeling or sensation of&#xD;
             complete evacuation, as well as the occurrence of one or more of the following for at&#xD;
             least 6 months before the selection visit: very hard (little balls) and/or hard stools&#xD;
             for at least a quarter of the stools; sensation of incomplete evacuation following at&#xD;
             least a quarter of the stools; or straining at defecation at least a quarter of the&#xD;
             time. The above criteria only applied to spontaneous bowel movements, (i.e., not&#xD;
             preceded within a period of 24 hours by the intake of a laxative or use of an enema).&#xD;
             A subject who never had spontaneous bowel movements was considered to be constipated&#xD;
             and therefore eligible for the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Constipation that was functional (i.e., not secondary to other causes);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to fill out own diary and questionnaires;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent, signed by the subject or legally acceptable representative&#xD;
             and by the investigator; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability for follow-up during the trial period, as determined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects in whom constipation was thought to be drug-induced or who were using any&#xD;
             disallowed medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects suffering from secondary causes of chronic constipation. For example:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Endocrine disorders: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; hypopituitarism; hypothyroidism;&#xD;
        hypercalcemia; pseudo-hypoparathyroidism; pheochromocytoma; or glucagon-producing tumors.&#xD;
        Endocrine disorders controlled by appropriate medical therapy were not excluded, with the&#xD;
        exception of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus Metabolic disorders: porphyria; uremia;&#xD;
        hypokalemia; or amyloid neuropathy. Metabolic disorders controlled by appropriate medical&#xD;
        therapy were not excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Exclusion criteria (cont'd): Neurologic disorders: Parkinson's disease; cerebral tumors;&#xD;
        cerebrovascular accidents; multiple sclerosis; meningocele; aganglionosis;&#xD;
        hypoganglionosis; hyperganglionosis; autonomic neuropathy; spinal cord injury; Chagas'&#xD;
        disease; or major depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of megacolon/megarectum or a diagnosis of pseudo-obstruction;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Constipation as a result of surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected organic disorders of the large bowel (i.e., obstruction, carcinoma,&#xD;
             or inflammatory bowel disease). Results of a barium enema with flexible sigmoidoscopy&#xD;
             or of a colonoscopic examination performed within the last 12 months were needed to&#xD;
             rule out organic disorders. An examination performed within the last 3 years was&#xD;
             acceptable, if the examination had been performed for an evaluation of constipation,&#xD;
             if there was no history or evidence of weight loss, anemia, or rectal bleeding, and if&#xD;
             the subject had had three consecutively negative stool occult blood tests at&#xD;
             screening. Subjects with polyps discovered by colonoscopy that were untreated (i.e.,&#xD;
             by polypectomy) were to be excluded;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of severe and clinically uncontrolled cardiovascular, liver or lung disease,&#xD;
             neurologic or psychiatric disorders (including active alcohol or drug abuse);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant cancer within the past 5 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive status or AIDS;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired renal function;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormalities of hematology, urinalysis or blood chemistry;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child-bearing potential without adequate contraceptive protection during&#xD;
             the trial. Oral contraceptives, Depo-Provera®, or Norplant®) must have been used for&#xD;
             at least 3 months prior to randomization. I.U.D.'s, sterilization, or a double-barrier&#xD;
             method were other acceptable methods of birth control;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with an investigational drug in the 30 days preceding the run-in phase of&#xD;
             the trial; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with either R093877 (prucalopride hydrochloride) or R108512&#xD;
             (prucalopride succinate).&#xD;
