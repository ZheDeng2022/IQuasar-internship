  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide when given&#xD;
      together with disulfiram in treating patients with metastatic and progressive melanoma. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as disulfiram and arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the tolerability of disulfiram and arsenic trioxide administration as a&#xD;
      therapeutic combination. (Phase IB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      l. Determine the response rate (complete and partial responses) and time to progression of&#xD;
      previously treated patients with metastatic malignant melanoma when treated with disulfiram&#xD;
      plus Arsenic Trioxide. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive disulfiram orally (PO) twice daily and arsenic trioxide intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 1-2 hours on Monday through Friday, alternating two weeks on treatment followed by two&#xD;
      weeks off treatment. Courses repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

    <measure>Dose Escalation: Identification of Maximum Tolerated Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The dose will be escalated or reduced until a tolerable dose is reached. Dose toleration is determined by the absence of any grade III/IV toxicities. Arsenic trioxide will be administered intravenously at a starting dose of 0.05 mg/kg daily, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks. The patients then have 2 weeks off, followed by two weeks of daily administration. If the initial dose is tolerated, the patient will be dose escalated for the second two weeks of drug administration to 0.10 mg/kg/day for two additional weeks, followed by two weeks off. If the first dose escalation is tolerated, then a second dose escalation will be attempted to 0.15 mg/kg/day, the current dose recommended for leukemia. The 0.15 mg/kg/day dose will be continued for two weeks on alternating with two weeks off as long as this is tolerated to a maximum of 60 doses. For patients developing grade III/IV toxicity at a given dose level, they will be dose reduced by one level and remain on that dose for the trial.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have bidimensionally measurable disease. All measurable lesions must be&#xD;
             assessed (by physical examination, CT scan, radionuclide scan or plain X-ray) within&#xD;
             28 days prior to registration. Non-measurable sites must be assessed within 42 days&#xD;
             prior to registration. The subject's disease status must be completely assessed and&#xD;
             reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must undergo a CT of abdomen and chest within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must undergo either a CT or MRI of the brain within 28 days of&#xD;
             registration. Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastasis are eligible for this&#xD;
             protocol but their metastasis must be clinically stable and asymptomatic. Subjects&#xD;
             with Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis must have been evaluated by neurosurgery&#xD;
             prior to entry to confirm that they are a candidate for this trial. Treatment of&#xD;
             symptomatic CNS metastasis that is required before protocol entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have progressed based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
             (RECIST) criteria after at least one prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy,&#xD;
             biologic/immunotherapy, or a combination regimen) for metastatic disease. This&#xD;
             includes development of any new lesion or a 20% increase in the sum of the subject's&#xD;
             measurable disease compared to their previous nadir. New CNS metastasis could be the&#xD;
             reason for disease progression, but they must be stable clinically and satisfy&#xD;
             criteria delineated in section 5.4. Prior systemic therapy must have been completed at&#xD;
             least 28 days before registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may have received prior biologic or immunotherapy given in an adjuvant&#xD;
             fashion. Prior adjuvant therapy must have been completed at least 28 days prior to&#xD;
             registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may have received prior radiation therapy. If all known sites of disease have&#xD;
             been previously radiated, there must be objective evidence of progression for the&#xD;
             subject to be eligible. Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 28 days&#xD;
             before registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may have received prior surgery. Prior surgery must have been completed at&#xD;
             least 28 days before registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status must be 0-2 according to Southwest Oncology Group Criteria&#xD;
