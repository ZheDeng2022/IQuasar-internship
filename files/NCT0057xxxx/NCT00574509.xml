  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of 131I-anti-B1 Radioimmunotherapy when&#xD;
      combined with high-dose BEAM or BEAC chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. The study will also compare the difference in response rates and time to&#xD;
      treatment failure between historical control patients receiving high-dose BEAM or BEAC&#xD;
      chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant and patients receiving&#xD;
      radioimmunotherapy and high-dose BEAM or BEAC chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant. Patients will receive escalating doses of radioimmunotherapy with anti-B1&#xD;
      radiolabeled with 131Iodine, high-dose carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and Melphalan (BEAM)&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.&#xD;

      Thirty patients will be enrolled in this study. There will be two administrations of&#xD;
      131I-anti-B1 given to patients, the &quot;dosimetric dose&quot; and the &quot;radioimmunotherapy dose&quot;. The&#xD;
      dosimetric dose will consist of an infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 (450 mg) immediately&#xD;
      followed by an infusion of Anti-B1 (35 mg) which has been trace labeled with 5mCi of&#xD;
      131I-anti-B1. The total whole body dosimetry dose is then calculated over an approximated&#xD;
      one-week time interval from the radioactive clearance data obtained by the Whole Body&#xD;
      anterior and posterior gamma camera scans. Based upon dosimetric data calculations specific&#xD;
      for each individual patient, a radioimmunotherapy dose will be given consisting of an&#xD;
      infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 (450 mg)immediately followed by an infusion of 35 mg Anti-B1&#xD;
      including a patient specific dose of 131Iodine-Anti-B1. Calculations will be made such that&#xD;
      in a dose escation study, whole body radiation doses of 30, 45, 60, and 75cGy will result&#xD;
      from the administration of the therapeutic activity of 131I-anti-B1. The amount of the&#xD;
      unlabeled Anti-B1 administered is not calculated on a body surface area basis, but is given&#xD;
      to provide an excess of Anti-B1 independent of tumor burden, splenic uptake, or other causes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pts with a diagnosis of indolent or aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have&#xD;
             failed &gt; 3 prior therapies, or are chemo resistant or refractory. Patients must be&#xD;
             otherwise eligible for high-dose therapy with the BEAM protocol and ABMT or PSCT.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The pre-transplant bone marrow biopsy must show no evidence of marrow involvement if&#xD;
