      The purpose of this study is to find out how people's needs are being met and what people do&#xD;
      about problems with treatment, symptoms, substance use, mental health, and social services.&#xD;
      We are also interested in finding out about changes that people make in their health care&#xD;
      team and the reasons for making those changes.&#xD;

      This is a longitudinal study to examine access to care, perceived quality of life, member&#xD;
      satisfaction and patient-reported outcomes among HIV+ adult Medicaid recipients. Special&#xD;
      Needs Plans represent a new approach to managed care tailored to patients with complicated&#xD;
      medical and psychosocial problems,requiring a high level of service. These plans combine HIV&#xD;
      primary and specialty care, mental health services, substance use treatment, care for&#xD;
      dependent children and social services into a single comprehensive program that also includes&#xD;
      comprehensive case management and other provisions to retain patients in care. Special Needs&#xD;
      Plans represent an alternative to both, Medicaid Fee for Service (FFS) and to mainstream&#xD;
      Medicaid managed care.Seven different Special Needs Plans will be implemented, serving in New&#xD;
      York City and the surrounding suburbs. A separate non-profit corporation administers each&#xD;
      SpecialNeeds Plan. Each plan encompasses a network of hospitals, providers, and&#xD;
      communitybased organizations. Although all plans offer many of the same basic services, they&#xD;
      differ in terms of organization and coordination of care, approaches to case&#xD;
      management,specific program enhancements (e.g., patient education, wellness programs, or&#xD;
      complementary medicine) and special provisions to meet the needs of subgroups of patients&#xD;
      (e.g., women, substance users, young gay men, Latinos). The HIV Special Needs Plans represent&#xD;
      an innovation in health service delivery and financing that is being evaluated as a national&#xD;
      model for Medicaid service delivery by the federal government, including HRSA and HCFA. This&#xD;
      protocol represents a component of that evaluation,from the patients' perspective.This study&#xD;
      is being conducted in collaboration with the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH)&#xD;
      AIDS Institute. As a component of their Quality Management and Improvement Programs, Special&#xD;
      Need Plans have agreed to assist with recruitment of participants to this evaluation. We will&#xD;
      recruit 120 patients sampled from each of the six plans and follow these patients for&#xD;
      initially a year with a possibility of continuing to interview them for up to two years. We&#xD;
      will also recruit a sample of 360 current Medicaid fee for service patients to serve as&#xD;
      comparison group. This sampling strategy will allow us to examine experiences in care and&#xD;
      outcomes for different subgroups of patients within the plans, distinguish the affects of&#xD;
      service differences among the plans and compare different plan enrollees to similar patients&#xD;
      who remain in the Medicaid FFS program. Our longitudinal design will also permit us to&#xD;
      examine prospective influences on comparison group patients' decisions to switch their&#xD;
      coverage from Medicaid FFS to Special Needs Plans.&#xD;

        The NYSDOH AIDS Institute will obtain Case Report Forms from Special Need Plans. and if&#xD;
        they have agreed to receive mail and/or telephone calls regarding the plan they have signed&#xD;
        up for. All patients will be informed at the time they join a Special Needs Plan that they&#xD;
        may be contacted by evaluators working with the NYSDOH AIDS Institute who willwant to ask&#xD;
        them about enrollment and care in the plan. Patients who have not agreed to receive mail&#xD;
        will only be contacted by telephone.At this time, a call will be made to conduct screening&#xD;
        using the Enrollment module and ask the selected Special Needs Plan patient about their&#xD;
        willingness toparticipate in the study.&#xD;
