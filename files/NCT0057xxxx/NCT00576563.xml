      To investigate the evolution of the 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and the tumour&#xD;

      This translational research part is aiming to give more insights in the way radiation injury&#xD;
      and tumour response develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It involves three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Repetitive FDG-PET-CT scans in order to assess early tumour response monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood sampling before, during and after radiotherapy in order to find predictors for&#xD;
           normal tissue injury and for tumour response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Extra staining of tumour biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. FDG-PET-CT scans The FDG-PET-CT scan with i.v. contrast gives information of the tumour&#xD;
      metabolism and its morphology. The pre-treatment max SUV is prognostic as a high value&#xD;
      confers a worse prognosis. Our group showed both in vitro and in vivo that a high FDG uptake&#xD;
      is due to tumour hypoxia. The evolution of the max SUV during radiotherapy may thus be&#xD;
      predictive for the ultimate tumour response. Therefore, two extra FDG-PET-CT scans will be&#xD;
      done during radiotherapy for the group of patients receiving long-term radiochemotherapy: one&#xD;
      at day 7 and one at day 14. This will enable calculation of the max SUV kinetics during&#xD;
      treatment. Tumour response will be determined by FDG-PET-CT scans 3-5 days after the short-&#xD;
      course of radiotherapy or 6-8 weeks after the long- term radiochemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Blood samples Blood collection and processing before, during and after radiotherapy will be&#xD;
      done according to the serum protocol. For performing ELISA's blood samples should be&#xD;
      collected and put in the freezer. The analysis of all blood material will be performed months&#xD;
      to years after collection and re-analysis with regard to the described protein groups may be&#xD;
      necessary depending on the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before radiotherapy, 10 millilitres of blood will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At day 7, day 14 and 6-8 weeks after the end of radiotherapy for the long- term&#xD;
           radiotherapy or 3-5 days after the short - course of radiotherapy,i.e. at the same days&#xD;
           that the FDG-PET-CT scans will be performed, 10 millilitres serum (EDTA tube) will be&#xD;
           taken to investigate the evolution of the proteins during and after treatment, for its&#xD;
           kinetics may be important as predictive factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Extra staining of tumour biopsies The tumour biopsies may be stained with markers for&#xD;
      proliferation (e.g. KI 67), apoptosis (e.g. M30), hypoxia (e.g. HIF, CA 9, Glut 1 and 3) and&#xD;
      others (e.g. EGFR and EGFRvIII), in order to correlate these measurements with response.&#xD;
