      2-month enrollment period and 30-day clinical follow-up.&#xD;

      interventional coronary or peripheral procedures utilizing a 7F arterial puncture in the&#xD;
      common femoral artery. Patients are excluded if they have a previous target artery closure&#xD;
      with any closure device, recent myocardial infarction or thrombolytic therapy, treatment with&#xD;
      thrombin-specific anticoagulants or low molecular weight heparin, fluoroscopically visible&#xD;
      calcium or atherosclerosis ≤ 1 cm of puncture site, or planned target site access ≤ 30 days.&#xD;
