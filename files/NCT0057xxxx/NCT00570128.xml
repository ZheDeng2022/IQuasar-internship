    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether donepezil HCl is effective and safe in&#xD;
      improving cognitive dysfunction exhibited by children and adolescents with Down syndrome&#xD;
      (DS). Effectiveness will be measured by rating communication, daily living skills, and social&#xD;
      skills and relationships in subjects aged 10 to 17.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in V-Scale Composite Score (Sum of 9 Sub-Domains) of Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition-Parent Caregiver Rating Form (VABS-II/PCRF) at Week 10-Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The VABS-II/PCRF instrument was used in this study to assess 3 domains (each with 3 sub-domains): communication (sub-domains: receptive, expressive, and writing), daily living skills (sub-domains: personal, domestic, community), and socialization (sub-domains: interpersonal relationships, play/leisure time, coping skills). Raw scores (2=always present, 1=sometimes present, 0=seldom or never present) rated by the parent/caregiver from each sub-domain were converted to standardized scores called V-scores, which are based on age and a national sample of normal children. Each sub-domain v-scale score ranged from 1 (weakness) to 24 (strength). V-scores for the 9 sub-domains were summed to obtain a composite V-score ranging from 9 to 216. Higher scores indicate a higher level of adaptive functioning. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in adaptive functioning. Composite V-scores have a mean (50th percentile) of 100 and a standard deviation (SD) of 15.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Test of Verbal Expression and Reasoning (TOVER) Total Score at Week 4 and 10-OC</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The TOVER is a participant-performance-based measure of expressive language function and verbal reasoning in response to questions about a series of stylized pictures showing identifiable scenarios. The 64-item test was specifically designed to assess language function in children and adults with down syndrome (DS) across a broad range of functional ability. The test used 23 multi-colored pictures to stimulate verbal responses to questions. The test was short (completed in 15 minutes) and fast-paced (2 to 4 questions per picture). Total score ranging from 0 to 64, was derived from 64 questions, where higher score indicates better functional ability.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in V-Scale Composite Score (Sum of 9 Sub-Domains) of Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition-Parent Caregiver Rating Form (VABS-II/PCRF) at Week 10-Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>The VABS-II/PCRF instrument was used in this study to assess 3 domains (each with 3 sub-domains): communication (sub-domains: receptive, expressive, and writing), daily living skills (sub-domains: personal, domestic, community), and socialization (sub-domains: interpersonal relationships, play/leisure time, coping skills). Raw scores (2=always present, 1=sometimes present, 0=seldom or never present) rated by the parent/caregiver from each sub-domain were converted to standardized scores called V-scores, which are based on age and a national sample of normal children. Each sub-domain v-scale score ranged from 1 (weakness) to 24 (strength). V-scores for the 9 sub-domains were summed to obtain a composite V-score ranging from 9 to 216. Higher scores indicate a higher level of adaptive functioning. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in adaptive functioning. Composite V-scores have a mean (50th percentile) of 100 and a standard deviation (SD) of 15.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in V-Scale Composite Score (Sum of 9 Sub-domains) of Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition-Parent Caregiver Rating Form (VABS-II/PCRF) at Week 4 and 10-Observed Cases (OC)</title>
        <description>The VABS-II/PCRF instrument was used in this study to assess 3 domains (each with 3 sub-domains): communication (sub-domains: receptive, expressive, writing), daily living skills (sub-domains: personal, domestic, community), and socialization (sub-domains: interpersonal relationships, play/leisure time, coping skills). Raw scores (2=always present, 1=sometimes present, 0=seldom or never present) rated by the parent/caregiver from each sub-domain were converted to standardized scores called V-scores, which are based on age and a national sample of normal children. Each sub-domain v-scale score ranged from 1 (weakness) to 24 (strength). V-scores for the 9 sub-domains were summed to obtain a composite V-score ranging from 9 to 216. Higher scores indicate a higher level of adaptive functioning. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in adaptive functioning. Composite V-scores have a mean (50th percentile) of 100 and a SD of 15.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Test of Verbal Expression and Reasoning (TOVER) Total Score at Week 4 and 10-OC</title>
        <description>The TOVER is a participant-performance-based measure of expressive language function and verbal reasoning in response to questions about a series of stylized pictures showing identifiable scenarios. The 64-item test was specifically designed to assess language function in children and adults with down syndrome (DS) across a broad range of functional ability. The test used 23 multi-colored pictures to stimulate verbal responses to questions. The test was short (completed in 15 minutes) and fast-paced (2 to 4 questions per picture). Total score ranging from 0 to 64, was derived from 64 questions, where higher score indicates better functional ability.</description>
