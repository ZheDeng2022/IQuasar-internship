      1. Purpose - A feasibility study to determine the accuracy of using skin markings as a&#xD;
           surrogate for the underlying surgical cavity (SC) in accelerated partial breast&#xD;
           irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis - Markings placed on the skin are an accurate representation of the&#xD;
           underlying surgical cavity and are adequate to use for patient setup for accelerated&#xD;
           partial breast irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification Breast conserving surgery with the use of whole breast radiation after&#xD;
           partial mastectomy is the preferred treatment for most women with early stage breast&#xD;
           cancer. Conventional radiotherapy in this setting delivers radiation to the entire&#xD;
           breast, with the consequence that the radiotherapy has to be given over a period of 3 -&#xD;
           6 weeks. However, the majority (70 - 80%) of local recurrences after breast conserving&#xD;
           surgery develop in the vicinity of the primary tumor. Partial breast irradiation with&#xD;
           the radiation target volume limited to the surgical cavity (SC) in selected patients is&#xD;
           therefore potentially feasible if it results in similar local control rates compared to&#xD;
           whole breast irradiation. In addition to limiting the radiation to breast tissue most&#xD;
           likely to harbor microscopic disease and thereby sparing the normal breast tissue, local&#xD;
           breast irradiation offers the distinct advantage of shortening the duration of&#xD;
           radiotherapy, thereby minimizing the impact radiotherapy has on the quality of life of&#xD;
           breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The current technique for accelerated partial breast irradiation assumes that the&#xD;
           cutaneous markers correctly reflect the position of the underlying SC without strong&#xD;
           evidence that the relationship between the two does not change. Our study will provide&#xD;
           the crucial missing link. Phase II of our study (not included in this REB application)&#xD;
           will go further in exploring the use of new imaging modalities in reducing the PTV&#xD;
           margins thereby enabling oncologists to better spare normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The primary objective is to determine whether skin markings truly reflect the surgical&#xD;
           cavity location during daily treatment by quantifying any change in relationship between&#xD;
           the skin markings &amp; the surgical cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objective is to investigate the dosimetric consequences of the change in&#xD;
           size, shape, and location of the surgical cavity volume (SCV) during the treatment&#xD;
           duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methods (for details see the attached protocol) To determine whether skin markings truly&#xD;
           reflect the surgical cavity location during daily APBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, for Stage 1 of the study, 20 breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy&#xD;
      after breast conserving surgery with a visible SC (cavity visualization score 3 - 5) will be&#xD;
      recruited. Skin markers will be placed on the skin around the SC during CT simulation in the&#xD;
      manner specified in the RAPID trial. During the first week of their treatment, patients will&#xD;
      return to the CT scanner on days 1 and 5 to undergo repeat planning CT. The patients will be&#xD;
      set up simulating the actual treatment set up at the linear accelerator. These repeat scans&#xD;
      will be compared with the original scan to identify any change in the relationship between&#xD;
      the skin markings and the SC. Five oncologists trained in SC identification will then contour&#xD;
      the SC on the original as well as the repeat CT scans. These images will be fused for each CT&#xD;
      scan to form a representative SC volume (RSCV). The RSCV in planning and subsequent CTs will&#xD;
      be related to skin marks to evaluate the reliability of patient positioning. Using these skin&#xD;
      marks the beams will be placed on the patient in the CT simulation software package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The centre of mass (COM) from RSCV will be determined from the contours and variations in&#xD;
      x,y, and z coordinates will be averaged. This will allow a comparison between what was&#xD;
      planned originally and what has changed over time. Coordinates of previously placed skin&#xD;
      markers on the breast surface will be calculated relative to the COM as well as medial and&#xD;
      lateral tattoos. This will enable us to verify if setup to external skin marks track the&#xD;
      RSCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosimetric consequences of SCV changes in shape/size/location will be quantified as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Repeat CTs with drawn RSCVs will be exported to the planning system and planning fields&#xD;
           will be applied to calculate dose distributions in target volumes and organs at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) for CTV, PTV and organs at risk, as defined from CT will be&#xD;
           evaluated for meeting planning criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The procedure will be repeated with simulated patient realignment using CT data sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Appropriate PTV margins to achieve desired CTV coverage will be calculated for both the&#xD;
           situations, with and without simulated realignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Statistical Analysis Sample Size: For Stage I, 20 patients can be successfully accrued in&#xD;
      6 months at the Fraser Valley Cancer Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between skin marks and surgical cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The centre of mass (COM) from RSCV will be determined and the mean variations in x,y, and z&#xD;
      coordinates will be calculated. In addition, the mean and standard deviation of the change in&#xD;
      volume of the RSCV will be calculated. The movement of the COM coordinates will be calculated&#xD;
      in reference to both the tattoos and the point guards separately. A paired t-test will be&#xD;
      used to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference in mean COM movement&#xD;
      in reference to the tattoos and centre spots. This will allow us to verify if setup to&#xD;
      external skin marks (tattoos and point guards respectively) track the RSCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DVH comparison&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosimetric consequences of changes in shape, size, and location of the RSCV will be&#xD;
      quantified through analysis of DVHs (see section 7.5.). Descriptive statistics will be used&#xD;
      to present the change in DVH for target volumes (CTV, PTV, and DEV) and OAR that occurred&#xD;
      between the initial simulated plan and the 5 additional simulated plans (see sections 7.2&#xD;
      through 7.5). Furthermore, this will be repeated for the plans that have undergone simulated&#xD;
      realignment. A paired t-test will be used to assess whether there is a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference in mean change in DVH (for target volumes and OAR) before and after&#xD;
      simulated realignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential decrease in CTV to PTV margin&#xD;
&#xD;
      The margin required on the CTV to create a PTV which ensures it is adequately covered, will&#xD;
      be obtained using the DVH criteria in Table 2. Subsequently, this will be repeated for the&#xD;
      plans that have undergone simulated realignment. A paired t-test will be used to assess&#xD;
      whether there is a statistically significant difference in mean change in the CTV margin&#xD;
      needed before and after simulated realignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulated patient realignment compensates for a portion of the CTV to PTV margin (the size,&#xD;
      shape and position of the RSCV) while still leaving some uncertainty (e.g., patient&#xD;
      respiration, daily setup). Therefore it is hypothesized that we can decrease the PTV needed&#xD;
      with simulated realignment. We will consider a decrease in the PTV margin by â‰¥ 3 mm with&#xD;
      simulated patient realignment justification for progression to Stage II of this study.&#xD;
