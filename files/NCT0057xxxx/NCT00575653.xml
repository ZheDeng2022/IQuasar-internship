    <textblock>
      We are conducting a large, record-based study to assess the risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome&#xD;
      (GBS), a serious demyelinating disease, following immunization with the tetravalent&#xD;
      meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Menactra) that is currently recommended for all adolescents.&#xD;
      The study was requested by CDC and FDA because of an unexpected number of case reports to the&#xD;
      CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was designed by the investigators, with input from FDA, CDC, and the&#xD;
      vaccine's manufacturer, Sanofi-Pasteur. An external advisory board that includes CDC&#xD;
      representation, provides input regarding important decisions. The manufacturer is not&#xD;
      participating in the conduct of the study and has no control over the analysis or&#xD;
      dissemination of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is derived from five large US health plans with a total membership of approximately&#xD;
      50 million over the study time period. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) serves as&#xD;
      liaison between the health plans and the Coordinating Center at the Department of Ambulatory&#xD;
      Care and Prevention of Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and is the&#xD;
      contracting organization with the health plans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through a partnership that uses the data and other resources of three national and two&#xD;
      regional health plans and insurers, we are conducting a multi-site retrospective study of the&#xD;
      relationship between immunization with tetravalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) and&#xD;
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in adolescents (ages 11-21 years of age) over the 42-month&#xD;
      period of March 1, 2005 to August 31, 2008. This collaboration has several features of a&#xD;
      distributed data network, and so provides an instructive example of the feasibility of large&#xD;
      scale population-based post-market evidence development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants include five research organizations that are either part of, or closely&#xD;
      affiliated with, a health plan or insurer: HealthCore Inc. (affiliated with WellPoint),&#xD;
      Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Pennsylvania, i3 Drug Safety, Aetna, Inc., and Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente Center for Health Research of Hawaii. There is a coordinating center at the&#xD;
      Harvard Medical School Department of Ambulatory Care and Prevention at Harvard Pilgrim Health&#xD;
      Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organizations provide coverage for approximately 80 million individuals (all ages), of&#xD;
      whom the information for approximately 50 million will be available for analysis. Each&#xD;
      organization provides scientific, informatics, and management expertise regarding its own&#xD;
      population and data, and the overall design and conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective study uses a hybrid design with three analytic components: 1)&#xD;
      characterization of the entire cohort with regard to demographics, eligible time under&#xD;
      observation, immunization status, incidence rates of GBS during various categories of person&#xD;
      time (never immunized, before immunization, during the 42 days after immunization, etc.), and&#xD;
      comorbidities and other covariates, 2) a nested case-control study assessing risk associated&#xD;
      with immunization, and 3) a self-controlled case series assessing immunization associated&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites will use programs distributed by the coordinating center to compute incidence rates of&#xD;
      GBS according to age, sex, season, and MCV4 vaccination status among the full base population&#xD;
      (health plan enrollees who meet age and cohort eligibility criteria). Additionally,&#xD;
      vaccination rates for MCV4 according to age, sex, and calendar year will be computed among&#xD;
      all cohort members. Incidence rates of GBS provided by these analyses will be used to&#xD;
      calculate the attributable risk of GBS following MCV4 vaccination should a significant&#xD;
      relationship be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested case control analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nested case-control analysis utilizing pooled analytic datasets from all sites will be used&#xD;
      to estimate the risk of GBS during the 42 days after MCV4 vaccination relative to the risk of&#xD;
      GBS among vaccines and non-vaccinees at other times (the study's primary objective), adjusted&#xD;
      for age, sex, and other vaccinations among 11-&lt;19 year olds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential cases of GBS among the cohort members will be identified, and a sample of 100&#xD;
      non-cases from the same risk set as each case will be randomly selected and matched on age,&#xD;
      sex, and state of residence. Their vaccination histories and other covariates will be&#xD;
      included in analytic datasets to be transferred to the coordinating center for pooled&#xD;
      multivariate analysis. Covariates will be estimated as of an index date assigned within each&#xD;
      case-control set which is the date of GBS onset for the associated case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relative risk of GBS associated with MCV4 vaccination will be estimated using conditional&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis in SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dependent variable: GBS case status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main independent variable: Analysis A: MCV4 vaccination in 1-42 days prior to index&#xD;
           date; Analysis B: MCV4 vaccination in 1-7, 8-14, 15-28, 29-42 days prior to index date&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matching factors: Age; sex; study site; state of residence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other covariates: Exposure to Tdap, Td, Hepatitis B, HPV, tetanus, and influenza vaccine&#xD;
           during the 42 days prior to the GBS onset date; exposure to MPSV4 vaccine during the 42&#xD;
           days prior to the GBS onset date(separate model from model with MCV4 exposure)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also will assess the potential effect modification between the different vaccines, and&#xD;
      according to age, season, and geographic region, through stratified analysis and the testing&#xD;
      of interaction terms within the conditional logistic regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Control Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional case-series analysis (to be referred to as &quot;Analysis C&quot;) will be performed&#xD;
      among the subset of adjudicated GBS cases with prior MCV4 vaccination. Date of MCV4&#xD;
      vaccination will serve as the index date for each patient. The relative incidence rate of GBS&#xD;
      during a &quot;control&quot; period of 43 or more days following vaccination will be compared to the&#xD;
      incidence during the &quot;exposed&quot; risk window of 1-42 days following vaccination using log&#xD;
      linear modeling with terms for the exposed and control periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dependent variable: Time to GBS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main independent variable: Analysis C: Time period 1-42 days post vaccination compared&#xD;
           with 43 or more days post vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other covariates (to be included as sample size permits): Time periods corresponding to&#xD;
           1-42 days following each of: Tdap, Td, Hepatitis B, HPV, tetanus, and influenza&#xD;
           vaccinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also will assess the potential effect modification between the different vaccines, and&#xD;
      according to age, season, geographic region, and race/ethnicity, through stratified analysis&#xD;
      and the testing of interaction terms within the log linear model, as sample size permits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis C will be performed once at the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBS Case Descriptive Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several additional secondary objectives will be addressed from evaluation of GBS cases based&#xD;
      on review of abstracted information from their medical charts, and administrative claims&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases of GBS identified among cohort members 19-&lt;22 years old will be identified from&#xD;
      administrative claims data, and adjudicated through review of abstracted medical record&#xD;
      information in a manner equivalent to that for cohort members 11-&lt;19 years old. These cases&#xD;
      will be quantified, and their clinical presentation described and compared with that of cases&#xD;
      among 11-&lt;19 year olds, with regard to at least the following factors: proportion of cases&#xD;
      classified as definite GBS cases, severity of illness as measured by mortality,&#xD;
      hospitalization for GBS, total duration of hospitalizations in days, mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      required, total number of days of mechanical ventilation, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy,&#xD;
      plasmapheresis, and immunosuppressive therapy. Similar comparisons will be made regarding the&#xD;
      clinical presentation of GBS among MCV4 vaccinees compared to non-vaccinees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of GBS cases with history of each of the other vaccines included in the study in&#xD;
      the 42 days prior to GBS onset will also be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A line list will be created for all potential cases of GBS. For adjudicated cases of GBS, the&#xD;
      listing will indicate the final case status, elements of the case definition that were and&#xD;
      were not met, immunization status (MCV4, MPSV4, Tdap, Td, HepB, HPV, tetanus, and influenza)&#xD;
      and indicators of infection or febrile illness in the prior 42 days, gender, age, month and&#xD;
      year of GBS onset, and a brief description of disease severity. Additional line lists will be&#xD;
      created for censored cases (adjudicated non-cases) that include the reason for censoring, and&#xD;
      for potential cases for which charts could not be obtained or insufficient information was&#xD;
      obtained from the chart to adjudicate case status.&#xD;
