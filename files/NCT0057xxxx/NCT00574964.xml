  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if combining all three treatments of&#xD;
      Gliadel wafers, Temozolomide and Radiation therapy at the same time is safe and more&#xD;
      effective than one treatment at a time. The study will measure the survival of subjects&#xD;
      treated with this combination of drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive surgery + Gliadel® wafer implantation + Limited Field Radiation Therapy&#xD;
      to a dose of 61.2 Gy with concomitant daily temozolomide. Up to 8 wafers will be implanted&#xD;
      into the tumor resection cavity (depending upon its size) after maximal tumor resection.&#xD;
      Between days 10 and 30 all subjects will begin a standard course of post-operative limited&#xD;
      field radiation therapy to the tumor site and a surrounding margin, with concomitant daily&#xD;
      temozolomide (75mg/m2 x 7 d/wk for 6 weeks, concomitant chemoradiotherapy phase). Beginning&#xD;
      no later than 45 days following completion of radiation, temozolomide will be given at a&#xD;
      dosage of 200 mg/m2 daily for five days on a 28 day schedule, for a total of 6 cycles&#xD;
      (adjuvant chemotherapy phase). Subjects will be monitored weekly during chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      with CBC with differential and brief clinical assessment, and monthly during the adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy phase. Toxicity reports will be assessed every three months. Dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLT) are defined in section 4.2. If toxic events unresponsive to planned dose&#xD;
      modification exceed 20% of enrolled subjects the stopping rule will be met and the study will&#xD;
      be discontinued. MRIs will be obtained no more than 72 hours post-op, and then prior to the&#xD;
      first, third, and fifth cycles of monthly temozolomide. Additionally, a stealth MRI or CT&#xD;
      scan (with or without contrast) will be done one week prior to radiotherapy for treatment&#xD;
      planning at the discretion of the treating Radiation Oncologist. Following completion of the&#xD;
      entire course of treatment subjects will be monitored clinically as well as with MRI every 3&#xD;
      months for survival and evidence of progression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have findings on neuroimaging studies and clinical evaluation consistent&#xD;
             with the diagnosis of a primary brain tumor in order to be offered enrollment in the&#xD;
             study. Subsequently, in order to remain on study, they must have histologically or&#xD;
             cytologically confirmed primary tumor of the brain. Intra-operative confirmation of&#xD;
             histology (i.e. frozen section assessment or equivalent) is required for all subjects.&#xD;
             Gliadel wafers will not be implanted without positive intraoperative histopathology&#xD;
             consistent with a primary tumor of the brain. The final classification and&#xD;
             evaluability determination will be made based on post-operative histological reports&#xD;
             showing anaplastic astrocytoma or Glioblastoma multiforme. No central pathology review&#xD;
             will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed supratentorial primary brain lesion as visualized on enhanced MRI scan&#xD;
             (or CT scan with contrast for subjects who cannot undergo MRI) that is appropriate for&#xD;
             surgical resection and implantation of Gliadel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All eligible subjects will undergo surgical resection. After resection, if there is&#xD;
             communication of the resection cavity with the ventricular spaces preventing the use&#xD;
             of Gliadel® the subject leaves the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI or CT with and without contrast within 30 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New diagnosis of primary brain tumor is required. No prior therapy, including previous&#xD;
             radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or operation is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years and older, since the rationale for this therapy was established in&#xD;
             adults, and the tumor uncommon in children, so that no useful information is likely to&#xD;
             emerge from their inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status greater than or equal to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WBC greater than or equal 2,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 125,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PT / PTT within 1.5 X upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  BUN less than or equal to 40 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evaluation of cardiac and pulmonary functions consistent with adequate&#xD;
             tolerance of surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test (beta HCG) if a female of childbearing age and not surgically&#xD;
             sterilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of BCNU (the active ingredient in the Gliadel wafer) with concomitant&#xD;
             Temozolomide on the developing human fetus are unknown. BCNU is known to cause fetal&#xD;
             harm if administered to a pregnant woman and is a pregnancy risk factor D.&#xD;
             Temozolomide May cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Animal studies,&#xD;
             at doses less than used in humans, resulted in numerous birth defects. Testicular&#xD;
             toxicity was demonstrated in animal studies using smaller doses than recommended for&#xD;
             cancer treatment. Temozolomide is also a pregnancy risk factor D. Radiation therapy is&#xD;
             known to be both mutagenic and teratogenic. For this reason, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, or if her partner is participating in this trial, she&#xD;
             should inform the treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to BCNU (carmustine) or other components of the&#xD;
             Gliadel® wafer such as polifeprosan polymer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the surgeon determines that placement of Gliadel wafers is inappropriate, or if the&#xD;
             final diagnosis is other than anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma, the subject will&#xD;
             leave the study and not be further analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy at any time for this diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject will be considered unresectable preoperatively if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             neurosurgeon, the subject is not a candidate for maximal cytoreductive surgery, (i.e.,&#xD;
             crosses the midline, continuous with the ventricular space). Such subjects will not be&#xD;
             eligible for treatment on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of prior central nervous system tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of systemic cancer requiring treatment within the past five years (except&#xD;
             for non-melanotic carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Open communication of the resection cavity with the ventricular system that prevents&#xD;
             insertion of Gliadel or tumors that cross the midline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Posterior fossa or brain stem tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent severe medical illness (e.g., active infection, acute hepatitis, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             uncontrolled seizures, pulmonary insufficiency, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolus,&#xD;
             etc) or psychiatric illness, or abnormal laboratory values that preclude surgical&#xD;
             candidacy or limits expected survival to less than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because BCNU and/or Temozolomide are&#xD;
             pregnancy risk D pharmaceutical agents with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BCNU and/or&#xD;
             Temozolomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             either of these agents. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive subjects receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with BCNU or other agents administered during the study.&#xD;
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects receiving combination&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
