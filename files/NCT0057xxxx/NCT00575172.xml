    <textblock>
      For the purpose of comparing efficacy of intensive therapy between 1) ultrarapid-acting type&#xD;
      insulin (insulin aspart) and 2) conventional rapid-acting type insulin (R), a Multicenter&#xD;
      Open Label Randomized Controlled Trial was planned in Japan using the occurrence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes, a high risk factor, as an index.&#xD;

      A survey shows that the most frequently observed direct cause of death in diabetic patients&#xD;
      is cardiovascular disorder. However, investigations and surveys such as DCCT, UKPDS and&#xD;
      KUMAMOTO-study, etc. clarified that strict control of blood sugar level prevented development&#xD;
      and progress of diabetic microangiopathy, but could not show a significant effect on great&#xD;
      vessel disorder. Recently, the DECODA-study, DECODE-study and Honolulu-study have&#xD;
      demonstrated that postprandial high blood sugar is involved in great vessel disorder.&#xD;
      Therefore, possible prevention of great vessel disorder in diabetic patients is suggested by&#xD;
      improving the postprandial blood sugar level as achieved using ultrarapid-acting type&#xD;
      insulin, which has become available recently. Even with results in Europe and the US&#xD;
      obtained, the life-style and incidence of complications in Japanese people are different, and&#xD;
      there are many points that remain uncertain with respect to the direct application of foreign&#xD;
      results to Japanese people. Therefore, in Japan also, it is necessary to conduct a&#xD;
      large-scale clinical study and to establish high-level evidence using mainly Japanese people&#xD;
      through hospitals having many patients.&#xD;
