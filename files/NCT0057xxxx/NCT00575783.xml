      The research study is designed to examine the impact of low blood sugar on brain function in&#xD;
      individuals with Type 1 Diabetes who have frequent and severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)&#xD;
      compared to those who do not.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the course of treating diabetes (for example, after an insulin injection), blood sugar&#xD;
      levels will sometimes drop too low. This condition is known as hypoglycemia. Normally, a&#xD;
      healthy body responds to hypoglycemia by producing a number of &quot;anti-insulin&quot; hormones which&#xD;
      raise blood sugar levels. In addition, these hormones provide the individual with warning&#xD;
      signals of hypoglycemia, including hunger, sweating, shaking and heart palpitations. These&#xD;
      warning signals allow diabetics to correct low blood sugar levels by eating sugar tablets or&#xD;
      by having a snack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, and for unclear reasons, many people with longstanding diabetes lose their&#xD;
      ability to recognize low blood sugar levels-a condition called &quot;hypoglycemia unawareness.&quot;&#xD;
      The brain, in particular, is extremely sensitive to hypoglycemia. Unable to sense and respond&#xD;
      to low blood sugar levels, these individuals may experience a sudden onset of blurred vision,&#xD;
      confusion, seizures, coma, or even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, a new technique called &quot;islet cell transplantation&quot; has been developed as an&#xD;
      alternate means of treating insulin-dependent diabetes. Pancreatic islet cells (the cells&#xD;
      that produce insulin), from human donors, are injected into the diabetic patient's liver&#xD;
      where the cells are capable of making insulin and can regulate blood sugar levels without the&#xD;
      need for insulin injections. Currently, this technique is used primarily in patients with&#xD;
      severe hypoglycemia unawareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is known that islet cell transplantation can reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia,&#xD;
      the effects of transplantation on hypoglycemia unawareness are unknown. This study is&#xD;
      designed to investigate why hypoglycemia unawareness happens and the impact it has on brain&#xD;
      function in individuals with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
