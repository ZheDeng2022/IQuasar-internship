      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light to&#xD;
      create pictures of living tissues and has been successfully used to generate high resolution&#xD;
      cross-sectional images of tissue in the human eye and skin. OCT systems are now commercially&#xD;
      available for eye and skin use, and several clinical reports on the use of OCT in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract have been published as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to develop a high-speed noninvasive OCT probe which can be&#xD;
      placed through an endoscope for the early diagnosis of pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions in&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract. This is a pilot clinical research study that is designed to&#xD;
      advance OCT technology, which may in the future be able to replace or augment endoscopic&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;

      Protocol Summary The long term objective of the proposed research is to develop a high-speed&#xD;
      noninvasive endoscopic functional optical coherence tomography (F-OCT) device using&#xD;
      microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology for early diagnosis of tumors or lesions in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design All patients undergoing endoscopy at UCIMC CDDC and who meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be candidates for enrollment in the protocol. Signed informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of Care Procedure The patients will undergo the standard of care endoscopy.&#xD;
      Endoscopy is performed on a routine basis with conscious sedation or general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Digital images and video clips of the areas of interest will be captured in the usual&#xD;
      standard of care fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedure The OCT probe will then be inserted through the biopsy channel of the&#xD;
      endoscope into the GI tract lumen and OCT images will be acquired of the lesions just prior&#xD;
      to biopsies (research procedure). In addition, OCT images will be taken of the surrounding&#xD;
      normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint The OCT images will be correlated to the specific biopsy site and biopsy&#xD;
      number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT Device and Probe Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging imaging modality that&#xD;
      uses light to image turbid media such as living tissues, and has been successfully used to&#xD;
      generate high resolution (~10 micron) cross-sectional images of tissue microstructure in the&#xD;
      human retina and skin. OCT devices are now commercially available for ophthalmic and&#xD;
      dermatologic use, and several clinical reports on the use of OCT in the vascular system and&#xD;
      aerodigestive tract have been published as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OCT device is an optical imaging instrument that combines a broadband low power near&#xD;
      infrared light source (non-laser) with an interferometer to produce cross-sectional optical&#xD;
      images of tissue to depths of 1-2 mm. OCT is already used commercially to image the retina&#xD;
      and skin. This study focuses on a device designed specifically for the aerodigestive tract.&#xD;
      The OCT probe has been designed to fit through the biopsy channel of standard endoscopes. The&#xD;
      probes are designed with three different types of mechanism. (1) The first mechanism consists&#xD;
      of a fiber optic with a micro lens and prism attached at the end to direct the light to and&#xD;
      from the tissue sample. Scanning is achieved by moving the fiber optic along its axis using a&#xD;
      linear motor. Longitudinal OCT imaging can be realized with this mechanism. Similar probes&#xD;
      are already used in our laryngoscopic OCT study. (2) The second mechanism is achieved by a&#xD;
      rotational MEMS motor, on which an angled mirror is attached to direct the light to the side.&#xD;
      Rotational imaging can be realized with this mechanism. (3) The third mechanism is based on&#xD;
      the silicon MEMS technology. The scanner is created with a polysilicon micromirror driven by&#xD;
      high frequency, thick single crystal silicon comb drives. The high speed scanning probe is&#xD;
      with large scan angles, excellent optical properties, high precision, and long-term&#xD;
      reliability. The overall cross-sectional diameter is approximately 3 mm to be able to fit&#xD;
      into the biopsy channel of the endoscope. The OCT device will focus the incident&#xD;
      low-coherence light onto the tissue and collect backscattered coherent photons. The&#xD;
      endoscopists can then obtain cross sectional optical images of the tissue through arbitrary&#xD;
      planes of section.&#xD;

        resection (EMR) 2) patients with early esophageal or gastric cancer who are undergoing&#xD;
        confirmatory endoscopy with biopsy or 3) patients with intestinal metaplasia with or&#xD;
