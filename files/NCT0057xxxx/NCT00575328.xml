  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether Maca Root is effective for treating&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction in females that is caused by the treatment for bipolar disorder. An&#xD;
      additional aim of the study is to document the safety and tolerability of maca root, as well&#xD;
      as any potential side effects that it causes. We suspect that Maca Root will result in a&#xD;
      significant reduction in sexual dysfunction when compared to a placebo group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to enroll 80 patients with sexual dysfunction associated with their bipolar&#xD;
      medication regimen over 24 months. Subjects were outpatient females between 18 and 80 years&#xD;
      old with no significant symptoms of mania (Young Mania Rating Scale score&lt;10), and who have&#xD;
      been on a steady regimen of medications to treat bipolar disorder for at least 8 weeks, with&#xD;
      a stable dose for at least 4 weeks. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a double blind&#xD;
      manner to receive 3000 mg/day of maca root or identical placebo for 12 weeks to determine&#xD;
      whether maca root is more effective than placebo for the treatment of sexual dysfunction&#xD;
      associated with treatment regimens for bipolar disorder.&#xD;

    <description>The ASEX scale consists of five items rating sexual drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach orgasm, and satisfaction from orgasm. The range of total score is from 5-30, with the higher scores indicating greater sexual dysfunction. Scores were obtained at baseline and at all biweekly assessment visits over the 12 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Biweekly from Baseline (week zero) to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is composed of five items evaluating libido, sexual arousal or excitement, ability to achieve orgasm, ability to achieve and maintain an erection (for men only) and overall sexual satisfaction. Items are rated on a scale of 1 to 6 with a rating of 1 indicating greater than normal functioning and a rating of 6 indicating totally absent functioning. Possible total scores range from 5-30, with higher scores indicating greater pathology. Scores were obtained at baseline and at each biweekly assessment visit over 12 weeks of treatment.</description>

          <title>Hamilton D-17 score</title>
          <description>The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) is a structured interview completed by the clinician based on assessment of patient's depressive symptoms. It quantifies degree and severity of depression. Higher scores indicate greater pathology. Possible range of scores is from zero (no symptoms) to 52 (very severe symptoms). Scores of 10 or less are considered to have no significant depression (11-15=mild, 16-22=moderate, &gt;23= severe). For entry, subjects were required to have a score of less than 10.</description>

          <title>Young Mania Rating Scale score</title>
          <description>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) has 11 items to assess severity of mania in patients with bipolar disorder. The items in this scale reflect core symptoms of the manic phase of bipolar disorder. YMRS total score ranges from 0 to 60; higher scores indicate more severe mania, thus, a negative change (or decrease) from baseline indicates a reduction in manic symptoms. Total score ≤12 indicates remission (13-19=minimal symptoms; 20-25=mild mania, 26-37=moderate mania, 38-60=severe mania). Scores &lt;10 are considered fully euthymic. For entry, subjects were required to have a score of less than 10.</description>
