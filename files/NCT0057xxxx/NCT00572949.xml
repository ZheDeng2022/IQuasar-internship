      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a better way of diagnosing heart artery&#xD;
      disease, heart attack and damage to the heart muscle early on. Currently, it often takes&#xD;
      several hours after admission before lab tests will show that there has been any damage to&#xD;
      the heart muscle. Although the standard electrocardiogram is quick and non-painful it may&#xD;
      miss many cases of significant coronary heart disease. The investigators are proposing that a&#xD;
      new entirely non-contact tool, the Magnetocardiograph (MCG), with high accuracy is able to&#xD;
      predict the presence of significant coronary heart disease early on before other studies&#xD;
      become positive. The investigators hope by this that the investigators can develop an&#xD;
      algorithm for better triage and management of patients with chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is designed to test the effectiveness of the investigational use of the&#xD;
      Magnetocardiograph (MCG) that has been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA). While the MCG used in the study is FDA-approved as a tool for the non-contact&#xD;
      measurement and display of the magnetic fields of the heart generated by the electrical&#xD;
      currents, it is not yet approved for the specific diagnosis of heart artery disease&#xD;
      (ischemia).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiomagnetism refers to the detection, analysis and interpretation of the magnetic fields&#xD;
      generated by the electrical activity of the heart. The peak value of the magnetic fields of&#xD;
      the heart is more than a million times smaller than the Earth's magnetic field. A major&#xD;
      breakthrough in the capability of measuring such small fields came with the invention of the&#xD;
      SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) in the late sixties. The first&#xD;
      magnetocardiograms (MCGs) measured with the SQUID were recorded by Cohen et al. in 1970 (1).&#xD;
      These earlier measurements were performed in very expensive magnetically shielded rooms,&#xD;
      initially utilizing only one or two SQUID probes. In the eighties this technology was tested&#xD;
      in several laboratories creating a magnetic field map by moving one SQUID sequentially above&#xD;
      the chest to create an image of the whole hearts magnetic field. These maps were then&#xD;
      attempted correlated with various pathologies (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then the technology has been greatly improved and several multichannel machines are in&#xD;
      use across the world for research purpose for arrhythmia localization and ischemia detection.&#xD;
      However, at present time, only one company (CardioMag Imaging) has developed a machine that&#xD;
      operates outside a shielded room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CardiomagImaging (CMI) Magnetocardiograph (MCG) is capable of noninvasive recording of&#xD;
      magnetic fields arising from the electrical activity of the heart with very high spatial and&#xD;
      temporal resolution. The temporal trace of the MCG is analogous to an ECG, and, similarly,&#xD;
      can be recorded in multiple leads. This MCG device has been specifically developed for the&#xD;
      general purpose (outside shielded room) of non-contact, non-invasive diagnostics of ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CMI MCG device has been approved as safe for patients. It is FDA approved for the&#xD;
      noninvasive detection and display of the heart's magnetic field created by the electrical&#xD;
      currents, and is awaiting FDA approval for the detection of ischemia in chest pain patients.&#xD;
      A similar SQUID technology utilized in magnetically shielded rooms has already been FDA&#xD;
      approved for localization of epileptic focus. When utilized in this matter it is referred to&#xD;
      as MEG (magnetoencephalogram).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several abstracts have been presented primarily at meetings on Biomagnetism, that confirm the&#xD;
      safety and indicate the efficacy of the MCG for the detection of ischemia. In particular, it&#xD;
      has been suggested that the resting MCG is capable of detecting ischemia in patients with&#xD;
      chest pain, when the 12-leads ECG is normal (4,5,6). However, this has not been tested in&#xD;
      larger prospective blinded studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Non-invasive Cardiac Laboratory will be the first center in the&#xD;
      US evaluating the CardioMag Imaging MCG in a clinical environment for the detection of&#xD;
      ischemia in an acute coronary syndrome patient population. Patients will be enrolled in a&#xD;
      similar protocol at Johns Hopkins Medical Center, Baltimore, Mayo clinic, Rochester, and at&#xD;
      Klinikum Hoyerswerda, Germany. The early detection of ischemia (before Troponins become&#xD;
      positive) with high negative and positive predictive values may prove cost effective and&#xD;
      decrease risk by improving prompt treatment and triage to higher or lower grade monitoring at&#xD;
      time of hospitalization.&#xD;
