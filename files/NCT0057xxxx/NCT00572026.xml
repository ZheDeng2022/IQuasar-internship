      Among children, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk for accidents, especially bicycle and pedestrian (Leibson 2001; Jensen 1988;&#xD;
      DiScala 1998). Anywhere from 40% to 80% of children diagnosed with ADHD continue to display&#xD;
      symptoms of the disorder into adolescence(Barkley 1990; Gittelman 1985). Adolescents with&#xD;
      ADHD are also at an increased risk for driving-related accidents, being 2 to 4 times more&#xD;
      likely to experience a motor vehicle accident (Barkley 1993; Barkley 1996; Cox 2000), 4 times&#xD;
      as likely to be at fault in the accident (Barkley 1993), and over 3 times more likely to&#xD;
      incur associated injuries as a result of the accident(Murphy 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulant treatment with immediate-release methylphenidate (IR MPH) has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      improve driving performance in adolescents with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be Tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main study: Just as stimulant medication improves simulation and on-road driving&#xD;
           performance of ADHD teenagers, it is hypothesized that stimulant medication will improve&#xD;
           routine driving performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Substudy - Extended wear (15 hours) of Daytrana will lead to safer driving late in the&#xD;
           evening (22:00 and 01:00), when the most dangerous driving mishaps are most likely to&#xD;
           occur, and the next morning at 09:00.&#xD;

      Driving collisions are the leading cause of death among adolescents, accounting for 15&#xD;
      teenage deaths per day in the United States. (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#xD;
      2003). Driving fatalities are significantly more likely to occur when distracting teenage&#xD;
      passengers are in the automobile(Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 2000). Fatalities are&#xD;
      also more likely to occur in the evenings, on the weekends, and during the summer months&#xD;
      (National Center for Statistics and Analysis 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among children, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk for accidents, especially bicycle and pedestrian (Leibson 2001; Jensen 1988;&#xD;
      DiScala 1998). Anywhere from 40% to 80% of children diagnosed with ADHD continue to display&#xD;
      symptoms of the disorder into adolescence(Barkley 1990; Gittelman 1985). Adolescents with&#xD;
      ADHD are also at an increased risk for driving-related accidents, being 2 to 4 times more&#xD;
      likely to experience a motor vehicle accident (Barkley 1993; Barkley 1996; Cox 2000), 4 times&#xD;
      as likely to be at fault in the accident (Barkley 1993), and over 3 times more likely to&#xD;
      incur associated injuries as a result of the accident(Murphy 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulant treatment with immediate-release methylphenidate (IR MPH) has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      improve driving performance in adolescents with ADHD. Simulated driving performance was&#xD;
      assessed 1.5 to 2 hours post-dose in a double-blind, crossover study comparing the effects of&#xD;
      one 10-mg dose of immediate-release methylphenidate (IR MPH) with placebo in male subjects&#xD;
      with ADHD (aged 19-25 years) to that of matched controls without ADHD(Cox 2000). When placebo&#xD;
      was administered to both groups, ADHD-diagnosed participants demonstrated significantly&#xD;
      poorer driving scores than did controls (P&lt;0.05); however, 1.5 hours after the administration&#xD;
      of IR MPH, the driving performance of the ADHD-diagnosed group significantly improved&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.05) and was equivalent to that of the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the difference in the pharmacokinetic profiles of IR and&#xD;
      extended-release MPH formulations influenced driving performance throughout the day, a study&#xD;
      was conducted to compare IR MPH dosed 3 times daily (tid) with once-daily, OROS® MPH&#xD;
      (CONCERTA®) (Cox 2004a). OROS MPH delivers MPH via an osmotic pump to produce an ascending&#xD;
      profile with duration of treatment effect through 12 hours(Swanson 2003). Once-daily dosing&#xD;
      of OROS MPH is similar to IR MPH dosed tid and minimizes the fluctuations in peak and trough&#xD;
      plasma concentrations associated with MPH dosed tid(Swanson 2003). Therefore, in this&#xD;
      crossover study design, OROS MPH was administered at 8:00 AM, and IR MPH was administered tid&#xD;
      at 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 4:00 PM. The driving performance of adolescents with ADHD aged 16&#xD;
      to 19 years was assessed using a driving simulator at 2:00, 5:00, 8:00 and 11:00 PM. When&#xD;
      subjects were administered IR MPH, simulated driving performance worsened by a factor of 5 at&#xD;
      8:00 PM and 11:00 PM, but driving performance in subjects receiving OROS MPH remained stable&#xD;
      from 2:00 PM to 11:00 PM. Not only was driving performance significantly better in subjects&#xD;
      receiving OROS MPH (P&lt;0.001), but subjects treated with OROS MPH demonstrated significantly&#xD;
      less variability in driving performance (P&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subsequent study to compare driving skills in subjects receiving and not receiving&#xD;
      medication, adolescents with ADHD drove their own car on a standard road course after either&#xD;
      taking OROS MPH at 8:00 AM or receiving no medication. (Cox 2004b) Raters, who were blinded&#xD;
      to the medication condition, observed significantly fewer inattentive driving errors in&#xD;
      adolescents taking OROS MPH (P&lt;0.01). The study demonstrated that reduction in inattentive&#xD;
      errors was positively correlated (r=0.60, P&lt;0.01) with mg/kg dosing of OROS MPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the evidence that stimulant therapy with MPH improves driving performance and that&#xD;
      once-daily OROS MPH improves driving performance and is more effective in the evenings&#xD;
      compared with the IR formulation, we recently studied the effects of 2 long-acting stimulant&#xD;
      formulations-once-daily OROS MPH and mixed amphetamine salts extended release (se AMPH ER,&#xD;
      ADDERALL® XR)-on simulated driving performance in adolescents with ADHD to compare how each&#xD;
      affected adolescent driving performance. This study indicated that medication improved&#xD;
      driving performance and neuropsychological functioning relative to placebo, and that&#xD;
      generally OROS MPH (Concerta) led to greater improvement. However, individual differences&#xD;
      were such that a minority of subjects performed better when taking se AMPH ER (Adderall XR).&#xD;
