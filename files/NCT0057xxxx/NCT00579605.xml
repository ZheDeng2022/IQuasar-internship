      1. Evaluate the cultural appropriateness of an intervention protocol related to: a)&#xD;
           motivational interviewing technique; b) stool, urine, and breast milk sample collection;&#xD;
           and c) infant breastfeeding test weight procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare Motivational Interviewing with an attention intervention (infant safety) on: a)&#xD;
           breastfeeding self-efficacy, b) intended length of breastfeeding, and c) duration of&#xD;
           breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine urine samples of infants for the presence of the inflammatory cytokine (LTE4)&#xD;
           and evaluate fecal and breast milk samples of infants for human milk oligosaccharide&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of asthma, the most common serious chronic inflammatory disease among children,&#xD;
      is rising each year. Therefore nursing interventions aimed at promoting infant immunity and&#xD;
      mitigating factors to which the infant may be exposed may reduce the complications of this&#xD;
      chronic illness. Breastfeeding is an ideal initial prevention strategy that strengthens the&#xD;
      infant's immune system. In addition, the identification of biomarkers that reflect infant&#xD;
      immune response sets the stage for the evaluation of nursing interventions targeted to&#xD;
      decrease the impact of this chronic inflammatory disease. Although more mothers currently&#xD;
      initiate breastfeeding, they do not sustain breastfeeding for the recommended 6 to 12 months.&#xD;
      In general, Native American mothers' breastfeed for a shorter period of time and mothers in&#xD;
      rural setting have fewer resources to support breastfeeding.&#xD;
