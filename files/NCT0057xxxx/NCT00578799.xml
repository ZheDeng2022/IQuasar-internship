  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in patients who have been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC), a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) - a disease of the intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the therapeutic (medical treatment) effects of daily&#xD;
      consumption of Kyo-Dophilus (a commercially available dietary supplement often used by&#xD;
      individuals with inflammatory bowel disease) on their UC. Kyo-Dophilus consists of three&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria (beneficial bacteria to help maintain the balance of good bacteria in the&#xD;
      intestine) to help treat inflammatory bowel disease caused by bad bacteria. Patients will&#xD;
      still be maintained on their clinical standard of care for their UC as part of their&#xD;
      participation in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are defined as &quot;live microorganisms, which, when administered in adequate amounts,&#xD;
      confer a health benefit on the host.&quot; Most probiotics are lactic acid producing bacteria that&#xD;
      are endogenous to the human GI (gastrointestinal) tract and are commonly utilized in the&#xD;
      fermentation of food products, such as yogurt. Disturbances in the composition of the&#xD;
      bacterial flora of the GI tract are associated with diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      (IBD), and consumption of some strains of probiotic bacteria are very effective for treating&#xD;
      diarrhea and possibly individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC). We will test the effects of 3&#xD;
      strains of probiotic bacteria on UC. In addition to standard medical care for UC,&#xD;
      participants will consume a dietary supplement of 3 probiotic bacteria (Kyo-Dophilus;&#xD;
      Lacobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium longum) for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Changes in clinical symptoms and physiological markers of systemic and GI inflammation in&#xD;
      subjects with UC will be assessed. Significant effects of the probiotics will be determined&#xD;
      by comparing pre- and post-probiotic treatment measures for disease severity and level of&#xD;
      inflammation and by comparing the probiotic treated group with the placebo treated control&#xD;
      group. Any placebo effect on UC will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty subjects with ulcerative colitis will be recruited for the study and be provided a&#xD;
      dietary supplement (5x109 bacteria/capsule, twice a day) for 6 weeks to 1/2 of the subjects&#xD;
      and 1/2 of the UC subjects will be given a placebo control (potato starch). Standard medical&#xD;
      care and therapies will be continued throughout the study. Initially, the physician will&#xD;
      complete the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) and the participants will&#xD;
      complete the Shortened Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ), and biopsies&#xD;
      collected for histopathological assessment and analysis of inflammatory cytokine production&#xD;
      (mRNA). Also, 30 ml of venous blood will be collected from each subject for analysis of&#xD;
      serum/plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones. Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the probiotic or placebo group (blinded to the physicians). After consuming the&#xD;
      dietary supplement or placebo for 6 weeks, subjects will complete the SIBDQ questionnaire,&#xD;
      the physician complete the UCDAI, be examined by sigmoidoscopy and tissue biopsies and blood&#xD;
      samples collected. Also, during the 6 weeks of treatment, subjects will maintain a daily&#xD;
      diary of their bowel habits. Data analysis will determine whether, relative to placebo&#xD;
      controls, consumption of probiotics reduces the symptoms and levels of intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
