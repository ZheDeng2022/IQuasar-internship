      The purpose of this study is to find out what happens to patients after they have surgery for&#xD;
      rectal cancer. After being treated for rectal cancer, patients tell us that their bowel,&#xD;
      bladder and sexual function have changed. We are trying to understand how these changes&#xD;
      affect your quality of life. The research that we have now does not explain these changes or&#xD;
      problems very well. The patients will be asked questions about bowel function, bladder&#xD;
      function, sexual function, and quality of life so we can understand these changes better.&#xD;
      This will help us take better care of our patients in the future, before and after their&#xD;
      treatment for rectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer is the second most common cancer in North America. Therapy has rapidly improved&#xD;
      over the last 20 years, and the surgical technique of total mesorectal excision, as well as&#xD;
      advances in radiation and chemotherapy, have resulted in improved survival and decreased&#xD;
      local recurrence. As a result, survivorship issues become increasingly important for patients&#xD;
      with rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients uniformly demonstrate a strong desire to avoid a permanent stoma and show strong&#xD;
      preferences for sphincter preserving surgery (SPS). With the introduction of the circular&#xD;
      stapler, SPS is technically possible in a higher proportion of patients. Additionally, even&#xD;
      tumors at the anorectal ring are considered amenable to SPS in select patients with ultra-low&#xD;
      rectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, long-term outcomes after rectal cancer surgery are poorly understood. Bowel,&#xD;
      bladder and sexual function appear to be negatively affected by multi-modality therapy.&#xD;
      However, function has been poorly studied, and it is difficult to translate the data into&#xD;
      clinically meaningful information for patients. Clinically, bowel, bladder and sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction seem to affect quality of life (QOL), although this has never been well studied.&#xD;
      It is important to quantify the extent of impairment so that it can be used to educate&#xD;
      patients preoperatively. However, translating these data to clinicians and patients remains&#xD;
      challenging, and efforts to convey the data in a meaningful manner preoperatively constitute&#xD;
      an important element in managing patient expectations. By understanding patients' baseline&#xD;
      needs, expectations and satisfaction at the time of the preoperative consent, we can begin to&#xD;
      develop novel preoperative strategies for educating patients about postoperative function and&#xD;
      quality of life in a meaningful manner, so that they may better adapt after surgery. We&#xD;
      ultimately plan to use data from this study to develop and subsequently evaluate the role of&#xD;
      an educational tool outlining functional outcomes after rectal cancer surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to surgery, patients will be asked to complete baseline surveys. In addition, a random subsample of approximately 30 patients will be asked to participate in a short qualitative interview to explore expectations regarding bowel function and quality of life following surgery. Follow-up surveys will be completed at 6, 12 and 24 months after bowel continuity has been restored (defined by their last surgical procedure). Patients with a permanent stoma will receive the Stoma-specific QOL questions in place of the MSKCC Bowel Function Instrument at 6 and 12 months after initial surgery.</description>
