  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this feasibility study we will collect blood from indwelling arterial catheters in up to&#xD;
      20 patients undergoing non-emergent surgery with desflurane anesthesia at Children's Hospital&#xD;
      of Philadelphia. Desflurane levels will be determined by high pressure liquid chromatography&#xD;
      (HPLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our eventual goal is to quantify fetal levels of desflurane in umbilical cord blood during&#xD;
      fetal surgery. We propose a pilot study to assess the ability of our assay to measure&#xD;
      desflurane in human blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fetal surgery is an evolving field. Some previously fatal diseases can be surgically&#xD;
      corrected before birth. Animal models of the procedures have been carefully translated to&#xD;
      humans, but less is known about anesthetic techniques. In children, inadequate anesthesia&#xD;
      results in greater stress responses as shown by cardiovascular, neuro-endocrine, and&#xD;
      metabolic changes. These stress responses have been associated with poorer outcomes. One of&#xD;
      the major goals of anesthesia for these procedures is to attenuate this stress response.&#xD;
      Fetuses get intramuscular opioids before their incision, and the mother is given high doses&#xD;
      of volatile anesthetic (desflurane) with the assumption that whatever amount of desflurane&#xD;
      crosses the placenta adequately anesthetizes the fetus. No studies have quantified the fetal&#xD;
      levels of desflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been used to measure levels of volatile&#xD;
      anesthetic in various tissues. Measurement of desflurane has been challenging because of its&#xD;
      higher boiling point (23.5 °C at one atmosphere pressure) when compared to older volatile&#xD;
      anesthetics such as sevoflurane (boiling point 58.6 °C) and isoflurane (boiling point 48.5&#xD;
      °C). With techniques in cold rooms and using ice for sample transport, investigators have&#xD;
      successfully measured desflurane levels in blood and brain tissue of mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our eventual goal is to quantify fetal levels of desflurane in umbilical cord blood during&#xD;
      fetal surgery, but we first propose a pilot study to assess and refine the ability of our&#xD;
      assay to measure desflurane in human blood.&#xD;
