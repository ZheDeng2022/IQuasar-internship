      This study looks at the differences in inflammatory mediators in gallbladder tissue between&#xD;
      males and females and the possibility that these differences contribute to a higher&#xD;
      perception of post-operative pain in females following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A patient's gender is a strong and significant predictor for substantial differences in&#xD;
      clinical outcomes such as postoperative pain, analgesic use, and surgical complications&#xD;
      (gangrenous gallbladder, empyema of the gallbladder, gallbladder perforation, and conversion&#xD;
      to open surgery) following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Bingener et al., 2002; Bingener et&#xD;
      al., 2003; Uchiyama et al., 2006). Although females present for laparoscopic cholecystectomy&#xD;
      more frequently (76% of the cases); the prevalence of surgical complications during&#xD;
      cholecystectomy is higher in men, most frequently because of inflammation or deterioration of&#xD;
      the gallbladder (Bingener et al., 2002; Bingener et al., 2003; Stefanidis et al., 2006).&#xD;
      Post-operatively, however, females report significantly greater pain scores and require&#xD;
      larger amounts of analgesics (Uchiyama et al., 2006), suggesting that although surgeries are&#xD;
      completed with fewer problems, females still report more post-operative pain. Sex-related&#xD;
      differences in pain thresholds and tolerance to thermal, pressure, and electrical stimuli in&#xD;
      experimental pain models indicate that pain differences are not solely due to psychosocial&#xD;
      distinctions between the sexes (Riley et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple physiological differences between males and females; however, considerable&#xD;
      evidence implicates estrogenic sex hormones as critical factors in sex-dependent differences&#xD;
      in pain (see review by Fillingim and Ness, 2000). It is possible that estrogens alter&#xD;
      inflammatory mediator profiles in the gallbladder, which subsequently increase sensitization&#xD;
      of visceral neurons innervating the gallbladder, resulting in increased pain in females. The&#xD;
      first portion of this study will extend the association of patient sex with clinical outcomes&#xD;
      to determine whether circulating and/or local estrogen levels correlate with differences in&#xD;
      peri-operative morbidity, including intra-operative complications, conversion to open&#xD;
      cholecystectomy, postoperative pain, inadequate wound healing, intra-abdominal infection,&#xD;
      disability and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated that the cytokines TNFalpha and IL-1beta alter the&#xD;
      sensitivity of sensory neurons and increase nociception (Opree and Kress, 2000). To determine&#xD;
      whether estrogen levels alter the profile of inflammatory mediators within the gallbladder&#xD;
      and result in an increase in nociceptive thresholds in females, we will correlate circulating&#xD;
      and/or local levels of estrogens with the amount of inflammatory mediators present within&#xD;
      laparoscopically excised gallbladder biopsies. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be recruited from University Hospital in San Antonio. Inflammatory mediators, including the&#xD;
      cytokines IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12p70 will be assayed from&#xD;
      interstitial fluid of biopsies from the fundus and infundibulum of the gallbladder. Biopsies&#xD;
      will be classified according to clinical assessment prior to surgery to control for expected&#xD;
      differences in inflammatory mediators in acute versus chronic cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate effects of this research will be to clearly delineate whether estrogens are&#xD;
      predictive of improved clinical outcomes following surgery and to determine whether these sex&#xD;
      hormones correlate with altered production of inflammatory mediators in the gallbladder.&#xD;
