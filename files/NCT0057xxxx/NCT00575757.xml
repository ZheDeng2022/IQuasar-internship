      Because NASH is now recognized as a significant cause of cirrhosis with associated morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality, its recognition as a long term complication of HAART is important to the&#xD;
      management of those living with HIV.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Abnormal liver enzymes are frequently seen in those with HIV. Although many of these&#xD;
      individuals are co-infected with HBV or HCV, histology in HIV patients with abnormal liver&#xD;
      enzymes in the absence of viral hepatitis has not been explored. HAART has significantly&#xD;
      improved the survival in those living with HIV. However, components of HAART, particularly&#xD;
      protease inhibitors (PIs) and certain nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs),&#xD;
      are frequently associated with metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance (IR),&#xD;
      dyslipidemias, fat redistribution and lipodystrophy (LD). Both IR and dyslipidemia are&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which often present as asymptomatic liver enzyme&#xD;
      elevations. Because NASH is now recognized as a significant cause of cirrhosis with&#xD;
      associated morbidity and mortality, its recognition as a long term complication of HAART is&#xD;
      important to the management of those living with HIV. In our HIV population without HCV or&#xD;
      HBV, there is a higher prevalence of abnormal liver enzymes (AST 21%, ALT 16%, ALP 43%)&#xD;
      compared to the general population (ALT 8%) and is independently associated with PI use. The&#xD;
      relationship of liver enzyme abnormalities to IR, dyslipidemias, and the development hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis/NASH in HIV patients is unknown. We hypothesize that Liver enzyme abnormalities in&#xD;
      HIV positive patients without viral hepatitis co-infections on HAART are due to hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis related to PI use and that a subset of these individuals has NASH. The Specific&#xD;
      Aims focus on HIV positive patients with abnormal liver enzymes in the absence of viral&#xD;
      hepatitis co-infections, diabetes, or alcohol abuse to answer the following three questions:&#xD;
      (1) What is the spectrum of NAFLD?; (2) How does the spectrum compare in those that are on a&#xD;
      PI compare to those that are not; and (3) What are the independent predictive factors&#xD;
      associated with hepatic steatosis and NASH? These studies will (1) provide novel data on the&#xD;
      histology of HIV infected patients with abnormal liver enzymes in the absence of viral&#xD;
      coinfections and their relationship to IR, LD, dyslipidemias, and HAART use and (2) provide&#xD;
      the necessary pilot data for a multicenter R0-1 grant to study the long-term impact of HAART&#xD;
      on the development of steatohepatitis and subsequent hepatic fibrosis.&#xD;
