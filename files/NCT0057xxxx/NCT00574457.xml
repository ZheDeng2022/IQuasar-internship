      1) Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. Can non-sonographer health care professionals in a community medical office practice&#xD;
      setting be trained to detect and evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b. Can carotid ultrasound performed in community office practices improve physician use of&#xD;
      evidence-based, risk-reducing interventions and patient motivation to adhere to therapeutic&#xD;
      recommendations?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health care providers from five medical practices will complete a 2-day training program that&#xD;
      teaches instrumentation, scanning, measurement, quality assurance, and interpretation. They&#xD;
      also will learn about CV risk assessment, intervention, and how to use an ultrasound-based CV&#xD;
      risk stratification and treatment algorithm. After certification, each site will recruit 70&#xD;
      patients from their practice (total N=350). Subjects will complete their routine office visit&#xD;
      and a pre-test survey designed to assess motivation and intention to change. The physician's&#xD;
      initial plan of action based on usual care will be recorded. Next, the subject will have a&#xD;
      standardized CV risk carotid ultrasound. The physician will revise his/her treatment plan&#xD;
      based on the scan results and an ultrasound-based risk assessment algorithm that includes CV&#xD;
      risk factors and ultrasound data. Evidence-based treatment recommendations for lifestyle&#xD;
      changes and risk factor targets will be provided. The physician's scan-based plan of action&#xD;
      will be recorded. The subject will be informed of the results and repeat the survey. All&#xD;
      images, interpretations, and recommendations will be reviewed by the UW AIRP.&#xD;
