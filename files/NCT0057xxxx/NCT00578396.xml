    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the dietary influence of grapes in colon cancer&#xD;
      prevention. A natural compound found in the skin of grapes, resveratrol, may protect against&#xD;
      cancer by acting as an antioxidant (a chemical compound or substance that helps reduce&#xD;
      damages due to oxygen). This compound is known to block colon cancer cell lines from growing&#xD;
      in the laboratory. The purpose of this study is to determine the minimum amount of&#xD;
      resveratrol-rich fresh red grapes needed to exhibit such signs of prevention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has long been recognized that dietary factors influence the risk of developing colon&#xD;
      cancer, with populations consuming a higher proportion of fruits and vegetables having lower&#xD;
      risk. A compound found in the skin of grapes, resveratrol, has been purported to have colon&#xD;
      cancer prevention activity though the dosages obtained through the diet have always seemed&#xD;
      too low to produce inhibitory effects against cancer cells in the laboratory. We have found&#xD;
      that low concentrations of resveratrol inhibit the Wnt pathway, a key signaling pathway which&#xD;
      is activated in over 85% of colon cancers. We have also found in a small pilot trial that low&#xD;
      dosages of freeze-dried grape powder can directly inhibit Wnt signaling in the normal colon&#xD;
      and that grape powder was more effective than resveratrol alone in blocking Wnt throughput.&#xD;
      This suggests that components of grapes may have direct activity in inhibiting a key&#xD;
      signaling pathway and that this may correlate with cancer prevention activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will directly test the impact of a diet containing a specific amount of red&#xD;
      grapes in the context of a controlled amount of other resveratrol containing foodstuffs on&#xD;
      Wnt signaling in the colon. This grape-supplemented diet provides a low-dose of resveratrol&#xD;
      in conjunction with other potentially active components contained within the grapes.&#xD;
      Participants will be normal volunteers and molecular studies will be done on colon tissue&#xD;
      obtained by a limited flexible sigmoidoscopy before, and after, the red grape-containing diet&#xD;
      is ingested. Different dosages of grapes will be utilized. This study will define the effect&#xD;
      of dietary grape-derived low dose resveratrol on biomarkers related to the Wnt pathway, and&#xD;
      provide critical information as to the utility of this nutritional approach toward colon&#xD;
      cancer prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, seedless red grapes will be used. Ten participants will be enrolled at each&#xD;
      dose level of grapes as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 1: 1 lb/day fresh red grapes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 2: 2/3 lb/day fresh red grapes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 3: 1/3 lb/day fresh red grapes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be normal volunteers identified through advertisements, referrals, and&#xD;
      community outreach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Define the minimum dietarily achievable amount of resveratrol-rich fresh red grapes which are&#xD;
      effective in inhibiting Wnt signaling in human colonic mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Define whether grape-supplemented diet affects colonic mucosa cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Define any side-effects associated with the resveratrol-rich dietary program.&#xD;
