  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to show, through a controlled masked clinical study of&#xD;
      subjects with ocular hypertension (OHT), that latanoprost increases the low uveoscleral&#xD;
      drainage of aqueous humor back to normal levels, and timolol maleate reduces the formation of&#xD;
      aqueous humor below normal. Both of these mechanisms will effectively reduce intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose is to assess the effects of both latanoprost and timolol maleate on the&#xD;
      fluorophotometric outflow facility, and episcleral venous pressure and on all parameters over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent publication by our laboratory has shown that patients with ocular hypertension (OHT)&#xD;
      have reduced uveoscleral outflow and reduced trabecular outflow facility compared with&#xD;
      healthy age-matched controls. These changes are the cause of the elevated intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP). Aqueous flow rate did not change in these patients. It is logical to assume&#xD;
      that it would be more efficacious to treat OHT patients with drugs that reduce IOP by&#xD;
      increasing uveoscleral outflow (which is abnormally low) than with drugs that reduce aqueous&#xD;
      flow (which is normal in OHT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to show, through a controlled masked clinical study of&#xD;
      OHT patients, that latanoprost increases the low uveoscleral drainage of aqueous humor (Fu)&#xD;
      back to normal levels, and timolol maleate reduces the formation of aqueous humor (Fa) below&#xD;
      normal. Both of these mechanisms will effectively reduce IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose is to assess the effects of both latanoprost and timolol maleate on the&#xD;
      fluorophotometric outflow facility (Cflu), and episcleral venous pressure (Pev) and on all&#xD;
      parameters over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects eligible to participate will be at least 19 years of age and diagnosed with&#xD;
      bilateral ocular hypertension or primary open angle glaucoma and have intraocular pressure&#xD;
      between 20 and 35 mmHg in both eyes on Day 0. Subjects will be treated with either&#xD;
      latanoprost or timolol for 6 weeks and then crossover and be treated similarly with the&#xD;
      alternate drug for an additional 6 weeks. There will be a screening visit and a total of 6&#xD;
      study visits in which aqueous humor flow, uveoscleral outflow, and fluorophotometric outflow&#xD;
      facility will be determined using an instrument called a fluorophotometer. The&#xD;
      fluorophotometer scans the eye for fluorescein dye allowing the investigator to measure and&#xD;
      calculate the above variables. There will be 7 scans taken during each study day and&#xD;
      additionally IOP will be measured after the completion of each scan. An Exit exam will be&#xD;
      performed at the time of exit to ensure the ocular health of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for adverse events throughout the course of the study and subjects&#xD;
      may discontinue from the study at any time for any reason, or may be discontinued if, in the&#xD;
      opinion of the investigator, there is a risk to the subject.&#xD;
