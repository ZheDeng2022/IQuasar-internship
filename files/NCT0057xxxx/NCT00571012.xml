      Intraocular pressure (IOP) varies with body position, with a significant increase occurring&#xD;
      from the seated to the supine position. Previous research has indicated that the IOP increase&#xD;
      cannot be explained by changes in episcleral venous pressure(blood flow leading away from the&#xD;
      eye) alone. As well, previous research has indicated that aqueous flow rate is independent of&#xD;
      body position. The purpose of this project was to determine if aqueous humor outflow facility&#xD;
      varied with changes in posture.&#xD;

      On the day of the experiment, patients will be asked to maintain a regular schedule and&#xD;
      normal activities. This will include avoiding excess caffeine intake, large deviations from&#xD;
      normal sleep cycle, or exposure to pharmacologic IOP modifying agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be seated in standard ophthalmologic examining chairs and reclined into the&#xD;
      supine position in a quiet room with subdued lighting for approximately 5 minutes. Anesthesia&#xD;
      will be achieved by instilling 3-4 drops of 0.5% proparacaine. The contralateral eye will be&#xD;
      patched in an air-tight fashion with an adhesive eye patch to reduce evaporative losses and&#xD;
      drying of the cornea. The patient will be asked to keep eyes closed prior to start of&#xD;
      measurements. When ready, the patient will be asked to open their eyes and to observe a dim&#xD;
      fixation target that will be placed on the ceiling of the room, roughly 6 feet from the&#xD;
      patient's eyes. Baseline IOP (Po) will be measured using a pneumatonometer (Model 30 Classic&#xD;
      Mentor). Tonography will then be performed using the electronic Schiotz tonometer with a 10g&#xD;
      weight in order to obtain a four minute tracing. The procedure will then be repeated on the&#xD;
      contralateral eye, with patching of the already tested eye. After this, the patient's chair&#xD;
      will the be raised 70 degrees and patient will be asked to hyperextend their neck until their&#xD;
      cornea is parallel to the floor. A minimum of 30 minutes will be allowed to elapse, allowing&#xD;
      for autonomic, postural and hormonal changes to stabilize. Then a repeat baseline IOP for the&#xD;
      sitting position will be taken and another 4 minute tracing will be collected successively in&#xD;
      each eye as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the tonometer tracing will be collected electronically and will be exported to a&#xD;
      standard Excel file. A smooth curve of best fit will be established through each tonogram&#xD;
      once graphed, correcting for oscillations and drift. This curve will help determine the&#xD;
      adequacy of the collected sample. Tracings that have a poorly fitted curve might occur for a&#xD;
      variety of reasons including patient tenseness and anxiety, uncontrollable tendency to fall&#xD;
      asleep and incidental interruptions such as a sudden wave of intestinal peristalsis.&#xD;
      Corresponding &quot;Po&quot; values for the initial steady-state IOP and the &quot;C&quot; value for facility of&#xD;
      aqueous outflow will be gathered by referring to standard tables and normograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main potential risk of participating in the study is the possibility of corneal abrasion.&#xD;
      Previous studies at the Mayo Clinic using the same techniques did not result in any corneal&#xD;
      abrasions in over 300 eyes of more than 150 patients. Based on this result, we estimate the&#xD;
      risk of a corneal abrasion to be minimal. If a corneal abrasion occurs, the patient will be&#xD;
      removed from the study. The patient will be treated with antibiotic drops or ointment and&#xD;
      followed until the abrasion has completely healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other minor risks include possible allergic reaction to the anesthetic drops or the adhesive&#xD;
      glue. As with any medication, allergic reactions are a possibility. However, these will be&#xD;
      the same drops used in routine clinical practice, and allergic reaction is extremely&#xD;
      uncommon.&#xD;
