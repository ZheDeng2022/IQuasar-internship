    <textblock>
      Our first aim is to describe how common a sudden decrease in renal function happens in&#xD;
      infants in a neonatal intensive care unit. We also want to see how a sudden loss of renal&#xD;
      function affects survival. Finally, we will explore non-invasive markers to identify a sudden&#xD;
      decrease in renal function from urinary samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advancements in the field of peri-natal medicine has improved the survival of critically ill&#xD;
      neonates but yet many still do not survive, and many more are left with long-term damage to&#xD;
      vital organ systems. Very little data is available on the impact that acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI) has on survival in term neonates, but adult and pediatric studies that show that even&#xD;
      mild AKI independently impacts survival after correcting for severity of illness. The role&#xD;
      that AKI impacts survival in neonates is likely to be greater than adults as this acute&#xD;
      injury occurs in context of impaired and ongoing kidney development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our ability to improve outcomes in children and adults with AKI has been hampered by the&#xD;
      inability to recognize AKI early in the disease process. Thus, the work on early non-invasive&#xD;
      biomarkers of renal injury has brought great optimism to the field of AKI. Serum and urinary&#xD;
      levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), urinary interleukin 18 (IL-18)&#xD;
      others are markedly elevated several hours after AKI as opposed to serum creatinine which&#xD;
      takes days to rise after the inciting event. Early non-invasive biomarkers of AKI have not&#xD;
      been tested in neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria - Families of infants (birthweight &gt;1500g) be asked to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria - Infants with prenatal renal ultrasound diagnosis of severe&#xD;
      hydronephrosis or other known renal abnormalities will be excluded&#xD;
