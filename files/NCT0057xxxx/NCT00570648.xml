      Hypothesis: 1% sodium hyaluronate (Healon), applied at end of surgery to the surface of a&#xD;
      corneal transplant will not shorten graft reepithelialization time when compared to coating&#xD;
      with nothing. We also wish to measure and compare visual acuity in this immediate post&#xD;
      operative period. We also wish to assess the safety of using this agent on the epithelium&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 50 high risk patients (see inclusion criteria) here at the University of&#xD;
      Virginia to randomly receive nothing or sodium hyaluronate (Healon) on the ocular surface at&#xD;
      the end of surgery, and follow time to reepithelialization of the corneal transplant grafts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corneal transplant is one of the most common transplant procedures, with over 32,000&#xD;
      recipients in the United States in 2005 and a similar number estimated in 2006. The immediate&#xD;
      post-operative period is very important in determining the quality of the graft and often its&#xD;
      overall chance of survival. The corneal epithelium is replaced by the recipient epithelium&#xD;
      after transplant and this should usually take place in no more than 1 week. This&#xD;
      reepithelialization is very important for healing, recovery of the epithelial barrier against&#xD;
      infectious agents, and for recovery of vision through the graft. Grafts that take longer to&#xD;
      heal can invite not only infection and hinder visual recovery, but be permanently scarred,&#xD;
      thinned, and even perforate/fail. Thus rapid reepithelialization is crucial. This becomes&#xD;
      even more crucial for monocular patients who need quick recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no universal agent that is used to coat the surface at the end of surgery&#xD;
      before patching. Previous animal studies have shown that sodium hyaluronate will promote&#xD;
      rapid migration of cells as well as stimulate cell proliferation leading to rapid wound&#xD;
      closure (1,2). In 1987 one smaller study showed that topical sodium hyaluronate (Healon) may&#xD;
      foster improved epithelial healing but it was used intraoperatively and presented technical&#xD;
      challenges (3). A more recent non-randomized, retrospective study found that sodium&#xD;
      hyaluronate at the end of surgery to coat the ocular surface shortened reepithelialization&#xD;
      time. This was in comparison to dexamethasone/oxytetracycline ointment and&#xD;
      neomycin/dexamethasone drops, both of which hinder reepithelialization (4). To date we know&#xD;
      of no prospective, randomized, double-blinded studies that compare the application of sodium&#xD;
      hyaluronate versus nothing (currently the practice at UVA).&#xD;
