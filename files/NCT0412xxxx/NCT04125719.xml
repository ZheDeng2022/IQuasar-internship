    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with metastatic melanoma who have at least one injectable lesion that&#xD;
      has been refractory to PD-1 therapy (n=30 patients) will be enrolled. Cohort 1 will include&#xD;
      15 patients who progressed within 3 months (primary resistance) of starting PD-1 therapy and&#xD;
      cohort 2 will be patients who progressed after at least 3 months of PD-1 therapy. Patients&#xD;
      will receive up to 7 injections of PVSRIPO intra-lesionally in combination with Nivolumab.&#xD;
      Nivolumab will be administered according to the FDA-approved dosing schedule of 480 mg&#xD;
      intravenously every 4 weeks, beginning ~10 days after the first PVSRIPO infusion and will&#xD;
      continue for 4 cycles. Nivolumab may be continued up to 2 years per standard of care after&#xD;
      the completion of the PVSRIPO injections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must have histologically proven unresectable melanoma, stage IIIB, IIIC, IIID, or&#xD;
      stage IV (AJCC staging must be documented in patient's medical record, as determined by CT of&#xD;
      the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and/or whole body PET scan, and MRI of the brain within 4&#xD;
      weeks prior to administration of study drug). Patients must have failed PD-1 therapy as&#xD;
      judged by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will initially receive one injection of PVSRIPO intra-lesionally. Based on a phase 1&#xD;
      study of the agent in adult patients with recurrent GBM, the starting amount to be delivered&#xD;
      will be 1x108 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) prior to initiation of nivolumab.&#xD;
      Nivolumab will be administered according to the FDA-approved dosing schedule of 480 mg&#xD;
      intravenously every 4 weeks, beginning ~10 days after the first PVSRIPO infusion and will&#xD;
      continue for 4 cycles. PVSRIPO will then be given intralesionally to multiple lesions (if&#xD;
      present) at days 38, 66, and 94.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 108 after 4 doses of nivolumab and 4 treatments of PVSRIPO, imaging and a full disease&#xD;
      assessment will be done and iRECIST determined. A patient with complete response (CR) or a&#xD;
      partial response (PR) (at least at 75% decrease in the sum of all diameters of all target&#xD;
      lesions plus new lesions) will continue on nivolumab for up to 2 years. For patients with PR&#xD;
      (&lt; 75% decrease), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), an additional 3&#xD;
      treatments of PVSRIPO q4weeks can be given concurrently with 3 doses of monthly nivolumab.&#xD;
      The lesions will be chosen at discretion of principal investigator (PI) and can be new&#xD;
      lesions, previously injected lesions, or untreated lesions. At Day 234 (±7 days), (after 7&#xD;
      total PVSRIPO injections and 8 doses of nivolumab), patients with PD will be off study, any&#xD;
      patient with CR, PR, SD can receive up to 2 years total of nivolumab. If a patient has no&#xD;
      remaining injectable lesions at any point during the study, PVSRIPO will not be given, but&#xD;
      patients can continue on nivolumab.&#xD;

             abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 7 months after the last&#xD;
             dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from donating&#xD;
             sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of&#xD;
        the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
        abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
        withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

                  Principal Investigator approval has been obtained. However, during the course of&#xD;
                  the study, use of corticosteroids is allowed if used for treating irAEs, adrenal&#xD;
                  insufficiencies, or if administered at doses of prednisone ≤ 10 mg daily or&#xD;
                  equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids&#xD;
                  for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible&#xD;
                  for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies&#xD;
             or fusion proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of&#xD;
             the nivolumab formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study or within&#xD;
             5 months after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result&#xD;
             within 24 hours prior to the initial administration of the study drug and then every 4&#xD;
             weeks during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Patients with human serum albumin allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Patients with a previous history of neurological complications due to PV infection.&#xD;

             PD-1 therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
         34. Psychiatric conditions or diminished capacity that could compromise the giving of&#xD;
             informed consent, or interfere with study compliance; any underlying medical or&#xD;
             psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the investigator will make the&#xD;
             administration of Nivolumab hazardous or obscure the interpretation of AEs, such as a&#xD;
             condition associated with frequent diarrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
         35. Prisoners, or subjects who are compulsory detained.&#xD;
