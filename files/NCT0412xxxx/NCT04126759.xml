  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been launched to collect spectral Raman data and reference&#xD;
      measurements to establish and validate a calibration model for the device during daily&#xD;
      glycemic fluctuations and evaluate analytical performance of device in the hypoglycemic&#xD;
      range. The study is a combined home-based and in-clinic study where subjects will attend the&#xD;
      clinic two times.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects enrolled in this protocol will dedicate 33 days of home-based measurement and two days for in-clinic measurements. For reference measurements, subjects will be equipped with a BG-meter (Contour Next One, Ascenia). Optical measurements are collected with the IMD. Each day of measurements consists of four sessions each comprising two capillary blood glucose measurement with a BG-meter and two IMD measurements. IMD measurements will be performed using the thenar of the right hand of the subject.</description>
