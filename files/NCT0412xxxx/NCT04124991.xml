  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label study to evaluate safety and efficacy of Radioembolization&#xD;
      with Yttrium-90 Microspheres in Combination with Durvalumab in Locally Advanced and&#xD;
      Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma which to be implemented at a single site in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 microspheres will be employed in&#xD;
      combination with an intravenous (IV) durvalumab until PD. TARE will be performed before the&#xD;
      first dose of durvalumab. Exploratory biomarker testing will be done on tumor tissues prior&#xD;
      to treatment and plasma samples prior to treatment and at the time of PD.&#xD;

If additional TARE is performed, the interval between additional TARE treatments and administration of durvalumab should be at least 1 week.</intervention_model_description>

&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced HCC&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        •The screening angiogram and technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) scan are&#xD;
        used to determine lobar liver volume from CT or MR images, to identify vascular shunting to&#xD;
        the GI tract requiring use of angiographic occlusion techniques and to determine the lung&#xD;
        shunt fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are ineligible to radioembolization meeting the following criteria will not be&#xD;
        included in the study. Additional patients will be screened to replace those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deposition of yttrium-90 microspheres to the GI tract that cannot be corrected by&#xD;
             placement of the catheter distal to collateral vessels or the application of standard&#xD;
             angiographic techniques, such as coil embolization to prevent deposition of yttrium-90&#xD;
             microspheres in the GI tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure of radiation to the lungs exceeds 30 Gray (Gy) for a single infusion or 50 Gy&#xD;
             cumulative for all infusions of yttrium-90 microspheres.&#xD;
