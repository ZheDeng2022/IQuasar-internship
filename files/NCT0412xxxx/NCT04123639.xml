  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common, important manifestation of systemic&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Stenosis or occlusions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) may result in&#xD;
      intermittent claudication or even critical ischemia, which may be treated by balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty with or without stenting .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerotic disease in the femoropopliteal (FP) artery consists of perfusion to the legs&#xD;
      and feet. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has been routinely used to manage FP&#xD;
      artery disease and is recommended as an alternative to surgical bypass. Recently, newer&#xD;
      endovascular approaches such as covered stent, drug-eluting balloon (DEB), drug-eluting stent&#xD;
      (DES), or catheter based atherectomy have been introduced as treatment options for FP artery&#xD;
      disease. Nevertheless, FP artery-in stent restenosis (ISR) is still a major challenge with&#xD;
      endovascular therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the use of peripheral arterial stents brought about a dramatic improvement in&#xD;
      patients' clinical and procedural outcomes, the long-term outcome of stent implantation&#xD;
      remains significantly constrained by the risk of developing in-stent restenosis (ISR) over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advancements in endovascular stent technology have addressed limitations associated with&#xD;
      conventional percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty in patients with chronic&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limbs, such as elastic recoil,residual&#xD;
      stenosis and flow-limiting dissection . However, a considerable proportion of patients with&#xD;
      PAD treated with stenting will require secondary interventions due to in-stent restenosis&#xD;
      (ISR), which is particularly common in long and complex lesions ISR refers to loss of luminal&#xD;
      volume from an ingrowth of cells, extracellular matrix, and thrombus within the cylinder of&#xD;
      the stented artery and 5-mm margins proximal and distal to the stent. ISR has been reported&#xD;
      to occur in 18-40% of patients undergoing stenting in the femoropopliteal segment within the&#xD;
      first year of treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of ISR is one of the major challenges in endovascular therapy for PAD. The&#xD;
      treatment options for ISR include standard balloon angioplasty with or without repeat&#xD;
      stenting (using bare-metal stents, stent grafts or drug-eluting stents), drug-coated or&#xD;
      cutting balloon angioplasty, cryoplasty and directional or laser atherectomy .&#xD;
