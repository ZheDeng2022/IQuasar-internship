  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) with chromosome 17 deletion (del(17p) represents one of the most&#xD;
      dangerous genetic variant of this disease, since it is associated with a high level of&#xD;
      genomic instability. Del(17p) is present in approximately 10% of patients at diagnosis, and&#xD;
      its frequency increases with disease evolution. The adverse prognosis of del(17p) has been&#xD;
      observed in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy and new drugs. Only very few&#xD;
      studies have suggested an advantage in treating del(17p) MM patients with specific therapies.&#xD;
      In particular, several recent trials combining lenalidomide plus dexamethasone with a new&#xD;
      agent, suggested that high risk cytogenetics patients may benefit from newest generation&#xD;
      drugs. Yet, in all studies, outcome of patients with high risk genetic features have been&#xD;
      derived from subgroup analyses, with all the limitations of this approach. To date no trial&#xD;
      has been designed with the specific aim to test genotype-adapted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the combination of&#xD;
      daratumumab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone (DPd) in relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM patients&#xD;
      harboring del(17p).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM patients harbouring del(17p) is a relevant&#xD;
      unmet medical need. A clinical trial designed to test a tailored treatment for this patient&#xD;
      population would be a major improvement. In this perspective the combination DPd seems&#xD;
      attractive since:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  both daratumumab and pomalidomide are therapies not interfering with DNA replication,&#xD;
           thus not increasing the intrinsic genomic instability of del(17p) plasma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the POLLUX study has shown that daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide is highly&#xD;
           effective in relapsed and relapsed/refractory MM patients.10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the IFM 2010-02 trial has suggested that pomalidomide may be effective in del(17p)&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the DPd combination has been successfully tested in MM patients with advanced disease.&#xD;

      Patients will undergo screening for protocol eligibility within 28 days (4 weeks) of&#xD;
      enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated for study eligibility. It is to note that patients can be enrolled based on the&#xD;
      presence of del(17p), as per center evaluation. However, the presence of del(17p) should be&#xD;
      confirmed by the central laboratory (University of Torino laboratory), which will perform the&#xD;
      test in 5 working days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After registration, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be treated according to&#xD;
      the protocol, only after the presence of del(17p) has been confirmed by the central&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period includes administration of 28-day cycles of treatment with DPd until any&#xD;
      sign of progression or intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response will be assessed after each cycle. The LTFU period will start after development&#xD;
      of confirmed progressive disease (PD) or treatment interruption due to toxicity. All patients&#xD;
      are to be followed for survival during the LTFU period every 3 months via telephone or office&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
