  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), known as insulin pump therapy, has been&#xD;
      widely used for diabetes patients in recent years. Many clinical studies have proved the&#xD;
      priority of CSII to multiple insulin injections including better glycaemic control with lower&#xD;
      daily insulin requirement, lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level and reduced risk of&#xD;
      severe hypoglycaemia. The best mode of CSII is a kind of programmed and individualized&#xD;
      insulin infusion mode. But at present, the applying of insulin pump is mainly during&#xD;
      hospitalization period in China, which is not conformed with daily living scenarios of&#xD;
      patients. The outpatient insulin pump treatment is much closer to the real living scenarios&#xD;
      of patients. However, lack of management experience and widely accepted formative model of&#xD;
      insulin pump applying in clinic restricted use of insulin pumps in clinical in China. The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to explore a safe and effective management mode of insulin pump operating&#xD;
      to enable a wide population to have access to daily use of CSII, and to maximize the rational&#xD;
      use of limited medical resources.&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators plan to enroll patients of different types of diabetes,&#xD;
      including type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      perioperative diabetes mellitus, pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus (after total&#xD;
      pancreatectomy) and diabetes patients in perioperative periodï¼Œeach type of diabetes patients&#xD;
      were divided into three groups according to the time (7days, 14days and 28days) reaching the&#xD;
      target blood glucose. Those patients are educated to record blood glucose and frequency of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia during the study period. After achieving goal blood glucose, follow-up will&#xD;
      continue one week to evaluate whether the blood glucose reached our goal and adjust the&#xD;
      insulin pump parameter if necessary. The investigators plan to apply continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring(CGM) for each patient during follow up. The investigators aim to explore the best&#xD;
      time to reach goal blood glucose considering frequency of hypoglycemia, economic factors,&#xD;
      insulin pump parameters at the end of study and the final insulin pump parameters at the end&#xD;
      of follow up. The investigators aim to enroll patients with six different types diabetes&#xD;
      because those patients have different insulin secretion pattern, which induced to different&#xD;
      mode of CSII. The investigators set the goal fasting blood glucose at 4-6mmol/L and the goal&#xD;
      postprandial blood glucose at 6-8mmol/L. The blood glucose of hypoglycemia was lower than&#xD;
      3.9mmol/L.&#xD;
