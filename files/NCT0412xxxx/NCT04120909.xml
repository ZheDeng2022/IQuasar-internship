  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the MARC-2 study is to investigate the relation of the QRS area, determined by&#xD;
      vectorcardiography, and response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) in patients with&#xD;
      a wide QRS complex and without a typical left bundle branch block; the interrelationship as&#xD;
      well as the potential predictive power of this biomarker, as well as other clinical&#xD;
      biomarkers on a hierarchal composite endpoint (death, heart failure hospitalizations, heart&#xD;
      failure complaints and cardiac function) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main biomarker that is studied is the QRS area, but also other electrocardiographic,&#xD;
      echocardiographic markers, blood markers and clinical markers will be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the purpose described in the brief summary, the MARC-2 study investigators have set an&#xD;
      aim of including 800 patients in 2 inclusion years, in 30 centres accross Europe and Israel.&#xD;
      Inclusion will be general patients indicated for (de novo or upgrade) implantation a&#xD;
      (Medtronic) CRT-pacemaker or -ICD, as according to current ESC heart failure guidelines.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are, age below 18 years, (planning) childbearing, baseline &gt; 5% RV-pacing,&#xD;
      listing for transplantation or inotropic dependency, structural heart disease for which&#xD;
      invasive therapy is pending, or inability/unwillingness to sign written informed consent. All&#xD;
      QRS morphologies, with duration &gt;/= 130ms are included because multiple LBBB definitions&#xD;
      exist and excluding patients on one definition will leave room for questions about the&#xD;
      definitions used. (Bio)markers that are collected are&#xD;
      electrocardiographic/vectorcardiographic/echocardiographic/blood-/CMR/ and device-based&#xD;
      parameters that have shown prior association to outcomes in CRT, with special attention to&#xD;
      vectorcardiographic QRS area. The primary endpoint will be a hierarchal (Packer) score of&#xD;
      collected heart failure related endpoints including death/LVAD/cardiac transpland/heart&#xD;
      failure hospitalizations/echocardiographic remodelling and NYHA improvement. Follow-up for&#xD;
      clinical endpoints will be 12 months; with echocardiographic follow-up at 6 months. Clinical&#xD;
      endpoints are subject to adjudication committee assessment. Core-labs exist to assess&#xD;
      electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and CMR-data.&#xD;

        The study group to be recruited will consist of heart failure patients (NYHA I-IV), male&#xD;
        and female, with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF&lt;/=35%) and ventricular&#xD;
        dyssynchrony (QRS&gt;/=130ms) as measured prior to implantation of a CRT device. Each study&#xD;
        subject receives a CRT device with a class I or II indication according to the current CRT&#xD;
        ESC/AHA guidelines.&#xD;
