    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a mindfulness intervention in patients with drug resistant epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of participants will follow a mindfulness programme, while the other half will follow a&#xD;
      self management programme.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug-resistant epilepsy is associated with an alteration of the quality of life mainly&#xD;
      related to psychiatric comorbidities (anxiety and depression). The management of these&#xD;
      comorbidities is therefore essential in patients with drug resistant epilepsy, Ideally&#xD;
      through non-drug management to minimize the side effects of molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of mindfulness interventions in pathology is to learn to better live with a chronic&#xD;
      disease by reducing the stress resulting from the disease, by increasing benevolence towards&#xD;
      oneself, the acceptance of the disease and reducing the ruminations linked with the&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness therefore seems to be a good way for these patients to improve the management of&#xD;
      their emotions and thus improve their quality of life what the investigators propose to&#xD;
      evaluate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two phases&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First phase: comparative randomized study (primary endpoint):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. After inclusion, a 2 months baseline follow-up is carry to collect the judgement&#xD;
                criteria without intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. At the end of this period, patients will be randomly assigned to the mindfulness&#xD;
                intervention group or the control group with the psycho educative programme. Both&#xD;
                programmes will takes 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Then a 6-months post-intervention follow-up period for both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will have assessment visits every 3 months. They will also complete a daily&#xD;
           notebook including the number of seizures they have done and a scale of their &quot;interior&#xD;
           weather&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second phase (optional):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first phase, patients in the control group will be able to benefit from the&#xD;
      mindfulness programme and will be followed at the end of the programme for 6 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Evolution of Quality Of Life In Epilepsy-Problems questionnaire (QOLIE31-P) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLIE31-P questionnaire has been developed specifically to measure the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. The score ranges from 0 to 100 points. Higher scores reflect better quality of life; lower ones, worse quality of life.&#xD;
The score of QOLIE31-P will be assess prior to intervention and then at month 3, month 6 and month 9 after the beginning of the intervention.&#xD;
