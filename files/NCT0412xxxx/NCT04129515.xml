    <textblock>
      This research study involves studying a device as a possible treatment for metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma in the brain. The purpose of this study is to obtain information on the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the study device, NovoTTF-200A, in melanoma participants with brain&#xD;
      metastases when it is combined with Pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study device involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- NovoTTF-200A&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the drug used in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- Pembrolizumab&#xD;

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The name of the study device involved in this study is: NovoTTF-200A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The name of the drug used in this study is: Pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be in this research study for up to 2 years, or until&#xD;
           progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity as is reflected in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I/II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety and toxicity of adding an investigational&#xD;
                device NovoTTF-200A to standard-of-care drug Pembrolizumab to use for further&#xD;
                studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A Phase II clinical trial tests how well the combination works for your brain&#xD;
                disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the device is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved NovoTTF-200A for your brain&#xD;
      metastasis from melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A metastatic brain tumor is usually found when a cancer patient begins to experience&#xD;
      neurological symptoms and a brain scan (CT or MRI) is ordered. However, some participants are&#xD;
      symptom-free and are only diagnosed with brain metastases with MRI or CT scans for another&#xD;
      reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NovoTTF-200A System is a portable device which produces changing electrical fields,&#xD;
      called Tumor Treatment Fields (&quot;TTFields&quot;) within the human body. TTFields stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells resulting in cell death of the rapidly dividing cancer cells. TTFields may also&#xD;
      sensitize the tumor cells to immune therapies and this is the rationale for combining&#xD;
      NovoTTF-200A and Pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system is a portable, light-weighted, battery operated device designed to deliver&#xD;
      TTFields directly to the region where brain metastasis are. The device can be carried&#xD;
      backpack while working or doing other activities of daily living.&#xD;

             solitary melanoma brain metastasis should not be treated with either surgery or&#xD;
             radiation prior to trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirm available archival or newly obtained tissue (either brain or systemic) from&#xD;
             prior core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion.&#xD;

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 14 days (or within 72 hours if deemed necessary by the treating&#xD;
             investigator) prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test&#xD;
             is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth&#xD;
             control or be surgically sterile, use barrier methods of contraception, or abstain&#xD;
             from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of study medication (Reference Section 5.8). Subjects of childbearing potential&#xD;
             are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses&#xD;
             for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception, including&#xD;
             spermicide, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of NovoTTF-200A and pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled&#xD;
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of administration.&#xD;

             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to first dose of treatment or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
             Subjects with newly diagnosed brain metastasis during checkpoint inhibitor treatment&#xD;
             are eligible, as long as they have stable or regressing systemic melanoma and the only&#xD;
             site of relapse is in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or those expecting to conceive or father children&#xD;
             within the projected duration of the trial (starting with the pre-screening or&#xD;
             screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment), are excluded&#xD;
             from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of immunodeficiency or HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;

             may qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline)&#xD;

             be determined by the treating investigator. However, it is recommended that both CSF&#xD;
             and neuroimaging be obtained because both modalities have limitations in sensitivity&#xD;
             and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are&#xD;
             stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to&#xD;

             drugs). Pre-existing hypothyroidism and type I diabetes mellitus (including those from&#xD;
             prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody treatment) are not considered as active&#xD;
             autoimmune diseases. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is&#xD;
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation&#xD;
             with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;

          -  Subject who received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu&#xD;
             vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are&#xD;
             live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implanted pacemaker, defibrillator, deep brain stimulator, or documented clinically&#xD;
             significant arrhythmias.&#xD;
