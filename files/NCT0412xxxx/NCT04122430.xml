      Recent data (Srikanthan and Tran et al. JCO 2014, in press) have demonstrated that the&#xD;
      presence of large retroperitoneal lymph node metastases on baseline staging scans (measuring&#xD;
      &gt;5cm in axial dimension) are associated with significantly increased risk of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism in patients receiving first line chemotherapy for disseminated germ cell&#xD;
      tumours.&#xD;

      Recent data (Srikanthan and Tran et al. JCO 2014, in press) have demonstrated that the&#xD;
      presence of large retroperitoneal lymph node (RPLN) metastases on baseline staging scans&#xD;
      (measuring &gt;5cm in axial dimension) are associated with significantly increased risk of&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients receiving first line chemotherapy for disseminated&#xD;
      germ cell tumours (GCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, a G3 collaborative effort, aims to confirm these findings in a large&#xD;
      multi-national validation cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the association between large RPLN metastases (measuring &gt;5cm in axial dimension)&#xD;
      and increased risk of VTE during and immediately after completion of (within 90 days) first&#xD;
      line chemotherapy for disseminated GCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the discriminatory accuracy for VTE of both large RPLN metastases and&#xD;
           high-risk Khorana score (defined as &gt; 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of VTE in patients with disseminated GCT receiving first line&#xD;
           chemotherapy at baseline, during chemotherapy and immediately following chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of VTE during and immediately after chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
           receiving prophylactic anticoagulation during first line chemotherapy for disseminated&#xD;
           GCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of major bleeding in patients who received prophylactic&#xD;
           anticoagulation versus those who did not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine overall survival at 12 months, 3 years and 5 years for patients who&#xD;
           developed VTE compared to those who did not No identifying data (e.g. name, hospital UR,&#xD;
           address) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by retrospective review of the medical chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When assessing for the presence of large RPLN as a risk factor for VTE, only the maximal&#xD;
      diameter of the long axis of the largest retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis will be&#xD;
      recorded. Where the exact measurement is not available, it should be recorded whether the&#xD;
      maximal diameter of the largest RPLN measures &gt;5cm or &lt;5cm. The representative value for&#xD;
      large RPLN should NOT include the combination of all maximal diameters of all RPLN&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the pre-chemotherapy values for hemoglobin, platelet count and leukocyte count,&#xD;
      these must have been conducted within 30 days of initiation of chemotherapy. The highest&#xD;
      serum Creatinine observed during the course of chemotherapy should also be recorded - this is&#xD;
      not necessarily the pre-chemotherapy serum Creatinine, as the highest value may have occurred&#xD;
      during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A VTE event is defined as either deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).&#xD;
      Superficial venous thrombosis or thrombophlebitis will not be considered as a VTE event. Only&#xD;
      bleeding events requiring medical intervention will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will cover the period from the start of curative first line chemotherapy&#xD;
      until 90 days following completion of chemotherapy. Any VTE event that is present at baseline&#xD;
      (i.e. start of first line chemotherapy) will be recorded. Additionally, any VTE event that&#xD;
      occurs within 90 days of completion of chemotherapy will be recorded; this allows recording&#xD;
      of incidental VTE noted on post-chemotherapy restaging scans. Distinction will be made for&#xD;
      VTE that occurs following post-chemo surgery (post-op) that is performed within the 90 day&#xD;
      timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection should be completed by December 31, 2015 and de-identified data forwarded to&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator for data analysis before January 30, 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aggregated data will be used for study reports, and where appropriate conference&#xD;
      presentations and peer-reviewed manuscript(s). In addition, the findings may be used to&#xD;
      inform the design of a subsequent prospective trial of prophylactic anticoagulation.&#xD;
