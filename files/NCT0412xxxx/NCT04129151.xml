      This research study is designed to study the combination of two drugs, palbociclib and&#xD;
      ganitumab, as a potential treatment for Ewing sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Ganitumab&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research study involves participants taking a medicine that inhibits proteins in cancer&#xD;
      cells called CDK4 and CDK6 (palbociclib) in combination with a medicine that inhibits a&#xD;
      protein called IGF-1R (ganitumab). This study is designed to see if these drugs are safe when&#xD;
      given together and whether they are effective in treating Ewing sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or drug combination to learn whether the drug(s)&#xD;
      works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug or combination is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ganitumab as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved palbociclib for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for another cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing whether palbociclib and ganitumab are safe when given together and effective in&#xD;
           treating Ewing sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing markers in the blood and in tumor tissue to see if there are certain features of&#xD;
           the tumor that may indicate this combination of drugs is effective or not effective&#xD;
