  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to determine the inflammation lowering impact of&#xD;
      anthocyanin-rich Aronia berries. Inflammation is an underlying mechanism driving the&#xD;
      development of several diseases. While an elevation in immune signals in the systemic&#xD;
      circulation is commonly attributed to adipose tissue, inflammation is not present in all&#xD;
      obese individuals. Adipose tissue must become inflamed, and the inflammation trigger may come&#xD;
      from other sources. Microorganisms (microbiome), host tissues, and immune cells residing in&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are a key source of pro-inflammatory signals that may cause&#xD;
      the host organism to become inflamed. Anthocyanins are bioactive compounds with established&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and microbiome altering properties. We hypothesize that the GIT microbiome&#xD;
      is a key determinant of host inflammation than can be manipulated by anthocyanins-rich&#xD;
      berries to lower inflammation. We assembled a cohort of Low-INF and High-INF individuals and&#xD;
      characterize their GIT microbiome and performed anthropometric measurements, basal measures&#xD;
      of metabolism and metabolic health, and triglyceridemic, metabolomic, and inflammation&#xD;
      responses to a high-fat meal challenge. Following this clinical trial, germ-free mice will be&#xD;
      humanized with fecal microbial transplants from humans with distinct inflammation phenotypes&#xD;
      to determine the impact of Aronia supplementation on the gut microbiome, metabolism, and&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;

      Anthropometrics. Measurements were collected from participants using the validated segmental&#xD;
      multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (SECA mBCA 515, Hamburg, Germany). Fat mass&#xD;
      (%) and estimated visceral adipose (L) were used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-Fat Meal Challenge. The high-fat meal contained salted butter (58.3 g, Tillamook) over 3&#xD;
      pieces of whole wheat toast (127.5 g; Wheat Montana). Total energy content of the meal was&#xD;
      714 kcal, with 43.1% from fat, with a macronutrient breakdown of 50 g fat, 54 g carbohydrate,&#xD;
      and 12 g protein. Water was provided with the meal; caffeinated black tea was provided&#xD;
      instead for participants who identified as habitual coffee consumers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sampling. Participants were instructed to avoid alcohol consumption and strenuous&#xD;
      physical activity in the 24 hours before their visit and to complete an overnight fast (10 -&#xD;
      12 hours) before blood collection. Participant blood samples were collected by a certified&#xD;
      nurse or physician in the morning before ingestion of the meal and hourly for 4 hours after&#xD;
      meal ingestion, totaling five time points. Whole blood in serum separating tubes was allowed&#xD;
      to clot for 15 minutes before centrifugation at 1200 RPM for 15 minutes with resulting serum&#xD;
      aliquoted and stored at -80ºC until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of blood markers. Blood markers of metabolic syndrome were determined from&#xD;
      whole blood run on Picollo Xpress Chemistry Analyzer lipid panels (Abaxis, Union City, USA).&#xD;
      Serum insulin (INS) was determined using an insulin ELISA kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH)&#xD;
      performed according to manufacturer instructions. Cytokine measurement was performed using&#xD;
      high-sensitivity multiplexing technology (Bio-Rad Bio-Plex 200 HTS) following procedures by&#xD;
      Millipore (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, USA). Classic systemic pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines were measured and include granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. InterleukinI-17 and&#xD;
      IL-23, both of which serve a pro-inflammatory and regulatory role in the gut mucosa, were&#xD;
      also measured. Serum samples at each time point during the high-fat meal challenge were run&#xD;
      in duplicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool Sample Collection. Collection kits were provided and participants were asked to follow&#xD;
      included instructions for the self-collection of a stool sample in the 24 hours before their&#xD;
      blood collection visit. After initial collection into a sterile disposable commode, a small&#xD;
      portion of the sample was transferred into a sterile Eppendorf tube and transported to&#xD;
      researchers. Samples were prepared and aliquoted in an anaerobic chamber then frozen at -80ºC&#xD;
      until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA Extraction and Microbial Analysis. Extraction of bulk DNA from fecal samples was&#xD;
      performed using Powersoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc.) and bead beating. DNA&#xD;
      was shipped overnight to the University of Michigan, Michigan Microbiome Project for Illumina&#xD;
      MiSeq amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region. After DNA quantification, V4 amplicon&#xD;
      libraries were generated with dual-index barcoded primers, then by library purification,&#xD;
      pooling, and MiSeq paired-end sequencing. Raw sequencing reads were processed and curated&#xD;
      using MOTHUR software (Version 1.35.1) following the MOTHUR standard operating procedure for&#xD;
      the MiSeq platform39. In brief review, paired-end reads were assembled into contiguous&#xD;
      sequences and screened for length and quality. The remaining contigs were aligned to the&#xD;
      SILVA ribosomal RNA database (Release 132), a comprehensive collection of aligned rRNA&#xD;
      sequences. Potentially chimeric sequences were identified and removed using the UCHIME&#xD;
      algorithm in MOTHUR. Taxonomic classifications were assigned using the Bayesian classifier of&#xD;
      the Ribosomal Database Project. Non-target reads were removed, and operational taxonomic&#xD;
      units (OTUs) were assigned using VSEARCH distance-based clustering at the 97% similarity&#xD;
      threshold. Alpha-, and β- diversity indices were generated using the vegan package in R40. An&#xD;
      OTU-based data matrix was constructed for participants included in the ppTG phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomic Analysis. Frozen serum samples were thawed and 20μL was placed in a clean tube.&#xD;
      80μL of HPLC grade methanol was added to the sample after which it was vortexed briefly and&#xD;
      placed in a -80 C freezer for 2 hours. After two hours, the sample was centrifuged at 20,000g&#xD;
      for 10 minutes. The metabolite supernatant was collected and concentrated in a Speed Vac to&#xD;
      dryness while the protein pellet was discarded. Samples were then stored at -80 C until ready&#xD;
      for LCMS analysis at which time they were reconstituted with 40μL of methanol:water (50:50)&#xD;
      and placed in a clean mass spectrometry vial. Analysis was completed on an Agilent 6538 Q-TOF&#xD;
      MS coupled to an Agilent 1290 UHPLC using a 130A, 1.7μm, 2.1mm X 10mm Acquity BEH-HILIC HPLC&#xD;
      column. Samples were ionized via electrospray ionization and runs were completed in positive&#xD;
      mode. Mobile phase A was 15mmol/L ammonium formate and mobile phase B was ACN using a 10-40%&#xD;
      A gradient over 6 minutes. Flow was kept at 400µL/minute and the column compartment&#xD;
      temperature was set at 30 C. MSMS analysis was completed using the same LC conditions while&#xD;
      targeting specific ions using retention time and m/z values from previous MS runs. After LCMS&#xD;
      analysis completion, raw data files were converted to .xml files using MSConvert. Data was&#xD;
      then mined with mzMine using an intensity minimum value of 1,000 based on a visual inspection&#xD;
      of the total ion chromatogram to remove noise. Blank samples were also ran and the resulting&#xD;
      features were removed from the biological data if present at a ratio under 5:1 in the sample&#xD;
      compared to the blank. Mined data was then input into MetaboAnalyst for statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Tandem MS data was analyzed with Sirius software to identify features.&#xD;
