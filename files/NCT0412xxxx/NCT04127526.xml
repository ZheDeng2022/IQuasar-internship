      Connection to Environment with Cognitive Therapy (CONNECT): A Single-Case Experimental Design&#xD;
      Exploring Dissociative Experiences and Voices&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging empirical evidence has suggested that dissociation is a robust determinant of&#xD;
      voice-hearing in psychosis, and that dissociation mediates the link between trauma and&#xD;
      voices. Despite the emerging evidence-base, targeted therapeutic interventions focusing on&#xD;
      dissociation remain largely untested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to investigate whether targeting dissociation leads to&#xD;
      improvements in distressing voices in people with a history of trauma. This will be done by&#xD;
      delivering an eight session intervention called 'CONNECT' to six individuals within the&#xD;
      Glasgow Psychological Trauma Service (GPTS) who hear voices, have experienced trauma and are&#xD;
      dissociating. The intervention will focus on learning strategies to manage dissociation. It&#xD;
      is hypothesised that reduced levels of dissociation will be associated with reduction in the&#xD;
      frequency and distress associated with hearing voices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a randomized multiple baseline single-case experimental design, meaning&#xD;
      that participants will be randomly allocated to a baseline of two, three or four weeks and&#xD;
      then will begin eight weeks of Connection to Environment Cognitive Therapy (CONNECT). As well&#xD;
      as daily measures during baseline and intervention phases, there will be four assessment&#xD;
      points (baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up). The study will take&#xD;
      approximately three months plus follow-up one month after therapy ends. Individual levels of&#xD;
      dissociation and voices will be compared during baseline and intervention periods using&#xD;
      visual analysis and Tau-U.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will contribute to the evidence-based for dissociation interventions targeting&#xD;
      distressing voices among this population. It serves to investigate the proposed mechanism in&#xD;
      a clinical population using a therapeutic intervention. It will therefore inform clinicians&#xD;
      of the effectiveness and feasibility of using such strategies in clinical practice and may&#xD;
      have good generalizability to practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Purpose and Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will use a single case experimental design (SCED). This approach is common in early&#xD;
           stage studies when exploring whether an intervention creates therapeutic change,&#xD;
           typically by applying multiple measures to investigate the constructs of interest. A&#xD;
           SCED also offers advantages for this type of exploratory research over a randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial (RCT), because of the rich detail in the data and reduced research&#xD;
           costs. Also, because individuals are compared against their own baseline scores, a&#xD;
           smaller sample can be recruited and participants do not need to be matched by age,&#xD;
           education or other variables to have a comparable control group, like in a RCT. For a&#xD;
           targeted intervention, like CONNECT, which is predicted to lead to change in voices,&#xD;
           even after therapy has stopped, a multiple- baseline design is the most appropriate form&#xD;
           of SCED. We will randomize participants to baseline periods of either two, three, or&#xD;
           four weeks before the intervention begins. This increases confidence that any&#xD;
           therapeutic change is more likely to be because of the intervention, not just natural&#xD;
           change over time. Equally, if therapeutic change is demonstrated across participants&#xD;
           allocated to different baseline lengths, we can be confident that it is not the length&#xD;
           of the baseline that is responsible for this effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Importantly, this study has been carefully designed in close partnership with the GPTS&#xD;
           to ensure that it is in line with routine care. Open and close communication between the&#xD;
           main researcher, the field supervisor and the wider team will be important to manage any&#xD;
           ethical issues that may arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims and Hypotheses The aim of the current study is to investigate whether targeting&#xD;
           dissociation through Connection to Environment Cognitive Therapy (CONNECT) is associated&#xD;
           with improvements in distressing voices in people with a history of trauma. It is&#xD;
           hypothesized that reductions in dissociation will lead to improvements in the frequency&#xD;
           and distress associated with hearing voices.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dissociation will significantly reduce following CONNECT therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Voice frequency and distress will significantly reduce following CONNECT therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reductions in dissociation will precede reductions in voice frequency and distress&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - CONNECT therapy will lead to increased perceived movement towards goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Plan of Investigation This study aims to investigate the above hypotheses by delivering&#xD;
           a dissociation intervention to individuals who hear voices and have experienced trauma.&#xD;
           The variables of interest will be monitored and compared within-participants between and&#xD;
           within baseline and intervention phases. Follow-up data will be gathered one month after&#xD;
           therapy. The intervention (CONNection to Environment with Cognitive Therapy:'CONNECT')&#xD;
           was developed incorporating: a) interventions from current literature including previous&#xD;
           work from a case-series of cognitive therapy in clients with trauma, dissociative&#xD;
           experiences and distressing voices delivered in Manchester by Dr Varese and colleagues&#xD;
           and b) interventions used in clinical practice in the GPTS. This information was&#xD;
           gathered by means of a survey which was circulated by the researcher to the Glasgow&#xD;
           Psychological Trauma Service (GPTS) staff in February 2019. The above information was&#xD;
           collated to develop an integrated CONNECT manual that the therapist will utilize.&#xD;
           CONNECT will adopt a 'toolbox' approach to learning strategies aimed to reduce&#xD;
           dissociation and choice of strategies will therefore vary between participants, as this&#xD;
           will be led by their individual preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment and engagement (sessions 1-3) Early phases of intervention will focus on&#xD;
           psych-education/normalization of voice-hearing and dissociative phenomena, and&#xD;
           intervention strategies targeting dissociation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Introducing strategies to target dissociative phenomena/processes (sessions 4-7) This&#xD;
           phase of therapy emphasizes training and practice of skills to manage dissociative&#xD;
           responses and increase perceived controllability of dissociation. This will be a&#xD;
           'toolbox' approach and therefore led by participant preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consolidation (session 8) This session directly follows intervention and focuses on&#xD;
           consolidating prior learnings from intervention phase. This should consist of no&#xD;
           additional learning of strategies to target dissociation. The purpose of this phase is&#xD;
           to consider future care. Focus will therefore be on relapse prevention, risk management&#xD;
           and linking in with other services or clinicians where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Review appointment There will also be a review appointment directly after CONNECT for&#xD;
           the purpose of deciding future care. The field supervisor from the GPTS, Dr Kirsten&#xD;
           Atherton, will be involved in this decision-making process and may also attend the&#xD;
           appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up at 1 month There will be one appointment one month after CONNECT to&#xD;
           re-administer measures and gain qualitative feedback of participation in therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential participants will come into the study via and following their routine&#xD;
           assessment pathway within the GPTS. The experimental intervention would be regarded as a&#xD;
           'phase 1 intervention' within the service. Individuals experiencing voices and&#xD;
           dissociation would be offered the opportunity to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If interested in taking part, the GPTS clinician will (with the individual's consent)&#xD;
           pass on contact information to the main researcher, who will contact participants to&#xD;
           arrange an information sharing appointment. Here, the study will be discussed in full&#xD;
           with reference to the information sheet and any questions will be answered at this&#xD;
           point. If interested in taking part, a follow-up consent appointment will be made&#xD;
           whereby the participant will sign the consent form and fill in screening questionnaires&#xD;
           to ascertain whether the person is suitable for the study based on the below&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Settings and Equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will be carried out during working hours in clinical rooms within the GPTS.&#xD;
           Equipment will include participant information sheets, consent forms, paper copies of&#xD;
           measures, paper, pens and a 'toolkit' consisting of various grounding objects e.g. aroma&#xD;
           oils. A digital voice recorder belonging to the University of Glasgow will be used which&#xD;
           is encrypted and password protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study utilises a randomized multiple baseline Single-Case Experimental Design&#xD;
           (SCED) with assessment at four time points (baseline, start of intervention, end of&#xD;
           intervention and follow-up). Randomisation: Participants will be randomised to baseline&#xD;
           periods of two, three or four weeks using a pre-determined simple randomisation method.&#xD;
           Randomisation will be completed using a computer-generated sequence before recruitment&#xD;
           begins. The researcher will be blind to the baseline allocation until the point of&#xD;
           consent and screening, when the researcher will open a sealed envelope to reveal this.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All sessions will be audio recorded using an encrypted digital recorder provided by the&#xD;
           University of Glasgow. Recordings will be used for supervision purposes to ensure the&#xD;
           intervention is of high quality and to assess for content and fidelity of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interpreters will be accessed as part of routine practice within the GPTS. The&#xD;
           researcher will endeavor to meet with the interpreter before the information sharing&#xD;
           appointment to ensure minimal impact to the study procedure. The researcher will also&#xD;
           endeavor for participants to have the same interpreter for the duration of the study.&#xD;
           The field supervisor has noted this to be feasible within the GPTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tau-U analysis will be used to analyse changes in outcome variables between the four&#xD;
           assessment time-points. Tau-U is a non-parametric rank order correlation statistic with&#xD;
           promising application for SCED research. Visual data analyses will be conducted to&#xD;
           analyse changes between and within phases. Visual analysis is routinely used in SCED&#xD;
           research and will be conducted according to established guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Justification of Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study aims to recruit a sample of six participants. As per SCED methodology, the&#xD;
           participants in this study will serve as their own baseline. Guidelines for SCED&#xD;
           research suggest that change ought to occur across a minimum of three participants, with&#xD;
           a minimum of three time points per participant in order to account for&#xD;
           between-participant variance and chance. Previous case series of a similar nature have&#xD;
           included between nine and ten participants however participants in these studies did not&#xD;
           have as much outcome data as the current study. Each participant in this study will have&#xD;
           outcome data for four assessment points, as well as daily and in-session measures during&#xD;
           baseline and intervention phases, thus having above the required three measures per&#xD;
           phase. However, it is acknowledged that small sample size may result in limited&#xD;
           generalizability to wider population. Therefore, demographic information will be taken&#xD;
           into consideration when interpreting the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Ethical Issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study has undergone ethical review from the West of Scotland Research Ethical&#xD;
           Committee (REC) and received approval (REC Reference: 19/WS/0125).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Dissemination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be submitted as part of the Doctorate in Clinical Psychology and will be&#xD;
      read by staff from the Institute of Health and Wellbeing as well as external examiners. This&#xD;
      work will be published in an academic journal, presented at conferences, and other clinical&#xD;
      forums. As CONNECT is a new therapy, individual case reports may also be written and&#xD;
      published in an academic journal to look at the feasibility and applicability of this therapy&#xD;
      in more depth. Dissemination plans will be discussed with participants who will receive a&#xD;
      summary of the results upon completion.&#xD;
