  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-randomized, multi-center, longitudinal study of healthy subjects and subjects with PAD&#xD;
      who are scheduled for ABI, TBI, and either Duplex Ultrasound or Angiographic assessments in a&#xD;
      vascular clinic.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for peripheral vascular examination and healthy controls will be measured&#xD;
      with the FlowMet-R, a noninvasive blood flow monitor, and compared to gold standard&#xD;
      diagnostics - ABI, TBI, and Doppler Ultrasound. Sensitivity and specificity of the FlowMet-R&#xD;
      device output in diagnosing PAD and CLI will be assessed on initial visit, 3-month followup,&#xD;
      and 6-month followup.&#xD;
