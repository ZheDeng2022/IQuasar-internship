  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present work is to study platelet indices ( platelet count - mean platelet&#xD;
      volume - platelet distribution width ) as noninvasive predictors in decompensated post&#xD;
      hepatitic liver cirrhosis .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is an advanced liver disease characterized by fibrosis and alteration in hepatic&#xD;
      architecture with the development of structurally anomalous nodules . Ascites is a condition&#xD;
      in which pathological collection of fluid occurs within the peritoneal cavity mainly because&#xD;
      of portal hypertension. It is a major complication of liver cirrhosis, The appearance of&#xD;
      ascites in cirrhotic patients indicates a poor prognosis , Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis&#xD;
      is a severe infection, commonly occurring in cirrhotic ascitic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets are attributed to preserve hemostasis. Yet, recently, there has been growing&#xD;
      recognition that they also play an essential role in inflammatory and immune response.&#xD;
      Platelets release prothrombotic and proinflammatory agents and participate in the induction&#xD;
      and advancement of vascular and inflammatory disorders . Larger-sized platelets contain many&#xD;
      granules, and are therefore more efficient in their hemostatic and proinflammatory actions .&#xD;
      This is why the mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) are worth&#xD;
      considering as potential tests for platelet function and activation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MPV and PWD can be calculated using almost all automated hematology analyzers. The MPV&#xD;
      indicates the average platelet size in femtoliters. The PDW, reflecting homogeneity of&#xD;
      platelet size, is calculated from the MPV by the equation (SD of platelet volume divided by&#xD;
      MPVÃ—100) or the distribution width at 20% frequency .&#xD;
