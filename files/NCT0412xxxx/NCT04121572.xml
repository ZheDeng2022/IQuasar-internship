  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis is one of the important and life-threatening pathophysiological changes in&#xD;
      DKA and its monitoring is essential. It is known that the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in&#xD;
      the blood is correlating with the degree of metabolic acidosis. The CO2 level can be measured&#xD;
      via the exhaled air by nasal cannula capnography (EtCO2) which is currently utilized to&#xD;
      monitor the patient ventilation in many situations. Our primary objective is to study the&#xD;
      degree of correlation between continuous EtCO2 monitoring and the severity of metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis in blood gas measurement in patients with diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA). Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are: ability of EtCO2 in ruling in or out DKA; discriminating the different&#xD;
      severity grades of DKA. It is a cross-sectional, observational, prospective cohort study in&#xD;
      convenience sample of children presenting with clinical manifestations consistent with DKA.&#xD;
      Will be conducted in pediatric Emergency Center, Hamad General Hospital. Will include all DKA&#xD;
      patients and excluding any condition or medication that affect the acid-base status.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in pediatric emergency center, Hamad General Hospital, a&#xD;
      recognized academic institution, in Doha, Qatar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DKA was defined as: hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt;11 mmol/L or 200 mg/dL), venous pH &lt;7.3&#xD;
      and/ or bicarbonate &lt;15 mmol/L, and the association with, ketonemia, and ketonuria. The&#xD;
      severity of DKA is categorized as mild (venous pH &lt;7.3 or bicarbonate &lt;15 mmol/L), moderate&#xD;
      (venous pH &lt;7.2 or bicarbonate &lt; 10 mmol/L) and severe (venous pH &lt; 7.1 or bicarbonate &lt;5&#xD;
      mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are all children with already known or newly diagnosed diabetics,&#xD;
      regardless weather has been enrolled in previous encounter or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients with the following criteria are excluded: older than 14 years of age, airway&#xD;
      obstruction, chest infection, complex congenital heart disease, Congestive heart failure,&#xD;
      central or peripheral neurological disorders, hyper/hypothermia, and sever pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians and nurses, and research assistance staff will be trained in the use of nasal&#xD;
      capnography including the proper size, connection and wave forms shapes and its&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
