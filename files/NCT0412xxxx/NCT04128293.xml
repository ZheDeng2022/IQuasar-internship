  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose, four-period, four sequential, and crossover study&#xD;
      conducted to assess the relative bioavailability of GSK3640254 mesylate tablets and&#xD;
      GSK3640254 mesylate capsules (in the presence of a moderate fat meal). This study will also&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of food (fasted, moderate fat meal, and high fat meal) on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of GSK3640254 mesylate tablet formulation. Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive a single dose of GSK3640254 200 milligram (mg) capsules under moderate fat&#xD;
      conditions and GSK3640254 200 mg tablets under moderate fat, fasted and high fat conditions&#xD;
      in each treatment period. Approximately 16 participants will be enrolled and the duration of&#xD;
      the study will be approximately 54 days.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>This was a randomized, open-label, single dose, 4 period crossover study in healthy participants conducted at a single center in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 16 participants were enrolled in this study. The study was early terminated by sponsor due to a potential contamination issue in the study drug after completion of treatment Period 2. Hence, treatment Periods 3 and 4 were not conducted.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Urine samples were collected to analyze the urine parameter: pH. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0 - 6.0).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameters: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and platelet count. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits, prior to the first dose of study drug administration. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

          <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameters: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and platelet count. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits, prior to the first dose of study drug administration. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameter: Erythrocytes Mean Corpuscular Volume</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the hematology parameter: erythrocytes mean corpuscular volume. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits, prior to the first dose of study drug administration. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the chemistry parameters: creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, ALT, ALP, AST and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits, prior to the first dose of study drug administration. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urinalysis Parameter: pH</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected to analyze the urinalysis parameter: pH. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0 - 6.0). Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits, prior to the first dose of study drug administration. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PR Interval, QRS Duration, QT Interval, QTcF, QTcB</title>
        <description>Twelve-lead ECGs were obtained to measure PR Interval, QRS Duration, QT Interval, QTcF Interval and QTcB Interval. Twelve-lead ECGs were performed with the participant in a supine or semi-supine position after a rest of at least 10 minutes. Baseline was defined as the average of the triplicate pre-dose assessments within each treatment. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Pulse rate was measured in the semi-recumbent position with a completely automated device after at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without any distractions. Baseline was defined as the average of the triplicate pre-dose assessments within each treatment.
