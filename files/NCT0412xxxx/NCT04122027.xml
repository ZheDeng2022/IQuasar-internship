    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage liver&#xD;
      diseases. Although with continuous advancement in technology, it remains a high-risk&#xD;
      operation. The goal of LT is not only ensure survival of the patients but also to restore&#xD;
      them back to their pre-morbid state with a good quality of life. Neurological sequelae can&#xD;
      have major impact on postoperative outcomes after LT and yet the reported literature is&#xD;
      scarce. Studies from Western countries showed some evidence on the use of cerebral oximtery&#xD;
      in cardiac surgery to prevent neurological mishaps. LT shares similar intra-operative&#xD;
      fluctuation of the haemodynamices as in cardiac surgery, causing disturbances in regional&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation and theorectically cerebral oximetry should be of great value as well in&#xD;
      LT surgery. Data from a large randomised controlled trial is lacking from the current&#xD;
      literatures. We therefore propose a prospective randomized controlled trial on the use of&#xD;
      this device in adult LT and see whether its use could reduce neurological mishaps.&#xD;

      Liver Transplant Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving procedure for patients with&#xD;
      end-stage liver disease. Despite continuous advancement in technology, it remains a high-risk&#xD;
      operation. The building-up of an oxygen debt during LT can lead to an increased risk of poor&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes (1, 2). Furthermore, patients with acute liver failure or end-stage&#xD;
      liver disease are prone to hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to disturbance of&#xD;
      auto-regulation in the brain, which may eventually cause cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia.&#xD;
      Irresversible metabolic disturbances can impair cerebral auto-regulation, causing poor&#xD;
      neurological outcomes after LT (3). The prevalence of encephalopathy, delirium and stroke in&#xD;
      transplant recipients is 12-40% (3). Hypotheses for these conditions include prolonged stay&#xD;
      in the intensive care unit (ICU) (so-called &quot;ICU psychosis&quot;), the use of Tacrolimus (4),&#xD;
      rapid correction of hyponatraemia (5) and impaired cerebral auto-regulation (3), but no&#xD;
      definite conclusion can be made most of the time. Among these hypotheses, impairment of&#xD;
      cerebral auto-regulation has never been documented in large clinical trials for Chinese&#xD;
      patients in LT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral oximetry (Near infra-red spectroscopy, NIRS) There is no &quot;gold standard&quot; for&#xD;
      measuring cerebral auto-regulation. Monitoring of the brain oxygenation, such as direct&#xD;
      tissue O2 tension and jugular bulb O2 saturation, has been used as a surrogate of&#xD;
      auto-regulation but it is invasive. Transcranial laser Doppler (TCD) of the middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery has been validated in healthy volunteers as well as real patients as a good&#xD;
      measurement of cerebral blood flow (6, 7). Similarly, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a&#xD;
      non-invasive and continuous method, can also monitor the regional cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      (rScO2) and is increasingly used in cardiac surgery. A previous report has validated the use&#xD;
      of NIRS when compared to TCD, as the latter requires a trained technician to monitor and&#xD;
      supervise. NIRS provides a timely, real-time, inexpensive, easily measurable alternative to&#xD;
      TCD, and thus should have a great potential for clinical usage in LT. Similar to other&#xD;
      non-invasive oximetry (e.g. pulse oximetry), measurement can be done through adhesive tapes&#xD;
      over bilateral forehead and connected to the machine (INVOSâ„¢ 5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter&#xD;
      by Covidien). This system is the ONLY cerebral/somatic oximetry system with FDA cleared&#xD;
      improved outcome claims (8). Plachky et al. showed that 50% of patients demonstrated a&#xD;
      decline in cerebral oxygen saturation when clamping of the vessles during LT and it had&#xD;
      positive correlation with the postoperative cerebral disrubances (9). Nonetheless, the&#xD;
      clinical application for patients undergoing LT is scarce and its application is novel. The&#xD;
      use of this technology may potenitally be limited by the presence of high levels of bilirubin&#xD;
      acting as a chromophore interferring with its data acquistion. However, in a pilot study of 9&#xD;
      patients who underwent LT investigators using this technology were able to demonstrate that 3&#xD;
      out of 9 patients had either transient or persistent impaired auto regulation throughout the&#xD;
      operation. This in turn was associated with higher Model of End-Stage Disease Score (MELD)&#xD;
      &gt;15 (p=0.015), more postoperative seizures and stroke (P&lt;0.0001) (3). A recent systematic&#xD;
      review (10) of 901 Caucasians from 24 publications showing a decrease in NIRS (&gt;15% relative&#xD;
      to baseline) could have impaired postoperative cognitive function (28 versus 26; MMSE) and&#xD;
      reduced LOS (14 versus 23 days) in open surgery. In the field of LT, impaired cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation (25%), cerebral deoxygenation in the anhepatic phase (36%) and cerebral&#xD;
      hyperoxygenation with reperfusion of the grafted liver (14%) were identified by NIRS and&#xD;
      could lead to adverse neurological outcome such as seizures, transient hemiparesis and&#xD;
      stroke. Nonetheless, no large prospective randomized trial and no Chinese cohort were&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
