    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, Phase 1, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      PK, and PD profiles of AGEN2373 as a monotherapy and in combination with Balstilimab&#xD;
      (AGEN2034), and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in subjects with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study will enroll up to approximately 86 evaluable adult subjects with&#xD;
      refractory cancer (solid tumors) regardless of diagnosis. Subjects may be enrolled into the&#xD;
      following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of a 3+3 dose escalation that will evaluate different combination dose&#xD;
      levels of AGEN2373 monotherapy and in combination with Balstilimab (AGEN2034). Each subject&#xD;
      will stay on the dose level at a schedule assigned at trial entry. Subjects can be replaced&#xD;
      for any reason other than a DLT. Subjects will receive treatment for ≤ 2 years or until PD,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal of trial&#xD;
      occurs.&#xD;
