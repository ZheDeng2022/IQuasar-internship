  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 12-week oral&#xD;
      CXA-10 therapy in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension, with additional evaluation&#xD;
      on the clinical efficacy of oral CXA-10 on changes in hemodynamics, exercise capacity,&#xD;
      cardiovascular function and patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, one-arm, open-label proof of concept safety study and a phase 2a&#xD;
      proof of efficacy pre- and post-assessment study of oral CXA-10 for the treatment of&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that administration of CXA-10 for 12 weeks will improves&#xD;
      exercise capacity, cardiovascular function and health related quality of life in pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension patients with limited toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be scheduled&#xD;
      within 4 weeks of screening to receive oral CXA-10 at the dose of 300 mg once daily followed&#xD;
      by 12 weeks of open-label CXA-10 treatment and then a 4-week safety follow-up. Additional&#xD;
      follow-up assessments by telephone will occur in between each outpatient clinic visit.&#xD;
