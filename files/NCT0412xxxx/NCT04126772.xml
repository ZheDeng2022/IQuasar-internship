      Objective: To establish the QSM-MRI-method as a part of MS-patient research protocol in TPC&#xD;
      and to quantify the time and space dependent correlation of QSM-MRI signal and PET-imaging&#xD;
      signal with both 11C-PK11195 and 11C-SMW139 radioligands in the brain of MS-patients with&#xD;
      active disease, secondary progressive MS-patients and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: In MS brain the inflammatory lesions change over time from active to chronic&#xD;
      active and finally to chronic inactive plaques. Conventional MRI-imaging is used to detect&#xD;
      the lesions but it is not able to differentiate the plaque types. The most acute lesions with&#xD;
      blood-brain-barrier defect can be identified using conventional MRI and gadolinium enhancing,&#xD;
      but follow-up of the later plaque development with microglial activation at plaque edge is&#xD;
      not possible using MRI. Furthermore, the diffuse microglial activation in the NAWM is not&#xD;
      detectable with conventional MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies it has been shown that chronic active plaques have a rim of active&#xD;
      microglial cells around them. With QSM-MRI method it is possible to detect and quantify these&#xD;
      iron containing active microglia cells around the chronic active plaque. Active microglial&#xD;
      cells can also be detected with PET imaging and TSPO-binding radioligand 11C-PK11195 or P2X7&#xD;
      binding radioligand 11C-SMW139. The investigators expect that the microglial activation&#xD;
      signals detected with QSM-MRI and PET are co-localized and that these methods would help to&#xD;
      differentiate the plaque types and to evaluate the MS plaque evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 10 MS-patients with acute gadolinium enhancing â‰¥0,5cm diameter lesion will&#xD;
      be imaged at baseline and 4 and 18 months after that. For comparison 10 secondary progressive&#xD;
      patients and 20 healthy controls will be imaged at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Clinical evaluation, brain QSM-MRI and PET imaging with 11C-PK11195 radiotracer will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline, 4 months and 18 months. PET imaging with 11C-CSMW139 radiotracer&#xD;
      will be performed at 4 months and 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthy controls, brain QSM-MRI, PET imaging with 11C-PK11195 radiotracer and PET imaging&#xD;
      with 11C-SMW139 radiotracer will be performed at baseline. For 12 healthy controls a&#xD;
      test-retest imaging with 11C-SMW139 radiotracer will be performed.&#xD;

The total score is calculated by adding up the answer from each item and divide by 9. Lower scores indicate better outcomes. Maximum score is 7.</description>
