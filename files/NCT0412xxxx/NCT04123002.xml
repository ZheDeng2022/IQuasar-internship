      The study design would be a cross over randomized clinical trial. The study sample would be&#xD;
      selected from the regular dental patients visiting the Faculty of Dentistry, Kuwait&#xD;
      University, Kuwait. The subjects of our study are patients with &gt;24 teeth who are&#xD;
      physically/mentally healthy and those who were diagnosed with gingivitis. There will be an&#xD;
      initial screening of the subjects, where patients would be briefed on the study components&#xD;
      and informed consent would be obtained from those who are willing to participate in this&#xD;
      study. The study subjects would be randomly divided into two groups; Group 1 subjects would&#xD;
      be instructed to brush their teeth two times per day, in the morning and in the evening&#xD;
      before going to the bed, and to refrain from using a miswak during this period. Group 2&#xD;
      subjects would receive the same instructions as Group 1 subject, but, in addition, they would&#xD;
      also be instructed to use miswak chewing sticks two times a day. All the participants would&#xD;
      then be given instructions on how to use miswak and toothbrush by the investigators. A sample&#xD;
      size of 20 was considered sufficient to conduct this study. The socio-demographic details of&#xD;
      the study participants would be obtained from the electronic dental records. Plaque index and&#xD;
      gingival bleeding index would be taken at baseline and on day 14. Plaque samples would be&#xD;
      collected at baseline - before and after the intervention (tooth brushing/miswak), day 3, day&#xD;
      7 and day 14. The oral plaque samples would be sent for PCR analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized assignment of the subjects regarding the order of miswak and toothbrush would be&#xD;
      carried out, by a random binary outcome of a dice, even or odd numbers. Group 1 subjects&#xD;
      would be given a new toothbrush (regular, straight handled Oral-B toothbrush). Group 2&#xD;
      subjects would also be given a new toothbrush (regular, straight handled Oral-B toothbrush)&#xD;
      as well as 14 fresh sticks of miswak (20 cm in length and 7mm in width) to be used daily.&#xD;
      Then the groups would be crossed over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection procedure and Purification of Microbes Subgingival and supragingival&#xD;
      plaques samples would be collected using a sterile universal curette. Subgingival plaque&#xD;
      samples would be collected from the deepest periodontal pocket. The sampling area would be&#xD;
      isolated from saliva and gently dried with air. The point would be then immersed in 0.5 ml&#xD;
      sterile distilled water in Eppendorf tubes (epTIPS Standard, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany).&#xD;
      The collected samples would be then sent to the Microbiology Laboratory, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Kuwait University and PCR analysis would be conducted to identify the strains.&#xD;
