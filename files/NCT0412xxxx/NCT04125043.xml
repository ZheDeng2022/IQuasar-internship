  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the Red Reflex Test&#xD;
      (RRT), with and without dilation, for early detection of ocular abnormalities in children and&#xD;
      newborns. The RRT functions by shining a light from an ophthalmoscope into a participant's&#xD;
      eye and noting the presence or absence of a red glow. Despite its use in pediatric clinics&#xD;
      for years, this test at times fails to detect significant ocular diseases, especially located&#xD;
      in the back of the eye, threatening visual development in this population. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to quantify the utility of this test as a tool for screening by comparing&#xD;
      these findings on RRT with those of retinal photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the sensitivity and specificity of the RRT will be&#xD;
      sufficient for detecting anterior segment pathology but will be insufficient for detecting&#xD;
      posterior segment pathology with or without dilation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients will be recruited through clinical practice at the designated study sites.&#xD;
      Participants with known anterior segment or posterior segment pathology will be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion. Patients who have a history of disease, treatments and/or surgical procedures&#xD;
      affecting the ability for normal pupillary reaction are excluded. An equal number of age&#xD;
      matched participants with a normal anterior and posterior segment exam will be recruited from&#xD;
      routine outpatient ophthalmology clinic appointments. Informed consent will be obtained and&#xD;
      will include an option to be considered for medical photography. Participants may opt out of&#xD;
      photography and still be included in the study. For Spanish speaking participants, an&#xD;
      interpreter will be used for study recruitment and informed consent. A Spanish informed&#xD;
      consent (developed by a Spanish medical translator from our English written consent) will be&#xD;
      provided. Current estimated number of subjects required for the study is 200 total including&#xD;
      100 controls. Patient charts will be accessed from date of birth to patient's current age&#xD;
      using either Cerner or Epic depending on the study site location. Examiners will include&#xD;
      ophthalmology residents with one completed year of ophthalmology training. They will be&#xD;
      blinded to participants' ophthalmologic history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pupil size will be recorded under ambient lighting conditions and the red reflex test (RRT)&#xD;
      performed at 18 cm using a direct ophthalmoscope (Welch Allyn 11710 or similar). Each eye&#xD;
      will then be inspected individually at 1 cm. Examiner description of the pupillary reflex in&#xD;
      terms of color, brightness, and the presence or absence of potential anterior/posterior&#xD;
      segment abnormality will be recorded using a standardized survey tool. The exam room lights&#xD;
      will then be turned off and the pupils examined again with the direct ophthalmoscope&#xD;
      according to the standard RRT procedure and results recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, pharmacological dilation will be achieved according to standard practices. For all&#xD;
      patients, one drop of proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution will be instilled in&#xD;
      each eye to achieve anesthesia. For patients under 1 year old, one drop of Cyclomydril will&#xD;
      then be instilled in each eye and followed second drop in each eye 5 minutes later. For&#xD;
      children over 1 year of age, pharmacologic dilation will be achieved with 1 drop of&#xD;
      Cyclopentolate 1% and 1 drop of Phenylephrine 2.5% in each eye. The RRT will be repeated by&#xD;
      the same examiner, including the lights on and lights off portions of the exam, and the&#xD;
      results recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be de-identified and results will be stored on a password protected Children's&#xD;
      National Hospital computer and pertinent statistical analyses will be perform to asses our&#xD;
      hypothesis. All statistical tests will be performed at the 5% level of significance unless&#xD;
      otherwise stated.&#xD;
