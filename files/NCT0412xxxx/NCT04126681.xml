  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of HQP1351 in patients with chronic&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) who are resistant and/or intolerant to first- and&#xD;
      second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The efficacy of HQP1351 is determined by&#xD;
      evaluating the subjects' event free survival (EFS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, open label, pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of HQP1351 in CML CP patients who are resistant and/or intolerant to first- and&#xD;
      second-generation TKIs in China. A total of 141 CML CP patients will be included in this&#xD;
      study. After screening, eligible subjects will be randomized by 2:1 ratio to enter HQP1351&#xD;
      therapy cohort and best available therapy (BAT) cohort. When the subjects in the two cohorts&#xD;
      reach EFS assessment, they can crossover to contralateral cohort if the investigator and&#xD;
      Sponsor think they could be clinically benefited. During treatment, each subject will be&#xD;
      assessed regularly for hematological, cytogenetic and molecular responses. At the same time,&#xD;
      safety information also will be evaluated.&#xD;
