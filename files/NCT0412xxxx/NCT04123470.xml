    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate safety and effect of combining an oncolytic adenovirus&#xD;
      (delolimogene mupadenorepvec; LOAd703) with atezolizumab in patients with melanoma. LOAd703&#xD;
      will be administered intratumorally for up to 12 injections while atezolizumab will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously for the duration of the active study visits (up to 57 weeks). The&#xD;
      patients are then monitored for survival for maximum study participation of 48 months. The&#xD;
      treatments will be given every 3 weeks. The patients will then be monitored for toxicity, PK,&#xD;
      ADA, immune responses, virus shedding, tumor response by RECIST 1.1 and survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, multicenter trial. This study aims to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      effect of combining an oncolytic adenovirus (delolimogene mupadenorepvec; LOAd703) with&#xD;
      atezolizumab in patients with melanoma. Patients will receive up to 12 LOAd703 intratumoral&#xD;
      treatments in combination with intravenous infusions of atezolizumab. LOAd703 will be tested&#xD;
      at two dose levels to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LOAd703 evaluated in the&#xD;
      study using a BOIN design. The LOAd703 dose can be divided for intratumoral injection into as&#xD;
      many as 3 tumor lesions. Atezolizumab will be tested at a fixed dose. At least 25 response&#xD;
      evaluable patients will be enrolled at the MTD for evaluation of their response using&#xD;
      binominal testing. The maximum number of evaluable patients in the study is 35. The patients&#xD;
      will then be monitored for toxicity, PK, ADA, immune responses, virus shedding, tumor&#xD;
      response by RECIST 1.1 and survival.&#xD;
