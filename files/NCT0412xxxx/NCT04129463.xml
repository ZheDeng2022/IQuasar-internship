      Purpose: To evaluate a new modification for surgical treatment of Buphthalmous using&#xD;
      subscleral trabeculectomy (SST) with iris incarceration Design: Prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      consecutive interventional comparative study. Setting: Ophthalmology department, Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine, Minia University, 61519, El-Minia, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a prospective study of eyes of 40 eyes with buphthalmous in 25 child 15 bilateral&#xD;
      and 10 with unilateral Buphthalmous divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (20 eyes ) those underwent&#xD;
      subscleral trabeculectomy (SST) with iris incarceration a new modification to SST and group 2&#xD;
      conventional rigid trabeculotomy through a period of 4 years between Jan., 2015 and Feb.,&#xD;
      2019. Patient's data of 2 years follow-up were recorded. The primary outcomes were the mean&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP) control in which complete success was defined as an IOP ≤18 mm Hg&#xD;
      without the use of anti-glaucoma drugs and a qualified success when medications were used to&#xD;
      reach this target and times of another surgical interference till reach IOP control. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes were studding bleb formation, the change in corneal diameter (CD), cup&#xD;
      disc ratio (C/D) , and axial length (AXL)&#xD;

      Subjects and Methods This was a prospective study of eyes of 40 eyes with Buphthalmous in 25&#xD;
      infants (15 bilateral and 10 with unilateral) divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (20 eyes) those&#xD;
      underwent Subscleral trabeculectomy (SST) with iris incarceration a new modification to SST&#xD;
      and group 2 conventional rigid trabeculotomy through a period of 4 years between Jan., 2015&#xD;
      and Feb., 2019. The local board committee approved the study as well as all patients'&#xD;
      relatives signed consent and the study was in agreement with Declaration of Helsinki Tents.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes were the mean intraocular pressure (IOP) measured under General&#xD;
      Anesthesia (GA) and the number of repeated surgical intervention. Complete success was&#xD;
      defined as an IOP ≤18 mm Hg without the use of anti-glaucoma drugs, a qualified success when&#xD;
      medications were used to reach this target and failure if the target IOP would not be reached&#xD;
      in spite of full anti-glaucoma medication and the infant needs another anti-glaucoma&#xD;
      procedure and the number of repeated surgical intervention were recorded. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were studding bleb formation, the change in corneal diameter (CD), cup disc ratio&#xD;
      (C/D), and axial length (AXL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative examinations: History taking including, age, sex, laterality, family history and&#xD;
      consanguinity, anti-glaucoma drugs. Ophthalmological examinations were done under GA,&#xD;
      includes slit lamp examination, corneal clarity, horizontal corneal diameter, fundus&#xD;
      examination and measurement of cup disc ratio, IOP with Perkins tonometer, and axial length&#xD;
      by ultrasonography. The demographic data were registered as in (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures were done by one of the Authors under GA. In group 1 SST with iris&#xD;
      incarceration Steps in brief:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clear corneal traction suture by vicryl 7/0 in the superior peripheral part 1 mm from&#xD;
           the limbus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conjunctival peritomy with fornix based conjunctival flap was done in the upper temporal&#xD;
           quadrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Half thickness rectangular scleral flab 3.5 x 4.5 mm was constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paracentesis to lower IOP and allows reformation of anterior chamber when needed and&#xD;
           check filtration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block trabeculectomy were done manually by knife and vannas scissors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iris incarceration was done by cutting the iris into 2 pillars, one pillar incarcerated&#xD;
           under the scleral flap and the other one reposted with iris repositor resulting in&#xD;
           inverted coma shaped pupil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scleral flap was closed with interrupted 10/0 nylon suture and Conjunctival flap with&#xD;
           contentious 10/0 nylon suture then injection of subconjunctival steroid, antibiotic and&#xD;
           eye dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 2 trabeculotomy Steps in brief:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conjunctival peritomy with fornix based Conjunctival flap was done in the upper temporal&#xD;
           quadrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Superficial rectangular scleral flab 3.5 x 4.5 mm and then small triangular deep scleral&#xD;
           flab (modified technique) with deroofing of Schlemm's canal anteriorly to the scleral&#xD;
           spur were done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radial incision into the scleral bed and cutting Schlemm's canal, exposure of its&#xD;
           opening and dilatation of the ostia by injection of Healon or trabeculotome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paracentesis to lower IOP allows reformation of anterior chamber when needed and check&#xD;
           filtration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hans's trabeculotome was inserted into Schlemm's canal from one side and centripetal&#xD;
           rupture of the canal through trabecular meshwork into the anterior chamber about 70- 90&#xD;
           degree and repeated on the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scleral flap was closed with interrupted 10/0 nylon suture and Conjunctival flap with&#xD;
           contentious 10/0 nylon suture then injection of subconjunctival steroid, antibiotic and&#xD;
           eye dressing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were prescribed topical tobradex (tobramycin- dexamethasone) eye drops QID and&#xD;
      tapering through 4-6 weeks and Vigamox (moxifloxacin 0.3 mg, Alcon Co) eye drops QID for 2&#xD;
      weeks. Scheduled follow up visits were advised next postoperative day, one week, monthly for&#xD;
      three months then each three months for 2 years. Each visit the child subjected to full&#xD;
      ophthalmological examinations previously mentioned and antiglaucoma medications were&#xD;
      prescribed when needed (IOP&gt;18 mmHg) or glaucoma progression starting by one drug beta&#xD;
      blockers and adding dorzolamide or prostaglandin to reach the target IOP. Another glaucoma&#xD;
      procedure were done if the IOP &gt; 18 mmHg with maximum tolerated medication. Patient's data of&#xD;
      the 2 years follow-up were recorded. The results of one week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1&#xD;
      year and 2 years were included in the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected, for statistical analysis done by using SPSS statistical package version&#xD;
      20. Descriptive statistics for the (mean ±SD) were done. Paired student's t-test was used for&#xD;
      comparison of two related parameters preoperative and postoperative. For all tests (P value)&#xD;
      was considered significant if &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
