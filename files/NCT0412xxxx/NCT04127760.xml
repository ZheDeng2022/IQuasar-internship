  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy is a key component of comprehensive treatment of&#xD;
      meningioma. However, for atypical meningioma after total resection, there is still a huge&#xD;
      controversy in patients who need adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many scholars have focused on this problem and carried out some small-scale retrospective&#xD;
      studies, but they have contradictory results. Some of the studies found that postoperative&#xD;
      adjuvant radiotherapy could not improve the prognosis of patients, but was questioned because&#xD;
      the sample size was too small, resulting in insignificant results, while other studies found&#xD;
      that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy can improve progression free survival. A study based&#xD;
      on the National Cancer Database found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and gross&#xD;
      tumor resection are associated with a good prognosis. A recent meta-analysis enrolled a total&#xD;
      of 757 patients and found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy reduced the risk of tumor&#xD;
      recurrence but did not improve survival time. Our team reviewed the meningioma data in the&#xD;
      SEER database and conducted a study previously. The study found that postoperative adjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy did not improve the overall survival of these patients. The relevant research&#xD;
      results were recently published in Frontiers in oncology. We further reviewed and summarized&#xD;
      the single-center data of our hospital and found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy&#xD;
      could not improve the progression free survival and overall survival of patients. Besides, we&#xD;
      also performed a meta-analysis and found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy had a trend&#xD;
      to improve progression-free survival, but there was no statistical difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there are many deficiencies in previous researches, and the research results are also&#xD;
      contradictory, it is still unclear whether patients with atypical meningioma who have&#xD;
      undergone gross total resection can benefit from postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. Further&#xD;
      high quality clinical trials is still needed to be conducted in order to guide the&#xD;
      postoperative care of patients. Therefore, we intend to conduct this multicenter randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to determine the value of postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with atypical meningioma who underwent gross total resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to enroll a total of 140 participants. Subjects would be enrolled with the&#xD;
      following information: name, age, gender, contact, KPS score, preoperative ASA score, current&#xD;
      ECOG score, tumor location, date of surgery, degree of tumor resection (modified Simpson&#xD;
      grade), pathology type, Ki-67 Proliferation index, etc. The preoperative magnetic resonance&#xD;
      image of the subject is stored. Tissue specimens are genetically examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a simple randomization method and random assignment in a 1:1 ratio, a random sequence&#xD;
      was first generated, and SAS version 9.1 statistical software was used to generate an&#xD;
      allocation sequence table including subject numbers, 140 random numbers, and random&#xD;
      groupings. 140 Subjects would be assigned to the test group (n=70) and the control group&#xD;
      (n=70) in a 1:1 ratio. The table of the assignment sequence is duplicated and saved by the&#xD;
      neurosurgical secretary and the trial designer of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang&#xD;
      University. The secretary puts the group mark into the 140 opaque kraft envelopes with the&#xD;
      serial number 1 to 140 according to the order of the allocation sequence table, and submits&#xD;
      them to the test designer. Zhige Guo is responsible for enrolling the participants according&#xD;
      to the inclusion criteria, assigning the subjects numbers according to the order of the&#xD;
      treatment, and Qiang Zeng is responsible for disassembling the corresponding opaque envelopes&#xD;
      according to the number of the subjects, and exerting interventions according to the group&#xD;
      marks. Chenhan Ling is responsible for follow-up and regular measurement of various&#xD;
      indicators, and Fei Dong is responsible for the images reports. Until the end of the trial,&#xD;
      Zhige Guo, Chenhan Ling and Fei Dong would not know the grouping of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test level of the study was α=0.05, and the two-sided test was used. All statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed by SPSS 16.0 statistical software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For PFS, OS, and DSS data, the COX proportional hazards model was used to calculate the&#xD;
           hazard ratio (HR) of radiotherapy and to assess the statistical difference between the&#xD;
           corresponding prognostic data between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For the 3-year progression-free survival, 3-year survival rate, and 5-year&#xD;
           progression-free survival, 5-year survival rate data, the chi-square test was used to&#xD;
           compare the differences between the two groups.&#xD;
