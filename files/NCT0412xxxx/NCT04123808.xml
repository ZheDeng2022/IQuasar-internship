      This study aims to assess whether the NeuroLutions Upper Extremity Rehabilitation System&#xD;
      (known as IpsiHand) will help stroke patients regain strength and functional movements in&#xD;
      their arm. The IpsiHand system involves using a hand robotic device that is controlled by&#xD;
      brain waves, known as a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). By using the device, participants&#xD;
      will be harnessing brainwaves from the side of their brain not affected by stroke to control&#xD;
      the robotic device on the hand that is weaker from the stroke.&#xD;

      This trial aims to assess the effectiveness of the NeuroLutions Upper Extremity&#xD;
      Rehabilitation System, known as IpsiHand, on functional motor recovery and neuroplasticity&#xD;
      for chronic stroke survivors with hemiparesis (N=27). The IpsiHand system involves a&#xD;
      Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) as a control for a robotic hand orthosis. Participants will&#xD;
      complete 16-32 weeks of home therapy with the IpsiHand system.&#xD;

    <masking_description>An occupational therapist independent to the study will review and score 2 outcome measures (Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test). The study coordinator will randomize the order of the videos for each participant, so that the outcome assessor will not know which time point they are scoring. In other words, the video-outcome assessor will be blinded to the order of the assessments as they are scoring them but will not be blinded to the intervention as all participants will be receiving the same intervention.</masking_description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke for Upper Extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 3 months post no device use</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer is a scale that measures capacity of the arm. There are 33 items that evaluate reflexes, active movement, grasp patterns, speed, and coordination of the arm and hand. Each item is scored from 0-2, with a maximum total score of 66. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Research Arm Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 3 months post no device use</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT is a scale that measures activity participation of the arm. There are 19 items that several types of grasps, grips, pinches, and gross movements of the arm and hand. Each item is scored from 0-3, with a maximum total score of 57. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <measure>Box and Block Test</measure>

    <description>The Box and Block Test measures the number of blocks a participant can pick up and place over a patrician in 1 minute. The number of blocks successfully moved are counted and a higher number indicates better performance.</description>

    <description>The IpsiHand system utilizes a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) as a control for a robotic hand orthosis donned on the affected upper extremity as participants are guided through a rehabilitation program on a tablet. Participants will complete 16-32 weeks of home therapy with the IpsiHand system. Motor function of their impaired upper extremity will be evaluated at baseline, at 4-week intervals, and 3 months post no-device use, to track progress.</description>
