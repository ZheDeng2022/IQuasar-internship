  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The outcome of ischemic stroke is related to the brain lesion volume and this&#xD;
      volume of infarction is directly related to the time to reperfusion, which therefore depends&#xD;
      on the time to initiation of therapy. Acute ischemic stroke is treated medically with the&#xD;
      administration of intravenous rtPA, but recent randomized controlled trials have shown the&#xD;
      efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy and is now the new gold standard in ischemic stroke. This&#xD;
      new therapeutic strategy has created two possibilities for pre-hospital decision-making: i/&#xD;
      transport the patient directly to the nearest stroke unit to receive alteplase and then if&#xD;
      indicated perform a thrombectomy (drip and ship) or ii/ bypassing thrombolysis centres in&#xD;
      favour of endovascular thrombectomy (mothership).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare cost/effectiveness of transfer to the closest local stroke centre or&#xD;
      telemedicine hub to direct transfer to the comprehensive stroke cent(CSC) in patients acute&#xD;
      stroke with suspected large vessel occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and economic expected impact: We hypothesize that direct transportation to CSC is&#xD;
      associated with better clinical outcome in case of acute ischaemic stroke due to intracranial&#xD;
      large vessel occlusion. However, we have to demonstrate that this approach is not associated&#xD;
      with time from onset harm in patients not eligible to mechanical thrombectomy.&#xD;

      Design: Multicenter, two-arm, prospective, open, blinded end-point (PROBE), randomized,&#xD;
      clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Incremental cost-utility ratio at 12 months. Secondary endpoints: modified&#xD;
      Rankin scale and EuroQoL5D scale at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria: A call to the emergency medical assistance service, 18 years and older,&#xD;
      severe acute stroke symptoms, transportation time from scene to the CSC longer than time to&#xD;
      go to the nearest stroke unit or telemedicine hub, transportation time from scene to the CSC&#xD;
      compatible with IV thrombolysis, known time from onset, RACE score (assessed by medical&#xD;
      emergency technicians) ≥5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental arm: direct transportation to the CSC. Control arm: transfer to the closest&#xD;
      local stroke centre or telemedicine hub.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 800 patients, 400 for each arm.&#xD;

    <description>Incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) at 12 months, defined as the ratio of the incremental cost of management by transfer to a CSC with MT (compared to the control arm &quot;local PSC&quot;) to the gain in healthy survival (quality adjusted life years, QALYs).</description>

    <measure>modified Rankin scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death. Modified Rankin Scale score will be evaluated through a structured telephone-based interview performed by a central assessor who is blinded to group assignment</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQoL5D scale</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.&#xD;
EuroQol5D scale will be evaluated through a structured telephone-based interview performed by a central assessor who is blinded to group assignment</description>
