  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of meals is a very important aspect of nutrition, with profound effects on&#xD;
      human health and in life expectancy. Excessive energy consumption is totally associated with&#xD;
      a significant increase in the incidence of chronic diseases including diabetes. That is why&#xD;
      nutritional therapy is recommended for all people with diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2 as an&#xD;
      effective complement to your medical treatment. For overweight or obese type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients, a low-calorie diet along with healthy eating patterns are recommended for weight&#xD;
      loss. Similarly, modest body weight decrease may provide clinical benefits in patients, such&#xD;
      as improved blood glucose, blood pressure, lipid profile, and others. Data about the role of&#xD;
      nutritional habits and energy density being important precursors of obesity and diabetes are&#xD;
      well known. On the other hand, data regarding frequency and timing of meals and how these&#xD;
      factors relate to corporal weight are not totally understood.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In general, hypocaloric plans for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are consumed in five&#xD;
      or six small meals per day. Eating more often is presumed to reduce hunger and thus energy&#xD;
      consumption. However, the effects of meal frequency on human health and longevity are&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will be carried out in which the differences in the impact of&#xD;
      nutritional therapy between a hypocaloric conventional 6 times meal versus a 3-meal&#xD;
      low-calorie plan will be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients with DM2 from the Institute's Diabetes Clinic who are overweight or obese and&#xD;
      between 40 and 70 years of age and who are found to have oral hypoglycemic agents, HbA1c less&#xD;
      than 9% and less than 10 years old will be recruited of evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete medical history and physical examination will be performed in order to confirm the&#xD;
      presence of the inclusion criteria and rule out the presence of exclusion criteria. An&#xD;
      anthropometric and body composition assessment (waist and hip circumference, height, weight&#xD;
      and percentage of fat) as well as blood pressure measurement will be made. A history of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, menopausal status and use of hormone therapy, smoking, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption and physical activity (through a questionnaire of physical activity validated in&#xD;
      the Mexican population) will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into 2 groups without any distinction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of 25 patients will undergo a caloric restriction with a caloric restriction&#xD;
      of 15% of their usual daily intake with a 40% macronutrient distribution in Carbohydrates,&#xD;
      20% Protein and 40% Lipids in three times of (TC6) over a period of 12 weeks in which the&#xD;
      following variables will be measured: (Weight, Glucose Variability: Monitor, HbA1c, blood&#xD;
      glucose, Lipid Profile, Oxidative stress, FGF-21, Blood Pressure and Hunger-Satiety Levels.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the clinical evaluation will be elaborated, which consists of a complete&#xD;
      physical examination in which vital signs will be measured, neck and head examination,&#xD;
      examination of the thorax and abdomen, exploration of upper and lower extremities. As well as&#xD;
      a complete nutritional assessment that includes; Assessment of body composition using&#xD;
      bioimpedance with body composition analyzer jawon iOi 353, Reminder of food consumption of&#xD;
      72hrs to collect information on the diet of each patient. Based on the information collected&#xD;
      will proceed to prescribe the individualized TC6 plan and will be given a 24/7 reminder&#xD;
      format to be filled by the patient for a week, in addition to giving the indication to&#xD;
      perform home glucose measurement once a day In random scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate attachment to the nutritional plan, the patient will be cited 15 days later to&#xD;
      perform daily consumption assessment using the 24/7 reminder format filled out by the patient&#xD;
      and a 72hrs reminder performed through an interview. Likewise, levels of Hunger-Satiety will&#xD;
      be measured with the tables of the institute Joslin validated for Mexican population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient adheres to the diet, blood samples will be taken for the measurement of the&#xD;
      variables (HbA1C, Glucose, Lipid Profile, Insulin, FGF-21) and after that place the Medtronic&#xD;
      model Ipro2 continuous glucose monitor with In order to monitor the patient's blood glucose&#xD;
      for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 7 days, the patient will be asked to remove the sensor and re-evaluate&#xD;
      dietary attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TC6 plan will be continued for 6 weeks, and at the end of this period the patient will be&#xD;
      recalled to re-perform blood samples to measure the variables (HbA1C, Glucose, Lipid Profile,&#xD;
      Insulin, FGF-21) Blood pressure and levels of Hunger-Satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TC6 regimen will be continued for a further 6 weeks. At the end of the period the patient&#xD;
      will be asked to re-perform blood samples to measure the variables (HbA1C, Glucose, Lipid&#xD;
      Profile, Insulin, FGF-21), Weight, Blood Pressure and Hunger-Satiety levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group of 25 patients will undergo a caloric restriction with a caloric restriction&#xD;
      of 15% of their usual daily intake, with a 40% macronutrient distribution in Carbohydrates,&#xD;
      20% Protein and 40% Lipids in three times of (TC3) over a period of 12 weeks in which the&#xD;
      following variables (Weight, Glucose Variability: Monitor, HbA1c, blood glucose, Lipid&#xD;
      Profile, Oxidative, FGF-21, Blood Pressure and Hunger-Satiety levels are measured.) At the&#xD;
      first visit, the clinical evaluation will be elaborated, which consists of a complete&#xD;
      physical examination in which vital signs will be measured, neck and head examination,&#xD;
      examination of the thorax and abdomen, exploration of upper and lower extremities. As well as&#xD;

      to collect information on each patient's diet. Based on the information collected will&#xD;
      proceed to prescribe the individualized TC3 plan and will be given a 24/7 reminder format to&#xD;
      be filled by the patient for a week, in addition to giving the indication to perform home&#xD;
      glucose measurement once a day in random scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate attachment to the nutritional plan, the patient will be cited 15 days later to&#xD;
      perform daily consumption assessment using the 24/7 reminder format filled out by the patient&#xD;
      and a 72hrs reminder performed through an interview. Likewise, levels of Hunger-Satiety will&#xD;
