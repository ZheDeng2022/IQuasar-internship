  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the validity of Sens Motion and ActivPAL acitivity&#xD;
      monitors. Thirthy-six patients from three different patient populations will be included: 12&#xD;
      acute high-risk abdominal surgery patients (+18 years), 12 hip fracture patients (+65) and 12&#xD;
      older medical patients (+65).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be asked to wear two sets of activity monitors while performing a&#xD;
      predefined researcher-supervised protocol consisting of a range of positions and activities&#xD;
      including lying down, sitting, standing and walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations measured by time in each position will be used as a golden standard for physical&#xD;
      activity and thus compared with the data produced by the acitivity monitors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the association between activity measured by Sens Motion and&#xD;
      ActivPAL acitivity monitors, respectively, and direct observation in order to investigate to&#xD;
      which degree the two types of activity monitors are able to classify activity (i.e. lying,&#xD;
      sitting, standing, walking, up/down transitions and steps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-six patients from three different patient populations will be included: 12 acute&#xD;
      high-risk abdominal surgery patients (+18 years), 12 hip fracture patients (+65) and 12 older&#xD;
      medical patients (+65). Inclusion criteria to be fullfilled: 1) admission from own home.&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded for the following reasons: inability to walk independently with or&#xD;
      without a walking aid; inability to transfer from lying to sitting, inability to transfer&#xD;
      from sitting to standing, inability to cooperate, and inability to speak or understand&#xD;
      Danish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be asked to wear two sets of activity monitors (on the right thigh and on&#xD;
      the chest) while performing a predefined, supervised protocol consisting of a range of&#xD;
      positions and activities including lying down, sitting, standing and walking.&#xD;

        The study population will be a convenience sample based on eligible patients from different&#xD;
        departments at Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre: Hip fracture patients from the&#xD;
        orthopaedic department, patients undergoing acute high-risk abdominal surgery from the&#xD;
        department of gastrointestinal surgery, and medical patients from one of four medical&#xD;
        departments. The patients will be selected based on the last four digits of their personal&#xD;
        identification number.&#xD;
