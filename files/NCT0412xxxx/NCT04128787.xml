  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of two&#xD;
      formulations (Formulation 1 and Formulation 2) of AG-881 and to examine the effect of food&#xD;
      and multiple-dose omeprazole on the single-dose PK of AG-881 Formulation 2 in healthy adult&#xD;
      participants. This study will also assess the safety and tolerability of single-dose AG-881&#xD;
      (Formulation 1 and 2) alone and of AG-881 Formulation 2 when administered with and without&#xD;
      food and when coadministered with omeprazole in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
