      A window of opportunity feasibility study assessing pre-operative stereotactic ablative body&#xD;
      radiotherapy followed by immediate surgery in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, prospective, non-randomised feasibility study. This study will&#xD;
      assess whether SABR can safely be given immediately prior to Whipple's resection by assessing&#xD;
      the rate of post-operative complications.&#xD;
