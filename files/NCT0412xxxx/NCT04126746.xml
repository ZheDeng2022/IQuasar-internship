  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to continue to follow subjects who were enrolled in the CTOT-20&#xD;
      CLAD Phenotypes study. Subjects will provide clinical data and complete quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires that will be used to determine the clinical factors associated with the&#xD;
      development of Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD) after lung transplant.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no mandated study visits, rather the study will be conducted using real world data&#xD;
      collected as part of usual clinical care according to the standard of care transplant&#xD;
      protocols at each site. Specimens and study data will be collected during standard of care&#xD;
      visits and study coordinators will review medical records and extract available clinical data&#xD;
      every 6 months. Study coordinators will collect Pulmonary Function Test data that will be&#xD;
      transferred to the Data Coordinating Center as in CTOT-20. Subjects will be asked to complete&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires on an annual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of times, blood samples will be collected during clinical care routine&#xD;
      venipuncture based on clinic visit scheduling. In the rare circumstances in which research&#xD;
      blood is missed during a standard of care venipuncture or one is not scheduled, a participant&#xD;
      may be asked to undergo venipuncture for study purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care (SOC) bronchoscopies with collection of Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) lung&#xD;
      fluid will be performed at each center according to clinical management protocols. During SOC&#xD;
      bronchoscopies, research participants will undergo additional fluid instillation for research&#xD;
      BAL sampling as in CTOT-20.&#xD;

        This study will include participants previously enrolled in the CTOT-20 study who are alive&#xD;
        and remain active in the study (i.e. not previously withdrawn). The CTOT-20 cohort consists&#xD;
        of adults who received their first lung transplant at one of the five participating centers&#xD;
        (Duke University Medical Center, University of California Los Angeles Medical Center,&#xD;
        Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Johns Hopkins University, Toronto General Hospital).&#xD;
        Multi-organ recipients as well as prior recipients of any solid organ or bone marrow&#xD;
        transplant were excluded. Recipients with HIV infection were excluded as were those&#xD;
        participating in an investigational drug trial at the time of enrollment. At the time of&#xD;
        this protocol writing, there are 625 out of 803 CTOT-20 participants alive and active in&#xD;
        follow-up, who are eligible to participate.&#xD;
