      The goal of this project is to adapt, implement and evaluate Take Charge! (a 1:1 mentoring&#xD;
      intervention for assault-injured youth) for a group mentoring model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial in which assault-injured 12-14 year old&#xD;
      youth recruited from the emergency department are randomly assigned to standard care or &quot;A&#xD;
      Fighting Chance&quot; group mentoring that includes a violence prevention curriculum and parent&#xD;
      sessions. Immediately post-intervention and again at six-month follow up, youth&#xD;
      violence-related, mental health and educational outcomes using validated measures will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Study participants randomized to intervention will be enrolled in a Y in Central Maryland group mentoring program that meets weekly over a three month period. Parents will participate in three parenting sessions. Youth study participants will be interviewed about the youth's thoughts and behaviors and the youth's medical and school records will be reviewed. Parents will also be interviewed to ask questions about the program. The study will last for 12 months and youth/parents will be interviewed at the time of enrollment and 4-6 months later.</description>
