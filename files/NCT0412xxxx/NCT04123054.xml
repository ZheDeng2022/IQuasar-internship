  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Artificial Pancreas lab at McGill University has developed an optimization algorithm for&#xD;
      adults with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) on Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) therapy with the&#xD;
      adjunctive use of glucose sensor technology, collectively known as sensor-augmented MDI&#xD;
      therapy. The algorithm is designed to estimate optimal basal-bolus parameters based on the&#xD;
      patient's glucose, insulin and meal data over several days. The investigators hope that this&#xD;
      algorithm will be better able to improve long-term glycemic targets by reducing HbA1c levels&#xD;
      compared to sensor-augmented MDI therapy alone.&#xD;

      The changes in eligibility criteria indicated below are from a previously approved amendment&#xD;
      but were inadvertently omitted in the previous PRS update made in November of 2020.&#xD;
      Therefore, this note serves to clarify the order of updates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion: HbA1c â‰¥ 7.5% in the last 2 months (modification)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More than 1 slow-acting injection and unwilling to switch to once a day for the study&#xD;
           (addition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe hypoglycemic episode within one month of admission (addition)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the subsequent amendment, we modified the timeframe for the HbA1c inclusion criterion to&#xD;
      obtain a more accurate representation of their current glucose control at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
