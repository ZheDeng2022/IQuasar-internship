  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the feasibility of implementing an Icelandic cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      program designed to prevent depression, called &quot;Thoughts and Health&quot; in a Swedish school&#xD;
      setting. The investigators will also evaluate whether implementation of the program has an&#xD;
      impact on the participating students, regarding both their mental health and their success in&#xD;
      finishing junior high school with passing grades.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical depression is a crucial problem among adolescents. In eighth grade more than half of&#xD;
      all students experience headaches, stomach pain, stress, feeling down, and difficulties&#xD;
      sleeping. Adolescents affected by depression at a young age are at greater risk of&#xD;
      experiencing depressive symptoms as adults, with serious impacts on their quality of life and&#xD;
      ability to work. Recent reports from the National Board of Health and Welfare have shown that&#xD;
      depression is increasing among adolescents and there is now focus on implementing&#xD;
      practice-oriented preventative programs for youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies by members of our research team have shown that a cognitive-behavioral,&#xD;
      developmentally-based intervention program, called &quot;Thoughts and Health&quot;, prevented initial&#xD;
      episodes of depression and/or dysthymia in adolescents for up to 12 months after program&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test the feasibility of implementing that program in a Swedish school&#xD;
      setting, while also collecting and analyzing preliminary results regarding the potential&#xD;
      impact of the program on number of students developing depressive symptoms and the number&#xD;
      passing junior high school with full grades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an intervention study with a control group. Students from two Swedish junior high&#xD;
      schools will be identified as &quot;at-risk&quot; and invited to participate in the program (n=40),&#xD;
      while students from two other schools will act as controls (n=40). All participating students&#xD;
      will be followed from study start (baseline) and 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after program&#xD;
      completion. Results will include quantitative clinical measures, qualitative focus group&#xD;
      discussions, and students' final grades. Two courses of the program will be run over two&#xD;
      school years. This study involves close collaboration between academia, primary care, and the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is to our knowledge the first study in Sweden that employs a longitudinal design to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of a school program aimed at preventing depression in adolescents.&#xD;
