  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare, heterogeneous histiocytic disorder occurring&#xD;
      most commonly in children. Because of the rarity of LCH in adults and a lack of prospective&#xD;
      randomized trials, the treatment strategy for adults is mostly based on pediatric protocols.&#xD;
      The overall response rate of therapy based on vinblastine plus prednisone in adults is lower&#xD;
      than in children and the treatment tends to show higher toxicity.There is little data to&#xD;
      guide therapy after frontline treatment. In a phase 2 trial, thalidomide as monotherapy gave&#xD;
      a 70% response rate in recurrent/refractory low risk LCH but there were no responses in six&#xD;
      high risk children. We want to analyze the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide combined with&#xD;
      dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide regimens in the treatment of recurrent/refractory LCH&#xD;
      among adult patients at our hospital.&#xD;
