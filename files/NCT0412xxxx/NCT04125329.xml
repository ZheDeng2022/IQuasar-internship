    <textblock>
      This clinical trial assessed the safety of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell therapy&#xD;
      in 15 patients with diabetic nephropathy. Fifteen subjects received umbilical cord&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell therapy 3 times. Approximately 1 × 106/kg of human umbilical cord&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells were administered by peripheral intravenous infusion once a month&#xD;
      .Endpoints:Primary endpoint: Safety and adverse events (safety and tolerability of umbilical&#xD;
      cord mesenchymal stem cell therapy within 60 weeks).Secondary endpoint indicators:Efficacy&#xD;
      measures: eGFR, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and percentage changes of 24-h urinary&#xD;
      protein quantities from baseline to 60 weeks.&#xD;

      Dosage and administration method: Fifteen subjects received umbilical cord mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cell therapy 3 times. Approximately 1 × 106/kg of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      were administered by peripheral intravenous infusion once a month at 0, 4, and 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Routine medications were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patient follow-up was performed 7 times at 0, 4, 8, 20, 32, 48, and 60 weeks.&#xD;
      Blood and urine were collected for determination of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24-h&#xD;
      urine protein ratio, liver and kidney function, fasting blood glucose, 2-h postprandial blood&#xD;
      glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, eGFR, blood lipids, and blood electrolytes at each&#xD;
      follow-up visit. The daily dose of insulin was recorded. Blood samples were taken after each&#xD;
      infusion of stem cells for flow cytometry and for the detection of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD28+,&#xD;
      Treg, CD80, CD86, HLA-DR, CD83, and CD1a cells. Plasma levels of the cytokines IFN-gamma,&#xD;
      TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, IL-12P70, IL-8, and IL-1 beta were also determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Safety and adverse events (safety and tolerability of umbilical cord&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell therapy within 60 weeks): The number and severity of adverse events, an&#xD;
      evaluation of their association with the umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell treatment, and&#xD;
      the outcome of the adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' discomfort and clinical symptoms during the study period were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects' relevant laboratory test indices, 12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs, and&#xD;
      physical examination results were recorded during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy measures: eGFR, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and percentage changes of 24-h&#xD;
      urinary protein quantities from baseline to 60 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of adverse events and the number of severity adverse events were determined based&#xD;
      on the changes in the data summary (i.e., descriptive statistics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multilevel statistical analysis model (mixed effects model) was used to infer the&#xD;
      relationship between treatment factors and key indicators, reflect the changing trend of key&#xD;
      indicators in different time periods, and draw statistical analysis conclusions.&#xD;
