  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic therapy is the main treatment for patients with metastatic cancers.&#xD;
      Oligo-progressionhas become a recognized entity for metastatic cancer and it is thought that&#xD;
      a subset of cancer cells may develop heterogeneity and resistant clones while receiving&#xD;
      systemic therapy. This results in overall tumor response but progression in metastatic sites.&#xD;
      Current standard is to change systemic therapies. With advancing technologies, stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy is being used to deliver high doses of focused radiation to the&#xD;
      disease site, while minimizing risk of injury to the surrounding organs. SBRT is increasingly&#xD;
      being used in patients presenting oligo-metastatic disease, and is recognized as having a&#xD;
      potential for cure. This study will investigate the use of SBRT for cancer patients with&#xD;
      oligo-progression. Patients will be seen before and at the end of treatment and will be&#xD;
      followed at 4 month intervals for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visits participants will complete quality of life questionnaires and will have&#xD;
      standard of care imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also have the option to provide blood at baseline, during treatment, and at&#xD;
      various follow up time points for analysis of ctDNA&#xD;

    <description>A previous study found that in four of the five metastatic GI patients, SBRT increased the duration of effective systemic therapy with no significant additional toxicities. There have been small number of case reports in lung and renal cancers, which suggest the potential for improvement in progression free survival. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of SBRT in this patient population</description>
