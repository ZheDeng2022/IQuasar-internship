  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the level of functional gain, below the injury for voluntary&#xD;
      control of movements, and recovery standing and stepping function as a result of activation&#xD;
      of spinal circuits with scES in humans with severe paralysis. Training will consist of&#xD;
      practicing stepping, standing and voluntary movements in the presence of specific scES&#xD;
      configurations designed specific for stepping (Step-scES), specific for standing (Stand-scES)&#xD;
      and for the voluntary movements of the legs and trunk (Vol-scES). Ability to step, stand,&#xD;
      move voluntarily, as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel and sexual function&#xD;
      will be assessed in these individuals with chronic severe spinal cord injury.&#xD;
