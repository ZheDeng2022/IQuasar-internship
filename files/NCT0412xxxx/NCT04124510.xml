      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Asthma improvement of Flutiform&#xD;
      K-haler after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to severe uncontrolled* asthma&#xD;
      following mid-dose ICS/LABA DPI therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory allergic disease of airway involving many cells and various&#xD;
      media. Airway inflammation causes various symptoms of airway hypersensitivity, including&#xD;
      repeated wheezing, dyspnea, and tightness in the chest. An estimated 300 million people&#xD;
      worldwide suffer from asthma, and in South Korea, an estimated asthma prevalence rate for&#xD;
      adults is approximately 5% [1]. For more effective management of asthma, Global Initiative&#xD;
      for Asthma (GINA) guideline[2] and Korean Asthma Management Guideline for Adults [1] suggests&#xD;
      that for patients who cannot have asthma symptoms under control with ICS (Inhaled&#xD;
      Corticosteroid) alone, concomitant treatment of ICS/LABA is more effective than dose increase&#xD;
      of ICS, and therefore recommends ICS combined with Long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) products.&#xD;
      Common ICS/LABA products that are available in the Korea market including dry power inhaler&#xD;
      (DPI) and pressured metered dose inhaler (pMDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that small airway significantly contributes to total airway resistance, so the&#xD;
      inflammation of the small airways could lead to the poor asthma control observed since small&#xD;
      airways are not directly reached by inhaler's particles [3,4]. Fluticasone/formoterol&#xD;
      (Flutiform®) shows a high fine particle fraction (FPF) of about 40% for both the ICS and the&#xD;
      LABA components regardless the inhalation flow rate[5]. FPF of Fluticasone/formoterol is&#xD;
      significantly higher than other ICS/LABA combinations. It is expected that small particles of&#xD;
      fluticason/formoterol could reach to the large/small airways easier than other ICS/LABA&#xD;
      combinations even if these ICS/LABAs shows a similar efficacy for asthma treatment. However&#xD;
      Asthma patients can struggle to use their pMDI inhalers correctly due to the need to properly&#xD;
      co-ordinate the press and inhale, which can worsen their asthma and lead to exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flutiform K-haler is the first breath-actuated inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) long-acting&#xD;
      β2-agonist (LABA) combination aerosol inhaler for adults and adolescents. The flutiform&#xD;
      k-haler has been designed with patients in mind, requiring only a gentle inhalation to&#xD;
      trigger the dose release, with the aim to help patients reduce critical errors and improve&#xD;
      long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, It is expected that Flutiform K-haler prevents exacerbation and improves symptom&#xD;
      of Asthma. Especially it will be beneficial to patients who did not response to existing&#xD;
      ICS/LABA DPI in Korea. This study is planned to examine the efficacy and safety of Flutiform&#xD;
      K-haler in patients who are not adequately controlled by previous mid-dose ICS/LABA DPI&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
