      The investigators want to obtain a fundamental understanding if and which chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents used for treating cancer during pregnancy are associated with placental and/or&#xD;
      offspring (epi)genetic changes, potentially causing FGR and childhood/adult diseases later in&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Cancer is the second leading cause of death during the reproductive years and&#xD;
      affects between 1:1000 and 2000 pregnant women. Previous studies from our group have shown&#xD;
      that chemotherapeutic cancer treatment in pregnancy has reassuring outcomes in terms of&#xD;
      cognitive and cardiac neonatal outcomes, and hence has been proposed as standard of care.&#xD;
      However fetal growth restriction (FGR), which places an infant at significant risk of&#xD;
      perinatal morbidity and mortality, is more common in women who were systemically treated&#xD;
      during pregnancy compared to the non-cancer population. The possibility that chemotherapy&#xD;
      during pregnancy causes placental (epi)genetic damage, and consequently induces FGR, or&#xD;
      affects offspring DNA leading to potential deleterious effects later in life, such as cancer&#xD;
      or other diseases, has not been investigated so far. As the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy&#xD;
      at DNA level have been well established, it could be speculated that chemotherapy-induced DNA&#xD;
      damage may interfere with fetal and childhood health in the long term. The results of this&#xD;
      study will lead to an increased understanding of potential toxic effects of chemotherapy for&#xD;
      the unborn child and may therefore contribute to the development of safe and solid treatment&#xD;
      regimens for pregnant cancer patients and their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To obtain a fundamental understanding if and which chemotherapeutic agents used&#xD;
      for treating cancer during pregnancy are associated with placental and/or offspring&#xD;
      (epi)genetic changes, potentially causing FGR and childhood/adult diseases later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This international multicentre prospective observational trial functions as an&#xD;
      extension of the CIP-study (Cancer in Pregnancy, S25470) and aims to collect placental&#xD;
      tissue, cord blood and meconium and neonatal buccal cells at birth. Parental peripheral blood&#xD;
      and buccal cells will be collected and used as reference. Minimal requirement to participate&#xD;
      in this study is participation in Part I.IA of the original CIP-study. Through this CIP-study&#xD;
      the investigators are able to gather pregnancy-, malignancy- and placenta-related data.&#xD;
      Placental tissue is only collected from women who are also willing to participate or are&#xD;
      already participating in Part I.IB (placental histopathology) of the CIP-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients with histological proven cancer during pregnancy and an&#xD;
      ongoing pregnancy (≥24 weeks of gestation) treated with chemotherapy (alkylating agents,&#xD;
      anthracyclines, taxanes and/or platinum derivates) or other treatment options (surgery,&#xD;
      radiotherapy and/or systemic treatment other than chemotherapy, or none).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: determination of potential (sub)chromosomal alterations&#xD;
      and/or changes in DNA methylation in placental tissue, and in cord blood and buccal cells of&#xD;
      the newborn, and the association with chemotherapy concentrations measured in respectively&#xD;
      placental or newborn tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: There are no risks associated nor benefits expected with participation in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        treatments: carboplatin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel and/or anthracyclines, the&#xD;
        latter being the most given type of CT during pregnancy (cfr. also Table 1). Women who were&#xD;

        did not receive any treatment during pregnancy, will be included in the CT-unexposed&#xD;
        control arm.In the CT-unexposed arm, we will also include women that had systemic treatment&#xD;
        other than chemotherapy (e.g. targeted therapies) and/or radiotherapy. A group of healthy&#xD;
        pregnant women without cancer, delivering in our participating centres, will form the&#xD;
