    <textblock>
      Stenosis of the lumbar canal is a degenerative disorder, occurring most often in the elderly&#xD;
      or middle aged, after 50 years. It most often results from the combination of 2 pathologies:&#xD;
      the congenital narrowness of the lumbar canal is decompensated over time by the anatomical&#xD;
      reorganizations generated by osteoarthritis. It is classically manifested by pain in the&#xD;
      lower limbs, occurring almost exclusively in walking or in case of prolonged standing. This&#xD;
      postural and dynamic character of the symptomatology is very characteristic of this&#xD;
      pathology. The levels most often involved are L4 / L5 and L3 / L4. But, in case of extensive&#xD;
      stenosis, other levels may be involved (L2 / L3, L5S1 or even L1 / L2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment is obviously indicated from the outset in emergency situations or in cases&#xD;
      of severe functional disability. It is most often proposed in case of failure of a complete&#xD;
      and well-conducted medical treatment. In practice, in cases of tight canal stenosis, only a&#xD;
      surgical operation can relieve the patient of pain and recover a normal walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimal invasive technique: lumbar recalibration, which consists of decompression of the&#xD;
      roots of the horse's tail under a microscope without fusion, without arthrodesis, provides a&#xD;
      short-term functional benefit, even when Grade 1 spondylisthesis exists. The interest of this&#xD;
      technique for the patient is twofold: first aesthetic because the incision is much smaller&#xD;
      than in the classical technique and becomes almost invisible after a few months; then and&#xD;
      above all it is functional because, by preserving the paravertebral muscles that it allows,&#xD;
      this procedure is less painful and allows a lift the same day and an earlier recovery&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few scientific publications compare different surgical techniques, and even fewer&#xD;
      results are available on the long-term future of patients.&#xD;
