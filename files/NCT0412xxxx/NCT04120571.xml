  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This research aims to improve&#xD;
      glucose metabolism in patients with T2DM thereby reducing the impact of diabetes and the&#xD;
      subsequent risk of future cardiovascular events. The investigators propose that improved&#xD;
      sleep health will result in improved glucose levels in participants with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to use short bursts of sound (pink noise) during sleep to improve the&#xD;
      deep-sleep phase. The study will be a 'crossover randomised controlled trial' in which two&#xD;
      different treatments (intervention and control) are compared in all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be based at the University of Lincoln Sleep Laboratory. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited via local GP practices. Twenty five adults with T2DM who have normal sleeping&#xD;
      patterns will be invited to attend the sleep laboratory on 3 nights, each visit separated by&#xD;
      one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for this study will be the difference in mean glucose between the&#xD;
      intervention and control periods over the first 24 hours after waking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be fitted with sensors on their faces to measure muscle tone and&#xD;
      eye-movements and scalps to measure brain activity (EEG) and earphones that will deliver the&#xD;
      'pink noise'. The first night will be a 'sham' visit with no intervention, and nights 2 and 3&#xD;
      will be randomised to either intervention or control. An oral glucose tolerance test will be&#xD;
      performed on the mornings of visits 2 and 3. During visits 2 and 3 participants will be&#xD;
      fitted with a continuous glucose monitor which will be worn for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study and the findings will be used to design a large randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial. With the increasing prevalence of diabetes it is important to develop new&#xD;
      approaches without the frequently observed side effects associated with pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments to improve glucose control in patients with T2DM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project uses a 'crossover randomised controlled trial' design, where two&#xD;
      different treatments are compared in all participants. Each participant will therefore&#xD;
      receive both treatments (sound intervention, and no intervention) and the project will&#xD;
      compare the impact of the two treatments on the same participant. This means each person acts&#xD;
      as their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted in the newly built Sleep Laboratory at the University of&#xD;
      Lincoln, which is composed of two participant bedrooms and an observation room. Participants&#xD;
      will have access to a toilet and shower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified by their General Practitioner (GP) by searching the&#xD;
      practice database and screening records for eligibility. All eligible potential participants&#xD;
      will receive a study information pack sent from the GP practice. There will be contact&#xD;
      details to allow anyone wishing to take part to make contact with the study team having read&#xD;
      the study information pack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also recruit via university email and staff web page. Potential&#xD;
      participants may then contact the research team to request a study information pack which&#xD;
      will be emailed or posted as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Potential participants will express an interest in the study by contacting one of&#xD;
      the research team. They will be screened over the phone by checking inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. If eligible to take part they will be invited to a recruitment visit with at least&#xD;
      24 hours to read the participant information sheet and ask any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment visit - Day 1/2 Participants will attend the sleep laboratory at 9pm on day 1 of&#xD;
      the study. They will have the opportunity to ask any questions and then if still happy to&#xD;
      take part will give signed informed consent. Basic information on age, sex, height and weight&#xD;
      will be collected. Their medical history will be checked and they will then be asked to&#xD;
      complete 5 sleep related questionnaires to confirm that they meet eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to measure sleep quantity and quality. 3.Epworth Sleepiness&#xD;
      Scale to assess for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome. 4.Horne-Ã–stberg&#xD;
      Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire to measure chronotype. 5.Insomnia Severity Index to&#xD;
      measure current levels of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At subsequent visits participants will complete only the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and&#xD;
      Stanford Sleepiness Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will have EEG sensors attached to their scalp and given comfortable earphones&#xD;
      (sleep phones) fitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 10 pm they will be left alone in the sleep laboratory to fall asleep. When they wake&#xD;
      naturally the following morning (Day 2) the EEG sensors and sleep phones will be removed and&#xD;
      they are free to leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Each participant will be randomised to either receive the sound intervention on&#xD;
      the 1st experimental night (visit 1) and no sound on the 2nd experimental night (visit 2) or&#xD;
      vice versa. The patient will not know which order these are going to occur in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention The intervention is an auditory signal (50 millisecond burst of pink noise).&#xD;
      The participants will be fitted with sensors on their face to examine eye-movements and&#xD;
      muscle tone and sensors on the their scalp to detect the electrical activity of the brain&#xD;
      using an EEG, whilst 50 millisecond bursts of 'pink noise' are delivered via&#xD;
      sleep-comfortable earphones (sleep phones). The EEG is recorded via electrodes. After the&#xD;
      scalp has been cleaned with NuPrep exfoliating gel (Weave and Company), active electrodes&#xD;
      will be attached using appropriate conducting gel. A ground electrode is attached to the&#xD;
      forehead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Day 8/9 The participant will attend the sleep laboratory again on day 8 at 9pm.&#xD;
      They will be asked to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index again. They will have the&#xD;
      EEG sensors and sleep phones fitted. In addition they will have a CGMS fitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be left to sleep in the sleep laboratory overnight whilst the experimenter is next&#xD;
      door, at no point during the study will the participant be left completely alone in the&#xD;
      lab.Within 30 minutes of waking the following morning (day 9) they will be asked to fill in&#xD;
      the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and drink 330ml of Rapilose glucose drink in under 5 minutes to&#xD;
      provide a 75g bolus of glucose. Blood glucose measurements will be recorded using the CGM.&#xD;
      Participants will need to sit quietly for 2 hours after drinking the Rapilose whilst the&#xD;
      glucose levels are recorded and then are free to leave the laboratory. The CGMS will be worn&#xD;
      until the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Day 15/16 The participant will attend the sleep laboratory again on day 15 at 9pm.&#xD;
      The CGMS will be removed and a new one fitted. They will be asked to complete the Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Index again. They will have the EEG sensors and sleep phones fitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be left to sleep in the sleep laboratory overnight whilst the experimenter is next&#xD;
      door, at no point during the study will the participant be left completely alone in the lab.&#xD;
      Within 30 minutes of waking the following morning (day 16) they will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      10-minute psychomotor vigilance task and to drink 330ml of Rapilose in under 5 minutes to&#xD;
      provide a 75g bolus of glucose. Blood glucose measurements will be recorded using the CGMS.&#xD;
      Participants will need to sit quietly for 2 hours after drinking the Rapilose whilst the&#xD;
      glucose levels are recorded and then are free to leave the laboratory. The CGM will be worn&#xD;
      until the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 - Day 23 The participant will return to the sleep laboratory at a mutually convenient&#xD;
      time and have the CGMS removed.&#xD;
