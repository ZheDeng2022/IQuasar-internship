  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An autograft is a piece of skin taken from a healthy area of the body to be used to treat&#xD;
      severe burns on another part of the same body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      StrataGraft skin tissue is an investigational tissue that can be used as an alternative to an&#xD;
      autograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  StrataGraft skin tissue is in late stage clinical development for deep partial-thickness&#xD;
           burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There have been no safety concerns reported to date&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor submitted a treatment protocol to FDA for experienced doctors to keep using&#xD;
      StrataGraft before it is marketed (expanded access), so the product is available (by&#xD;
      invitation only at the locations listed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is to allow patients to receive StrataGraft prior to approval&#xD;
      by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of deep partial-thickness burns. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure will be the number of participants with adverse events and safety&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to provide expanded access to StrataGraft for thermally&#xD;
      induced deep partial-thickness burns that contain intact dermal elements and for which&#xD;
      surgical excision and autograft would normally be part of the clinical management.&#xD;

             extremities:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. that are the right size for treatment areas,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. with intact dermal elements for which excision and autografting are clinically&#xD;
                  indicated, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. have not been previously excised and grafted.&#xD;
