  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pain can affect up to 40% of children and adolescents. Neck pain (NP) is one&#xD;
      of the most prevalent painful conditions and evidence suggests that its prevalence has&#xD;
      increased in recent decades in adolescents aged 16 to 18 years, from 22.9% in 1991 to 29.5%&#xD;
      in 2011. Interventions based on pain neuroscience education have emerged as promising&#xD;
      strategies in chronic pain conditions.In adults this intervention has been explored in many&#xD;
      pain conditions, including musculoskeletal pain, but there is only one pilot study in&#xD;
      adolescents with chronic NP and one case study in adolescents with fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the main objective of the present study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) To compare the effectiveness of an education program based on pain neuroscience education&#xD;
      and exercise versus exercise alone, in decreasing pain intensity in secondary school students&#xD;
      with chronic and idiopathic NP immediately after the intervention and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Compare the effectiveness of these programs immediately after the intervention and at 6&#xD;
      months in i) disability, ii) sleep, iii) pain catastrophizing, iv) fear of movement, v)&#xD;
      self-efficacy, vi) central sensitization vii) the strength of the deep neck flexors and&#xD;
      extensors muscles and stabilizers of the scapula; and viii) the pressure pain threshold&#xD;
      between the two intervention groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Explore possible predictors of response to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that the sample will consist of 127 participants from four secondary&#xD;
      schools that will be divided into two groups. Both groups will receive the same&#xD;
      exercise-based intervention. The experimental group will receive, in addition to exercise, an&#xD;
      intervention based on pain neuroscience education. The intervention will consist of 1 session&#xD;
      per week during 8 weeks and will be applied in small groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be performed in a blended-learning format. Five sessions will be&#xD;
      face-to-face with up to 45 minutes duration, performed at school and incorporated into&#xD;
      physical education classes and 3 will be performed at home, supported by v√≠deos sent by&#xD;
      WhatsApp. The first two sessions will always be face-to-face. Face-to-face sessions will be&#xD;
      interspersed with WhatsApp sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed, by online questionnaires, for sociodemographic aspects, pain&#xD;
      characterization and physical activity level, disability, sleep, catastrophizing, fear of&#xD;
      movement, self-efficacy, central sensitization and knowledge on pain neurophysiology. In&#xD;
      addition, 3 muscle tests will be performed for the deep neck flexor and extensor muscles and&#xD;
      scapular stabilizers, and the pressure pain thresholds in the neck and at distance will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will received an 8-week intervention consisting of exercise and pain neuroscience education. Pain neuroscience education will be conducted in line with international guidelines and will address the following topics: pain neurophysiology, nociception and nociceptive pathways, inhibition and spinal cord stimulation, peripheral and central sensitization, nervous system plasticity and the impact of variables such as stress, anxiety, sleep and exercise on pain behavior. Exercise will be performed in accordance with international guidelines for chronic NP. Motor control, endurance and strengthening exercises will be performed for the neck and scapulo-thoracic region.</description>

    <description>The incorporation of the exercise in this group will be gradual, in order to decrease the education component and increase the exercise component (up to 45/60 minutes). The 1st session will be only PNE and will last approximately 45 minutes. In the 2nd session, there will be 30 minutes of PNE and the remaining 15 minutes of exercise. In the following 4th and 6th sessions, 15 minutes of each session will be used to clarify doubts and emphasize PNE concepts and strategies. The 8th session will include exercises only. In WhatsApp sessions, in addition to the video with the exercises, participants will receive activities about the PNE.</description>
