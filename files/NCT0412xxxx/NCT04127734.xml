    <textblock>
      The TENTACLE: Rectum study is a multinational retrospective cohort study that includes&#xD;
      patients with anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to develop an anastomotic leakage severity score and to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of different treatments of anastomotic leakage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage occurs in up to 20% after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. It is&#xD;
      a severe complication with high associated morbidity, ICU admission, prolonged hospital stay&#xD;
      and need for reinterventions and readmissions. Anastomotic leakage is independently&#xD;
      associated with the risk of local recurrence and reduced long term survival. Most literature&#xD;
      focusses on incidence and predictive factors. Remarkably, there is almost no data on the&#xD;
      efficiency of different treatments of anastomotic leakage after low anterior resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer resection is generally underreported, mainly due to&#xD;
      subclinical leaks below a diverting stoma. However, up to 50% of the leaks do not heal with&#xD;
      fecal diversion alone, especially not in an irradiated field, related to a competent&#xD;
      sphincter which hampers adequate drainage of the presacral abscess. Late diagnosis of&#xD;
      'reactivated' leaks after stoma reversal is not an infrequent phenomenon. Chronic sinus,&#xD;
      gluteal abscess, and fistula formation have been reported in up to 10%, and permanent stoma&#xD;
      rates around 20%, both having significant impact on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of factors that may influence the severity and chance of healing of the anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage are: timing of diagnosis, degree of systemic inflammatory response, etiology (e.g.&#xD;
      ischemia of the afferent loop), degree of dehiscence and retraction, location of the leak&#xD;
      (e.g. circular staple line, blind loop), whether or not a diverting stoma is in place, and&#xD;
      extent of abdominal contamination. However, little is known about to what extent these and&#xD;
      other factors contribute to anastomotic leakage severity and chance of healing. In addition,&#xD;
      it is not known which anastomoses are likely to be preserved by which type of treatment, and&#xD;
      which anastomotic failures require redo surgery at a certain time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate which factors contribute to anastomotic leakage severity and to compose&#xD;
           an evidence based anastomotic leakage severity score, in which clinically relevant&#xD;
           subgroups will be explored (e.g. diversion or not), as well as different clinical&#xD;
           settings (e.g. leak diagnosis within or beyond 90 days postoperatively).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effects of different treatment approaches on all different pre-specified&#xD;
           outcome parameters, stratified for severity score, anatomical characteristics of&#xD;
           leakages and timing of diagnosis of leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      International multicenter retrospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with anastomotic leakage after low anterior resection for rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameter:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-year stoma-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU length of stay, mortality, comprehensive complications index, total number of&#xD;
      reinterventions (surgical, radiological, endoscopic) within one year, total number of&#xD;
      unplanned readmissions within one year, total hospital stay during one year, total time of&#xD;
      having a stoma until one year, stoma present at one year, type of stoma present at one year&#xD;
      (diverting, permanent), secondary leakage related complications (extrapelvic abscess,&#xD;
      cutaneous fistula, vaginal fistula, bladder fistula, small bowel, ureteric fibrosis with&#xD;
      hydronephrosis), hospital related costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of 980 patients will be sufficient to analyze primary study objective 1 and this is&#xD;
      1246 patients for primary study objective 2. Therefore, the aim is to include at least 1246&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
