  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fever is one of the most common reasons children are brought to emergency departments.&#xD;
      Treatment of fever with antipyretics is usually done simply to make children more&#xD;
      comfortable, although in some circumstances, such as febrile seizure, control of fever is&#xD;
      critically important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to compare the two most widely-used IV antipyretic medications,&#xD;
      paracetamol and ibuprofen, in multiple measures of fever control. Although there is much data&#xD;
      evaluating adults fever, as well as these medications for analgesia in both children and&#xD;
      adults, there is scant published data on the topic: One IV Ibuprofen study of 100 children,&#xD;
      and one study of IV paracetamol with 67 children.1,6 Due to the highly limited published data&#xD;
      evaluating IV ibuprofen and IV paracetamol for pediatric fever due to infection, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to conduct a pilot study in order to know the effect size and accurately&#xD;
      estimate a sample size in order to design a full randomized controlled trail.&#xD;

      Upon arrival, when patients are found to be febrile, the parent and patient are informed by&#xD;
      the treating physician about their study eligibility. They are provided with study&#xD;
      information and a consent form, and given the opportunity to discuss the study with a&#xD;
      research nurse or assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 10 minutes a decision to consent for the study must be made, and if no consent is made&#xD;
      the patient is excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent into the study, study subjects will be randomized to arm 1,2,3 or 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medications: Arm 1,2,3,4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will have an intravenous catheter placed by standard method practiced in the Al Saad&#xD;
      Pediatric Emergency Center. All febrile patients admitted in the facility have an intravenous&#xD;
      catheter placed as a standard practice, so they will not require an IV catheter simply for&#xD;
      the purpose of delivering study medications. This will typically be a 24 gauge or 22 gauge&#xD;
      angiocatheter, secured with tegaderm and tape. After placement of this IV catheter, the&#xD;
      patient will receive the study medication(s).The dosing of these medications, specifically&#xD;
      ibuprofen 10 mg/kg and paracetamol 15 mg/kg is standard dosing routinely used in pediatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1- Patients will receive IV Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg to a maximum of 400 mg intravenously over&#xD;
      15 minutes. This medication will be diluted as per manufacturer instructions with 100 mL&#xD;
      normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2- Patients will receive 15 mg/kg IV Paracetamol to a maximum of 1000 mg intravenously&#xD;
      over 15 minutes. This medication will be diluted as per manufacturer instructions with normal&#xD;
      saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3- Patients will receive an infusion of both IV Paracetamol and IV Ibuprofen. They will&#xD;
      initially receive IV Ibuprofen as described above. Their IV catheter will then be flushed&#xD;
      with 10 ml of normal saline, and the patient will receive IV Paracetamol as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 4- Patients will receive PO ibuprofen given as a 100mg/5ml syrup or 200 mg tablets to a&#xD;
      maximum of 400 mg. The treating nurse will ask the parental preference to use syrup or&#xD;
      tablets. If they vomit the medication within 15 minutes of administration, another full dose&#xD;
      will be administered.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment phase consists of assignment to a study arm, either IV Ibuprofen, IV Paracetamol, IV paracetamol-Ibuprofen, or PO ibuprofen, and administration of the appropriate medication. The IV medications will be administered over a 15-minute period. The safety of infusion of IVIbuprofen in just 10 minutes has been established, and to infuse over 15 minutes to ensure that IV Paracetamol and IV Ibuprofen have equal infusion times. For IV paracetamol-Ibuprofen, the IV paracetamol-Ibuprofen will be administered as a sequential infusion of IV Ibuprofen over 15 minutes, followed by a flush of the IV line, followed immediately by IV paracetamol infusion over 15 minutes. Oral ibuprofen will be administered as a syrup or tablet based on patient weight and parental preference.</description>
