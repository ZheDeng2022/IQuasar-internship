  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a theory- driven&#xD;
      education platform to improve concussion-related norms and perceptions in an effort to&#xD;
      improve student-athletes concussion-related decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 80 college-aged recreational athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: The study is a single-blind (participants) randomized control trial where&#xD;
      participants will complete a previously validated survey assessing concussion knowledge,&#xD;
      perceived norms, attitudes, and behavioral intentions immediately pre- and post-receipt of&#xD;
      their designated intervention. Participants will also complete the previously validated&#xD;
      survey two-week post receipt of their designated intervention. The interventions include an&#xD;
      interactive concussion education platform along with the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic&#xD;
      Association) concussion education sheet and the NCAA concussion education sheet alone (with a&#xD;
      sham educational intervention similar in length to the concussion education platform).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A convenience sample of participants will be recruited from the University of North Carolina&#xD;
      at Chapel Hill student-body from November-January via campus emails, in-class recruitment,&#xD;
      flyers/informational sheets, and word of mouth from fellow participants. During the beginning&#xD;
      of recruitment, efforts were targeted towards males with participant numbers being carefully&#xD;
      monitored. Recruitment will be targeted to recruit an even number of males and females.&#xD;
      Interested participants will be contacted to confirm interest and those who remained&#xD;
      interested will be scheduled to complete the study session. Participants will report to an&#xD;
      on-campus athletic training facility or research laboratory or may report/complete study&#xD;
      activities virtually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then complete the written, informed consent process. The consent form&#xD;
      indicated that they would be completing a sport-related educational intervention to not&#xD;
      disclose the information they would receive and to keep participants blind to their&#xD;
      intervention group assignment. Participants will not be explicitly told that it is a study&#xD;
      evaluating concussion education, but rather an injury and nutrition study, to reduce bias.&#xD;
      Once the consent form was signed, participants were assigned a unique identifier and&#xD;
      randomized (simple) without replacement to one of the two study arms, using a pre-determined&#xD;
      random number generator in Excel. Participants then completed the pre- questionnaire in a&#xD;
      quiet location via a tablet/computer provided by the research team or virtually. There was no&#xD;
      time limit for completion of the questionnaire. The survey will feature an item that prompts&#xD;
      individuals if they miss a question, but does not force participants to respond. After&#xD;
      initial questionnaire completion, participants completed their assigned intervention&#xD;
      (decision-based interactive concussion education platform + NCAA concussion education sheet&#xD;
      versus NCAA education sheet). Immediately following their respective intervention, athletes&#xD;
      completed the questionnaire again. Upon completing the post-intervention questionnaire, the&#xD;
      participant's participation in the study is complete and they will receive an incentive.&#xD;
      Following each survey, a research team member will verify and assess for missing answers,&#xD;
      allowing participants to complete any missed questions that they wish to answer. Two weeks&#xD;
      following the post-intervention survey, participants will be contacted again to complete the&#xD;
      same questionnaire to assess retention of concussion knowledge, perceived norms, attitudes,&#xD;
      and behavioral intentions. At this two-week post time point, participants will be informed of&#xD;
      the true purpose of the study and be provided access to the BANK (Behaviors, Attitudes,&#xD;
      Norms, and Knowledge) platform.&#xD;

    <measure>Perceived Behavioral Norms Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From pre to post intervention, an approximate total of up to thirty minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked seven questions on a previously validated BANK survey identifying what an athlete thinks are important to people in his or her environment would do with respect to concussion reporting. Each item is added together to compute an overall perceived behavioral norms score. The difference between the intervention and post-intervention total score is calculated to compute a change score.Scoring scale ranges from a minimum of 7 to a maximum of 49, where higher scores indicate more favorable perceived norms.</description>

    <time_frame>From pre to post intervention, an approximate total of up to thirty minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked a three questions on a previously validated BANK survey assessing intention to disclose a concussion or concussion-like symptoms. The items are totaled to compute an overall behavioral intention score. The difference between the pre-intervention and post-intervention score is calculated to compute a change score.Scoring scale ranges from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 21, where a higher score indicates a better likelihood that an individual will disclose concussion-like symptoms.</description>
