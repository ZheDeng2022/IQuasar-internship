  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GISAR has an open and modular setup. It is sought to include as many German sarcoma and CS&#xD;
      patients (i.e. sarcoma and CS patients treated in Germany) in the registry as possible. A&#xD;
      basic data set should be collected on every included patient). In order to adress specific&#xD;
      scientific questions, additionally detailed data can be collected in defined patient groups&#xD;
      (e.g. effectiveness / adverse effects of systemic therapies in defined situations) within the&#xD;
      context of sub-project add-on modules. This data collection can be prospective or&#xD;
      retrospective depending on the sub-project&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcomas are rare malignant tumors that affect people of all ages. They can be divided into&#xD;
      different subtypes yet having more than 80 different forms of soft tissue sarcomas only. In&#xD;
      these terms, it is not remarkable that this high number of subtypes is accompanied by various&#xD;
      treatment strategies, often representing multimodal treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in a growing amount of patients tumors are diagnosed, whose malignant cells have&#xD;
      histological, cytological, or molecular properties of both epithelial tumors (&quot;carcinoma&quot;)&#xD;
      and mesenchymal tumors (&quot;sarcoma&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such &quot;mixed&quot; sarcomatoid/epithelial tumors (&quot;CS&quot;) are categorized as carcinoma considering&#xD;
      their epithelial origin. But in most cases, CS seem to be more aggressive, than other&#xD;
      carcinomas with the same origin; often they are characterized by rapid growth, invasion,&#xD;
      disease recurrence and metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the rarity of CS, only limited information is available about their clinical course&#xD;
      and best therapeutic approaches. Because of these uncertainties and the sarcoma-component of&#xD;
      the tumors, several CS-patients are referred to sarcomacenters. As many experiences with&#xD;
      single CS-cases as possible should be collected and evaluated to better understand the&#xD;
      different CS-forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the complexity of diagnosis and therapy of sarcomas and of CS it is of high relevance&#xD;
      to depict the current treatment landscape and the effects and course of different treatment&#xD;
      options to illuminate the best option for each specific patient. This is compassed by this&#xD;
      registry, as it aims to collect information and data on treatment and outcome of most of&#xD;
      future German sarcoma cases along with retrospective data collection to achieve a most&#xD;
      comprehensive data set as well as the possibility to identify alterations / trends in the&#xD;
      procedures used for sarcoma diagnosis and therapy over time.&#xD;
