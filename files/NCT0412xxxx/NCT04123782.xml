  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biological principles on which is based Focused Shockwave Treatment (F-ESWT) is has been&#xD;
      demonstrated mostly in terms of improvement of Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF),&#xD;
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Insulin Growth&#xD;
      Factor-1 (IGF-1) and Transforming Growth Factor b1 (TGF-b1). Nevertheless, to date Focused&#xD;
      Shockwave Treatment is not used in the treatment of acute pathologies and consequently in&#xD;
      acute muscle lesion, despite there are no contra-indication in that sense. A recent study of&#xD;
      Zissler et al. demonstrate how focused shockwave treatment induce an acceleration of the&#xD;
      biological process of recovery during the acute phase of muscle injury in rats, and in 2016&#xD;
      Kisch et al. demonstrate that Focused ESWT enhances blood flow in the muscle of rats and&#xD;
      repetitive ESWT extended this beneficial effect. The only clinical trial in humans about&#xD;
      acute pathology in muscle was realized by Fleckenstein et al. in 2016, in which demonstrate&#xD;
      that a single treatment with F-ESWT causes clinically relevant effects in the relief of pain,&#xD;
      increase in force and improvement of pain-associated impairments of daily living in subjects&#xD;
      affected by DOMS. However, there are no studies in humans that describe the effect of F-ESWT&#xD;
      in muscle injuries. Considering the greater number of evidences about the biological effects&#xD;
      of F-ESWT, namely anti-inflammation, neo-vascularization and tissue regeneration and their&#xD;
      parallelism in many aspects with one of the most novelty treatment of muscle injuries, as for&#xD;
      example the growth factors therapy, the hypothesis is to obtain favorable and better&#xD;
      outcomes, both ultrasonographic and clinical, in subjects treated with F-ESWT than in&#xD;
      subjects treated with standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: The hypothesis of our study is that 3 sessions of focused shockwave&#xD;
      treatment (1 per week), performed in acute phase of injury (≤ 2 weeks), a total of 3.000&#xD;
      shocks with an energy flux density of 0,12 mJ/mm2 at 5 Hz, can improve the recovery process&#xD;
      of acute indirect hamstrings injuries, with results both clinical and ultrasonographic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To analyze the effect of Focused Shockwave Treatment in acute indirect&#xD;
      hamstring injuries in soccer players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the effect of Focused Shockwave Treatment in acute indirect hamstring&#xD;
           injuries in soccer players.&#xD;

           injuries in soccer players.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze prognostic factors (demographic, clinical, imaging variables). Study Outcome&#xD;
           Measures Primary outcome: Repair process, injury size and Return to play Secondary&#xD;

           Maudsley and Likert scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN This is a single blind randomized clinical trial that will be conducted in Quirónsalud&#xD;
      Barcelona, Spain. The study will enroll patients suffering an acute indirect injury of common&#xD;
      tendon of hamstrings, over a 5-months period. The duration of the trial will be of&#xD;
      approximately 8 months. This protocol calls for 9 visits to be performed over a 8-weeks&#xD;
      period for each patient (see flow-chart). As an intention-to-treat study, data analysis will&#xD;
      be based on the randomization of the patients. At Visit 1 (screening visit; T0), patients&#xD;
      will first need to provide written signed informed consent before any data is collected or&#xD;
      procedures are performed. Then, patients will be screened for eligibility for the study by&#xD;
      ascertaining that all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are met. At V1, the&#xD;
      Investigator will gather demographic and medical history data and will carry out clinical and&#xD;
      ultrasonographic evaluation. The treatment period will consist of three sessions of ESWT,&#xD;
      performed one week apart and within 2 weeks from the day of injury. Clinical and&#xD;
      ultrasonographic data will continue to be collected during a follow-up period consisting of 9&#xD;
      visits, one per week and performed starting at 1 week from visit 1 (V1;T0). The last&#xD;
      follow-up visit will performed at 10 weeks from visit 1 (V1;T0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Assignment Procedures i. Randomization Procedures: We will use block randomization,&#xD;
      which is commonly used in the two treatment situations where the samples of the two&#xD;
      treatments must be equal or equally equal. The process will involve recruiting participants&#xD;
      in short blocks and ensuring that half of the participants within each block are assigned to&#xD;
      &quot;A&quot; and the other half to &quot;B&quot;. Within each block, however, the order of patients will be&#xD;
      random. They will be considered blocks of four dimensions: 1. AABB, 2. ABAB, 3. ABBA, 4.&#xD;
      BAAB, 5. BABA, 6. BBAA. We will randomly select between these six different blocks for each&#xD;
      group of four recruited participants. The random selection will be done using a list of&#xD;
      random numbers generated using statistical software (Excel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Masking Procedures: The participants will be blinded to the type of ESWT treatment and&#xD;
      the assessor, data managers, statistician and study monitors will be blinded to the&#xD;
      allocation. All participants who receive ESWT treatment will be treated using the same device&#xD;
      (Duolith® SD-1 STORZ Medical, Switzerland) regardless of what group they are included in. The&#xD;
      participants will not be able to predict the allocated group based on the appearance of the&#xD;
      ESWT treatment. The blinding will be maintained until the data are locked. For blinding&#xD;
      evaluation, allocation guessing will be assessed immediately after the final treatment.&#xD;
      Practitioners and assessors will be instructed to treat the participants according to&#xD;
      predefined standard operating procedures during the trial to maintain blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHOD Study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soccer players suffering from indirect acute hamstring injury, will be selected for this&#xD;
      study, sign up for an informed consent form, informed about the details of the procedure and&#xD;
      the potential risks before treatment and randomized into 2 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A (F-ESWT group): 3 sessions, one per week, of electromagnetic focused&#xD;
           extracorporeal shockwave treatment (3000 impulses at 0.12 mJ/mm2 per session).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (placebo group): 3 sessions, one per week, of electromagnetic focused&#xD;
           extracorporeal shockwave treatment (3000 impulses at 0.01 mJ/mm2 per session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatments will be performed by the senior authors. In all cases, a focused&#xD;
      electromagnetic shockwave device will be used (Duolith® SD-1, STORZ Medical, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed with the patient in lateral positioning of the decubitus&#xD;
      pronus. The treatment area will be prepared with a coupling ultrasound gel to minimize the&#xD;
      loss of shockwave energy at the interface between the tip of the applicator and the skin. The&#xD;
      inline ultrasonic guide will be used to concentrate the shockwaves on the injury area in the&#xD;
      muscle. No local anesthesia will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY EVALUATIONS Injury size: Evaluation of the three major diameters of the lesion. Grade&#xD;
      of repair process (A,B,C,D): Evaluation of the repair process with stages from A to D, where&#xD;
      A represented the absence of repair, B a start in the repair process with less than 50 % scar&#xD;
      tissue, C advanced repair process with more than 50 % repaired tissue and stage D when&#xD;
      complete repair was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): The visual analogue scale (VAS) is considered to be one of the&#xD;
      best methods available for the estimation of the intensity of pain. The VAS provides a&#xD;
      continuous scale for magnitude estimation and consists of a straight line, the ends of which&#xD;
      are defined in terms of the extreme limits of pain experience. Respondents mark the location&#xD;
      on the 10-centimeter line corresponding to the amount of pain experienced. This gives the&#xD;
      greatest freedom to choose pain's exact intensity. It also gives the maximum opportunity for&#xD;
      each respondent to express a personal response style.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS): The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) is a&#xD;
      sensitive and reliable outcome measure that has commonly been used in patients with hip and&#xD;
      knee dysfunction. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) is a questionnaire containing&#xD;
      20 questions about a person's ability to perform everyday tasks. The LEFS can be used by&#xD;
      clinicians as a measure of patients' initial function, ongoing progress and outcome, as well&#xD;
      as to set functional goals. The LEFS can be used to evaluate the functional impairment of a&#xD;
      patient with a disorder of one or both lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tegner activity scale: Tegner activity level scale is a graduated list of activities of daily&#xD;
      living, recreation and competitive sports. The patient is asked to select the level of&#xD;
      participation that best describes their current level of activity (before injury). The score&#xD;
      varies from 0-10. A score of 0 represents sick leave or disability pension, whereas a score&#xD;
      of 10 corresponds to participation in national and international elite competitive sports &gt;6&#xD;
      Roles and Maudsley scale: The RM scale is a subjective 4-point patient assessment of pain and&#xD;
      limitations of activity. The RM score has been used extensively at centers throughout the&#xD;
      world to assess outcome after SWT. On the scale, 1 point indicates an excellent result with&#xD;
      the patient having no symptoms. Two points indicate a good result with the patient&#xD;
      significantly improved from the pretreatment condition and satisfied with the result. Three&#xD;
      points indicate a fair result with the patient somewhat improved from the pretreatment&#xD;
      condition and partially satisfied with the treatment outcome. Four points indicate a poor&#xD;
      outcome with symptoms identical or worse than the pretreatment condition and dissatisfaction&#xD;
      with the treatment result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likert scale (1-6): Degree of recovery compared with baseline, measured on a 6-point Likert&#xD;
      scale (completely recovered to much worse). Success rates will be calculated by dichotomizing&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Return to play: Return to Play is the process of deciding when an injured or ill athlete may&#xD;
      safely return to practice or competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ethical Standard: This clinical study was designed and shall be conducted and reported&#xD;
           in accordance with the International Conference for Harmonization (ICH) Harmonized&#xD;
           Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations&#xD;
           (including European Directive 2001/20/EC), and with the ethical principles laid down in&#xD;
           the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Independent Ethics Committee: The protocol, informed consent form, recruitment&#xD;
           materials, and all subject materials will be submitted to an Independent Ethics&#xD;
           Committee (IEC) in each center for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol&#xD;
           and the consent form must be obtained before any subject is enrolled. The implementation&#xD;
           of any change in the protocol will not be permitted until the principal investigator and&#xD;
           the IEC have provided written approval of the change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed Consent Process: Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the&#xD;
           individual agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout study&#xD;
           participation. An extensive discussion of the risks and possible benefits of study&#xD;
           participation will be held with the subjects. A consent form describing in detail the&#xD;
           study procedures and risks will be given to the subject. Consent forms will be&#xD;
           IEC-approved, and the subject is required to read and review the document or have the&#xD;
           document read to him or her. The investigator or designee will explain the research&#xD;
           study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise. The subject will sign the&#xD;
           informed consent document prior to any study-related assessments or procedures. Subjects&#xD;
           will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with their families and take all the&#xD;
           time they need prior to agreeing to participate. They may withdraw consent at any time&#xD;
           throughout the course of the study. A copy of the signed informed consent document will&#xD;
           be given to the subjects for their records. The rights and welfare of the subjects will&#xD;
           be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their clinical care will not be&#xD;
           adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study. The consent process&#xD;
           will be documented in the clinical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subject Confidentiality: Subject confidentiality shall be guaranteed at all times by the&#xD;
           investigators, study staff, and the sponsor and their delegates. The study protocol,&#xD;
           documentation, data, and all other information generated will be strictly confidential.&#xD;
           No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized&#xD;
           third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all study&#xD;
      documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not&#xD;
      limited to the medical records of the study subjects. The clinical study site will permit&#xD;
      access to such records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING The investigator will be responsible for the completeness,&#xD;
      accuracy and timeliness of the data reported. All source documents should be completed in a&#xD;
      neat, legible manner to ensure the accurate interpretation of data. The Investigator is&#xD;
      required to verify the data transcribed onto the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study monitors then have to check the database against the source documents for accuracy&#xD;
      and validity as per the monitoring schedule, as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data Management Responsibilities Data collection and accurate documentation are the&#xD;
           responsibility of the study staff under the supervision of the investigator. All source&#xD;
           documents and laboratory reports must be reviewed by Site staff and data entry staff,&#xD;
           who will ensure that they are accurate and complete. Unanticipated problems and adverse&#xD;
           events must be reviewed by the investigator or designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Protocol Deviations The occurrence of any protocol deviations will be reported during&#xD;
