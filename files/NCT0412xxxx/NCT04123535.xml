      This is a single arm, single site, feasibility study of Magnetic Resonance Guided Focused&#xD;
      Ultrasound (MRgFUS) to promote immunotherapy responses in patients with undifferentiated&#xD;
      pleomorphic sarcoma&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, single site, feasibility study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of MRgFUS using the ExAblate 2100 System for the partial ablation of&#xD;
      undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas. A total of 20 adult participants will be treated with&#xD;
      MRgFUS through this study. A matched comparison group of archived samples from patients with&#xD;
      UPS who have not received focused ultrasound will be used as a control group to further&#xD;
      evaluate the secondary endpoints (stratified and matched for age, sex, and history of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy). All patients enrolled will receive timely standard of care&#xD;
      surgical resection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the overall rate and severity of adverse events following pre-operative MRgFUS&#xD;
      prior to surgical resection of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure possible immune response effects related to MRgFUS by serial serological&#xD;
           analysis with flow cytometry panels (T-cell, natural killer cell, myeloid panels).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure possible immune response effects related to MRgFUS by multiplex&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry assays of resected tumor specimens (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD68,&#xD;
           FOXP3, PD-1, PD-L1, CD45) as well as RNA sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare possible immune response effects in this group of patients receiving&#xD;
           pre-operative MRgFUS prior to surgical resection of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma&#xD;
           to a comparison group of archived samples from patients who have had resection of UPS&#xD;
           but did not have pre-operative focused ultrasound.&#xD;

    <description>The ExAblate 2100 MRgFUS system (InSightec, Inc., Dallas, Texas, USA) is a noninvasive thermal ablation device fully integrated with an MR imaging system and used for the ablation of soft tissue and bone.14-16 The ExAblate combines a focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) delivery system and a conventional diagnostic 3T Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner. The ExAblate systems provide a real-time therapy planning algorithm, thermal dosimetry, and closed-loop therapy control. The ExAblate transducer device is an integrated component of the MR table</description>
