    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, post-marketing, single-arm clinical investigation on the effects of&#xD;
      optimal insulin injection technique, in conjunction with the use of disposable Becton&#xD;
      Dickinson (BD) Micro-Fine Plus 32G pen needles, by Type I and Type II Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      patients, with or without lipohypertrophy, on clinical outcomes like HbA1c and hypoglycemic&#xD;
      events, as well as changes in insulin Total Daily Dose (TDD) and patient's Quality of Life&#xD;
      (QoL). During this study, each subject will be trained in the optimal insulin injection&#xD;
      technique by personal training as well as by following online video training modules on a&#xD;
      specific web-based platform.&#xD;
