  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to gain a deep understanding of the available lay/professional community&#xD;
      resources and systems of support for people with, and family carers of people with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease (PD), healthcare professionals and organisations and community groups,&#xD;
      and discuss strategies that could approximate interests of voluntary groups, and patients and&#xD;
      families. This will constitute a starting point to propose a transformative framework that&#xD;
      incorporates dialogue between sectors and levels of care for better living with PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From previous research the investigators know that living with PD depends on several factors&#xD;
      including the acceptance of diagnosis of PD management of symptoms and social support for the&#xD;
      person with the condition. Through this project the investigators aim to map on a diagram&#xD;
      (using a method called concentric circles) what are the lay and professional community&#xD;
      resources and systems of support that people with PD use or have available to them in the&#xD;
      community. The investigators will also explore ways these resources can be better utilized,&#xD;
      and to discuss their personal social preferences. This project aims to gain a deep&#xD;
      understanding of these resources and systems of support for people living with PD in the&#xD;
      community, carers, stakeholders and healthcare professionals, and discuss strategies that&#xD;
      could approximate interests of all stakeholders and professionals. This will constitute a&#xD;
      starting point to develop and implement a transformative framework that incorporates dialogue&#xD;
      between sectors and levels of care for better living with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to look at knowledge and attitudes towards resources in the community&#xD;
      of people with PD carers, stakeholders and healthcare professionals, with a special interest&#xD;
      in those living in less advantaged circumstances, such as older people living alone or in&#xD;
      less accessible areas. The investigators will map the social support available on circle&#xD;
      diagrams (demonstrating varying levels of value of this support) in one-to-one interviews&#xD;
      with approximately 10 people with PD, 10 family carers, 10 Stakeholders and 10 healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. The investigators will also undertake Focus Groups (n=4) with each of these&#xD;
      stakeholder groups. Focus Groups will go over concepts raised in interviews and develop&#xD;
      further understanding of priorities and tensions between different stakeholder groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in semi-structured interviews, which will begin with using a&#xD;
      concentric circles diagram to discuss and map social support networks and availability of&#xD;
      support for people with PD and family carers from the perspective of people with PD, carers,&#xD;
      stakeholders and healthcare professionals. This will encompass identification and discussion&#xD;
      of existing community resources and systems of support. All participants will also be asked&#xD;
      to complete a socio-demographic form (e.g. ge, gender, years since diagnosis of PD, working&#xD;
      status or organisation and professional role and years in practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual interviews will be undertaken face-to-face or by phone and will follow a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview guide. The mapping element creates a visual map of participant's&#xD;
      current social and support network, applying a concentric circles method, which will involve&#xD;
      thinking of, and visualising the sources of support or community resources involved in their&#xD;
      life as person with PD, carer, community or professional stakeholder or Healthcare&#xD;
      professional. Furthermore, participants' social preferences or choices will be discussed in&#xD;
      an attempt to understand the potential changes experienced and the utility and&#xD;
      appropriateness of community resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process will be facilitated and discussion will take place with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to take part in a Focus Group following on from analysis of&#xD;
      interviews to go over concepts raised in interviews and develop further understanding of&#xD;
      priorities and tensions between different stakeholder groups.&#xD;

    <description>We are not using questionnaires or other quantitative outcomes measures in this study, which is a development stage for a future feasibility study. We are using one-to-one qualitative interviews (10 of each participant group) and qualitative Focus groups (x4), and will use an interview schedule which will cover the following;&#xD;
knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about the available resources and support for people with PD&#xD;
the community challenges (availability of resources, integration of services, support in care) and the factors that influence roles, working relationships and partnerships between sectors in the management of PD.&#xD;
use a concentric circles mapping network tool to map out the sources of support in the community.&#xD;
strategies that could build partnerships between all stakeholders for development of a multi-sectoral action plan.&#xD;
the relationships with and capacity of voluntary organisations and their role in enhancing the experience of living with PD.</description>
