  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to reproduce candidate single nucleotide variants found by whole&#xD;
      exome sequencing in some type 2 diabetic patients dependent on sulfonylurea in a separate&#xD;
      patient group. The validation of the dependence-related variations performed in this study is&#xD;
      expected to help decision-making in the clinical use of sulfonylurea in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sulfonylurea, one of the oral hypoglycemic agents, is the oldest and most widely used drug.&#xD;
      The use of sulfonylurea was overwhelming compared to metformin especially in East Asia, where&#xD;
      insulin secretion was notable during the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. However,&#xD;
      sulfonylurea causes hypoglycemia and weight gain, increases cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      mortality compared to other oral preparations. With the recent development of other oral&#xD;
      hypoglycemic agents for lowering blood glucose without the risk of hypoglycemia and with&#xD;
      cardiovascular protection, sulfonylurea is in a decreasing state of use worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But some patients tend to be highly dependent on sulfonylurea for blood glucose control. It&#xD;
      suggests that there will be a group of patients whose the action of sulfonylurea is strongly&#xD;
      influenced by genetic factor, since insulin secretion of pancreatic beta cells is very&#xD;
      hereditary, genetic variations that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes are found mainly in&#xD;
      genes related to beta cell dysfunction rather than insulin resistance, and the more risk&#xD;
      variants of type 2 diabetes, the less likely the effect of sulfonylurea is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators had performed whole exome sequencing in patients showing dependence on&#xD;
      sulfonylurea and identified tens of candidate variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will select patients with dependence on sulfonylurea by&#xD;
      prospective intervention (by discontinuing and resuming sulfonylurea) and perform genetic&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
