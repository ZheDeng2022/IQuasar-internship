    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of AMV564 alone and in combination with Pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMV564-301 is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation with expansion trial in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In the dose-escalation portion of&#xD;
      the study, cohorts of patients will receive AMV564 alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      at increasing dose levels to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the&#xD;
      recommended dose for expansion. In the expansion portion of the study, one or more cohorts of&#xD;
      patients will receive AMV564 at the MTD or recommended dose to further evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and clinical activity.&#xD;
