  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the most effective dose of brief, non-invasive&#xD;
      brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS) for improving&#xD;
      cognitive functions such as attention and memory as well as to improve the ability to recover&#xD;
      from stressful situations (stress resilience).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) works by rapidly turning a focused&#xD;
      magnetic field on-and-off repeatedly over your head, which passes directly through your hair,&#xD;
      scalp, and skull and onto your brain, and can temporarily increase brain activity under the&#xD;
      magnetic field. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved&#xD;
      treatment for depression, and is used commonly to treat people for their depression. The rTMS&#xD;
      treatment regime used in this study is different from the FDA approved treatment because you&#xD;
      will receive up to ten treatments per day over five days instead of the FDA approved rTMS&#xD;
      treatment regime of 25 treatments over 25 days. This sort of accelerated or high dose&#xD;
      protocol has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of depression. We are&#xD;
      hoping to find out if this treatment can be used as a treatment for improving cognitive&#xD;
      function and stress resilience.&#xD;
