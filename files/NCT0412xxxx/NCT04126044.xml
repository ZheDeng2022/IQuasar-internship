    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized (1:1), parallel group, single dose, 2-arm, comparative PK&#xD;
      study of PF-06439535 (CN) and bevacizumab-EU administered intravenously to Chinese healthy&#xD;
      male volunteers. Approximately 66 subjects will be enrolled to ensure that at least 58&#xD;
      subjects (29 per arm) complete the study procedures and have evaluable PK data. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted at 1 center in China.&#xD;

             directly involved in the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
