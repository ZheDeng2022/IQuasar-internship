    <textblock>
      Muscular (i.e., quadriceps) weakness is a major risk factor for predisposing the knee to&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, impairing physical function, and increasing patient-reported pain. Muscular&#xD;
      weakness is a consequence of and could contribute to the development of knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      Minimizing muscular weakness has been fount to improve activities of daily living in patients&#xD;
      with osteoarthritis symptoms. Although vitamin D associates with muscular strength in young&#xD;
      and old populations, it is unknown if vitamin D supplementation improves muscular strength in&#xD;
      subjects with osteoarthritis or osteoarthritis symptoms. It is also unknown if supplemental&#xD;
      vitamin D alters circulating cytokine concentrations in subjects with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is probable that a more comprehensive supplement is necessary to improve&#xD;
      muscular strength. Such as glucosamine sulfate and omega-3 fatty acids (i.e.,&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids) which could be influential on knee pain and&#xD;
      inflammation as well as muscular strength. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      identify the influence of vitamin D supplementation with and without glucosamine sulfate and&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acids on circulating cytokine concentrations and muscular strength in subjects&#xD;
      with knee osteoarthritis symptoms. This study is intended to establish preliminary data&#xD;
      identifying the influence of vitamin D supplementation on circulating cytokines and muscular&#xD;
      strength in subjects with osteoarthritis at no more than minimal risk exposure to subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint condition and a leading contributor to the&#xD;
      global burden of disease. Estimates indicate that approximately 14 million people in the&#xD;
      United States have symptomatic knee OA, and nearly half of those individuals are between 45&#xD;
      and 65 years of age. Over the years, data have extended our knowledge regarding the early&#xD;
      premise of knee OA being the sole consequence of &quot;wear and tear&quot; processes of articular&#xD;
      cartilage and it is now recognized that knee OA arises, in part, as a consequence of&#xD;
      cytokine-mediated cellular and signaling events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines are pleiotropic proteins instrumental to the immune response, host defenses, and&#xD;
      intra- and inter-cellular signaling. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β&#xD;
      are pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote the catabolic and destructive events of knee OA&#xD;
      in animal and human studies. These findings are corroborated by data illustrating&#xD;
      chondrocytes as a site for pro-inflammatory cytokine production in knee OA, and that disease&#xD;
      severity and progression associate with increasing TNF-α, IL-1β, and other cytokine&#xD;
      concentrations in the circulation and transcriptional expression in peripheral blood&#xD;
      leukocytes. Fortunately, IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine expressed in chondrocytes and&#xD;
      possesses chondroprotective properties by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production.&#xD;
      While some factors are unavoidable or unpreventable, such as aging, trauma, and genetic&#xD;
      predisposition, disrupting the cytokine network could alter OA development and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low circulating vitamin D concentrations are reported in elderly with and without knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis symptoms. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations associate with muscular strength or&#xD;
      performance in elderly. Vitamin D supplementation increases serum 25(OH)D concentrations and&#xD;
      improves muscular strength in elderly. Based on these observations, vitamin D is essential&#xD;
      for muscle function in elderly, however, it is unknown if supplemental vitamin D influences&#xD;
      muscular strength in subjects with knee OA. Furthermore, it is probable that a more&#xD;
      comprehensive supplement is necessary to improve muscular strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify the influence of supplemental vitamin D on circulating&#xD;
      cytokines and muscular strength in subjects with knee OA. This study consists of a&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design. Subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of three groups: (#1) vitamin D (cholecalciferol, 4000 IU) with glucosamine sulfate (1000&#xD;
      mg) and omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 580 mg) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 470 mg)&#xD;
      acids), (#2) vitamin D (cholecalciferol, 4000 IU) with matching glucosamine sulfate and&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acid placebo supplements, or (#3) matching vitamin D, glucosamine sulfate and&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acid placebo supplements. Supplements will be taken daily for 84 days (12&#xD;
      weeks). Groups will be permutated in random blocks of six. Serum 25(OH)D, serum cytokines and&#xD;
      muscular-based outcomes will be determined prior to, during, and following supplementation.&#xD;
