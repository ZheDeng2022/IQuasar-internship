  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2B study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of PB2452 in reversing the anti-platelet&#xD;
      effects of ticagrelor as part of a dual antiplatelet regimen and to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of PB2452 in subjects aged 50-80 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 200 subjects between 50-80 years old will be enrolled in the US or other&#xD;
      countries at the discretion of the Sponsor across 5-15 sites. The subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      at a ratio of 3:1 receiving either the PB2452 investigational study drug or placebo. Hence, a&#xD;
      total of approximately 150 subjects will be receiving PB2452 and approximately 50 subjects&#xD;
      will be receiving placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a Screening period, a Check-in day, an on-site&#xD;
      Randomization/Treatment day, a 2-day on-site Follow-up period (Days 2 through 3), a Follow-up&#xD;
      visit (Day 7), and a Final Follow-up visit (Day 35±3). If needed and at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Investigator, a subject may remain in the study facility beyond the scheduled Day 3 discharge&#xD;
      to accommodate Day 7 and Day 35±3 follow-up visits. Seven days prior to enrollment, subjects&#xD;
      will be administered ASA 81 mg orally once daily (QD) until the final dose on Day 1.&#xD;
      Beginning in the morning on Day -2, a single dose of oral ticagrelor 180 mg will be given,&#xD;
      followed by oral ticagrelor 90 mg every 12 hours for 4 additional doses through to Day 1 (2&#xD;
      hours before study drug is initiated; this will be 5 total doses of ticagrelor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be randomized with 3:1 allocation ratio (active:placebo), to receive an IV dose of&#xD;
      PB2452 or placebo 2 hours following the 5th ticagrelor dose. Subjects may be discharged from&#xD;
      the clinical site on Day 3 and will return for a Follow-up visit on Day 7, if already&#xD;
      discharged, and on Day 35 (±3 days). A subject may remain in the study facility beyond the&#xD;
      scheduled Day 3 discharge to accommodate Day 7 and Day 35±3 follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject is taking a moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitor, a 36 g alternative regimen of&#xD;
      PB2452 will be administered consisting of 12 g infused over 10 minutes followed by a 12 g&#xD;
      loading dose infused over 6 hours, then a maintenance dose of 12 g infused over the next 18&#xD;
      hours immediately following completion of the loading period for a total infusion time of&#xD;
      approximately 24 hours.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject provides written or verbal informed consent (in-person or remotely) and&#xD;
             agrees to comply with all protocol requirements throughout study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is male or female between ≥50 and ≤80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a body mass index between 18 and 35 kg/m2 and a weight of ≥ 50 kg but&#xD;
             ≤ 120 kg, inclusive, at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is considered by the Investigator to be in good general health as&#xD;
             determined by medical history, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign&#xD;
             measurements, 12 lead ECG results, and physical examination findings at screening and&#xD;
             Check-in. Subjects with chronic, stable, and well-controlled medical conditions, are&#xD;
             eligible provided they meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has specific inclusionary laboratory values at screening and check-in:&#xD;
             white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count, haemoglobin level, thyroid-stimulating&#xD;
             hormone (TSH) level, and prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)&#xD;
             levels within the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking medications for well-controlled medical conditions must have been on a&#xD;
             stable dose for at least 30 days prior to screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects entering the study must be willing to start and/or document an 81 mg daily&#xD;
             dose of aspirin on Day -7 and must document daily dosing until the final dose is&#xD;
             administered on the morning of Day 1. Subjects already taking daily aspirin must&#xD;
             suspend aspirin dosing after Day 1 until discharge from the clinical facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant, lactating, or planning&#xD;
             to become pregnant for 3 months after the last dose of study drug. Female subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use two effective methods of birth control from screening&#xD;
             and before study drug administration through to the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the Investigator there are concern(s) regarding the inability of the&#xD;
             subject to comply with study procedures and/or follow up, or, if the subject is not&#xD;
             suitable for entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any acute or chronic medical disorder expected to decrease the life&#xD;
             expectancy of the subject to an extent where the subject's study participation is&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant acute illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
             laboratory assessments, and ECG parameters identified during screening or check-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any specific contraindication to ticagrelor as described in the ticagrelor prescribing&#xD;
             information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving chronic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [including&#xD;
             aspirin (&gt;100 mg daily), anticoagulants, or other antiplatelet agents that cannot be&#xD;
