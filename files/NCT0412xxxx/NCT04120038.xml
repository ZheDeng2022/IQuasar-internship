  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 6 weeks of the SMART Program on the&#xD;
      walking capacity and confidence of individuals with unilateral lower limb amputation (LLA).&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is that SMART can improve walking capacity in individuals with LLA.&#xD;
      Our secondary hypothesis is that SMART can improve ambulation confidence, body function,&#xD;
      depression, body image, pain, balance confidence, activities of daily living, satisfaction&#xD;
      with life and habit formation for skin monitoring and prosthetic cleaning in individuals with&#xD;
      LLA. A post-intervention one on one interview will be conducted to understand SMART&#xD;
      acceptability. The entirety of the study, including intervention administration, assessment,&#xD;
      and interviews will be conducted online.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive an online link to access the SMART platform. Online training on&#xD;
      using the SMART platform will be provided for participants. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete one education module per week at their own convenience and weekly online meetings&#xD;
      with a peer over the 6-week intervention period. The educational modules include&#xD;
      psychological adaptation, residual limb management, nutrition/weight control, managing a&#xD;
      prosthetic limb, managing chronic conditions and enhancing mobility. The modules include&#xD;
      instructional movies, goal setting logs, and quizzes. A module can be stopped or &quot;re-wound&quot;&#xD;
      at any point, and the participant's place and work-to-date is automatically saved. The SMART&#xD;
      platform will be asynchronously monitored through a web portal by the trainer, who will be a&#xD;
      PhD candidate in Rehabilitation Sciences and observe participant progress and provide&#xD;
      feedback if required. If there is no online activity within a 7-day (consecutive) period, the&#xD;
      trainer will contact the participant to inquire the reasons for inactivity and troubleshoot&#xD;
      any problems including technical issues. Clinical outcomes measures will be collected at two&#xD;
      timepoints (T1 &amp; T2). A post-intervention one on one interview will be conducted to explore&#xD;
      SMART acceptability.&#xD;
