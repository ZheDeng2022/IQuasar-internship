  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is common among very preterm infants. If pharmacological&#xD;
      closure is ineffective or contraindicated, surgical ligation may be required. Access to&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgery may influence the timing of ligation, with possible long-term clinical&#xD;
      effects. This study protocol aims to assess the impact of different surgical management of&#xD;
      PDA (bedside surgery vs. referral to a cardiac surgery centre) on ligation timing and&#xD;
      neonatal clinical outcomes in two tertiary Neonatal Intensive Care Units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants born at St. Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital, Bologna, Italy (group 1, bedside&#xD;
      ligation) and Cambridge University Hospital, Cambridge, UK (group 2, referred to an off-site&#xD;
      specialist paediatric cardiac surgical centre) who underwent PDA ligation between 2007 and&#xD;
      2018 will be included in this retrospective cohort study if fulfilling the following&#xD;
      criteria: gestational age (GA) &lt;32 weeks, birth weight (BW) &lt;1500 g, inborn, absence of major&#xD;
      malformation or congenital heart disease. Neonatal clinical outcomes will be collected and&#xD;
      compared between the 2 groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common condition among preterm infants, with an estimated&#xD;
      incidence of 60% in extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW). Several factors, such as the&#xD;
      relative oxygen hyposensitivity and increased sensitivity to prostaglandins of the immature&#xD;
      tissues and the scarceness of ductal medial muscles, contribute to the patency of arterial&#xD;
      duct in prematurely born neonates; as a consequence, the rate of spontaneous closure is&#xD;
      inversely related to gestational age (GA) Over the past two decades, the persistence of a&#xD;
      significant systemic-to-pulmonary shunt through the PDA has been associated with a higher&#xD;
      incidence of adverse clinical outcomes, including acute pulmonary morbidities and&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis (NEC), feeding intolerance and increased mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of PDA in very preterm infants first includes supportive therapy (e.g.,&#xD;
      restricted fluid intake, diuretics, increasing end-expiratory pressure) and targeted&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors (i.e., ibuprofen, indomethacin,&#xD;
      acetaminophen) or paracetamol if spontaneous closure does not occur. However, when&#xD;
      pharmacological closure is ineffective or contraindicated and the neonate requires extensive&#xD;
      respiratory support, surgical ligation may be required. PDA ligation can be performed&#xD;
      on-site, either at the infants' bedside or in the operation room, or off-site, if a&#xD;
      paediatric cardiac surgery team is not available locally. By favouring one approach over the&#xD;
      other, the setting may also contribute to influence the timing for PDA ligation. To date,&#xD;
      literature comparing the effects of early vs. delayed PDA ligation on the main neonatal&#xD;
      morbidities has led to contrasting results; hence, the optimal timing of surgical PDA closure&#xD;
      remains a matter of debate among neonatologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess whether a different management of surgical PDA closure (on-site&#xD;
      bedside ligation vs. referral to an off-site specialist paediatric cardiac surgical centre)&#xD;
      may influence the timing of the intervention and the main neurological, respiratory and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal clinical outcomes in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants from two&#xD;
      tertiary Neonatal Intensive Care Units with different paediatric cardiac surgery&#xD;
      capabilities. Postoperative complications, mortality rates and the length of hospital stay&#xD;
      will be also evaluated as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Preterm infants &lt;32 weeks' gestation born at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)&#xD;
      of Cambridge University Hospital (CUH, Cambridge, UK) and of St. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital&#xD;
      (SOM, Bologna, Italy) between January 1st, 2007 and June 30th, 2018 will be included in this&#xD;
      retrospective study if, due to failed or contraindicated medical therapy, underwent surgical&#xD;
      closure of PDA, judged hemodynamically significant (hsPDA) either on a clinical (hypotension,&#xD;
      ventilator dependence, heart failure symptoms) or echocardiographic basis (left atrial/aortic&#xD;
      root ratio &gt;1.5, pulsatile left-to-right shunt and/or mean velocity in the left pulmonary&#xD;
      artery &gt;0.6 m/s). The presence of major congenital malformations, including congenital heart&#xD;
      disease, was considered an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echo-Doppler studies of each patient will be reviewed, and the following parameters from the&#xD;
      latest pre-operative scan were will be recorded: PDA size and shunt characteristics&#xD;
      (direction and pattern); left atrial to aortic root ratio; evidence of reversed end-diastolic&#xD;
      flow in the descending aorta and/or in the middle or anterior cerebral artery (when&#xD;
      evaluated). Contraindications and adverse effects of pharmacological treatment will be also&#xD;
      reviewed. Failure of pharmacological treatment is defined by PDA persistency after at least&#xD;
      two full pharmacological courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal characteristics and the following pre- and peri-operative data will be recorded:&#xD;
      echocardiographic PDA characteristics, PDA management (supportive or pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment, related adverse effects, rates of responsiveness and recurrence),&#xD;
      post-conceptional age, days of life and weight at surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal outcomes include mortality rates, IVH, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), NEC,&#xD;
      sepsis (defined as relevant symptoms with positive blood culture and/or C reactive protein&#xD;
      &gt;25 mg/L and &gt;5 days of antibiotic treatment), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP, any grade)&#xD;
      and BPD (defined as any requirement for supplemental oxygen and/or positive-pressure&#xD;
      respiratory support at 36 weeks' post-conceptional age). Length of hospital stay, time needed&#xD;
      to achieve full enteral feeding, total duration of mechanical ventilation and the rate of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen need at hospital discharge will be also evaluated.&#xD;
