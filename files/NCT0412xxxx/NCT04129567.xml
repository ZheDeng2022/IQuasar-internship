  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a significant health problem in the United States with 34 million Americans&#xD;
      suffering from migraine attacks every year. High-flow oxygen has been successfully used in&#xD;
      several clinical studies. Vasoconstriction of blood vessels in the scalp has been proposed as&#xD;
      a possible mechanism of action. Some researchers have suggested that the cooling effect of&#xD;
      high-flow dry oxygen may be in part responsible for the pain relief. The main objective is to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that the pain relief obtained during high-flow trans-nasal gas therapy is&#xD;
      due to the cooling effect of dry gas on the nasal mucosa. The study entails recruiting&#xD;
      patients from a headache clinic, being escorted to the Institute for Clinical and&#xD;
      Translational Research (ICTR) Johns Hopkins Bayview and randomized into different groups&#xD;
      (humidified oxygen, dry air, humidified air and dry oxygen). Eventually, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out a questionnaire on pain, nausea, sound and light sensitivity graded on a&#xD;
      scale of 1-10. Readings are noted at baseline, 15 mins, 2 hours and 24 hours post-therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headaches are associated with significant impairment of quality of life and loss of&#xD;
      productivity. High-flow oxygen has been successfully used in several clinical trials and&#xD;
      vasoconstriction of blood vessels has been postulated as a possible mechanism. Some&#xD;
      researchers have suggested that the cooling effect of high-flow dry oxygen may be in part&#xD;
      responsible for the pain relief.The main objective is to test the hypothesis that the pain&#xD;
      relief obtained during high-flow intra-nasal gas therapy is due to the cooling effect of dry&#xD;
      gas on the nasal mucosa. Participants for this study are recruited from the pool of patients&#xD;
      who are already scheduled to attend the headache clinic staffed by the principal&#xD;
      investigator. The PI will recruit patients at the Headache Clinic. The patients are escorted&#xD;
      to the Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) at the Johns Hopkins Bayview where therapy its provided and&#xD;
      will be asked to fill out a questionnaire on pain, nausea, sound and light sensitivity using&#xD;
      a visual analog score (VAS) for each symptom on a scale of 1-10. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either humidified oxygen, dry air, humidified air or dry oxygen. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to submit readings at the end of therapy, at 2 hours and 24 hours post-therapy.&#xD;
      Treatment failure is defined as persistent headache despite treatment with oxygen or air.&#xD;
      Participants will be removed from the trial if participants prematurely terminate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that using a total sample size of 45 patients, the investigators&#xD;
      will be able to show a statistically significant difference of &gt;2 point change in the VAS&#xD;
      pain score reduction between the two treatment groups with a confidence of 80%. No risk were&#xD;
      reported in prior studies involving &gt;100 patients and &gt;500 episodes of treatment with air or&#xD;
      oxygen. Because of the (at least 2 and 1/2 hour) delay in initiating standard of care&#xD;
      treatments, subjects may experience a longer duration and/or intensity of pain from the&#xD;
      headache than regular standards of care i.e., sooner. Participants will be reimbursed for&#xD;
      participation in this study which will compensate travel and parking.&#xD;
