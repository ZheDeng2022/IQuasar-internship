    <textblock>
      Eating oily fish containing long chain seafood-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids&#xD;
      (PUFAs) protects against heart attacks and strokes. Hence most national and international&#xD;
      guidelines now recommend that adults eat at least 2 servings per week of oily fish. However&#xD;
      uptake of these recommendations is poor - many people do not eat seafood at all. A number of&#xD;
      factors probably contribute to this poor compliance with guidelines; limited availability and&#xD;
      costs of oily fish; distaste for oily fish; and concern about toxins in such fish. An Irish&#xD;
      company, Devenish Nutrition, offers a possible alternative solution - by feeding omega-3&#xD;
      PUFA-enriched feeds to chicken, Devenish Nutrition have demonstrated that the resultant&#xD;
      chicken meat and eggs are enriched in omega-3 PUFAs. A recently completed small study, with&#xD;
      30 participants, showed that 5 weeks of eating omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken resulted in&#xD;
      increased blood levels of omega-3 PUFAs. There were also beneficial effects on blood pressure&#xD;
      and on platelet stickiness. This study will be larger (including 160 participants) and longer&#xD;
      in duration (6 months). It will be a double-blind, controlled, randomized study. This will&#xD;
      allow testing whether eating omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken-meat regularly over a 6 month&#xD;
      period, results in even greater increments in blood levels of omega-3 PUFAs, and in greater&#xD;
      beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Beneficial effects of eating omega-3 PUFA&#xD;
      enriched eggs will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Alpha-linolenic acid&#xD;
      (ALA 18:3n-3) is found in plants. However the remaining three omega-3 PUFAs, which are longer&#xD;
      and more unsaturated (Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA 20:5n-3, Docosapentaenoic acid, DPA 22:5n-3,&#xD;
      and Docosahexaenoic acid, DHA 22:6n-3), are in large part found in oily seafood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of oily fish, and of long chain seafood-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (PUFAs), has been strongly and consistently associated with reduced cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. In a 2011 &quot;State of the Art Paper&quot; Mozaffarian and colleagues&#xD;
      concluded that &quot;current data provide strong concordant evidence that long chain (seafood) n-3&#xD;
      PUFA are bioactive compounds that reduce risk of cardiac death&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seafood derived omega-3 PUFAs influence a myriad of molecular pathways including membrane&#xD;
      structure, ion channel properties, genetic regulation, hepatic fatty acid metabolism,&#xD;
      eicosanoid and inflammatory mediator synthesis. It appears likely that the beneficial effects&#xD;
      of omega-3 PUFAs are mediated through downstream effects on a range of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors including blood pressure, heart rhythm, lipid levels, inflammation, and lastly&#xD;
      thrombotic tendency through effects on platelet function. The omega-3 fatty acid&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is proven essential to pre and postnatal brain development while&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is more influential on behaviour and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the strong evidence of benefits of seafood derived omega-3 PUFAs, most national&#xD;
      and international guidelines now recommend that adults eat at least 2 servings/week of oily&#xD;
      fish (&gt;250 mg/day of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs). However uptake of these recommendations is&#xD;
      poor - many people do not consume seafood at all, and approximately one-half of U.S adults&#xD;
      consume &lt;60 mg/day of EPA+DHA. A number of factors probably contribute to this poor&#xD;
      compliance; limited availability and costs of oily fish; distaste for oily fish; and concern&#xD;
      about toxins in such fish including methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Irish company, Devenish Nutrition, offers a possible alternative solution - by feeding&#xD;
      algae derived omega-3 PUFAs enriched feeds to broiler chicken, Devenish Nutrition have&#xD;
      demonstrated that the resultant chicken meat is enriched in EPA, DPA and DHA. Furthermore&#xD;
      there was no detrimental effect to bird performance or on taste. Omega-3 enriched eggs are&#xD;
      currently commercially available (Skea Egg Farms Ltd, Dungannon, Tyrone), and are produced in&#xD;
      a similar fashion, through feeding omega-3 PUFAs enriched feeds to hens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a just completed pilot study, portions of omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken-meat were eaten,&#xD;
      three times weekly for five weeks, by 30 healthy human volunteers. Plasma levels of the 3&#xD;
      seafood derived omega-3 PUFAs increased from 82 ug/g at baseline to 93 ug/g at five weeks&#xD;
      (12% increment, p=0.006), and the red cell omega-3 index (sum of EPA and DHA expressed as&#xD;
      percentage of total fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes) increased from 4.9% to 5.1% (p =&#xD;
      ns). At 5 weeks, two secondary end-points, blood pressure (BP) and platelet reactivity, had&#xD;
      declined significantly in the 30 healthy volunteers - clinic systolic BP reduced from 116 to&#xD;
      113 mmHg (p = 0.014), and urinary thromboxane reduced from 1435 to 1024 pg/mg creatinine (p =&#xD;
      0.037).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this double-blind, controlled, randomized study, the investigators intend to test whether&#xD;
      eating of omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken-meat over a 6 month period, results in greater&#xD;
      increments in plasma and red cell levels of omega-3 PUFAs, and in greater beneficial effects&#xD;
      on cardiovascular risk factors and on cognitive function and mood. In a second limb to this&#xD;
      study the investigators will test for additional beneficial effects in humans of consumption&#xD;
      of omega-3 PUFA enriched eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The red cell omega-3 index was chosen as the primary outcome for this study, because of its&#xD;
      lessor variability over time compared to plasma values, and because of its proven correlation&#xD;
      with EPA and DHA levels in human cardiac tissue, and in multiple relevant organs in animal&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AIMS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two co-primary objectives are to test whether;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The consumption of 3 servings of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat per week, over a 6&#xD;
           month period, results in measurably higher red cell levels of EPA and DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The consumption of 3 omega-3 enriched eggs per week, over a 6 month period, results in&#xD;
           measurably higher red cell levels of EPA and DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include the evaluation of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the consumption of 3 servings of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat per week,&#xD;
           over a 6 month period, results in measurably higher plasma levels of EPA and DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the consumption of 3 omega-3 enriched eggs per week, over a 6 month period,&#xD;
           results in measurably higher plasma levels of EPA and DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the consumption of 3 servings of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat per week,&#xD;
           over a 6 month period, reduces BP, heart rate, lipid levels, inflammation and/or&#xD;
           thrombotic tendencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the consumption of 3 omega-3 enriched eggs per week, over a 6 month period,&#xD;
           reduces BP, heart rate, lipid levels, inflammation and/or thrombotic tendencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the consumption of 3 servings of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat per week,&#xD;
           over a 6 month period, results in improved cognitive function and/or mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the consumption of 3 omega-3 enriched eggs per week, over a 6 month period,&#xD;
           results in improved cognitive function and/or mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 participants will be recruited to the study through hospital out-patient departments,&#xD;
      general practices, and by public advertisement by 2 clinical sites in Dublin, Beaumont and&#xD;
      Connolly Hospitals, both of whom are part of the RCSI Teaching Hospital Network Academic&#xD;
      Health Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a controlled, double-blind randomised study. Using a 2X2 factorial design, 160&#xD;
      healthy participants will be randomised to eat at least 3 portions/week of omega-3-PUFA&#xD;
      enriched (or control) chicken-meat, and to eat at least 3 omega-3-PUFA enriched (or Control)&#xD;
      eggs/week, for 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY CONDUCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to recruitment to the study, potential participants will be given comprehensive&#xD;
      information about the study, unlimited time to study this written information, and all&#xD;
      questions will be answered by a study investigator. If the potential participant is satisfied&#xD;
      with this information, and wishes to participate, written informed consent will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit, a comprehensive lifestyle and medical history will be taken. A food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire will be completed to capture food intake over the previous year.&#xD;
      Clinic and ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate will also be measured, as will height,&#xD;
      weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Finally, assessment of cognitive function&#xD;
      and mood will be carried out by a battery of tests. A fasting blood sample will be taken to&#xD;
      allow measurement of plasma and red cell levels of EPA and DHA, full blood count (platelet&#xD;
      count), renal function, liver function, plasma lipid levels, inflammation (high sensitivity&#xD;
      C-reactive protein), platelet function (platelet aggregation and serum thromboxane), and DNA&#xD;
      extraction. Urine sampling will also occur to allow assessment of platelet turnover (urinary&#xD;
      thromboxane/creatinine ratio), and renal function (microalbuminuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all screening assessments have been completed, and if all inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are satisfied, participants will be randomized to eating omega-3 PUFA enriched&#xD;
      chicken-meat or control chicken-meat, and to omega-3 PUFA enriched eggs or control eggs, for&#xD;
      the 6 month period. Randomization will be stratified according to gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken (whole chickens, breasts, thighs, drums and wings) and eggs, or&#xD;
      the appropriate control chicken and control eggs, will be delivered to the homes of study&#xD;
      participants at regular intervals (weekly or two-weekly), so that both they, and up to four&#xD;
      family members, will be able to eat at least 3 servings per week of chicken meat, and at&#xD;
      least 3 eggs weekly over the 6 month study period. The chicken-meat will be delivered frozen,&#xD;
      and the eggs will be delivered refrigerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to avoid the taking of omega-3 PUFA supplements,&#xD;
      antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, or any&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nurofen, indomethacin, diclofenac etc) for the&#xD;
      duration of the study. If an analgesic is needed paracetamol may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to fast, not drink tea or coffee, not smoke and not engage in&#xD;
      intense exercise from midnight (minimum 8 hours) prior to the screening (baseline) visit, and&#xD;
      prior to the 3 and 6 month visits. Participants may drink water and take essential&#xD;
      medications on these mornings. At both the 3 month and the 6 month (final) visit, all&#xD;
      baseline assessments will be repeated. At months 1,2,4 and 5 a telephone call will be made to&#xD;
      check on participant well-being (absence of adverse events), and on compliance with diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, range, %) will be used to&#xD;
      describe baseline characteristics of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in both the primary and the secondary end-points, at 3 and 6 months from baseline,&#xD;
      with consumption of omega-3 enriched chicken-meat and eggs, will be compared to the changes&#xD;
      recorded with consumption of control chicken-meat and eggs, using two-way ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to test whether the consumption of 3 servings per week&#xD;
      of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat and/or the consumption of 3 omega-3 PUFA enriched eggs,&#xD;
      over a 6 month period results in measurably higher red levels of EPA and DHA (red cell&#xD;
      omega-3 index). From the recently completed pilot study, wherein 30 healthy community&#xD;
      dwelling subjects ate three servings per week of omega-3-PUFA enriched chicken meat for 5&#xD;
      weeks, the baseline omega-3 index was 4.93% (standard deviation 1.11%). This increased to&#xD;
      5.12% (1.18%) after 5 weeks. The mean difference was 0.19% (0.44%). In order to achieve a&#xD;
      power of 95% to detect a difference of 1% in the omega-3 index between those eating control&#xD;
      and enriched chicken-meat, and between those eating control and enriched eggs, at a&#xD;
      2-sided-level of 0.05, a sample size of 132 participants is required. To allow for potential&#xD;
      losses to follow-up, enrollment of 160 participants is planned.&#xD;
