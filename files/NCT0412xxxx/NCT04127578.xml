  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study PRV-PD101 is a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, open-label, ascending dose, first in-human&#xD;
      study that will evaluate the safety of intracisternal PR001 administration in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe Parkinson's disease with at least 1 pathogenic GBA1 mutation. Two&#xD;
      escalating dose cohorts are planned (low dose and high dose). The duration of the study is 5&#xD;
      years. During the first year, patients will be evaluated for the effect of PR001 on safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, immunogenicity, biomarkers, and clinical efficacy measures. Patients will&#xD;
      continue to be followed for an additional 4 years to continue to monitor safety as well as&#xD;
      selected biomarker and efficacy measures.&#xD;
