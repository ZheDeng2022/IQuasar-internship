  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cancer in China, with a crude&#xD;
      incidence rate of 26.67 per 100,000 population. Moreover, 357,800 new liver cancer cases are&#xD;
      predicted to be diagnosed in China in 2020. HCC represents approximately 90% of all cases of&#xD;
      primary liver cancer. HCC has a high predilection for portal vein invasion, which occurs in&#xD;
      44-62% of living patients with HCC. Patients with PVTT usually have an aggressive disease&#xD;
      course, decreased liver function reserve, limited treatment options, thus worse overall&#xD;
      survival. Among untreated HCC patients with PVTT, the median overall survival has been&#xD;
      reported as low as 2 to 4 months with supportive care. Sorafenib is the first-line treatment&#xD;
      for HCC patients with PVTT, however, it has shown unsatisfactory benefit. Notably, sorafenib&#xD;
      combined with TACE significantly improved the TTP over sorafenib alone, albeit for no more&#xD;
      than 1 month in the median TTP, and the median OS was not significantly prolonged. A&#xD;
      promising drug-lenvatinib was approved in China on September 2018, in the China patients&#xD;
      subgroup analysis showed an encouraging results. Lenvatinib group had showed a significant&#xD;
      benefit in TTP, PFS and ORR. Also median overall survival time was significantly improved in&#xD;
      China subgroup (Lenvatinib group: 15 months VS Sorafenib group: 10.2 months). However,&#xD;
      REFLECT didn't enrolled patients who had tumors invading the maint portal vein. The&#xD;
      mechanisms of lenvatinib or sorafenib combined with TACE were still unknown, and clinical&#xD;
      data were limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was to explore lenvatinib plus TACE versus sorafenib plus TACE for HCC with PVTT:&#xD;
      efficacy and safety. Biomarkers expression of VEGFR, FGFR, FDGF-α, IL-2,etc would be detected&#xD;
      to find the difference between the two groups, finally to analyze the relationship between&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and biomarkers' expression. A better treatment modality to HCC with PVTT&#xD;
      patients would be expected and promoted.&#xD;

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cancer in China, with a crude&#xD;
      incidence rate of 26.67 per 100,000 population. Moreover, 357,800 new liver cancer cases are&#xD;
      predicted to be diagnosed in China in 2020, and HCC is by far the most common subtype of&#xD;
      primary liver cancer and is the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death in the&#xD;
      country. Approximately 80% of liver cancers are attributed to chronic infection with&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus; other factors, including diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use, have also been found&#xD;
      to be potential risk factors for liver cancer HCC has a high predilection for portal vein&#xD;
      invasion, which occurs in 44-62% of living patients with HCC. Portal vein tumour thrombosis&#xD;
      (PVTT) usually portends a worse prognosis, with a median survival time of only 2.7-4.0 months&#xD;
      in untreated patients. Despite advancements in understanding the molecular aetiology of HCC,&#xD;
      the outcomes for patients with this disease who develop PVTT remain unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several treatment strategies for patients with inoperable HCC who developed PVTT have been&#xD;
      attempted, including first-line targeted therapy with sorafenib, transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolisation (TACE), TACE plus sorafenib, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA),&#xD;
      and radiotherapy. However, the prognosis of patients with HCC who are complicated by PVTT&#xD;
      remains poor, and the optimal treatment modality for such patients has not been established&#xD;
      to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, sorafenib combined with TACE significantly improved the TTP over sorafenib alone,&#xD;
      albeit for no more than 1 month; the median TTP was less than 3 months, and the median OS was&#xD;
      not significantly prolonged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent phase III global multicentre REFLECT study, lenvatinib, the only other&#xD;
      available first-line anti-angiogenic drug, did not improve overall survival (OS). However,&#xD;
      lenvatinib as an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets VEGF receptors 1-3, FGF receptors&#xD;
      1-4, PDGF receptor α, RET and KIT, median time of PFS was 8.9 months (95% CI 7.4-9.2) for&#xD;
      patients in the lenvatinib group compared to 3.7 months (95% CI 3.6-5.4) for patients in the&#xD;
      sorafenib group. Lenvatinib also showed a greater objective response rate (ORR) than did&#xD;
      sorafenib group. ORR was 40.6% (95% CI 36.2-45.0) for patients in the lenvatinib group&#xD;
      compared to 12.4% (95% CI 9.4-15.4) for patients in the sorafenib group, and TTP was 7.4 (95%&#xD;
      CI 7.2-9.1) VS 3.7 (95% CI 3.6-3.9). What's more, in the Chinese patients subgroup analysis&#xD;
      showed an encouraging results, lenvatinib group not only showed significant improvement in&#xD;
      PFS, TTP, ORR, but also in median OS time ( Lenvatinib group: 15 months VS sorafenib group&#xD;
      10.2 months). However, REFLECT didn't enrolled patients who had tumors invading the maint&#xD;
      portal vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the mechanism of sorafenib combined with TACE was unknown, and clinical data of TACE&#xD;
      plus lenvatinib for HCC had not been reported until now. As our preliminary experimental&#xD;
      results showed that lenvatinib combined with TACE show a 91.7% clinical benefit in 11 cases&#xD;
      HCC with PVTT (7 PR cases, 4 SD cases) , the median TTP was 6.5 months, during the&#xD;
      preliminary experimental trail hadn't observed any fatal adverse event occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these supporting data, lenvatinib plus TACE showed a potential benefit to HCC&#xD;
      with PVTT patients. This study was to explore lenvatinib plus TACE versus sorafenib plus TACE&#xD;
      for HCC with PVTT: efficacy and safety. Biomarkers expression of VEGFR, FGFR, PDGF-α,&#xD;
      IL-2,etc would be detected to find the difference between the two groups, finally to analyze&#xD;
      the relationship between clinical outcomes and biomarkers' expression.&#xD;
