      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that VRVg-2 (purified rabies vaccine) is non-inferior to Verorab and Imovax&#xD;
      Rabies vaccines in each age group (pediatric and adult populations), in terms of proportion&#xD;
      of participants achieving a rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer ≥ 0.5&#xD;
      international units (IU)/ milliliter (mL) at Day 42, i.e., 14 days after the last injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of VRVg-2 versus Verorab and Imovax Rabies vaccines after&#xD;
           each vaccine injection in each age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety of a single booster dose of VRVg-2 in a subset of adults&#xD;
           following primary series with VRVg-2, Verorab, and Imovax Rabies vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that at least 99% of participants in the VRVg-2 group achieve an RVNA&#xD;
           titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at Day 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that VRVg-2 is non-inferior to Verorab and Imovax Rabies vaccines in each&#xD;
           age group, in terms of proportion of participants achieving a RVNA titer of ≥ 0.5 IU/mL&#xD;
           at Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg-2 versus Verorab and Imovax Rabies&#xD;
           vaccines at Day 28 and Day 42 in all age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg-2 at Day 14 after a single booster of&#xD;
           VRVg-2 administered 12 months after the primary series with VRVg-2, Verorab or Imovax&#xD;
           Rabies vaccines in a subset of adult participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of each participant's participation in the study is approximately 7 months (28&#xD;
      day-vaccination period followed by 6 month safety follow-up period). For the subset of adults&#xD;
      who receive a single booster dose of VRVg-2, the duration is approximately 18 months (1&#xD;
      booster dose 12 months after the first injection, followed by a 6 month safety follow-up&#xD;
      period).&#xD;
