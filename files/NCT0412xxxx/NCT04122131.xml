      Despite the ongoing refinement of current breast cancer staging, clinical outcome is still&#xD;
      varied among patients of similar stage. Further exploration of novel prognostic factors is of&#xD;
      great clinical value. In our earlier findings, we have demonstrated the added value of&#xD;
      fibrotic focus (FF) in the current staging. However the precise composition in different&#xD;
      components within FF and underlying mechanism involved remain to be determined. In fact,&#xD;
      there is unappreciated heterogeneity in FF. All these have limited its application in&#xD;
      clinical practice. In this proposal, a systemic evaluation on the FF features in breast&#xD;
      cancers will be performed. We aim to further characterize FF at morphological, cellular and&#xD;
      molecular levels as well as its collagen characteristics. Given the multiple lines of&#xD;
      evidence showing its relationship with immune components, additional attention will be put on&#xD;
      its interaction with immune tumor environment. Finally, we plan to develop prognostic model&#xD;
      integrating these different FF features for a more accurate risk stratification. Accumulated&#xD;
      evidence suggested that the significance of FF in breast cancer prognosis. Moreover, the&#xD;
      impact of fibrotic stroma on tumor immune environment may be implicative in immunotherapy.&#xD;
      The more complete understanding of FF is pre-requisite for its development as an applicable&#xD;
      prognostic marker in breast cancer.&#xD;

      Background Breast cancers exhibit a wide scope of morphologic features with demonstrated&#xD;
      prognostic significance. These features have the advantage of easily evaluated in routine&#xD;
      reporting; thus offering great clinical potential. In our earlier analysis, fibrotic focus&#xD;
      (FF) was demonstrated to have added value to the current staging. FF refers to the central&#xD;
      scar like area in an invasive tumor, and is surrounded by a highly cellular zone of&#xD;
      infiltrating tumor cells. It is composed of fibroblasts and collagen fibers forming a&#xD;
      radially expanding fibrosclerotic core, with an incidence of around 20%. The precise&#xD;
      composition of the different components within FF may affect its prognostic value in breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and collagen components are the most prominent features&#xD;
      in FF. FF with proliferative CAF was associated with higher risk of metastasis. Moreover,&#xD;
      CAFs identified by fibroblastic markers were correlated with breast cancer recurrence. In&#xD;
      breast cancer, different subsets of CAF by differential fibroblastic markers have been&#xD;
      characterized recently. They were present in varying proportions in breast cancer subtypes&#xD;
      and conferred dissimilar impact on the immune tumor microenvironment (TME). Nonetheless, the&#xD;
      relationship of CAF subtypes and FF and whether they will affect the FF prognostic impact&#xD;
      remain elusive. Apart from CAF, the potent influence of collagen content in cancer is&#xD;
      increasingly appreciated. Collagen stroma can modulate immune TME by inhibiting CD8 T&#xD;
      lymphocytes infiltration. The expression of collagen and other extracellular matrix&#xD;
      components is prognostic in different types of cancer patients, including breast cancer. For&#xD;
      FF, detailed analysis on the collagen content is still lacking. The distinct collagen&#xD;
      composition and organization could also impact on the prognostic capabilities of FF. The&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms for effects of FF are largely unknown. To date, there are very few&#xD;
      reports of molecular analysis of breast cancers with FF. FF has been associated with&#xD;
      increased angiogenesis, hypoxia markers expression and activation of hypoxia-inducible&#xD;
      factor-1Î± pathway, and concordantly increased tumor associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration.&#xD;
      Exploration of other key biomarkers involved in will provide additional information on FF&#xD;
      prognostication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, a systemic evaluation on the FF features in breast cancers will be&#xD;
      performed. We aim to further characterize FF at different levels in detail. Finally, we plan&#xD;
      to develop prognostic model integrating the different FF features for a more accurate risk&#xD;
      stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design To characterize FF based on morphologic, structural and molecular features The&#xD;
      different morphologic features of FF will be examined and correlated with the&#xD;
      clinico-pathologic parameters and breast cancer subtypes. To characterize the collagen&#xD;
      stroma, the expression of these different collagens will be determined by IHC analysis. The&#xD;
      structural characteristics of the collagen fibers will be determined on SHG signal and/or&#xD;
      pico-Sirius red staining. The collagen composition and structural features in cases with&#xD;
      different FF morphological features will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the characterization of fibroblastic components, CAF populations will be determined by&#xD;
      IHC analysis. Based on the reported CAF phenotypes, CAF markers will be examined on the&#xD;
      consecutive IHC slides. Co-expression of CAF markers will be evaluated using multiple IHC&#xD;
      alignment. The relationship of CAF subpopulations on FF and collagen features as well as&#xD;
      clinico-pathologic characteristics will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The candidates from top differential genes and pathways implicated in FF will be examined.&#xD;
      The candidates will be prioritized also based on survey of published literatures and their&#xD;
      biological relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hierarchical clustering analysis will be performed to classify FF based on the different&#xD;
      features. The correlation of defined FF subsets and clinico-pathologic features will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact of FF in immune TME To examine the effects of FF in the immune TME,&#xD;
      we will investigate several immune cell populations in situ simultaneously using mIHC.&#xD;
      Patients will be clustered based on their immune cell profiles. The immune cells density,&#xD;
      their relative ratio, immune profile and spatial relationship with tumor cells will be&#xD;
      assessed in relation to different FF features and compare between FF and non-FF cases. The&#xD;
      interplay of immune features and FF in prognosis will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the prognostic value of FF in breast cancer. Having examined the&#xD;
      clinico-pathologic correlation of various features of FF and its relationship of tumor immune&#xD;
      environment, their prognostic value on overall survival, recurrence and metastasis will be&#xD;
      analyszd using the Kaplan-Meier method. Their prognostic impacts will be compared with each&#xD;
      other using univariate Cox proportional hazards model. Their independent prognostic value&#xD;
      will be determined by multivariate analysis together with other conventional prognostic&#xD;
      markers. A novel predictive model will be constructed based on the independent risk factors&#xD;
      derived from the multivariate analysis. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve will&#xD;
      be used to identify the cutoff value.&#xD;
