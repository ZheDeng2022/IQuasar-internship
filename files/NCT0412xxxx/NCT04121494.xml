  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalating and a paired-placebo design study to describe the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity profile of candidate TB vaccine ChAdOx1 85A given by aerosol inhaled&#xD;
      vaccination versus intramuscular (IM) vaccination in adult healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is postulated that the aerosol inhaled route is practical and feasible and has an&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile, comparable to the systemic safety profile of the IM route of&#xD;
      administration of ChAdOx1 85A in adult healthy volunteers, and that the aerosol inhaled route&#xD;
      of administration will induce greater mucosal immunity and comparable systemic immunity when&#xD;
      compared to the IM (systemic) route of administration in these volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are followed on a regular basis for safety and immunogenicity, with blood analysis&#xD;
      for biological safety tests and immune tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is a pathogen with worldwide preponderance which infects&#xD;
      humans and causes tuberculosis (TB), a transmissible disease resulting in very high mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity. A third of the world's population is latently infected with M.tb, and these&#xD;
      people carry a 10% lifetime risk of developing active life-threatening disease. In 2015,&#xD;
      there were 10.4 million new cases worldwide and 1.8 million people died of TB. Co-infection&#xD;
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) greatly increases risk of TB reactivation and death.&#xD;
      Diagnosis is challenging and drug treatment can be prolonged, harmful, costly and complex.&#xD;
      For these reasons an effective TB vaccine is a global public health priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the only licensed TB vaccine and it has been&#xD;
      administered globally to several billion people over a 90 year period. Although it does not&#xD;
      protect against pulmonary TB in endemic areas, it is effective in preventing disseminated TB&#xD;
      disease including tuberculous meningitis in childhood. Recently, heterologous &quot;prime-boost&quot;&#xD;
      vaccination strategies, in which two different candidate vaccines expressing antigens in&#xD;
      common are given weeks or months apart, have generated strong and sustained cellular immune&#xD;
      responses correlating with an M.tb protective effect in preclinical animal models. In such a&#xD;
      &quot;prime-boost&quot; strategy, BCG would therefore be an ideal priming vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ChAdOx1 85A is a new adenoviral vaccine based on a vector that is a chimpanzee adenovirus&#xD;
      isolate Y25 expressing the M.tb antigen 85A. Adenoviruses are attractive candidates for use&#xD;
      as viral vectors and have been used as vaccine vectors for a number of conditions; however&#xD;
      the use has been limited by the high level of anti-vector immunity present in humans in whom&#xD;
      adenovirus is a ubiquitous infection. This has led to the consideration of simian&#xD;
      adenoviruses, which are not known to cause pathology or illness in humans and to which the&#xD;
      prevalence of anti-vector antibodies is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The route of M.tb infection is by inhalation of aerosolised infectious droplets containing&#xD;
      tubercle bacilli, leading to the establishment of primary infection in the lung, which has a&#xD;
      distinct mucosal immune system characterized by bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT),&#xD;
      which is well adapted to encounter and process such antigens. Immunising via the airway&#xD;
      should therefore have the advantage, over other routes, of eliciting protective immune&#xD;
      responses in the lung mucosa. There is data from preclinical animal models with virally&#xD;
      vectored vaccines to suggest that immunising the respiratory mucosa may give superior&#xD;
      protection against respiratory diseases. The inhaled route is a well-established route of&#xD;
      drug delivery for humans and there are numerous perceived advantages of aerosol inhaled&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be the first to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of candidate TB&#xD;
      vaccine ChAdOx1 85A given by aerosol inhaled vaccination. Using a paired-placebo design, the&#xD;
      trial will investigate aerosol vaccination compared to intramuscular vaccination, the latter&#xD;
      for which initial safety data has already been collected and from which the dosing regimen&#xD;
      for this trial has been chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to describe the safety and immunogenicity profile for ChAdOx1 85A given by&#xD;
      aerosol inhaled vaccination versus intramuscular (IM) vaccination in adult healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-nine subjects will be enrolled into the trial: 29 BCG-vaccinated and 10 BCG-naïve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine BCG-vaccinated healthy volunteers will receive the ChAdOx1 85A vaccine by aerosol&#xD;
      inhaled vaccination at three different dose levels (3 volunteers per dose levels, Groups&#xD;
      A-B-C). Based on the safety profile and immunogenicity results obtained in Groups A, B and C,&#xD;
      the highest tolerated dose will be determined, and a decision made as to which dose to use&#xD;
      for subsequent Groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next 20 BCG-vaccinated subjects will be blinded and randomised in Groups D and E:&#xD;
      volunteers randomised to the intervention group (D, inhaled aerosol) will receive a&#xD;
      concurrent intramuscular saline injection, while volunteers in the control group (E,&#xD;
      intramuscular) will receive a concurrent dose of inhaled saline. This design has the added&#xD;
      benefit of allowing a distinction to be made between any adverse events attributable to the&#xD;
      method (including nebuliser device) of vaccine delivery and those attributable to the inhaled&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel to enrolment of Groups D and E, 10 BCG naïve subjects will be enrolled in Group F&#xD;
      to receive the highest tolerated dose by aerosol inhaled vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After vaccination (day 0), volunteers will then follow a schedule of visits over the six&#xD;
      months (day 1, day 7, day 14, day 28, day 84 and day 168), for safety and immunological&#xD;
      follow-up via blood tests and physical examination. Moreover, at day 14, volunteers will&#xD;
      undergo a bronchoscopy to check for signs of inflammation or other damage and to obtain a&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage sample and lymph node cytopunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall investigational approach with ChAdOx1 85A trials is to develop an effective&#xD;
      prime-boost vaccination strategy to prevent TB infection, with BCG as the priming vaccine.&#xD;
