  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study examining the use of&#xD;
      perioperative pregabalin in ureteroscopy with stent placement. Ureteroscopy is typically&#xD;
      performed for kidney or ureteral stones, but may be performed for other reasons such as for&#xD;
      the diagnosis and possible treatment of certain kinds of cancers. As part of the same&#xD;
      surgery, a ureteral stent is often placed. The surgery and the stent can cause discomfort,&#xD;
      and patients may receive narcotic pain medicine. In other surgeries, a single dose of&#xD;
      pregabalin, around one hour before surgery has been shown to decrease the need for pain&#xD;
      medication after the surgery. This work will test whether this is true in ureteroscopy by&#xD;
      giving eligible patients who agree to participate either pregabalin or a placebo shortly&#xD;
      before surgery then examining how much pain medication they use after surgery. A placebo is&#xD;
      an inactive medication. Neither the study participant nor the study staff will know who&#xD;
      received pregabalin and who received placebo until after the study is over. For completing&#xD;
      surveys, patients will receive compensation for their time in the form of gift certificates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of urolithiasis is greater than 8% and increasing in the United States. For&#xD;
      those who require surgery, ureteroscopic treatment is common, representing &gt;120,000&#xD;
      procedures yearly in the United States. This does not include ureteroscopy for other,&#xD;
      including diagnosis of structural anomaly and diagnosis and management of ureteral and renal&#xD;
      pelvic tumors. Frequently, a ureteral stent is placed intraoperatively. There is&#xD;
      post-operative pain in around 80% of patients, and 12% of those undergoing ureteroscopy will&#xD;
      have an emergency department visit in the first 30 post-operative days, typically for stent&#xD;
      related symptoms or post procedural pain. Aside from the short-term repercussions of&#xD;
      ureteroscopy with stent placement there are long-term issues related to pain and the&#xD;
      treatment thereof. Recent evidence suggests that approximately 6% of opioid na√Øve patients&#xD;
      who undergo ureteroscopy will become new persistent opioid users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single perioperative dose of pregabalin has been shown in many surgical contexts to have&#xD;
      analgesic, anxiolytic, and opioid sparing effects. A common regimen employed in the&#xD;
      literature is a single preoperative dose of 300mg PO pregabalin 1hr before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Pregabalin is a well-tolerated gabapentinoid medication with temporary&#xD;
      cognition/coordination changes being the most common side effects. There is currently no&#xD;
      standard of care for the use of perioperative gabapentinoid medication in ureteroscopy. A&#xD;
      pilot was performed looking at such use that demonstrated the safety of this use and the&#xD;
      feasibility of studying this at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, the efficacy and safety of perioperative pregabalin in ureteroscopy with stent&#xD;
      placement will be evaluated by executing a prospective, double blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial for the use of perioperative pregabalin in the management of&#xD;
      post-ureteroscopy symptoms, with the hypothesis that this treatment is safe and efficacious.&#xD;
      Emphasis will be placed on patient-centered outcomes, especially those related to opioid&#xD;
      sparing effects, mainly within the first 30 days after the surgery and extending out to one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be powered with an 80% probability to detect a 10% difference in the primary&#xD;
      outcomes. It will also assume a loss to follow up rate of 50%. This will require&#xD;
      approximately 200 total subjects with a planned 1:1 placebo to active treatment enrollment&#xD;
      ratio. The necessary enrollment can be accomplished in 11 months, allowing for 30 days of&#xD;
      follow up within the funding period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final goal of this project will be at least one paper in a top urology journal. This will&#xD;
      contribute to the literature by helping to inform urologists and anesthesiologists on the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of perioperative pregabalin for ureteroscopy with stent placement and&#xD;
      will provide data regarding opioid sparing management after ureteroscopy. Opioid related&#xD;
      issues abound nationwide and are evident in Missouri. This study has the potential to&#xD;
      influence opioid use both in this state and nationwide as it relates to this frequently&#xD;
      performed procedure.&#xD;
