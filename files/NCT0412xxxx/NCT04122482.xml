  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Available research on mental health accommodations within the workplace suggests that&#xD;
      employees with mental health concerns require accommodations (e.g., flexible scheduling,&#xD;
      quiet spaces), but only a fraction of employees will receive the accommodations they have&#xD;
      requested. Reported barriers to receiving mental health accommodations include concerns&#xD;
      regarding stigma, lack of knowledge about appropriate accommodations, financial constraints&#xD;
      of the employer, and size of the organization. While there is growing research on workplace&#xD;
      accommodations, there is a paucity of research available on interventions aimed at improving&#xD;
      accommodation usage, particularly within SMEs. To address this gap, the intent of the&#xD;
      proposed study is to develop and implement an online psychoeducation course to increase&#xD;
      employees' accommodation knowledge and usage within Canadian enterprises. Once the course is&#xD;
      developed, reviewed, and implemented, an additional aim of the proposed study will be to test&#xD;
      the efficacy of the course using a two-arm, randomized controlled trial comparing the&#xD;
      intervention to a wait-list control group. A total of 86 participants experiencing workplace&#xD;
      impairments due to a depressive and/or anxiety disorder will be randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      psychoeducation group or wait-list control group. A 2x3 repeated measures (i.e., pre-course,&#xD;
      at four weeks and eight weeks) mixed model ANOVA will be used to analyze the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on accommodation requests, knowledge of accommodations, absenteeism/presenteeism&#xD;
      rates, employee self-efficacy, and psychological symptoms. The results of the study may be&#xD;
      used to develop future offerings of the course and improve mental health accommodations&#xD;
      practices within Canadian enterprises.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the first phase of the study will be to develop the online psychoeducation&#xD;
      course. Once the course is developed it will be reviewed by experts in the field of&#xD;
      accommodations (e.g., Human Resource professionals, lawyers) and their suggestions will be&#xD;
      reviewed and possibly implemented before the course is delivered to employees. Experts&#xD;
      providing feedback will be asked to review and complete a consent form prior to reviewing one&#xD;
      or more lessons. After reviewing a lesson, they will be provided with an opportunity to give&#xD;
      lesson feedback through the completion of a short questionnaire. Total participation time is&#xD;
      expected to be 1 hour. Experts will be eligible for the study if they meet the following&#xD;
      criteria: (1) are 18 years of age or older; (2) have knowledge or experience with workplace&#xD;
      accommodations; and (3) are Canadian residents. Experts will be excluded if he/she: (1) is&#xD;
      not 18 years of age or older); (2) Do not have knowledge or experience with workplace&#xD;
      accommodations; (3) are not a resident of Canada&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course will be comprised of the following lessons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesson 1: Anxiety and depression in the workplace. This lesson will include information on&#xD;
      how to identify symptoms of depression and anxiety in the workplace. To accomplish this the&#xD;
      DSM-5 criteria for depression and anxiety will be provided along with practical work examples&#xD;
      (e.g., difficulty with concentration in meetings). Participants will also be presented with&#xD;
      examples of the functional limitations that are commonly associated with depression and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms (e.g., missing important deadlines due to procrastination behaviours).&#xD;
      Information on the prevalence of depression and anxiety in Canada/World will also be provided&#xD;
      to counteract any stigmatic attitudes or beliefs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesson 2: Accommodations for mental health concerns. Within this lesson, participants will be&#xD;
      presented with the Canadian legislation on reasonable workplace accommodations. This&#xD;
      information will include a discussion on undue hardship and how this may impact the receipt&#xD;
      and types of accommodations available within Canadian enterprises. Participants will also be&#xD;
      provided with common examples of accommodations frequently identified within the research&#xD;
      literature (e.g., flexible work schedules, quiet spaces). In addition, the benefits of&#xD;
      receiving accommodations for mental health concerns (e.g., improved productivity, reduced&#xD;
      symptomology) will be discussed. The lesson will conclude with the potential barriers (e.g.,&#xD;
      stigma, organizational barriers) and facilitators (e.g., supportive work environments) to&#xD;
      requesting and receiving accommodations. Strategies to overcome potential barriers will also&#xD;
      be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesson 3: Requesting an accommodation and disclosure. This lesson will focus on strategies&#xD;
      for requesting an accommodation within a Canadian enterprise. This will include information&#xD;
      on when, how, to whom, and what should be disclosed when requesting an accommodation.&#xD;
      Employees will also be provided with information on the pros and cons of making an&#xD;
      accommodation request. In addition, they will be provided with information on what to&#xD;
      disclose when making the request (i.e., full disclosure [&quot;I have depression] or selective&#xD;
      disclosure [&quot;I have an illness]), the pros and cons of disclosure, and information on the&#xD;
      tasks for preparing to disclose. It will also be emphasized within the lesson that full&#xD;
      disclosure may not be required to receive an acceptable accommodation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesson 4: Future management. The psychoeducational course will conclude with a lesson on&#xD;
      strategies for managing depression and anxiety symptoms within Canadian enterprises with or&#xD;
      without an accommodation. This will include information on managing symptoms within the work&#xD;
      environment such as, managing expectations, tackling avoidance strategies, progressive muscle&#xD;
      relaxation, and fostering workplace relationships/supports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of the proposed study will be to test the efficacy of the course using a two&#xD;
      arm, randomized controlled trial. The sample size of 43 participants per arm is based on a&#xD;
      power analysis for an ANOVA: repeated measures, between factors, with a medium effect size (f&#xD;
      = 0.25), an alpha of 0.05, correlation among repeated measure of 0.5, and power of 0.80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interested participants will be directed to the study website (www.onlinetherapyuser.ca),&#xD;
      where they will be presented with a consent form explaining the screening protocol (i.e.,&#xD;
      online screening consent). After consent is given, participants will be assessed for program&#xD;
      eligibility using an Internet-delivered screening questionnaire. The online screening&#xD;
      questionnaire captures demographic information (e.g., sex, ethnicity, location), contact&#xD;
      details (e.g., telephone number, email address), eligibility information (e.g., medical&#xD;
      history, mental health history, symptom measurements), and information on workplace&#xD;
      functioning (e.g., self-reported absenteeism, presenteeism, disclosure questions,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, self-stigma, workers' relation scale, workplace inclusion). This data will be&#xD;
      made available to participants in an online survey created and hosted by REDcap (Research&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture) software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants have been assessed for program eligibility using the online screening tool,&#xD;
      they will asked to schedule a telephone interview. During the telephone interview, the&#xD;
      primary investigator will ask a series of follow-up questions (i.e., Telephone Interview&#xD;
      Guide) to the online screening questionnaire to ensure program eligibility as per exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Participants who meet any of the exclusion criteria during the online screening&#xD;
      phase will be provided with an explanation for their ineligibility and encouraged to contact&#xD;
      the researcher via email if they have any questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are appropriate for the study will be assigned to their randomized group&#xD;
      (i.e., Psycho-education course or wait-list control group). At this point, participants&#xD;
      assigned to the psycho-education group will be provided user-names and temporary password&#xD;
      words by phone to access the course. Participants assigned to the wait-list group will be&#xD;
      provided with their user name and password 8 weeks following the telephone screening date.&#xD;
      Before beginning the course, all participants will be presented with a course consent form&#xD;
      that will explain the nature of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lessons will take approximately 30 to 45 minutes for participants to review. Once&#xD;
      participants have completed a lesson, they will be granted access to the next lesson the&#xD;
      following day, which will allow them to complete multiple lessons within any given week. To&#xD;
      minimize time pressures, participants will be instructed that follow-up measures (i.e., same&#xD;
      measures included in the screening questionnaire minus the AUDIT/DUDIT and clinical history)&#xD;
      will be available four weeks and eight weeks after they have been provided access to the&#xD;
      course. Should negative effects be observed (e.g. self-reported symptoms increase,&#xD;
      absenteeism/presenteeism numbers significantly rise) at any point, participants will be&#xD;
      reminded of the resources (e.g., family doctor, mental health websites, mental health&#xD;
      agencies) available to them. These resources will be documented and posted on the website for&#xD;
      easy reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a wait-list control group will provide a comparison group to determine the effects&#xD;
      of the psychoeducation course. It will also circumvent any ethical concerns with failing to&#xD;
      provide a potentially helpful intervention. Participants assigned to the wait-list group will&#xD;
      be assigned a start date eight weeks after the pre-screen interview and sent an automatic&#xD;
      reminder email a few days prior to their start date. The wait-list group will also be sent a&#xD;
      link through email to complete measures (i.e., PHQ-9, Accommodation/Disclosure questions, WHO&#xD;
      HPQ) four-weeks after the telephone screen for comparison purposes and to maintain engagement&#xD;
      in the study. No further contact will be provided during the eight-week wait-list period.&#xD;
      Following completion of the wait-list period, the participants will be provided their user&#xD;
      name and password so they may access the psycho-education course and measures will be&#xD;
      requested again at 4-weeks and 8-weeks post course access.&#xD;
