  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) including anti-CCP2 antibodies are&#xD;
      known to promote inflammation and joint destruction in patients suffering from ACPA-positive&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, there are currently no therapies available to efficiently eliminate&#xD;
      autoantibody production and to re-induce immune tolerance in these patients. However, both a&#xD;
      B cell-targeting therapy (Rituximab) and a T cell targeting therapy (Abatacept) were&#xD;
      described to lower anti-CCP2 antibody levels and occasionally trigger disappearance of these&#xD;
      autoantibodies (sero conversion). By sequentially combining Rituximab and Abatacept, we thus&#xD;
      aim to enhance the tolerogenic potential of these drugs and seek to eliminate autoantibody&#xD;
      production and significantly lower ACPA titers. This would for the first time correspond to a&#xD;
      &quot;deep&quot; immunological remission and a re-induction of immune tolerance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on fact that both a B cell-targeting therapy with Rituximab and a T cell-targeting&#xD;
      therapy with Abatacept affect ACPA levels and can occasionally induce seroconversion and an&#xD;
      immunological remission as well immune tolerance in ACPA-positive RA patients, we conclude&#xD;
      that T/B cell-mediated autoimmunity can be in principle reversed in RA patients suffering&#xD;
      from active disease. We hypothesize that we can increase the tolerance-inducing potency of&#xD;
      Rituximab and Abatacept by combining these two approaches and delivering a sequential B&#xD;
      cell/T cell therapy with Rituximab and Abatacept. Such a combined approach might increase the&#xD;
      rate of seroconversions in RA patients and thus re-induce tolerance in a significant number&#xD;
      of patients which would pave the way for a long-lasting &quot;deep immunological&quot; and drug-free&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed project, we thus plan to perform a sequential treatment with initial B cell&#xD;
      depletion with Rituximab followed by blockade of the immunological synapse by Abatacept. Such&#xD;
      an approach aims to deplete autoreactive B cells and plasmablasts, which constitute the major&#xD;
      source for ACPA (3) and thus reboot part of the immune system, before blocking the&#xD;
      immunological synapse in order to enable reconstitution of self-tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on their recently discovered pathogenic properties and to determine a potential&#xD;
      immunological remission in the participating RA patients, we primarily plan to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of a sequential Rituximab/Abatacept treatment on changes in the levels of anti CCP2&#xD;
      antibodies between Baseline and Week 52 and will determine the rate of seroconversions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary, we plan to perform an additional quantitative and qualitative analysis of the ACPA&#xD;
      response. Glycosylation of ACPA was shown to modulate their inflammatory activity and is thus&#xD;
      considered to control the onset of arthritis in ACPA-positive individuals (9). We will&#xD;
      therefore measure glycosylation (galactosylation, fucosylation and sialylation) of ACPA and&#xD;
      total IgG. Moreover, we plan to determine changes in total IgG, IgA and IgM subclasses,&#xD;
      numbers of total B cells and plasmablasts as well as of CCP2-specific B cells and&#xD;
      plasmablasts in the peripheral blood of the participating patients. The clinical outcome will&#xD;
      be measured at week 52 described by disease activity parameters and patient questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal setup of this proof of concept mode of action study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of a subsequent Abatacept therapy post B cell depletion in regard to ACPA&#xD;
      seroconversion, ACPA titers and B cell phenotype changes.&#xD;
