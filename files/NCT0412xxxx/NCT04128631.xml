      Background and Rational&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Introduction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) have favorable prognosis. Overall 10-year survival is&#xD;
      93% for papillary carcinoma, and 85% for follicular carcinoma(1). After total thyroidectomy&#xD;
      followed by radioiodine remnant ablation, DTC patients are screened for recurrence by&#xD;
      measuring the levels of both Tg and TgAb and I-131 whole body scan (WBS) in the follow-up (2)&#xD;
      It is reported that elevated TgAb may indicate the recurrent and/or metastatic disease and&#xD;
      can be used as an alternative of the tumor marker for DTC . The I-131 WBS has high&#xD;
      specificity to detect recurrence (50 to 60% in papillary thyroid carcinoma and 64 to 67% in&#xD;
      follicular thyroid carcinoma) (3,4). The I-131WBS showed negative finding in 10 to 15% of&#xD;
      patients with detectable serum Tg levels(5). Two factors may account for discrepancy between&#xD;
      serum Tg and I-131 WBS . First, the tumor size might be too small to be detected by WBS.&#xD;
      Second, the tumor cell may lose the ability to trap radioiodine while still able to secret&#xD;
      Tg(6,7). It becomes necessary to investigate with other modalities to identify possible&#xD;
      residual disease to initiate the appropriate treatment. (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro- D-glucose integrated with&#xD;
      computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) has emerged as a powerful imaging tool for the detection&#xD;
      of various cancers. (9)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined acquisition of PET and CT has synergistic advantages over PET or CT alone and&#xD;
      minimizes their individual limitations. (10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a valuable tool for staging and re staging of some tumors and has an important role in&#xD;
      the detection of recurrence in asymptomatic patients with rising tumor marker levels and&#xD;
      patients with negative or equivocal findings on conventional imaging techniques.(11)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of (PET/CT) in patients with&#xD;
      suspected thyroid cancer recurrence or metastasis , with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)&#xD;
      patients who show elevated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) or antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb)&#xD;
      level with negative radioiodine whole body scan (I-WBS).&#xD;

      Design and Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a prospective study for the group of patients who will do F-18FDG PET/CT scan after&#xD;
      negative whole body scan with elevated serum thyroglobulin Antibody or Thyroglobulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study investigations:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients at this study should have histopathological evidence of DTC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serum TSH level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serum TG &amp; antiTG antibodies levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  radioactiveiodine whole body scan (I-WBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neck ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood glucose level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioisotopes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine-131 (I-131) is an important radioisotope of iodine as a major product of Uranium&#xD;
      fission. It is a β-emitting radionuclide with a maximum energy of 606 keV and an average&#xD;
      energy of 191 keV. Average range of β-particles in tissue is 0.8 mm and has a principal γ-ray&#xD;
      of 364 keV. It has a radioactive decay half-life of about eight days. Only&#xD;
      well-differentiated thyroid cancer cells concentrate radioiodine to a significant degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F-18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) is a positron emitting radiotracer that is transported&#xD;
      intracellularly and phosphorylated by hexokinase to FDG-6-PO4 through the same cellular&#xD;
      membrane transport pathways as glucose. Unlike glucose, however, FDG-6-PO4 is subsequently&#xD;
      trapped intracellularly due to lack of further metabolism from insufficient amounts of&#xD;
      glucose phosphatase. After intravenous administration, this substrate accumulates in tumors&#xD;
      during the uptake phase, and whole body imaging can then be performed to identify regions of&#xD;
      high glycolytic activity. and can be used to characterize and localize many types of tumors&#xD;
      as well as determining stage and sites of recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients fasted for at least 6 hours before F-18FDG PET/CT imaging with the exception of&#xD;
           water intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The blood glucose level was measured before tracer injection. The blood glucose levels&#xD;
           of all patients should be less than 150 mg/dL .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An intravenous catheter was placed for radiopharmaceutical administration,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After tracer injection, the patients rested on a comfortable chair during the 18F-FDG&#xD;
           uptake period&#xD;
&#xD;
      F-18FDG PET/CT Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT was initiated (45-60) min after injection of the F-18-FDG, Each patient received&#xD;
      400-610 MBq (11-16.5 mCi) of 18F-FDG intravenously. CT was performed before acquisition of&#xD;
      the PET data in a single step with the patients supine. First, a scout scan was obtained to&#xD;
      determine the axial range of the study. The scanning parameters for whole-body CT&#xD;
      craniocaudal scanning are 130 kV, 80-120 mAs, 5-mm collimation, and a pitch of 1.6. During&#xD;
      the scan, patients have to maintain shallow respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subsequent 3-dimensional PET data acquisition included 4-6 bed positions, (4 min per bed&#xD;
      position) over the same axial extent. The PET acquisition included a dead time correction and&#xD;
      online delayed coincidence subtraction to correct for random coincidences. Rescaled CT images&#xD;
      were used to produce attenuation correction values for the PET emission reconstruction.&#xD;
