      INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE The increased incidence of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistant 'superbugs' has amplified the use of broad spectrum antibiotics&#xD;
      worldwide. An unintended consequence of antimicrobial treatment is disruption of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal microbiota, resulting in susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens, such as&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile (C. difficile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. difficile is a gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium that causes hospital and&#xD;
      community-acquired enteric infections resulting in C. difficile-associated diarrhea, pseudo&#xD;
      membranous colitis, colitis and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) remains the predominant cause of health care&#xD;
      -associated infectious diarrhea, centered mainly in hospitals but also in the community at a&#xD;
      rate of ~100/100,000 population and affecting the elderly disproportionately. Antimicrobial&#xD;
      damage to the intestinal microbiome combined with the acquisition of spores of C. difficile&#xD;
      is the main cause of pathogenesis. CDI is endemic in hospitals, and although infection&#xD;
      control measures have reduced nosocomial rates of CDI in Canada over the past 5 years,&#xD;
      community cases now appear to be more apparent .Treatment of CDI utilizes alternate&#xD;
      antimicrobials directed at the pathogen, mainly metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin&#xD;
      given for a recommended 10-14 days. While the majority respond to antibiotic treatment,&#xD;
      subsequent recurrences of CDI are observed in 25-40% of patients. Recurrences of CDI are&#xD;
      retreated with the same antibiotics and due to the non-selective spectrum of activity of&#xD;
      metronidazole and vancomycin, recurrences are increasing in probabilities for subsequent&#xD;
      recurrences. Fidaxomicin is relatively more selective and its use is associated with reduced&#xD;
      recurrences, but the high cost of fidaxomicin has restricted the usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. difficile infection is a serious diarrheal illness associated with substantial morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality and is responsible for hospital and community-acquired diarrhea, pseudo&#xD;
      membranous colitis colitis and death..&#xD;
&#xD;
      ImmuniMed Inc. has developed an oral Immunotherapy using egg-derived anti- C. difficile&#xD;
      polyclonal antibodies (IM-01), that directly targets the virulence factors of C. difficile.&#xD;
      IM-01 is produced from chicken eggs following the immunization of laying hens with C.&#xD;
      difficile virulent antigens, C. difficile toxin A, toxin B, C. difficile whole cells and C.&#xD;
      difficile spores. IM-01 is in the form of spray-dried whole egg powder (yolk plus egg white&#xD;
      containing ovalbumin) and is very stable for functional activity. Upon reconstitution, IM-01&#xD;
      is administered orally, which allows it to reach to the intestinal lumen, where C. difficile&#xD;
      toxins exert their toxic effects. In addition, IM-01 antibodies bind to C. difficile toxins&#xD;
      and spores and neutralize their biological activities in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of polyclonal antibodies derived from chicken eggs (IgY) to confer passive immunity&#xD;
      has gained attention as a novel strategy for oral immunotherapy as an alternative to&#xD;
      antibiotics for treatment of intestinal pathogens which cause diarrhea in animals and humans&#xD;
      including, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Salmonella spp, and both bovine and human rotaviruses.&#xD;
      Compared with mammalian antibodies (IgG), chicken egg-derived antibodies (IgY) have high&#xD;
      antigen-specificity and avidity, react more rapidly to the same antigens and differ from&#xD;
      mammalian antibodies (IgG) in both structural and immunological properties.. Compared to IgG,&#xD;
      IgY is more stable in gut at pH 3.5 -11 and better tolerates enzymatic degradation by trypsin&#xD;
      and chymotrypsin; the stability of IgY against pepsin is pH-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunimed has determined that IgY polyclonal antibodies-specific to E. coli in egg powder&#xD;
      containing albumin, are functionally stable when stored at 2-8°C for over 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This makes IM-01 antibodies attractive for oral immunotherapy since eggs are normal dietary&#xD;
      components, with no known toxic side effects. The IM-01 antibodies are shown to bind with C.&#xD;
      difficile toxins and spores as well as to neutralize their biological activities in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with active vaccination, passive immunotherapy using IM-01 egg-derived polyclonal&#xD;
      anti-C. difficile antibodies has advantages including: (i) rapid and local onset of action,&#xD;
      (ii) highly specific activity, (iii) applicability to a broader range of patients from&#xD;
      children to adults including immunocompromised patients, (iv) strategically can be applied&#xD;
      for a specific event when it occurs, in contrast to a vaccination model where large&#xD;
      populations need to be treated in advance and sustain active antibodies for long-durations,&#xD;
      and (v) is a normal part of human diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a published literature, hamsters treated orally with C. difficile anti-toxin A and&#xD;
      anti-toxin B neutralizing egg-derived polyclonal antibodies were protected following C.&#xD;
      difficile challenge. Also, hamsters treated with egg-derived antibodies did not develop&#xD;
      relapsing disease months after the treatment with antibodies. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, egg-derived polyclonal antibodies have several advantages over the monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies (MAbs), since MAbs are generally specific for single epitope, when polyclonal&#xD;
      antibodies - a new class of biopharmaceuticals, that have higher affinities for multiple&#xD;
      target antigens and can recognize multiple epitopes resulting in superior potency; since they&#xD;
      can recognize multiple toxin epitopes as it is relevant to polymorphism of the toxin A and&#xD;
      toxin B genes in C. difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A piglet study was performed to demonstrate the safety and therapeutic effect of egg-derived&#xD;
      polyclonal antibodies -specific to E. coli K-88, in farm animals. It has been established&#xD;
      that E. coli K88 that cause diarrhea in piglets by colonizing in the lower GI tract of&#xD;
      piglets improve their growth performance following treatment with E. coli K-88-specific&#xD;
      antibodies orally.Furthermore, the highest body weight gain was achieved in pigs which were&#xD;
      fed with the highest dosage of E. coli K-88 antibodies (4kg/1000 kg of nursery diet) compared&#xD;
      to the lowest antibody dosage (1kg /1000 kg of nursery diet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was concluded that feeding of piglets with egg-derived polyclonal antibodies-specific to&#xD;
      E. coli K-88 results in significantly improved growth performance in an antibody&#xD;
      dose-dependent manner. The manufacturing process for egg-derived polyclonal antibodies&#xD;
      targeted to enterotoxigenic E. coli has been approved and validated by the Canadian Center&#xD;
      for Veterinary Biologics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion oral Immunotherapy using polyclonal antibodies is considered to have a high&#xD;
      safety profile with a low likelihood of adverse effects. If proven to be effective as an&#xD;
      anti-infective approach, antibiotic selection pressure could be reduced, a key strategy to&#xD;
      limit antibiotic resistance in C. difficile infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IM-01 is spray-dried egg powder product containing polyclonal antibodies -specific to C.&#xD;
      difficile toxins A and toxin B, plus antibodies to C, difficile spores. A 20g/day dosage of&#xD;
      IM-01 was selected based on a pre-clinical animal study data, using piglets to treat with C.&#xD;
      difficile enteritis.disease with 0.6g of IM-01 orally daily for 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under compassionate grounds, patients with confirmed CDI clinical diagnosis with unformed&#xD;
      diarrheal stools, abdominal cramps and a positive stool test for the presence of toxins&#xD;
      and/or C. difficile in culture, 106 patients (ages: 11-93 years) were enrolled for the&#xD;
      clinical study. All patients signed informed consent forms to participate in the study. The&#xD;
      amount of IM-01 antibody powder product (10g or 20g) orally administered daily by each&#xD;
      patient with 150 mL of milk and followed for up to 6-week period following IM-01&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Seventy six patients received an oral dose of 20 g of IM-01 and 30 patients&#xD;
      received 10 g of IM-01 powder daily for 10 consecutive days, as drinkable therapy with milk&#xD;
      or chocolate milk. The primary endpoint of the study was to eradicate C. difficile in stool&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 106 patients treated with IM-01 therapy,101 patients showed significant improvement of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms with negative stool test results for CDI.Five patients showed reduced&#xD;
      clinical symptoms during IM-01 treatment period. No recurrence was observed with IM-01&#xD;
      therapy during the follow up period. No safety concerns were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care (SOC) antibiotics for the treatment of CDI have observed responses to&#xD;
      treatment i.e. resolution of diarrhea and ancillary symptoms/signs in 72-88% of subjects, and&#xD;
      for those subjects who do achieve resolution of CDI, ~16-24% experience a recurrence of CDI&#xD;
      within an 8 week follow up. Non-responders are treated with higher dosages of vancomycin. day&#xD;
      interval. A post-treatment minimal follow up period of 30 days has been used in recent RCTs&#xD;
      of antimicrobials. Other trials have used several time points i.e 8 weeks or 12 weeks post&#xD;
      -treatment. Therefore, in absence of a standard of care control arm, the foregoing response&#xD;
      rates for resolution of CDI symptoms (~80%), and a recurrence rate of 20% will be used for as&#xD;
      a response template for this study. In the absence of randomization of subjects to an&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment control group,&#xD;
