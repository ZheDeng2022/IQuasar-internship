  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A convenient sample of internal medicine residents will be observed during their nightshift&#xD;
      work in the wards of the department of internal medicine of a university hospital. The&#xD;
      epidemiology of night calls and emergencies, including incidence, causes, management, and&#xD;
      prognosis, will be assessed prospectively. The impact of nightshift work on sleep, stress,&#xD;
      quality of life, regrets, and general well being of the residents observed will be measured&#xD;
      through completion of validated questionnaires. Quality of handoff sessions will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various medical problems of patients admitted to an internal medicine ward can worsen during&#xD;
      the stay. Furthermore, new, unidentified problems can develop (complications, medication&#xD;
      errors, delirium, acute anxiety or pain, etc). During evenings, nights and week-ends,&#xD;
      emergent needs of hospitalized patients are usually cared for by physicians in-training, who&#xD;
      are in charge of a large number of patients. Hence, physicians should have a wide range of&#xD;
      medical knowledge and procedural skills and know how acute problems are dealt with in the&#xD;
      unique environment of the healthcare institution. Training physicians should also be able to&#xD;
      obtain information and counseling efficiently, either from clinical guidelines, senior&#xD;
      supervisors, or specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These requirements may represent a significant stress for training physicians and may have a&#xD;
      major impact on their health, quality of life, and finally on the quality of inpatient care.&#xD;
      Nightshift work may lead later to a high burden of regrets among caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better knowledge of training needs, organization features, coping strategies, and regrets&#xD;
      associated with nightshift duty are important to prepare training physicians to that&#xD;
      demanding and necessary task. Understanding of the epidemiology of night-shift ward&#xD;
      emergencies could provide guidance concerning the required level of staffing and training of&#xD;
      the responding medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, efficient transmission of information between day and night staff (so-called&#xD;
      handoffs) is a difficult yet important part of care. Systematic observation of handoff&#xD;
      sessions between physicians before and after nightshifts may enhance previous knowledge on&#xD;
      key components of these topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the incidence causes, and prognosis of night-shift&#xD;
      emergencies in internal medicine wards by direct observation of the nightshift work of a&#xD;
      convenient sample of internal medicine residents. By the means of before-and-after shift&#xD;
      completion of various validated questionnaires, the investigators will explore quantitatively&#xD;
      and qualitatively the physiological and psychological impact on nightshift work for&#xD;
      physicians in training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned study will also provide qualitative and quantitative data concerning handoffs&#xD;
      session, and the repercussions on night shift emergencies management.&#xD;
