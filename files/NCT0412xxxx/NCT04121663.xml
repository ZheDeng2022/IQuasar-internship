      This clinical trial compares the clinical effects of rotator cuff injury and/or shoulder&#xD;
      instability surgery with the full suture anchor made by Hangzhou Ruijian Mastine Medical&#xD;
      Equipment Co., Ltd. and the polyether ether ketone bone anchor system made by Arthrex, Inc.,&#xD;
      USA, and evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the experimental device in clinical&#xD;
      application&#xD;
