  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Resin composites are effective in restoring damaged teeth due to their good&#xD;
      esthetics, high surface gloss, and clinically acceptable wear resistance1. One of the most&#xD;
      challenging tasks a dentist has to confront in daily practice is matching the color of&#xD;
      composite restorations used in anterior teeth2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem The shade selection is carried out subjectively with a visual shade guide and&#xD;
      generally under inadequate light conditions, which can lead to errors in color perception3.&#xD;
      The presence of discrepancies between the classic shade guides and the actual shade of&#xD;
      composite makes that task more difficult.4. Not only that, but there was also mismatch&#xD;
      between composite shades and the proprietary shade guides included with the composite kits 5.&#xD;
      A mock-up should be performed as a trial to assist in shade selection and ensure the&#xD;
      predictability of the esthetic result in restorative treatment6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Shade matching has been a time consuming procedure. Recommendations were made to&#xD;
      make customized shade guides of the used composite material for more predictable results7.&#xD;
      Manufacturers have been aiming at providing materials with a blending effect; taking on the&#xD;
      color appearance from surrounding tooth structure 8. Introduction of Omnichroma by Tokuyama&#xD;
      is aiming at eliminating the shade taking procedure by providing a single shade universal&#xD;
      composite that is designed to blend with the surrounding tooth structure without the need for&#xD;
      a shade matching procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this study is to evaluate the shade matching ability of a new single shade&#xD;
      composite (Omnichroma; Tokuyama) compared to a conventional multiple shade microhybrid&#xD;
      composite in the restoration of class V restorations using USPHS criteria&#xD;

      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In class V restorations will there be a difference in shade matching between Omnichroma (one&#xD;
      shade) universal composite and a microhybrid (multiple shade) universal composite?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shade selection is carried out subjectively with a visual shade guide and generally under&#xD;
      inadequate light conditions, which can lead to errors in color perception. The presence of&#xD;
      discrepancies between the classic shade guides and the actual shade of composite makes that&#xD;
      task more difficult. Not only that, but there was also mismatch between composite shades and&#xD;
      the proprietary shade guides included with the composite kits. A mock-up should be performed&#xD;
      as a trial to assist in shade selection and ensure the predictability of the esthetic result&#xD;
      in restorative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for conducting the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shade matching has been a time-consuming procedure. Recommendations were made to make&#xD;
      customized shade guides of the used composite material for more predictable results.&#xD;
      Manufacturers have been aiming at providing materials with a blending effect; taking on the&#xD;
      color appearance from surrounding tooth structure. Introduction of Omnichroma by (Tokuyama&#xD;
      Dental, Tokyo, Japan) is aiming at eliminating the shade taking procedure by providing a&#xD;
      single shade universal composite that is designed to blend with the surrounding tooth&#xD;
      structure without the need for a shade matching procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2004, Nahri compared the clinical efficacy of Z250 (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA) with Z100&#xD;
      (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA) in class III and class V restorations. A total of 148 restorations&#xD;
      were placed by different dentists. The study used modified USPHS criteria to evaluate the&#xD;
      restorations at baseline and for one year. Color match, along with marginal adaptation,&#xD;
      discoloration, and anatomic form were evaluated using specified criteria. Baseline evaluation&#xD;
      was done after one week from restoration placement. At baseline, 70% of the Z250 restorations&#xD;
      were rated as Alpha regarding color-match compared to 62% of the Z100 restorations. It was&#xD;
      concluded that there was no significant difference between the two materials and that both&#xD;
      can be used in class V restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Sakrana compared between the clinical performance of Palfique Estelite,( Tokuyama&#xD;
      Corp., Tokyo, Japan) resin composite and Palfique Toughwell (Tokuyama Corp., Tokyo, Japan)&#xD;
      Resin Composite in anterior class V restorations. Both are minifilled composites with&#xD;
      Palfique Estelite indicated for anterior restorations and Palfique Toughwell indicated for&#xD;
      both anterior and posterior ones. Seventy eight class V cavities were restored using Palfique&#xD;
      Estellite and eighty two were restored with Palfique Toughwell. Both groups were examined&#xD;
      immediately after polishing (baseline), after 6 months, and after 1 year. Both showed 100%&#xD;
      color match of rating Alpha (USPHS criteria) at baseline. At 6 months, 100 % of Palfique&#xD;
      Estelite restorations were still rated as Alpha, while only 90% of the Palfique Toughwell&#xD;
      restorations were still rated as Alpha. It was shown that Palfique Toughwell had more color&#xD;
      change after one year. Only 70% were rated as Alpha regarding color match after one year.&#xD;
      However, the difference was not significant and both materials prove to be reliable in class&#xD;
      V restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study by Paravina found color differences between same shades of 2 microhybrid&#xD;
      composite when placed in specimens of different surrounding color or different size. They&#xD;
      used specimens of 2 composite shades placed circumferentially. The outer ring was using the&#xD;
      darker composite and the inner was the lighter. Palfique Estellite (Tokuyama, Tokyo, Japan)&#xD;
      composite of shade C2 was used as the darker outer composite. Lighter shades (A2 and B2) of&#xD;
      Palfique Estellite and Esthet-X (Dentsply/Caulk, Milford, DE) were used in the inner part.&#xD;
      Multiple diameters (2,4,6) of the inner part were used. In addition to that, single composite&#xD;
      specimens were prepared from the same shades for comparison. It was found that the same&#xD;
      shades of composite appeared differently when placed in different diameters. Also, when there&#xD;
      was less color difference between inner and outer disks, more color match is achieved. This&#xD;
      led to a conclusion that composites can have a blending effect. This blending effect&#xD;
      increased with decreased restoration size, decreased color difference, and translucency of&#xD;
      the used composite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mourouzis compared the blending effect of three commercially available composites in vitro,&#xD;
      microhybrid GC Gradia Direct Anterior (GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), microfilled Clearfil&#xD;
      Majesty Esthetic (Kuraray Medical Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and nanofilled IPS Empress Direct&#xD;
      (Ivoclar Vivadent, Shaan, Liechtenstein). The study was conducted on extracted teeth. Shade&#xD;
      was taken for the teeth using a spectrophotometer. The teeth were sectioned vertically and&#xD;
      restored using the three composite materials of the designated shade. The restorations were&#xD;
      made using a prefabricated mold. The shade was taken afterwards and compared to that of&#xD;
      intact teeth. Results were that all composite restorations had color differences with intact&#xD;
      teeth. However, this difference was not visible by human eye and it was concluded that a&#xD;
      color difference of ΔΕ&lt;3.3 was considered clinically acceptable It was stated that the&#xD;
      properties of the composite material have a drastic effect over esthetics. The Ivoclar group&#xD;
      demonstrated the most color difference among the 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      McLaren et al introduced a technique using calibrated photography and photoshop for shade&#xD;
      analysis. Digital photographs were taken in Raw format using polarizing filters and a gray&#xD;
      card. The cross-polarizing filter is used for eliminating glare. The gray card is used to&#xD;
      calibrate exposure in Adobe Camera Raw (which comes in adjunction with Adobe Photoshop to&#xD;
      compensate for exposure differences between different camera-models. The authors provided&#xD;
      recommended camera settings for standardization of images. L, A, and B values were calculated&#xD;
      using digital color meter in photoshop and compared to those of shade tabs for shade&#xD;
      selection. The authors claimed this technique to be effective, useful, and accurate in shade&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019, Paravina et al compared between color adjusting potential of 5 commercially&#xD;
      available universal composites namely Omnichroma (Tokuyama Dental, Tokyo, Japan), Filtek&#xD;
      Supreme Ultra (3M, Saint Paul, MN), TPH Spectra (Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE), Herculite&#xD;
      Ultra (Kerr Corporation, Orange, CA), and Tetric Evoceram (Ivoclar Vivadent, Amherst, NY) in&#xD;
      vitro. Single and dual specimens were prepared. Single specimens were composed of the&#xD;
      composite material alone and were compared to denture teeth. Dual specimens were composed of&#xD;
      the restorative material placed in cavities prepared in acrylic teeth of different shades.&#xD;
      Comparisons were made between denture teeth and single specimens and dual specimens.&#xD;
      Comparisons were made visually and instrumentally. There was large color difference between&#xD;
      single specimens and Denture teeth. However, dual specimens showed more color match. This was&#xD;
      most pronounced in Omnichroma. It was concluded that Omnichroma had the most color adjusting&#xD;
      potential. This means that it had a great color difference between single specimens and&#xD;
      denture teeth. It also had the greatest color match in dual specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6b. Explanation for choice of comparators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro-hybrid composite was chosen as a comparator because it's considered a universal&#xD;
      composite to be used in anterior and posterior restorations. It has high filler content along&#xD;
      with good surface polish and color stability. Also according to a recent study, micro-hybrid&#xD;
      composite showed excellent color match and color stability compared to nano-filled composite&#xD;
      in five-years follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending at the Conservative and Esthetic Dentistry Department Clinic will be&#xD;
      screened. Those who meet the study inclusion criteria will be recruited. They will be&#xD;
      informed with the study and an informed consent will be signed if they approve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Periodontal treatment will be made and oral hygiene instructions will be enforced.&#xD;
      Shade taking procedure will be done visually using customized composite shade tabs for more&#xD;
      accuracy. Shade will be confirmed using cross-polarized photography and image analysis using&#xD;
      a digital color meter (Adobe Photoshop).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the shade is confirmed, the operator will start rubber-dam isolation and cavity&#xD;
      preparation using a round bur. Remaining caries will be excavated by a sharp excavator. A 1mm&#xD;
      bevel will be prepared in enamel margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective enamel etching will be done and a universal adhesive will be applied to both enamel&#xD;
      and dentin. After solvent evaporation, the bonding agent will be cured for 20 seconds. The&#xD;
      operator will be blinded to the material to be used till the placement of the restoration to&#xD;
      avoid bias. According to the concealed envelope, the tooth will be assigned to one of both&#xD;
      treatment groups. Composite will be placed incrementally and light cured for 20 seconds using&#xD;
      3M Elipar DeepCure-S LED Curing Light (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post curing will be done using Glycerin to decrease the oxygen inhibited layer. Finishing&#xD;
      will be done using yellow and white finishing stones Intensiv (Intensiv SA, Montagnola,&#xD;
      Switzerland). More finishing and polishing will be done using (Enhance and Pogo (Dentsply&#xD;
      Sirona). Rubber-dam will be removed and patients will be recalled for baseline evaluation&#xD;
      after one week to allow for rehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessor will be blinded to both treatment groups. She will give the restorations a score&#xD;
      using Modified USPHS score. Calibrated photographs will be taken using cross polarizing&#xD;
      filters and a gray card for image analysis using Photoshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recall appointments will be after 3 months and 6 months. Same evaluation will be made to&#xD;
      assess color stability.&#xD;
