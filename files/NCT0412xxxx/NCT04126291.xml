      Tools are limited to help health care professionals talk about weight-related issues with&#xD;
      their pediatric patients. The investigators have developed 6 whiteboard videos for health&#xD;
      care professionals based on the 5As of Pediatric Obesity Management to address weight-related&#xD;
      issues with pediatric patients and their families. This study aims to evaluate the videos&#xD;
      using pre and post questionnaires. With the questionnaires, the investigators want to&#xD;
      evaluate the content, quality (acceptability, engagement) and impact of patient-oriented&#xD;
      educational videos on HCPs' self-efficacy/confidence and knowledge in regards to addressing&#xD;
      weight-related issues with pediatric patients and their families using the 5A framework.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one third of Canadian children and adolescents can be classified as having&#xD;
      overweight or obesity. Health-care professionals (HCP), particularly primary care physicians,&#xD;
      play a critical role in helping to address weight-related issues with patients and their&#xD;
      families. A primary care-based obesity treatment model may be a practical means of treating&#xD;
      obesity and helping to prevent Type 2 Diabetes and other co-morbidities. At the same time,&#xD;
      obesity is not currently being addressed or managed in a consistent way across primary care&#xD;
      settings, representing a significant gap in care. Furthermore, the extant literature&#xD;
      indicates that HCPs feel ill-equipped to address obesity prevention and management, during&#xD;
      childhood in particular. A lack of self-efficacy and training are recognized as two&#xD;
      significant barriers to discussing weight with patients and their families. Other challenges&#xD;
      for HCPs include the fear of damaging their relationship with patients and their families and&#xD;
      the apprehension of triggering other issues such as eating disorders. For these reasons,&#xD;
      effective educational materials are required for HCPs to promote healthy and helpful&#xD;
      conversations about weight and risk of comorbidities. Research has shown that educational&#xD;
      videos are an effective and engaging means to improve knowledge, confidence, and attitudes in&#xD;
      HCPs and trainees. The investigators use The 5As of Pediatric Obesity Management as a&#xD;
      framework for the creation of these educational videos. Preliminary evidence indicates that&#xD;
      implementation of the 5As of Adult Obesity Management can increase communication amongst&#xD;
      providers and patients in weight management. In 2013, experts from The Children's Hospital of&#xD;
      Eastern Ontario (CHEO) partnered with CON to adapt this framework for use in a pediatric&#xD;
      setting. It was designed as a step by step approach for busy primary care physicians who see&#xD;
      childhood obesity in their practice. The Pediatric 5As presently exists as a downloadable&#xD;
      booklet on the CON website. Although this resource is a helpful tool for HCPs, feedback from&#xD;
      focus groups indicate that HCPs would like an expanded version with practical visuals of how&#xD;
      a 5As framed encounter would occur in a busy office setting. The investigators have developed&#xD;
      6 videos to evaluate: Video #1: Weight Science 101, will present background information,&#xD;
      including information on the factors driving body weight regulation. Video #2: A Word about&#xD;
      BMI, will present background information on the advantages and disadvantages of using BMI.&#xD;
      Video #3 ASK, reviews how to approach discussions about obesity with pediatric patients and&#xD;
      their caregivers. Video #4: ASSESS, will review how to comprehensively assess children and&#xD;
      youth with obesity. Video #5: ADVISE, AGREE, and ASSIST, will discuss the interventions for&#xD;
      pediatric obesity management in the primary care setting, how to ensure patient engagement in&#xD;
      the process, and how to sustain therapy. Our last video, Video #6: Putting it All Together,&#xD;
      will summarize each of the 5As and how to use them as a comprehensive tool for pediatric&#xD;
      obesity management.This study aims to evaluate the videos using pre and post questionnaires.&#xD;
      With the questionnaires, the investigators want to evaluate the content, quality&#xD;
      (acceptability, engagement) and impact of patient-oriented educational videos on HCPs'&#xD;
      self-efficacy/confidence, knowledge, and change in practice in regards to addressing&#xD;
      weight-related issues with pediatric patients and their families using the 5A framework.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The recruited group of health care professionals (HCPs) will answer a pre-questionnaire to collect demographic and practice data and ratings of perceived self-efficacy/confidence and knowledge in talking about weight-related issues. This pre-questionnaire only needs to be completed once. Participants will then be asked to watch each video. Immediately after watching each video, the participants will re-rate their perceived self-efficacy/confidence and knowledge to help elucidate outstanding educational gaps. For participants who consent to do a follow up questionnaire four-six months later, investigators will send an email link for HCPs to complete a satisfaction questionnaire and re-rate their perceived self-efficacy and knowledge to help elucidate outstanding educational gaps.</intervention_model_description>
