  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the progression of population aging, the number of elderly patients undergoing surgery&#xD;
      is increasing as well. However, as the condition of health differs greatly between individual&#xD;
      elderly patients even of the same age, it is a necessity to evaluate elderly patients&#xD;
      thoroughly and individually for better management of perioperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty is a condition in which patients are impaired at physical reserve and homeostatic&#xD;
      control. Frail elderly people are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality after exposure to&#xD;
      a stressor. Frail patients are at higher risk of perioperative complications and longer&#xD;
      hospital stay. However, there has been no standard criteria or tool to evaluate frailty in&#xD;
      the elderly. Neither has there been enough evidence explaining the mechanism between frailty&#xD;
      and increased perioperative complications. Therefore, in this study we aim to discover the&#xD;
      relationship between frailty and intraoperative hemodynamic instability, as well as&#xD;
      perioperative complications in the elderly patients, hoping to find an adequate and practical&#xD;
      model for preoperative assessment in the elderly hopefully for better perioperative outcome.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Intraoperative hypotension includes post induction hypotension(PIH), early intraoperative hypotension(eIOH) and late intraoperative hypotension(lIOH). Hypotension is defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90mmHg or a relative decrease more than 30% compared to baseline blood pressure, or mean arterial pressure less than 65mmHg or a decrease more than 30% compared to baseline. PIH is defined as a hypotension within 20 minutes after anesthesia induction, or before surgical incision. eIOH is defined as hypotension within 30 minutes after the start of surgery. lIOH is defined as hypotension that happen 30 minutes after the start of surgery until the end of surgery.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of intraoperative hemodynamic instability</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Intraoperative hemodynamic instability is defined as a definite change of systolic blood pressure, or mean arterial pressure, or diastolic pressure, or pulse pressure more than 15% or the need for vasoactive agents.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of postoperative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative complications will be recorded according to medical records and laboratory results within 30 days after surgery according to Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications. Incidence of each grade will be calculated as outcome. Postoperative acute kidney injury will be assessed by analysis of urinary and serum biomarkers before and after surgery.</description>
