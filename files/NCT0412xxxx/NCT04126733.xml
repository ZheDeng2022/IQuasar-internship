  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if combination of the two drugs regorafenib and&#xD;
      nivolumab is an effective treatment for pMMR - MSS colorectal cancer, a special type of&#xD;
      cancer of the colon or rectum (pMMR stands for proficient Mismatch Repair; MSS stands for&#xD;
      Microsatellite Stable) and whether it is safe for patients. Regorafenib works by blocking&#xD;
      several different proteins involved in tumor growth. Nivolumab is an immunotherapy drug&#xD;
      encouraging the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both drugs have been approved, but not for how they are being used as combination therapy in&#xD;
      this study. Brand name of regorafenib is Stivarga; brand name of nivolumab is Opdivo.&#xD;
