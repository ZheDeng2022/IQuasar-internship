  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of using the Zoom Reperfusion System&#xD;
      in subjects diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke and undergoing a thrombectomy procedure&#xD;
      within 8 hours of last known well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year 17 million people suffer stroke worldwide. According to the World Stroke&#xD;
      Organization, stroke has become the second cause of death and disability worldwide. In the&#xD;
      United States, every year, more than 795,000 people have a stroke. Given the large-scale&#xD;
      challenges of curing stroke, prevention and treatments for stroke are much needed. Ischemic&#xD;
      stroke is treatable in many patients if they have early access to viable treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial designed to assess the&#xD;
      potential treatment benefits of using the Imperative Care 0.088&quot; Catheters in conjunction&#xD;
      with the other devices in the Zoom Reperfusion System to restore blood flow in patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke secondary to intracranial large vessel occlusive disease. The Zoom&#xD;
      Reperfusion System includes the Imperative Care 0.088&quot; Catheters, the Zoom Reperfusion&#xD;
      Catheters (0.035&quot; to 0.071&quot; Catheters), Zoom Aspiration Tubing, and Zoom Aspiration Pump. The&#xD;
      trial will assess reperfusion success using the mTICI scores in the absence of any rescue&#xD;
      therapy, reperfusion time, first-pass success, and functional independence including a&#xD;
      quality-of-life assessment.&#xD;
