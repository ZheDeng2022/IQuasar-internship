  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age has been related to awakening propofol concentration at effector site of TCI, but not to&#xD;
      the loss of consciousness concentration, neither to the concentration of body movements&#xD;
      during surgery, that can be interpreted as a sign of light anesthesia and lead to awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determinate the incidence and the propofol TCI concentration at the&#xD;
      effector site, in patients undergoing general anaesthesia without NBDs, of any patients body&#xD;
      movements, defined as any spontaneous movements (but no reflex movements) during surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Target-Controlled-Infusion (TCI), estimating the effect-size concentration (Ce) of propofol&#xD;
      and its elimination time with a computerized system, provides the anaesthesiologist useful&#xD;
      information to guide anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the correlation between propofol at the effector site at loss of consciousness (Ce&#xD;
      LOC) and age is still debated with contrasting results, the correlation between propofol at&#xD;
      the effector site at return of consciousness (Ce ROC) and age is well established, and some&#xD;
      authors suggested that, due also for age-related changes in both pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of propofol, its dosage should be reduced in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lowering propofol dosage however, can lead to an higher incidence of awareness during general&#xD;
      anaesthesia, even if anaesthesia management is guided by consciousness monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awareness during anaesthesia has recently been defined not as a binary phenomenon, but as a&#xD;
      graded spectra of states and, during general anaesthesia without using neuromuscular blocking&#xD;
      drugs (NBDs), body movement on the operating table can be taken as an indication of&#xD;
      increasing probability of consciousness or 'light' anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, this study aims to evaluate the impact of age on the concentration at the effector&#xD;
      site of propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia administered with TCI pump and without NBDs.&#xD;
      Concnetration at the effector site of Propofol at the return of consciousness (CeP ROC) and&#xD;
      at any clinical sign of superficialization such as body movements (CeP BM) will be&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
