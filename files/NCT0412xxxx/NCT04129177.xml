    <textblock>
      Background. The Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program in Catalonia (VINCat) monitors SSI&#xD;
      in elective colorectal surgery since 2007 in 56 hospitals (7.5 million population). These&#xD;
      hospitals perform active and prospective standardized surveillance of elective colorectal&#xD;
      resections. Post-discharge surveillance is mandatory up to 30 days after surgery. Between&#xD;
      2007 and 2015, the SSI rate did not change significantly, with a cumulated incidence of 5,491&#xD;
      SSI in a total of 29,006 interventions (19%). In 2015, a working group of VINCat specialists&#xD;
      and surgeons from the Catalan Society of Surgery was set up to formulate a specific bundle of&#xD;
      SSI preventative measures for colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. To analyse the effect of a specific bundle for SSI prevention in elective colorectal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. In 2016, a bundle of six preventative measures was recommended to the VINCat&#xD;
      hospitals. Bundle measures were: systemic and oral antibiotic prophylaxis, mechanical bowel&#xD;
      preparation (MBP), laparoscopic surgery, maintenance of normothermia, and the use of a&#xD;
      double-ring wound retractor. The results of SSI before and after the implementation of the&#xD;
      bundle are compared. The results are analysed using the chi-square test (statistical&#xD;
      significance p &lt;0.05).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Surgical location infection (ILQ) is the most frequent complication of surgery and an&#xD;
      important source of clinical and economic problems for health systems. The reduction of its&#xD;
      incidence is important because of its impact on patient comfort and the health resources&#xD;
      used. The ILQ includes the categories of: superficial incisional (IIS, affects skin and&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue); deep incisional (IIP, affects deep soft tissues), and organ-space or&#xD;
      organ-cavitary (IOE, affects any anatomical structure other than the incision manipulated&#xD;
      during the intervention). Surgical procedures are distributed in the categories of clean,&#xD;
      clean-contaminated, contaminated and dirty or infected surgery depending on your risk of ILQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective colorectal surgery belongs to the clean-contaminated surgery category, it is one of&#xD;
      the most frequent surgical procedures in Western society and the one with the highest rate of&#xD;
      postoperative infection. The ILQ after colorectal procedures represents a measurable&#xD;
      indicator of the quality of a health system. Endogenous factors of the patient and exogenous&#xD;
      factors related to the surgical procedure are involved in the development of the ILQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the introduction of laparoscopy and the standardization of perioperative measures of&#xD;
      prophylaxis, the clean-contaminated nature of these procedures, the increase in comorbidities&#xD;
      and age of patients and the increase in the complexity of surgical procedures do not improve&#xD;
      the Postoperative ILQ rates. It is necessary to investigate the usefulness of complementary&#xD;
      prophylactic measures that allow lowering the level of wound contamination and reducing the&#xD;
      rate of ILQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grouping of ILQ prevention measures into bundles or packages of measures with a high&#xD;
      level of evidence is a strategy that has proven effective in various types of surgical&#xD;
      procedures. The overall effectiveness of a package of measures depends on the degree of&#xD;
      individual effectiveness of each of the measures included in the bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program in Catalonia (VINCat) has been monitoring ILQ&#xD;
      rates in elective colorectal surgery since 2007 in 55 hospitals. These hospitals perform&#xD;
      active and prospective standardized surveillance of elective colorectal resections.&#xD;
      Post-discharge surveillance is mandatory up to 30 days after surgery. Between 2007 and 2015,&#xD;
      the rate of ILQ did not change significantly, with a cumulative incidence of 5,491 ILQ in a&#xD;
      total of 29,006 interventions (19%). Given the persistence of these infection rates, in 2015,&#xD;
      an interdisciplinary working group was formed that included infection control nurses,&#xD;
      infectious disease specialists, anesthetists and surgeons of the Catalan Society of Surgery.&#xD;
      Its objective was to design a specific package of ILQ preventive measures for elective&#xD;
      colorectal surgery that could affect the incisional infection and organ / space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, a package of 6 measures of prevention of ILQ in colorectal surgery was implanted in&#xD;
      hospitals belonging to VINCat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambit. A multicenter study is proposed in 55 hospitals in Catalonia. This is a cohort study&#xD;
      of the prospective VINCat database, which collects data on surgical patients with the purpose&#xD;
      of improving quality. Sixty-five VINCat hospitals participate in the surveillance of ILQ in&#xD;
      colorectal surgery, an effort focused on improving the ILQ in colon and rectal operations&#xD;
      since 2007. There are more than 43,000 case records since that date. VINCat hospitals are&#xD;
      predominantly public hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workgroup. The working group is multicentre and interdisciplinary, including doctors and&#xD;
      nurses of different specialties related to the prevention and control of surgical infection&#xD;
      (surgical nursing, anesthesia, infectious diseases, infection spread and surgery) of&#xD;
      different hospitals in the territory. The working group has a long experience in the&#xD;
      surveillance and prevention of nosocomial and surgical infection and with the necessary means&#xD;
      to carry out the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients The study recipients are all patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, one&#xD;
      of the most frequent major abdominal surgical procedures in our hospitals and one of the ones&#xD;
      that causes the most complications and health costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. Implantation of a package of ILQ prevention measures in colorectal surgery, which&#xD;
      includes the combination of oral antibiotic and mechanical colon preparation (PMC) may&#xD;
      decrease the rate of ILQ in elective colon surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals. Principal. Evaluate the effect of the implementation of a package of specific measures&#xD;
      (bundle) in reducing the ILQ rate&#xD;
