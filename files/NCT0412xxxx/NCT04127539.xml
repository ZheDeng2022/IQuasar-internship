  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of Strong and Steady (S&amp;S) group exercise&#xD;
      on fall risk and physical function among community-dwelling older adults over 12 months. A&#xD;
      pre-post test study deign will be used.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The S&amp;S group exercise program builds on the Otago and FaME exercise programs which have&#xD;
      shown to be effective in preventing falls. Strong and steady has been adapted to more&#xD;
      functionally fit older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will be one year. Due to the corona pandemic all S&amp;S groups in Norway have&#xD;
      been closed. Due to this all participants have had a break from their exercise program for&#xD;
      more than 6 months and can be seen av new participants to the exercise groups. Participants&#xD;
      that are about to start in a S&amp;S group in municipalities in Trøndelag will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in this study. They will go through tests of muscle strength and balance in&#xD;
      addition to questionnaires at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of exercise. Where possible&#xD;
      the participants will go through the same tests 1 month before they start to exercise in&#xD;
      addition to the three other test timepoints.&#xD;

    <description>The community-based group exercise program S&amp;S, with strengthening and balance exercise as the main components. The participants will attend a once-weekly, one hour supervised session. The exercises that will be used can be found in the S&amp;S handbook which includes different difficulty levels. All instructors are volunteers and have completed the S&amp;S education. Each exercise session will consist of a warm-up (5-8 min.), endurance exercises (10-15 min.), strength exercises (15 min.), balance exercises (20 min.) and a cool down/stretching (5 min.). In addition to attending the group exercises, the participants will be taught and encouraged to do home exercises twice a week from hand out leaflets that can be found at www.sterkogstodig.no.</description>
