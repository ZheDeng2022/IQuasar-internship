  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to evaluate the efficacy of the Cyberlegs X-leg in people with a&#xD;
      unilateral transfemoral (above the knee joint) and transtibial (under the knee joint)&#xD;
      amputation. De Cyberlegs X-leg is in continuation of the development of the Cyberlegs&#xD;
      gamma-prototype (B.U.N. 143201732970; FAMHP reference number: 80M0725). The Cyberlegs X-leg&#xD;
      is a motorized prosthesis which replaces the amputated part of the leg. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that people with a lower limb amputation perform daily activities (e.g. walking, stair&#xD;
      climbing, sit to stand, et cetera) easier, more comfortable and more efficient with the X-leg&#xD;
      compared to their current prosthesis. Assessments will be based on a holistic approach in&#xD;
      which biomechanical, physiological and psychological parameters are determined.&#xD;

      Study design A crossover study and a case study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Number of subjects 14 participants will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Age:18 - 80 year Gender: men and women Level of amputation: unilateral&#xD;
      transfemoral or transtibial Completed the rehabilitation program Functional Medicare&#xD;
      Classification K-level 2-4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Comorbidity (hemiplegia or neurological diseases) Stump pain or bad fit of&#xD;
      the socket&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Recruitment process Experiments will take place at the research group Human&#xD;
      Physiology and Sports Physiotherapy of campus Etterbeek from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel&#xD;
      (Belgium). Participants will be recruited via clinical rehabilitation centers, such as V!GO&#xD;
      (Wetteren or Pellenberg, Belgium), Jessa hospital (Hasselt, Belgium) or via advertisement and&#xD;
      flyers. All participants will be providing written and oral information about the&#xD;
      experimental protocol, potential risks and benefits before giving informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment During a first meeting with the participant (either at home or at the laboratory)&#xD;
      the experiment will be explained, informed consent is given, and a clinical anamnesis will&#xD;
      occur. Eventually, appointments are made for the experiments. If necessary, a copy of the&#xD;
      participants' current socket will be made to optimize fitting and alignment to the novel&#xD;
      prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarization The familiarization trial aimed to accustom participants to the experimental&#xD;
      protocol, to get used to the measurements and the novel prosthesis. Participants will get&#xD;
      enough time (60 minutes) to perform the tests with their current and novel prosthesis and to&#xD;
      ensure a good alignment and fitting. Participants will be fitted and aligned to the novel&#xD;
      device by a physiotherapist and prosthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol A (people with a transfemoral amputation) Participants with a Medicare&#xD;
      Functional Classification K-level 2 are asked to visit the laboratory two times for a sit to&#xD;
      stand test with their current prosthesis (first experiment) and the Cyberlegs X-leg (second&#xD;
      experiment). During the sit to stand test (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC):&#xD;
      0.84-0.92), the participants will be asked to rise as often as possible from their chair in&#xD;
      thirty seconds without support of their hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol B (people with a transfemoral and -tibial amputation) Participants with&#xD;
      a Medicare Functional Classification K-level 3 and 4 are asked to visit the laboratory two&#xD;
      times for four consecutive tasks with ten minutes of rest in between each task. During the&#xD;
      stair climbing test participants' will be asked to ascend and descend a staircase.&#xD;
      Participants start in front of the staircase and are asked to ascend and descend as fast as&#xD;
      possible. Bilateral handrails are required to allow support when needed. The ascending phase&#xD;
      is initiated with the prosthetic side, while the first step of the descending phase is&#xD;
      performed with the non-involved leg. The second task is the L-test (ICC: 0.97), where&#xD;
      participants are asked to rise from a chair, walk through an office door, turn 90 degrees,&#xD;
      walk down a hallway, turn 180 degrees and then return in the same way to the seated position.&#xD;
      A total distance of 20 meter will be covered. The slope walking test assesses the&#xD;
      participants' ability to ascend and descend an inclined ramp as fast as possible. For safety&#xD;
      reasons bilateral handrails are warranted. Participants start the test in an upright position&#xD;
      in front of the ramp and are asked to ascend the ramp, turn around on the platform, descend&#xD;
      the ramp and return to the starting position. Finally, a hallway six-minute walk test (ICC:&#xD;
      0.90 - 0.96) will be performed on a hallway at a self-selected walking speed, which closely&#xD;
      relates to the most efficient walking speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These four tests will be performed in four separate case studies with the POWER knee (Össur,&#xD;
      Reykjavik) compared to the Cyberlegs X-leg, the POWER knee compared to the Cyberlegs X-leg&#xD;
      knee with a passive ankle joint, the current prosthesis (either passive or quasi-passive)&#xD;
      compared to the Cyberlegs X-leg and finally a passive or quasi-passive ankle joint compared&#xD;
      to the Cyberlegs X-leg ankle joint. In the last case study, a participant with a transtibial&#xD;
      amputation will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All appointments will take place at the same hour to counteract circadian rhythm effect, and&#xD;
      at least 24 hours between each session will be planned to counteract mental and physical&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures and measurement devices Physical performance determinants will be gathered&#xD;
      in terms of duration, number of stands and normal walking speed. Biomechanical outcome&#xD;
      measures (spatiotemporal, kinematics and kinetics) will be recorded during the different&#xD;
      tests with a motion capture system (VICON, UK), portable singe layer sensitive walkway&#xD;
      (GAITRite®, CIR systems, USA) and inertial measurement units (Technaid®, Spain). Outcomes&#xD;
      from these devices include joint angels, pressure plots, cadence, step width and length, and&#xD;
      stance and swing phases. Physiological outcome measures (cardiovascular, respiratory and&#xD;
      electrophysiological) will be collected with a heart rate sensor (Polar® M400, H7-sensor,&#xD;
      Finland), an ergospirometric device (K5®, Cosmed, Italy), a life monitor vest (Equivital®,&#xD;
      USA) and electromyography device (Mini Wave®, Cometa, Italy). Outcome measures from these&#xD;
      devices include heart rate, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, ventilation,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, skin temperature and muscle activity (peak and mean amplitude).&#xD;
      Psychological outcome measures like the rating of perceived exertion (score between 6-20),&#xD;
      the visual analogue scale ( score on 100) for comfort and fatigue will be collected after the&#xD;
      tests. The EuroQol-5D (score on 100) will be filled in before each trial. Other&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed during the familiarization, i.e. the mini-mental state&#xD;
      examination (score on 30), the prosthetic evaluation questionnaire and the system usability&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
