  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate sleep is necessary for physical and mental health of human being. Although surgery&#xD;
      and anesthesia techniques have improved in resent years, postoperative sleep disturbance&#xD;
      remains a challenging problem in surgical procedures1. Postoperative sleep fragmentation and&#xD;
      poor sleep quality can not only result in hyperalgesia and a delay in postoperative&#xD;
      recovery2, lack of sleep after surgery can also bring many potential adverse effects such as&#xD;
      cognitive disorders (such as delusions, delirium), chronic pain, mood disorders, metabolic&#xD;
      disorders, and pro-inflammatory changes3-5. Previous studies have reported that age,&#xD;
      preoperative comorbidity and severity of surgical trauma were independent factors that&#xD;
      associated with postoperative sleep disturbance6,7. Our prior studies have also found that&#xD;
      patients are more likely to experience decreased sleep quality after receiving general&#xD;
      anesthesia, which was characterized by a decrease in each sleep stage8. Propofol and&#xD;
      sevoflurane are commonly used general anesthetics in clinical practice. The choice of&#xD;
      anesthetic may also affect the cognitive outcome after surgery, but the results of clinical&#xD;
      studies have always been contradictory. Some studies report that the cognitive results after&#xD;
      inhalation are worse than those after intravenous anesthesia. And the incidence of dreaming&#xD;
      was significantly higher in the sevoflurane anesthesia group compared to the propofol&#xD;
      group9-11. Another study conduct among infants proved that compared with&#xD;
      propofol-remifentanil, sevoflurane appears to be associated with less sleep disturbances in&#xD;
      the first weeks after surgery12. Based on these conflicts, the aim of the current study was&#xD;
      to compare the effect of propofol vs sevoflurane on early postoperative sleep quality and&#xD;
      complications of patients receiving laparoscopic surgery after general anesthesia.&#xD;
