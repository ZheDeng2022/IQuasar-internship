    <textblock>
      Specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess variability in performance on state-level measures of working memory (WM)&#xD;
           delivered via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The investigators expect WM&#xD;
           performance to vary over the course of a day across participants, and to be poorer and&#xD;
           more variable among youth with overweight/obesity and loss of control (LOC) eating&#xD;
           relative to overweight/obese and non-overweight controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the relationship between state WM and eating behavior. The investigators&#xD;
           expect that poorer momentary WM will predict an increased likelihood of LOC eating as&#xD;
           assessed via EMA, and greater energy intake and poorer dietary quality as assessed via&#xD;
           dietary recall, across participants. The investigators expect these effects to be&#xD;
           strongest among youth with concomitant overweight/obesity and LOC eating.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric overweight and obesity continue to represent major threats to public health. One&#xD;
      cause is loss of control (LOC) eating, which involves a sense that one cannot control what or&#xD;
      how much one is eating, affects up to 30% of youth with overweight/obesity, and may undermine&#xD;
      weight control attempts via increased psychiatric distress, including onset of full-syndrome&#xD;
      eating disorders. One methodology to explore factors underlying LOC eating is ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA), which enable examination of &quot;in the moment&quot; processes related to&#xD;
      eating behavior. A neurocognitive factor implicated in LOC eating is executive functioning&#xD;
      (EF; i.e., the ability to adaptively engage in ongoing, goal-oriented behavior). It is&#xD;
      critical to understand the role of EF in the development of LOC eating because EF informs&#xD;
      one's ability to understand and respond to emotions, and to engage in healthy weight&#xD;
      regulation behaviors. In particular, working memory (WM), conceptualized as the ability to&#xD;
      retain goal-relevant information when faced with distracting or irrelevant information, may&#xD;
      impact regulation of eating behavior including vulnerability to LOC eating. Although WM is&#xD;
      typically conceptualized as a trait-level factor, it is known to vary at the state-level as&#xD;
      well, which may increase susceptibility for engaging in goal-incompatible behaviors. The&#xD;
      proposed study uses EMA to characterize state-level WM and eating behavior in youth with&#xD;
      overweight/obesity and LOC eating to understand how WM variations between- and&#xD;
      within-subjects influence acute maladaptive eating. Participants will be 50 children, ages&#xD;
      10-17, 20 of whom are overweight/obese and report LOC eating (i.e., at least 3 objectively or&#xD;
      subjectively large LOC episodes in the past 3 months), 20 of whom who will serve as&#xD;
      overweight/obese controls with no LOC eating, and 10 of whom are normal-weight controls with&#xD;
      no LOC eating.&#xD;
