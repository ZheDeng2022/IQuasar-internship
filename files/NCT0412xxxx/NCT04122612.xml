  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Events occurring in the early stages of life play an important role in the development of&#xD;
      chronic diseases; diet and lifestyle during pregnancy are recognized to be crucial&#xD;
      determinants in modulating offspring microbiota, throughout a vertical transfer of dysbiotic&#xD;
      maternal ambient. Moreover, the intestinal colonization is maximized in the first two years&#xD;
      of life through newborn's type and time of feeding. This study will provide the starting&#xD;
      point for a future prospective observational study to assessing the association between&#xD;
      maternal lifestyle with infant microbiota and their influence future health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory has pointed out&#xD;
      biological mechanisms supporting the intergenerational nature of non communicable diseases&#xD;
      (NCDs), which are an increasing public health problem in many countries. Furthermore,&#xD;
      scientific evidence confirms that the events occurring in the early stages of life play a&#xD;
      critical role in fostering the development of chronic diseases (e.g. overweight and obesity,&#xD;
      allergies, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, neurocognitive impairment and cancers),&#xD;
      throughout the life-course, indicating the high relevance of &quot;the maternal environment&quot;&#xD;
      impact on the life of the future child. This crucial window goes from the conception to the&#xD;
      two years of life, and it is known as 'first thousand days'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional status during pregnancy is one of the crucial determinants in modulating the&#xD;
      characteristics of the &quot;maternal environment&quot; in which the foetus originates and develops.&#xD;
      Therefore, adequate nutrition just before conception, during pregnancy, infancy and early&#xD;
      childhood is essential to ensure growth, health, and development of children to their full&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic links have been confirmed in mice between the prenatal diet and the increased&#xD;
      incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic associated conditions in their&#xD;
      offspring. However, specific epigenetic regulation mechanisms are still unclear. Recently, an&#xD;
      increasing number of animal and human studies have proposed the hypothesis that the gut&#xD;
      microbiota may be considered an important mediator of vital microbiome-host interaction(s)&#xD;
      under health or disease conditions. Moreover, microbiota has been shown to pass features from&#xD;
      one generation to the next via maternal contact; in fact, recent observation of microbial&#xD;
      presence in placenta, meconium and amniotic fluid has suggested a significant interplay&#xD;
      between the environmental microbes and the developing gastrointestinal tract of the fetus&#xD;
      even before delivery. Thus, the alteration of microbiota composition, driving to increased&#xD;
      long-term susceptibility to diseases, can begin early in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination of the neonatal gut microbiome immediately after delivery revealed that it varied&#xD;
      by virtue of maternal gestational diet suggesting that the colonization of the infant gut is&#xD;
      likely to occur prior to parturition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first months after birth, the bacterial flora in the gut is known to be affected&#xD;
      by many factors, including mode of delivery, use of antibiotics or probiotics, geographical&#xD;
      location, type and time of feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, maternal exposures during pregnancy to several environmental chemicals are known to&#xD;
      induce perturbations in the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome. Among these&#xD;
      substances, endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs), such as phthalates, bisphenol and&#xD;
      hydroxypyrene, which can be found in oil and water resistant textile coatings, non-stick&#xD;
      cookware, food container coatings, floor polish, fire-fighting foam, and industrial&#xD;
      surfactants, are a class of suspected obesogenic contaminants persisting in the environment&#xD;
      and humans. EDCs have been also detected in cord blood samples, suggesting that exposure&#xD;
      starts prenatally and early life EDC exposures may perturb neuroendocrine systems involved in&#xD;
      growth, energy metabolism, appetite, adipogenesis, and glucose-insulin homeostasis promoting&#xD;
      childhood obesity development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this first period, the gut microbial composition continues to evolve until the age of&#xD;
      2-3 years; these first years represent as &quot;a window of opportunity&quot; for microbial modulation,&#xD;
      influenced by complementary feeding period, gradual transition from milk-based infant feeding&#xD;
      to weaning and solid foods, usually occurring between 6 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.MA.MI is a longitudinal, prospective, observational study that includes a group of&#xD;
      mother-infant pairs (n=60) attending the Neonatal Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San&#xD;
      Matteo, Pavia (Italy). The study was planned to provide data collected before discharge (T0)&#xD;
      and at 1,6,12 months after birth (T1,T2,T3). Maternal and infant anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      are assessed at each time. Other variables evaluated are pre-pregnancy/gestational weight&#xD;
      status (T0), maternal dietary habits/physical activity (T1-T3); infant medical history, type&#xD;
      of feeding, antibiotics/probiotics/supplements use, environment exposures (e.g cigarette&#xD;
      smoking, pets, environmental temperature) (T1-T3). A child stool sample was planned to be&#xD;
      collected at each time and analyzed using metagenomics 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence-based&#xD;
      methods. Maternal urine samples were planned to be collected at T3 to investigate pollutants&#xD;
      exposure (Phthalates, Bisphenol A and Hydroxypyrene).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there are still limited knowledge about the child's microbiota, its changes over time&#xD;
      and the host and environmental interactions in shaping its composition, further prospective&#xD;
      studies are needed to determine how different factors related to diet-related factors,&#xD;
      lifestyle, drugs and anthropometric measures can influence microbial colonization of the gut&#xD;
      during early childhood and influence the future health status.&#xD;
