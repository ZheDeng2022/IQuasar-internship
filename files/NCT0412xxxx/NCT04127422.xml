    <textblock>
      Benign diseases of the breast are common clinical conditions that affect young women.&#xD;
      Complaints related to the breast often cause significant discomfort and mental stress. The&#xD;
      following study will try to identify the risk factors that may be associated with symptomatic&#xD;
      benign breast diseases. Identification of such factors may help preventing and / or treating&#xD;
      these conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benign breast disease (BBD) is a common cause of hospital visit. In young adults, benign&#xD;
      breast conditions surpass cancer as a cause of symptoms related to the breast. However,&#xD;
      breast symptoms may be associated with significant distress and may impose diagnostic&#xD;
      difficulties. Moreover, certain pathological entities of benign breast conditions are well&#xD;
      known to increase the risk of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of modifiable risk factors associated with symptomatic breast disorders has&#xD;
      several potential benefits. Modification of such factors may help decrease patients'&#xD;
      distress, hospital visits and indirectly decrease the risk of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the available data point to the possible association of several environmental factors with&#xD;
      symptomatic BBD. Most of the available information points to an association of BBD with&#xD;
      anthropometric features, growth pattern, family history of breast conditions and dietary&#xD;
      consumption. Substantial evidence are however lacking and further studies are strongly&#xD;
      required to better characterize the risk factors of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will systematically collect epidemiological, developmental&#xD;
      and clinical data in young patients presenting with breast complaints. The association with&#xD;
      disease incidence, pattern and histology will be examined.&#xD;
