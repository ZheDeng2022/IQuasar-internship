  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific chronic low back pain is defined as pain that originates in the lumbar spine, is&#xD;
      persistent, lasts more than 3 months, and is unrelated to an inflammatory, traumatic, tumour,&#xD;
      malformation, or infectious cause. Chronic low back pain is one of the most frequent reasons&#xD;
      for consulting a physician, and one of the most common sources of disability, particularly as&#xD;
      a result of socio-professional withdrawl. It is a major consumer of health resources&#xD;
      (diagnostic investigations, multiple treatments) and involves heavy expenses for the&#xD;
      investigator's health insurance system. In view of this major public health issue, in&#xD;
      November 2017, the Health Insurance and several specialized health organizations launched a&#xD;
      &quot;general public&quot; campaign to raise awareness of low back pain. This campaign, entitled &quot;Back&#xD;
      pain? The right treatment is movement&quot; was designed to encourage appropriate physical&#xD;
      activity in patients with low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the available therapies, multimodal programs are recommended as a first line treatment.&#xD;
      In order to incorporate physical activity into patients' daily lives, these rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs are based on a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach (therapeutic education,&#xD;
      muscle strengthening, reconditioning, ergonomics, psychological, social, professional and&#xD;
      nutritional management and cardiovascular risk factors). Although such programmes have&#xD;
      already shown short term effectiveness, few data are available on their continued&#xD;
      effectiveness in the medium term (1 year). This project aims to identify good and bad&#xD;
      responders to a multimodal program in the medium term, based on common clinical parameters&#xD;
      (Quebec City questionnaire score and spontaneous walking speed), and to identify the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying this response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in clinical practice, heterogeneity in maintaining the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      program is observed but little documented. The limited data available show a heterogeneity of&#xD;
      these programs and one of the objectives of this project will be to identify the existing&#xD;
      barriers and levers available to improve this situation.&#xD;
