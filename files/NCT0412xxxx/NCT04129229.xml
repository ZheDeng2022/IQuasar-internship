  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LinguaFlex™ Tongue Retractor (LTR) is an investigational medical device that is inserted&#xD;
      into the tongue to prevent it from moving backward during sleep. This helps to keep the&#xD;
      airway open during sleep so that the tongue doesn't block the airway and stop breathing or&#xD;
      narrow it enough to cause snoring. This study will monitor the effectiveness of the LTR&#xD;
      device in the reduction of Obstructive Sleep Apnea over the course of a one-year treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a multi-site, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm&#xD;
      clinical study to test the efficacy of the LinguaFlex Tongue Retractor for the treatment of&#xD;
      moderate to severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) (AHI ≥15 at baseline) in adult subjects in&#xD;
      twelve (12) months of continuous use. The study will include three (3) investigational sites&#xD;
      that will implant a minimum of sixty (60) subjects with the LTR. No single site is to perform&#xD;
      more than 25 implants. After informed consent is obtained, eligible subjects (adults who have&#xD;
      moderate to severe OSA) will be screened for study inclusion. The screening will consist of a&#xD;
      Polysomnography (PSG) completed within two (2) months of inclusion in the study to confirm&#xD;
      the diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA, an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) assessment,&#xD;
      Snoring Self-Assessment (SOS) with bed partner input (SBPS), assessment of pain, speech and&#xD;
      swallowing, and a physical examination. The screening data will be reviewed by the Sponsor's&#xD;
      designated study monitor to confirm and approve that inclusion criteria are fully met.&#xD;
      Failure to meet all inclusion criteria will be designated as a screen failure and the&#xD;
      subject's enrollment will be terminated. Participation in the study is voluntary. Subjects&#xD;
      may withdraw at any time during the study. Reasons for the withdrawal will be recorded and&#xD;
      entered into the clinical study report. Any subject who withdraws from the study for any&#xD;
      reason will have the device removed and will undergo a Post Device Removal Follow-Up within&#xD;
      30 days (-7/+ 15) of device removal.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder to Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the responder rate to therapy. A responder is defined as a subject who experiences a ≥ 50% reduction in AHI from baseline and has an AHI &lt; 20 at the 12-month follow-up visit. Subjects with an AHI ≤ 20 at baseline will be considered a responder if a 50% reduction in AHI is achieved from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) from the baseline control measurement and determine the proportion of study subjects that achieve an ESS value of ≤ 10 at the twelve-month follow-up. ((ESS is a validated instrument that rates a subject's daytime sleepiness and is commonly used in clinical evaluation and management of OSA as a quality of life measurement. Scores range from 0 to 24, with lower scores indicating greater functioning. An ESS &lt; 10 is considered normal subjective sleepiness.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) Responder</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) responder rate at the twelve-month follow-up visit. An ODI responder is defined as a subject which demonstrates at least a 25% reduction in ODI from the baseline control measurement at the 12-month follow-up visit. Change in ODI will be reported as a percentage change from baseline for each subject as well as the mean percentage change for the entire cohort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Metric - Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>At each follow-up visit over the course of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Examine the tolerance and comfort of the implanted LTR. Pain will be assessed at each follow-up visit using a 10 point Visual Analog Scale (0 no pain - 10 worst pain) and will be compared to the baseline measurement.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Metric - Speech and Swallowing</measure>
    <time_frame>At each follow-up visit over the course of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Examine the tolerance and comfort of the implanted LTR. Comfort with speech and swallowing will be assessed using the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN). This scale consists of three individual scores for Normalcy of Diet, Eating in Public and Understanding of Speech. In each case a score of 100 indicates normal function and 0 indicates the most limited function.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Metric - Snoring</measure>
    <time_frame>At each follow-up visit over the course of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Examine the change in snoring from the baseline control measurement. Snoring will be assessed using the Snore Outcome Survey (SOS) and the Spouse/Bed Partner Survey (SBPS). The SOS is a series of 8 questions with a score range of 0 - 34; with 0 representing no snoring and 34 representing the worst possible snoring. The Spouse Bed Partner Survey is a series of 3 questions with a score range of 0 - 12; with a score of 0 representing no snoring and 12 the worst possible snoring.</description>

    <intervention_name>LinguaFlex Tongue Retractor (LTR)</intervention_name>
    <description>The LinguaFlex Tongue Retractor (LTR) is a small, flexible, implanted tongue retaining device that prevents the backward movement of the tongue during sleep. The LTR's flexible shaft and a nubbed tether passes through the center of the tongue beneath the tongue blade (frenulum area) and connects to a disc (head) that rests on the external surface of the tongue base mucosa. Underneath the tongue, on the external surface of the frenulum, a small anchor secures the shaft that can be adjusted to tension the LTR to maximize therapeutic effect and maintain comfort.</description>
