      Background &amp; Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For years, most tumor immunotherapy researches have focused on T cell and natural killer (NK)&#xD;
      cell therapies, most of which involve amplification and modification of the patient's immune&#xD;
      cells for reinfusion therapy. However, for the treatment of solid tumors, there is currently&#xD;
      little breakthrough. Recently, researchers have reported a colony of cancer-resistant mice&#xD;
      developed from a single mouse that was immune to multiple lethal cancer cell injections.&#xD;
      Further research revealed that such anti-cancer immunity can cause rapid shrinkage or&#xD;
      disappearance of the tumors in other cancer-bearing mice. Interestingly, this therapeutic&#xD;
      effect is due to the donor granulocytes, instead of T cells or NK cells. Infusion of&#xD;
      granulocytes is a classic therapy in treating infection associated with granulocytopenia.&#xD;
      Currently, clinical collection of blood components, including isolation of granulocytes, is a&#xD;
      mature technique. The infusion of granulocytes is a viable anticancer therapy combining the&#xD;
      classic technique and novel anticancer approach. This proposed trial will test whether&#xD;
      granulocyte infusions from healthy unrelated donors can be used to treat advanced cancer. In&#xD;
      the proposed trial, up to 100 Subjects with advanced cancer can be entered. Each patient will&#xD;
      be given a dose of (2.0-5.0)x10^10 granulocytes from a different healthy donor every week&#xD;
      over a course of 5 doses. The trial will evaluate the subject's cancer 7, 30, 90 and 180 days&#xD;
      after the last infusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Granulocyte anti-cancer therapy refers to a method in which healthy donor granulocytes with&#xD;
      high cancer-killing activity are collected and infused into a specific cancer patient by&#xD;
      matching, to achieve the therapeutic anticancer effect. In this proposed trial, up to 100&#xD;
      Subjects with advanced cancer can be entered. Potentially hundreds of healthy&#xD;
      Donor-participants will be recruited. First, granulocyte donors will be identified via&#xD;
      in-vitro assay of Cancer Killing Activity (CKA), which screens healthy Donor-participants for&#xD;
      those with anticancer activity of more than 80%. Secondly, after donor-recipient blood&#xD;
      matching, (2.0-5.0)x10^10 granulocytes will be collected from each donor, accounting for&#xD;
      about 1/10 of the human body. Each patient will be given a dose of (2.0-5.0)x10^10&#xD;
      granulocytes from a different donor per week over a course of 5 doses (with an ideal total&#xD;
      infusion of 2X10^11 granulocytes). After each infusion, the patients will be monitored&#xD;
      carefully for possible adverse events. If adverse events occur, the infusion can be slowed&#xD;
      down or stopped until the adverse events can be managed. The trial will observe the subject's&#xD;
      cancer 7, 30, 90 and 180 days after the last infusion. Target lesions, non-target lesions,&#xD;
      and new lesions will be evaluated via medical imaging and tumor markers. The responses will&#xD;
      be compared against the measurements at baseline.&#xD;
