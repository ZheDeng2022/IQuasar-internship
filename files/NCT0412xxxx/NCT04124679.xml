  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia is a medically induced state of low reactivity consciousness which is&#xD;
      similar to natural sleep.Some studies found that general anesthesia as an independent risk&#xD;
      factor could result in a desynchronization of the circadian time structure and cause&#xD;
      postoperative sleep disorders characterized by reduced rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave&#xD;
      sleep (SWS),which have signiﬁcant deleterious impacts on postoperative outcomes, such as&#xD;
      postoperative fatigue, severe anxiety and depression, emotional detachment and delirium, and&#xD;
      even pain sensitivity or postoperative pain of patients.Acupuncture can regulate plant nerve&#xD;
      activity by increasing slow-wave sleep time to improve sleep quality.The results of&#xD;
      polysomnography monitoring showed that the sleep latency, total sleep time, awakening index&#xD;
      and sleep quality were all significant improved after acupuncture treatment.And&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation（TAES） works by stimulating Shu yu acupoints,&#xD;
      which is more convenient than the normal electric acupuncture. The purpose of this paper is&#xD;
      to study the effect of TAES on sleep after thoracoscopic surgery&#xD;

      In TEAS group, an experienced acupuncturist performed 30 minutes of TEAS treatment at the HT7&#xD;
      (Shenmen) and Neiguan (PC6) acupoints on bilateral side, which were identiﬁed in accordance&#xD;
      with the TCM anatomic localizations on the first night before surgery by a stimulator (Hwato&#xD;
      Electronic Acupuncture Treatment Instrument, model no.: SDZ-II; Suzhou Medical Appliances Co.&#xD;
      Ltd, Suzhou, China). And after surgery, ST36 (Zusanli) and LI4 (Hegu) acupoints were added&#xD;
      for the effect of relieving postoperative complications. 30 minutes of TEAS treatment was&#xD;
      also performed on bilateral side by an experienced acupuncturist at the Neiguan (PC6), HT7&#xD;
      (Shenmen), ST36 (Zusanli) and LI4 (Hegu) acupoints on the first three nights after surgery.&#xD;
      The TEAS was standardized before each treatment and was set at 2/10 HZ, which has been&#xD;
      documented as the most effective frequency. The optimal intensity is from 6 to 15mA, which&#xD;
      was adjusted according to individual maximum tolerance to maintain a slight twitching of the&#xD;
      regional muscles. Patients in the control group were attached the gel electrodes at the sham&#xD;
      acupoints. The acupuncture points were to be stimulated by microcurrents generated by a&#xD;
      special electrical device, which the patients may only experience a mild electric current&#xD;
      sensation or nothing at all.&#xD;
