      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPX-351 in combination with&#xD;
      quizartinib for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and high risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome. CPX-351, composed of chemotherapy drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine, works in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Quizartinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to learn if the combination of CPX-351 and quizartinib can help to control acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of liposomal cytarabine and&#xD;
      daunorubicin (CPX-351) in combination with quizartinib in patients with newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (HR-MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) rate including CR (complete remission) + CRp&#xD;
      (complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery) + CRi (complete remission with&#xD;
      incomplete count recovery) + partial remission (PR) within 3 months of treatment initiation&#xD;
      of CPX-351 and quizartinib combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response&#xD;
      (DOR) of patients treated with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the ORR, EFS (event free survival) and OS (overall survival) in FLT3&#xD;
      mutated/NPM1 wild-type patients versus FLT3 mutated/NPM1 mutated versus FLT3 wild-type/NPM1&#xD;
      mutated patients treated with CPX-351 and quizartinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Quantitative changes of FLT3-ITD allelic burden and longitudinal evaluation to identify&#xD;
      emergence of FLT3 non-ITD mutations with time in patients treated with the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the effect of this treatment combination on responding patients&#xD;
      transitioning to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To store and/or analyze surplus blood or tissue including bone marrow, if available, for&#xD;
      potential future exploratory research into factors that may influence development of AML&#xD;
      and/or response to the combination (where response is defined broadly to include efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability or safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CPX-351, followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3 and 5 and&#xD;
      quizartinib orally (PO) on days 6-19. Patients who do not respond to treatment during cycle 1&#xD;
      receive CPX-351 IV on days 1 and 3 and quixartinib PO on days 6-19 during cycle 2. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive CPX-351 over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 and quizartinib PO on&#xD;
      days 4-28 of cycle 1. Treatment with CPX-351 repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive quizartinib PO on days 1-28 in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3-6&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of 1) AML (World Health Organization [WHO] classification definition of &gt;=&#xD;
             20% blasts, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL]), or 2) high risk MDS (&gt; 10%&#xD;
             bone marrow blasts)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For frontline cohort: Patients aged &gt;= 60 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For relapsed or refractory cohort: Patients aged &gt;= 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For frontline cohort: Patients must be chemonaive, i.e., not have received any&#xD;
             chemotherapy (except hydrea or 1-2 doses of ara-C for transient control of&#xD;
             hyperleukocytosis) for AML or MDS. They may have received transfusions, hematopoietic&#xD;
             growth factors or vitamins for an antecedent hematological disorder (AHD) or for AML.&#xD;
             Temporary prior measures such as apheresis, ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid), steroids&#xD;
             or hydrea while diagnostic work-up is being performed are allowed and not counted as a&#xD;
             prior salvage. Supportive care therapy for MDS (growth factors, transfusions) will not&#xD;
             be considered as prior therapy for MDS/AML and these patients will be enrolled to the&#xD;
             frontline cohort of the study if they are otherwise eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For relapsed or refractory cohort: Patients who have received at least one prior&#xD;
             therapy for AML or for MDS (with &gt; 10%) blasts will be eligible. Patients may have&#xD;
             received up to 4 salvage regimens for AML and/or MDS (defined by the International&#xD;
             Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS] classification). Patients who receive MDS directed&#xD;
             therapies considered not purely supportive such as hypomethylating agents (HMAs),&#xD;
             lenalidomide, investigational therapies, will be enrolled to the salvage cohort if&#xD;
             they are otherwise eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to&#xD;
             time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents&#xD;
             or at least 5 half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents (whichever is shorter). The&#xD;
             half-life for the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration&#xD;
             manuals) and will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. The use of&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic or anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during the study with the&#xD;
             following exceptions: (1) intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with controlled&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at the discretion of the principal investigator&#xD;
             (PI). (2) Use of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m^2) or hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly&#xD;
             proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and for the first&#xD;
             four weeks on therapy. These medications will be recorded in the case-report form&#xD;
