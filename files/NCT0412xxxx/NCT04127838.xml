  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether low-vision occupational therapy&#xD;
      improves quality of life in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Low-vision occupational&#xD;
      therapy has not been previously studied in PD patients, and we suspect that this is a&#xD;
      beneficial treatment option for PD patients as vision impairment is common in the PD patient&#xD;
      population. Our primary objective will assess whether quality of life was improved following&#xD;
      a low-vision occupational therapy session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will be an exploratory study that will evaluate the benefits of low vision&#xD;
      occupational therapy in the treatment of PD using the Revised Self-Report Assessment of&#xD;
      Functional Visual Performance (R-SRAFVP) as the primary outcome measure. This tool assesses&#xD;
      33 vision-dependent ADLs ranging from personal care, leisurely activities, clothing&#xD;
      management, meal preparation, etc. Patients are able to rank their ability to complete these&#xD;
      tasks as independent, minimally difficult, moderately difficult, greatly difficult, unable,&#xD;
      or not applicable. This will allow us to capture potential changes in the patient's ability&#xD;
      to complete vision-specific ADLs following low vision occupational therapy. In addition, we&#xD;
      will also evaluate quality of life using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), to&#xD;
      compare this broad outcome measure with the R-SRAFVP.&#xD;
