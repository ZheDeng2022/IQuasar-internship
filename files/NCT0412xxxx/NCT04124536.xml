  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of secondary&#xD;
      distribution HIV self-test kits to existing partner notification guidelines increases the&#xD;
      proportion of male partners who access facility-based HIV testing services, when compared to&#xD;
      the partner notification strategy alone&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women 18 years of age or older who enter antenatal care at Chipata Level 1 Hospital&#xD;
      in Lusaka, Zambia will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women will be randomized to one of two groups: partner&#xD;
      notification alone or partner notification plus secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits.&#xD;
      Women will return to the clinic 30 days after enrollment for an exit visit during which time&#xD;
      information about their experience with the partner notification strategies will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random sample of women and health care workers will also participate in qualitative&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Healthcare Providers Describing Feasibility of Intervention Via In-depth Interviews (Qualitative)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the start of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>To gain deeper insights about the feasibility of male partner HIV testing strategies, healthcare workers from the study site were asked to participate in in-depth interviews. Participating healthcare workers were involved in different aspects of male partner HIV testing and included study staff members. Feasibility was defined as a positive rating about the intervention's potential performance in real-life conditions at the clinic and community levels.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Describing Acceptability of Intervention Via In-depth Interviews (Qualitative)</measure>
    <time_frame>In the first two months of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>To gain deeper insights about the acceptability of the different male partner HIV testing strategies, subsamples of participants were selected based on study arm (intervention vs. control) and woman's HIV status (positive vs. negative). For the outcome measure, acceptability was defined as a positive rating of male partner HIV testing strategies from participants based on their experiences.</description>
