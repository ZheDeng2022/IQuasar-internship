  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open-label, single arm Phase III, multicenter trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of T-Guard treatment in patients with Steroid-Refractory acute Graft&#xD;
      versus Host Disease (SR-aGVHD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potent immunotherapy with&#xD;
      curative potential for several hematological disorders. Improvements in survival following&#xD;
      allo-HSCT have led to its increasing use, but the leading cause of non-relapse mortality&#xD;
      (NRM) remains graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD. Despite recent advances in the understanding&#xD;
      of transplantation immune tolerance, aGVHD is a frequent and major complication of allo-HSCT&#xD;
      involving activation of donor T-lymphocytes, which ultimately causes host tissue damage.&#xD;
      T-Guard has a rapid onset, preferential killing of activated T cells, and short half-life,&#xD;
      leading to depletion of allo-reactive T cells and quick post-treatment reconstitution of the&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must be at least 12.0 years of age at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has undergone first allo-HSCT from any donor source using bone marrow,&#xD;
             peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood. Recipients of nonmyeloablative, reduced&#xD;
             intensity, and myeloablative conditioning regimens are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients diagnosed with SR-aGVHD after allo-HSCT. SR is defined as aGVHD that:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progressed after 3 days of primary treatment with prednisone (or equivalent) of&#xD;
                  greater than or equal to 2mg/kg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No improvement after 7 days of primary treatment with prednisone (or equivalent)&#xD;
                  of greater than or equal to 2mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with visceral (GI and/or liver) plus skin aGVHD at prednisone (or&#xD;
                  equivalent) initiation with improvement in skin GVHD without any improvement in&#xD;
                  visceral GVHD after 7 days of primary treatment with prednisone (or equivalent)&#xD;
                  of greater than or equal to 2mg/kg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previously was treated with prednisone (or equivalent) of greater than or equal&#xD;
                  to 1mg/kg/day and aGVHD has developed in a previously uninvolved organ system&#xD;
                  Progression and no improvement are defined in the protocol. Improvement or&#xD;
                  progression in organs is determined by comparing current organ staging to staging&#xD;
                  at initiation of prednisone (or equivalent) treatment. Staging is performed per&#xD;
                  MAGIC criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of myeloid engraftment (e.g., absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal&#xD;
             to 0.5 × 109/L for 3 consecutive days if ablative therapy was previously used). Use of&#xD;
             growth factor supplementation is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients or an impartial witness (in case the patient is capable of providing verbal&#xD;
             consent but not capable of signing the informed consent form (ICF)) should have given&#xD;
             written informed consent. For patients less than 18 years of age, a written informed&#xD;
             consent of the parents or guardian and written assent of the patient will be obtained,&#xD;
             per the local requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have been diagnosed with overlap syndrome, that is, with any concurrent&#xD;
             features of cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients requiring any of the following: mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support,&#xD;
             or hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have received any systemic treatment, besides steroids, as upfront&#xD;
             treatment of aGVHD OR as treatment for SR-aGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have severe hypoalbuminemia, with an albumin of less than or equal to 1&#xD;
             g/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have a CK level of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with uncontrolled infections. Infections are considered controlled if&#xD;
             appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of enrollment, no signs of&#xD;
             progression are present. Progression of infection is defined as hemodynamic&#xD;
             instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening physical signs or&#xD;
             radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs&#xD;
             or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with evidence of relapsed, progressing or persistent malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with evidence of minimal residual disease requiring withdrawal of systemic&#xD;
             immune suppression&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components murine monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies (mAb) or Recombinant Ricin Toxin A-chain (RTA).&#xD;

             treatment until 30 days after the last infusion of T-Guard.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Male patients who are, if sexually active and with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential, unwilling to use effective birth control from start of treatment until 65&#xD;
             days after the last infusion of T-Guard.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with any condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with&#xD;
             full participation in the study, including administration of study drug and attending&#xD;
             required study visits; pose a significant risk to the patient; or interfere with&#xD;
             interpretation of study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients whose decision to participate might be unduly influenced by perceived&#xD;
             expectation of gain or harm by participation, such as patients in detention due to&#xD;
             official or legal order.&#xD;
