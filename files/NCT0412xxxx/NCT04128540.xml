  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is considered to be subjective, however in children it is believed to be felt rather&#xD;
      than expressed, because they often depend on the caregiver for their safety and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is significant pain after thoracotomy surgery because of pleural and muscular damage,&#xD;
      ribcage disruption, and intercostal nerve damage during surgery, which if not effectively&#xD;
      managed, it will lead to various systemic complications; pulmonary (atelectasis, pneumonia,&#xD;
      and stasis of bronchial secretions), cardiovascular (increased oxygen consumption and&#xD;
      tachycardia), musculoskeletal (muscle weakness), increased neuro-hormonal response and&#xD;
      prolonged hospital stay. So adequate and sufficient post-operative analgesia for paediatric&#xD;
      patients is mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of highly potent opioids for paediatric cardiac anaesthesia has gained widespread&#xD;
      popularity during the last 20 years.In addition to the important advantage of hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability, the large-dose opioid-based anaesthetic techniques also blunt the stress response,&#xD;
      However, large doses can cause oversedation, respiratory depression, and prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB), recently developed by Forero et al, is a novel technique&#xD;
      in management of thoracic neuropathic pain guided by ultrasound. It became popular because it&#xD;
      is much safer and easily administered than other alternative regional techniques as thoracic&#xD;
      paravertebral and thoracic epidural block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) performed in aortic coarcitectomy&#xD;
      operations has not been investigated yet.This has encouraged the performance of the present&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our study will be designed to estimate and compare the analgesic effect of single shot&#xD;
      erector spinae plane block in pediatric patients undergoing aortic coarcitectomy via&#xD;
      thoracotomy incision versus fentanyl infusion as the control group. Our primary outcome will&#xD;
      be the total dose of intraoperative fentanyl bouluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be achieved by using an online random number generator. Patient codes will&#xD;
      be placed into sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes by a research assistant who is&#xD;
      not involved in the study. A medical personnel not involved in patient management will be&#xD;
      responsible for opening the envelope and give the instructions contained within each envelope&#xD;
      to the anesthesiologist who is expert in doing the ESPB in patients included within the block&#xD;
      group. this expert anaesthesiologist will not be involved in collecting data but another&#xD;
      anaesthesia doctor will be responsible for patient management and collecting the&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the pediatric cardiothoracic operation theatre in Abu El Reesh&#xD;
      Pediatric Hospital -Cairo University on 28 pediatric patients aged 3 months-12 months, ASA&#xD;
      III undergoing aortic coarcitectomy (with thoracotomy incision).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will attend at the pre- anesthesia room with their parents 1 hour before the&#xD;
      procedure after taking approval of research ethical comittee and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed history from the parents will be taken followed by a full and detailed clinical&#xD;
      examination of the child then all investigations including CBC, coagulation profile, liver&#xD;
      enzymes, kidney function tests, Chest x-ray ,echocardiography and blood grouping will be&#xD;
      checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG, pulse oximetry and non-invasive blood pressure will be applied to all patients. All&#xD;
      patients will be premedicated by intramuscular midazolam 2mg/Kg and atropine 0.2 mg/Kg 20&#xD;
      minutes before induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be induced in all patients by sevoflurane 5% in 100% O2 followed by Placement&#xD;
      of peripheral I.V cannula and IV administration of fentanyl (1-2µg/kg). Oral endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation will be facilitated by IV atracurium 0.5 mg/kg and then capnogram will be&#xD;
      connected to monitor End-tidal CO2 and muscle relaxation will be maintained by atracurium&#xD;
      infusion in a dose of 0.5 mg/ kg/ hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be mechanically ventilated using pressure controlled mode with FiO2 50%,&#xD;
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O,I: E ratio of 1:2,peak inspiratory pressure&#xD;
      (PIP) will be set to deliver a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg and respiratory rate will be 15 to&#xD;
      35 cycle / minute according to the age. our aim is to keep end tidal CO2 between 30-40 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sevoflurane will be used for maintenance of anaesthesia and its MAC will be determined by&#xD;
      using bispectoral index (targeting 40-60) to standardize the depth of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After insertion of a central venous catheter and an arterial cannula , nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      temperature probe will be placed and the patient's position will be changed from supine to&#xD;
      right lateral position.&#xD;

    <description>ultrasound guided erector spinae plane block by injecting 0.4ml/kg (1:1 solution of bupivacaine 0.25% and lidocaine 1%). This will be performed at the same side of the planned thoracotomy under strict aseptic precautions.A high frequency 12 MHz linear ultrasound transducer will be placed in a longitudinal orientation 3 cm lateral to the T3 spinous process corresponding to the T2 transverse process.&#xD;
Three muscles; trapezius, rhomboids major, and erector spinae will be identified superior to the hyperechoic transverse process.&#xD;
Using in-plane approach a 25 G needle will be inserted in caudal-cephalic direction, until the tip is deep to erector spinae muscle.&#xD;
Correct needle tip location will be confirmed by injecting 3 mL of normal saline and visualizing the linear LA spread in the fascial plane between the erector spinae muscle and the transverse process..</description>
