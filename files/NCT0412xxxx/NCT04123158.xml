      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine sarcomas are rare malignant tumors arising from the mesenchymal tissues of the uterus&#xD;
      including the endometrial stroma, uterine muscle and connective tissue. They represent 1% of&#xD;
      female genital tract malignancies and 3-7% of all uterine malignances with a worldwide annual&#xD;
      incidence of 1.55-1.95 per 100.000 women. Malignant mesenchimal tumors include: uterine&#xD;
      leiomyosarcoma (LMS), endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma&#xD;
      (UUS), and other (eg adenosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, STUMP). The current WHO&#xD;
      classification also includes a smooth muscle tumor with features that preclude an unequivocal&#xD;
      diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, but do not fulfill the criteria for leiomyoma, or its variants,&#xD;
      therefore is defined as smooth uterine muscle of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP). While&#xD;
      most STUMP patients have good outcomes, unexpected aggressive behavior can be seen in some of&#xD;
      the tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean age at diagnosis is approximately 60 years old. However, uterine sarcomas have been&#xD;
      diagnosed in women as young as 20 years old . The prevalence of sarcoma in women undergoing&#xD;
      hysterectomy or myomectomy for a myometrial mass, is approximately 0.001 percent (1 in 1000)&#xD;
      (Parker 94), with a range from 0.005 (1 in 2000) to 0.28 percent (1 in 352). , The&#xD;
      discrimination between benign and malignant myometrial lesions is clinically relevant to plan&#xD;
      the optimal management (surgery versus medical treatment) and to define the most appropriate&#xD;
      surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the diagnosis of uterine sarcomas or STUMP is a challenge and no validated clinical&#xD;
      or radiological criteria can accurately distinguish benign from malignant myometrial tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, data on the ultrasound features of uterine sarcomas are scarce and they are&#xD;
      mainly based on retrospective case series. The role of CT(Computed Tomography) has generally&#xD;
      been limited to identify extrauterine disease, including local spread within the pelvis and&#xD;
      metastatic disease. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) )represents an accurate diagnostic&#xD;
      imaging modality in the assessment of gynecological pathologies with high soft tissue&#xD;
      contrast, large field-of-view and multiplanar imaging capabilities; however, no accurate&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria have been validated to discriminate between benign and malignant&#xD;
      myometrial lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no large prospective studies have been carried on to assess a&#xD;
      diagnostic algorithm to predict the malignant histology of myometrial lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to evaluate the accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) of &quot;Positive Orange&#xD;
      Criteria&quot; category in predicting uterine sarcoma and STUMP in the population of patients with&#xD;
      &gt; 3 cm myometrial lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the clinical history of patients with myometrial lesions, assessed on&#xD;
           ultrasound, and conservatively managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the accuracy of subjective assessment of an experienced ultrasound examiner in&#xD;
           detecting uterine sarcomas and STUMP in women with at least one &gt;3 cm myometrial lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare clinical and ultrasound characteristics of patients with benign myometrial&#xD;
           lesion versus those with uterine sarcomas and STUMP, histologically confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare clinical and Magnetic Resonance (MR) characteristics of patients with benign&#xD;
           myometrial lesions versus those with uterine sarcomas and STUMP, histologically&#xD;
           confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the accuracy of the subjective assessment of an ultrasound examiner versus&#xD;
           that of a MR reader in detecting uterine sarcomas and STUMP in women triaged for surgery&#xD;
           (&quot;Orange group&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of study: Monocentric, prospective, observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Setting: Department of Woman and Child Health, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.&#xD;
           Gemelli, IRCSS, Roma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated study period: Three years for the enrollment and additional two years for the&#xD;
           completion of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is dimensioned on the hypothesis that &quot;Positive Orange criteria&quot; category has a&#xD;
      sensitivity of at least 90% in identify patients with uterine sarcoma and STUMP among&#xD;
      patients with at least one &gt;3 cm myometrial lesion, against a null hypothesis of 65% [143].&#xD;
      Considering the prevalence of uterine sarcoma in this population 1.55%, as per our previous&#xD;
      experience, to demonstrate an increase in sensitivity of 25% with a 90% power and bilateral&#xD;
      alpha error=5%, 2000 patients (with at least one ≥ 3 cm myometrial lesion) with 30 sarcomas&#xD;
      are needed. Considering a 15% of drop-out (patients evaluated but not completing the&#xD;
      observation), 2353 patients will be enrolled. With this number of patients, the study will&#xD;
      have 100% power in demonstrating a similar increase in the specificity of the &quot;Positive&#xD;
      Orange criteria&quot; category with an alpha error=0.05. (PASS v11)&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDENTIFICATION PARAMETERS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A myometrial lesion with the largest diameter &gt;3 cm represents the target lesion. In case of&#xD;
      multiple myometrial lesions with similar ultrasound morphology, the largest tumor will be&#xD;
      selected as target lesion. In case of multiple myometrial lesions with different ultrasound&#xD;
      morphology, the &quot;target lesion&quot; will be identified by the ultrasound examiner on the basis of&#xD;
      the parameters subjectively considered suspicious for malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient may choose not to take part in this study. The patient may choose to have US&#xD;
      revaluation or surgery without enrolling in this study. The patient may choose to receive&#xD;
      other therapy, if available. In all cases, the woman receive appropriate medical care,&#xD;
      including treatment for bleeding, pain or other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women enrolled in the study will be managed according to the following algorithm (Figure&#xD;
      1. Clinical and Diagnostic Algorithm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed by a Green Card (Figure 2. Green Card) to check the eventual&#xD;
      presence of at least one of the following clinical and/or ultrasound characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum size of the lesion ≥ 5cm;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms (abdominal and/or pelvic pain, sensation of pressure, abdominal distension,&#xD;
           infertility (&gt;12 months), two or more abortions;&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Irregular cystic areas;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Color Score 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If no Green Card criteria is fulfilled (Negative Green Criteria), the patient will&#xD;
                receive an annual telephone follow up for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If one or more Green Card criteria is present (Positive Green Criteria), a&#xD;
                dedicated clinical and ultrasound paper form (Appendix 1. MYLUNAR Paper Form) will&#xD;
                be fulfilled in order to check the presence of the criteria described in the Orange&#xD;
                Card (Figure 3. Orange Card):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anamnestic and clinical characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Symptoms (abnormal uterine bleeding; abdominal and/or pelvic pain; sensation of&#xD;
                pressure; Abdominal distension)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) &gt; 250 UI/L (if known)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maximum size of the lesion ≥ 8cm&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Absence of acoustic shadow&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Color Score 4&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;Cooked&quot; aspect&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If at least two Orange Card criteria (including at least one ultrasound&#xD;
                     parameter) are present (Positive Orange Criteria), the patient will be&#xD;
                     examined by means of Magnetic Resonance (MRI) within 30 days and triaged to&#xD;
                     surgery (to be performed within 60 days since the enrollment in the study). A&#xD;
                     dedicated MRI paper form will be fulfilled (Appendix 2. MRI Paper Form)&#xD;
                     Histology of the target myometrial lesion will be considered as the gold&#xD;
                     standard parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  In case of &quot;negative Orange Criteria&quot; (i.e. no Orange Card criteria, or only&#xD;
                     one Orange Card criteria, or only Orange clinical criteria) the patient will&#xD;
                     be scheduled for longitudinal follow up at 6, 12 and 24 months. At each&#xD;
                     follow-up visit, a transvaginal ultrasound examination will be performed&#xD;
                     (using the MYLUNAR Paper Form) and the patient will be re-evaluated according&#xD;
                     to the Orange Card. In case of &quot;positive Orange Criteria&quot; the patient will be&#xD;
                     triaged to MRI and surgery. Eventual treatment for the myometrial lesion&#xD;
                     during the study period will be recorded and the outcome of these patients&#xD;
                     will be described separately.&#xD;
