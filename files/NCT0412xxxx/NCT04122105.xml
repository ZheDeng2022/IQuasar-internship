      Ischemia-reperfusion (IRI) injuries are common in renal transplantation and cause poor&#xD;
      patient outcomes. Ischemia occurs after the donor's death and reperfusion occurs after kidney&#xD;
      implantation. The donor kidney undergoes warm ischemia (WIT) after blood circulation stops&#xD;
      and cold ischemia (CIT) when subjected to cold storage during transportation. Decreased blood&#xD;
      flow leads to waste product accumulation and cellular damage. During reperfusion, reactive&#xD;
      oxygen radicals and inflammatory processes further damage the kidney. PDE5 inhibitors&#xD;
      increase renal blood flow and could protect the kidney during transplantation. Our study&#xD;
      assesses the utility of giving these drugs perioperatively to reduce the effects of IRI&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

      1. Purpose Renal ischemia-reperfusion injuries (IRI) are the result of multifactorial&#xD;
           mechanisms. During ischemia, the kidney is subject to reduced blood flow, oxygen&#xD;
           delivery, and nutrients. This leads to the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products&#xD;
           (i.e. creatinine and blood urea nitrogen) that can lead to cellular damage, depending on&#xD;
           the extent and duration of the ischemia. Moreover, when the kidney is reperfused there&#xD;
           is additional damage caused by reactive oxygen radicals and inflammatory processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IRI is a common feature in the presentation of a diverse range of presentations: trauma,&#xD;
           shock, sepsis, renal transplantation, cardiovascular surgery, partial nephrectomy, and&#xD;
           other urologic complications. Moreover, IRI of the kidney specifically can lead to acute&#xD;
           kidney injury (AKI), acute renal failure (ARF), and subsequent chronic renal failure. In&#xD;
           the context of renal transplantation, IRI is associated with primary nonfunction,&#xD;
           delayed graft failure, increased acute rejection, and allograft dysfunction. It has been&#xD;
           postulated that interventions designed at increasing vasodilation during early&#xD;
           reperfusion could reduce the effects of IRI through improving blood flow to the&#xD;
           transplanted kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, like sildenafil citrate (Viagra) and tadalafil,&#xD;
           are drugs generally used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) and pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
           These drugs prevent the breakdown of nitric oxide (NO) by increasing levels of cyclic&#xD;
           guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Besides causing smooth muscle relaxation and systemic&#xD;
           vasodilation, NO and cGMP are both believed to help reduce the extent of IRI. NO has&#xD;
           protective vasodilatory effects; while cGMP is an important mediator in the body that&#xD;
           causes neutrophil degranulation, inhibits platelet aggregation, regulates intracellular&#xD;
           calcium levels, and opens mitochondrial K+ATP channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A number of different studies have been undertaken that support the use of PDE5&#xD;
           inhibitors as a pretreatment to prevent IRI in kidneys. In particular, sildenafil's&#xD;
           antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties have been shown to be&#xD;
           renoprotective in some renal injury models. However, the majority of literature is based&#xD;
           from animal studies; there is very little information about the clinical use of PDE5&#xD;
           inhibitors during human kidney transplantation. Previous studies have proven that these&#xD;
           drugs are safe for impotent males with significant comorbidities, including those on&#xD;
           dialysis and those who underwent kidney transplants (&gt;6 months post-op). They have also&#xD;
           proven that sildenafil does not affect immunosuppressive drugs (i.e. tacrolimus and&#xD;
           cyclosporine), despite these drugs sharing a common elimination pathway; Tacrolimus'&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics, trough levels, and half-life are not significantly changed when&#xD;
           administered with sildenafil. However, tacrolimus does change the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
           (increase in Cmax and half-life) of sildenafil when both are administered together.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These studies prove that PDE5 inhibitors are renoprotective, generally well-tolerated,&#xD;
           and do not impact immunosuppressants. However, what they have not shown is the effect of&#xD;
           PDE5 inhibitors administered early in human kidney transplantation and their effect on&#xD;
           the transplanted kidney. Our study will try to amend this by looking at utility of&#xD;
           perioperative administration of sildenafil in early effects on the transplanted&#xD;
           allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis A.) PDE5 inhibitors given perioperatively will decrease ischemia reperfusion&#xD;
           injury and lead to consequently improved function in the transplanted kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification In 2018, 133 transplants were performed by the Vancouver General Hospital&#xD;
           (VGH) Kidney Transplant program. 38 of these kidneys were from living donors (LD), while&#xD;
           the remaining 95 were cadaveric donations. This data supports that the majority of renal&#xD;
           transplants are done using kidneys from deceased donors (DD) as opposed to LDs. However,&#xD;
           the quality of these donated organs can vary drastically and DD organs are more likely&#xD;
           to have poorer outcomes relative to LD. This is because the DD kidney undergoes warm&#xD;
           ischemia (WIT) after the blood circulation is stopped and then cold ischemia (CIT) when&#xD;
           subjected to hypothermic conditions meant to preserve the organ. The combined effects of&#xD;
           WIT and CIT inflict cellular damage and may impair renal blood flow to cause primary&#xD;
           renal dysfunction, delayed graft failure, increased acute rejection, and allograft&#xD;
           dysfunction. Increased renal perfusion in this critical phase through vasodilation may&#xD;
           counteract some of these negative effects of procurement and implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is a lot of heterogeneity among DD kidneys due to the exact cause of the donor's&#xD;
           death. Donation after circulatory death (DCD), as opposed to donation after brain death&#xD;
           (DBD), kidney transplants have a higher chance of delayed graft function (DGF). DGF is&#xD;
           defined as needing dialysis in the first week of transplant. This is common in marginal&#xD;
           donor organs such as DCD or extended criteria (ECD) cadaveric transplants and can&#xD;
           predispose to slow graft function or delayed graft function, which themselves are&#xD;
           associated with increased rates of acute rejection and poorer outcomes. Our study aims&#xD;
           to look at both DCD and DBD transplants to determine if PDE5 inhibitors can positively&#xD;
           impact graft function of DD kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objective A) To measure the utility of perioperative administration of PDE5 inhibitors&#xD;
           in kidney transplant recipients (RTRs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research Design DRUG CHOICE Sildenafil has the longest safety record of the PDE5&#xD;
           inhibitors. Moreover, it is shown to have a more potent effect in IRI studies. A dose of&#xD;
           50mg twice a day is the standard dose given to patients with Erectile Dysfunction (ED).&#xD;
&#xD;
           METHOD A patient who has given written informed consent will be given a randomly&#xD;
           generated subject ID that is not derived from any aspect of their personally identifying&#xD;
           information, nor details regarding their operation. This subject ID will be stored on a&#xD;
           master list alongside their personal health number to serve as a unique method of&#xD;
           identifying patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will randomly be assigned to either the control (no PDE5 inhibitor) or the&#xD;
           intervention (sildenafil) group. The control group will receive standard care. The&#xD;
           intervention group will receive standard care in all capacities with the exception of&#xD;
           sildenafil administration. The first dose (50mg) will be given 1-hour prior to the&#xD;
           surgery. Patients will be given Sildenafil twice daily up to 3 days post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be collected and stored on an encrypted, office-only hard drive. Information&#xD;
           on demographics (gender, ethnicity, age, etc.) and postoperative results (kidney&#xD;
           function, all cause 90-day perioperative morbidity and mortality, postoperative&#xD;
           complications, and length of stay in hospital) will be recorded for all patients on an&#xD;
           password protected Excel file.&#xD;
&#xD;
           OUTCOMES Outcomes including intraoperative, postoperative and 90 day followup will be&#xD;
           assessed. Intraoperative: xxxx, xxxx, xxx, xxx. Postoperative: kidney function, all&#xD;
           cause 90-day perioperative outcomes including xxxx, xxx, xxx, xxx. Time zero biopsies&#xD;
           are done as routine and will likewise be taken into account. Kidney Function will be&#xD;
           determined through daily bloodwork while an inpatient, and twice a week for the first 4&#xD;
           weeks, once a week from weeks 5-8, and then every 2 weeks from weeks 9-12. This is the&#xD;
           standard of care follow-up in the Program. All information is normally collected for&#xD;
           transplant patients on this schedule and no extra time or discomfort will be required on&#xD;
           the part of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical Analysis This study will use the Chi square method to analyze categorical&#xD;
           data and the t-test between groups to analyze continuous variable. A P-value &lt; 0.05 will&#xD;
           be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, he investigators propose n=100 with 50/50 split between patients undergoing&#xD;
      DCD and DBD transplants and a 1:1 split in the control and experimental arms. Therefore,&#xD;
      there will be 25 patients in each of the following arms: DCD experimental, DCD control, DBD&#xD;
      experimental, and DBD control. The VGH Kidney transplant program completed 133 transplants in&#xD;
      2018. Out of this, 95 were cadaveric transplants. Assuming similar numbers in the future with&#xD;
      50% of the recipients participating, it will take about 2 years to accrue the data needed for&#xD;
      adequate statistical analysis.&#xD;
