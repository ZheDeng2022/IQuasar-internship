  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder associated with intense fear of weight gain, food&#xD;
      refusal, and severe weight loss. AN has the highest mortality rate among the psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders; however, little is known about biomarkers, and no medication has been approved for&#xD;
      AN. Many individuals only partially recover, and treatment options, especially for the&#xD;
      psychological components of the illness, are not very effective, highlighting the need for&#xD;
      more effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain reward pathways have a direct impact on the drive to eat, and a variety of neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies have suggested altered reward processing in AN. The neurotransmitter dopamine has a&#xD;
      central role in the reward circuitry to drive food approach, and the dynamic interplay&#xD;
      between dopamine receptor response and food restriction could have implications for the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of AN. Dopamine-related brain function has been studied indirectly using&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) and tasks that deliver reward stimuli&#xD;
      unexpectedly, that elicit the so-called prediction error (PE) response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in AN showed repeatedly altered PE processing suggesting altered dopamine circuit&#xD;
      function in the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dopamine and PE response have also been associated with altered reversal learning, which has&#xD;
      important treatment implication for AN as reversal learning is impaired in the disorder and&#xD;
      modulation of the dopamine system could improve treatment.&#xD;
