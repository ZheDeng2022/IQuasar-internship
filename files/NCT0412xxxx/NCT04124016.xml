    <textblock>
      Flavan-3-ols are the main source of flavonoids in Western diets. They are characteristic&#xD;
      compounds of tea, cocoa, wine, apple, pears, etc. In plant-based foods, they occur as simple&#xD;
      monomers or as oligomers and polymers of up to 50 units (also known as proanthocyanidins or&#xD;
      condensed tannins). When ingested, both monomeric and high molecular weight flavan-3-ols are&#xD;
      poorly absorbed and metabolized in the first gastrointestinal tract, reaching the colon and&#xD;
      becoming a suitable substrate for the local microbiota. These compounds undergo an extensive&#xD;
      microbial metabolism leading to the formation of hydroxyphenyl-γ- valerolactones (PVLs),&#xD;
      which are then absorbed by colonocytes before reaching the liver and being converted into&#xD;
      phase II conjugated metabolites. Since the microbiota composition varies among individuals,&#xD;
      it results in differences in the production of PVLs and, consequently, the health effects of&#xD;
      flavan-3-ols might change at an individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another factor of variability might be due to a different asset in the fermentation of&#xD;
      indigestible dietary carbohydrates, which are known to modify colonic pH through the&#xD;
      production of short-chain fatty acids and may result in different profiles of gas production&#xD;
      (i.e. hydrogen and methane), possibly affecting the bioconversion of flavan-3-ols as well.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, these multiple variabilities are poorly understood to date.&#xD;

      The study will be a single-dose, partially randomized, cross-over design, with 4 consecutive&#xD;
      treatments. The study includes 4 phases where each volunteer will consume a specific dose of&#xD;
      one of the products chosen for the study. Each volunteer will consume each product once, for&#xD;
      a total of 4 different occasions. The products will be a food extract consisting of chicory&#xD;
      fermentable fiber (inulin) fractions followed by three food extracts rich in a different type&#xD;
      of flavan-3-ols, consumed at three different occasions and in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be asked to provide once a fecal sample, taken from the first daily&#xD;
      defecation, which will be analyzed for fecal microbiota composition. They will also undergo a&#xD;
      Breath gases day profile in order to evaluate the effect of inulin consumption on colonic&#xD;
      fermentation and breath-gases production. These two analyses (fecal samples microbial&#xD;
      composition and breath-gases production) will serve to characterize the volunteers' gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition and functionality. In detail, during the 48-h before the fecal and&#xD;
      breath samples collections, volunteers will be asked to avoid a high level of fiber and&#xD;
      (poly)phenols (to facilitate adherence to the dietary restrictions, a list of permitted and&#xD;
      forbidden foods will be supplied. To check dietary compliance, a 2- days dietary record of&#xD;
      the 2 days prior to each sampling day will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The morning of the first treatment, volunteers will arrive, after an overnight fast, and they&#xD;
      will deliver the fresh fecal sample. After that, one sample of forced end-expiratory samples&#xD;
      of alveolar air will be collected. Then, they will be given a standardized test breakfast&#xD;
      consisting of 12 g of food extract of chicory inulin fractions dissolved into 250 g water and&#xD;
      a fermentable fiber-free, (poly)phenol-free, nutritionally-balanced solid meal. They will be&#xD;
      asked to consume the entire breakfast within 15 minutes. At hourly intervals for 11 hours&#xD;
      after breakfast, forced end-expiratory samples of alveolar air will be collected. During the&#xD;
      whole test, all subjects will refrain from smoking, sleeping, exercising and eating foods or&#xD;
      meals other than the ones provided by the staff. Five hours after starting the test,&#xD;
      volunteers will eat a fermentable fiber-free nutritionally-balanced standardized lunch&#xD;
      provided by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, on three distinct occasions and with one-week wash-out between different&#xD;
      treatments, each participant will randomly consume a dose of flavan-3-ol rich extracts. Each&#xD;
      test day, participants, after fasting baseline urine collection, will receive the dose of one&#xD;
      of the food extract rich in flavan-3-ols (1 mmol of PVL precursors) dissolved into 200 mL of&#xD;
      water. Then, the same standardized breakfast (pre-packaged (poly)phenol-free snack) will be&#xD;
      provided to subjects. After breakfast, volunteers will be allowed to leave and to perform the&#xD;
      successive urine collections on their own. Urine samples will be collected at selected&#xD;
      intervals of time along the 24 h following the extract ingestion. In addition, urine sampling&#xD;
      will continue in a subgroup of volunteers for the successive 24 h to evaluate the evolution&#xD;
      of metabotypes from 24 to 48h. This subgroup will be composed of the first 30 participants&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to follow a (poly)phenol-poor diet 48-h before each test day and while&#xD;
      sampling (to facilitate adherence to the dietary restrictions, a list of permitted and&#xD;
      forbidden foods will be supplied; to check dietary compliance, a 3/4-days dietary record of&#xD;
      the 2 days prior to each sampling day and of the sampling day(s), depending on the subgroup&#xD;
      the subject belongs to, will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of all treatments, and on the basis of the results of gas samples analysis, one&#xD;
      subgroup of methane producer volunteers (number=5) and one of non-methane producers&#xD;
      (numnber=5) will be asked to provide one further faecal sample, taken from the first daily&#xD;
      defecation for In Vitro analysis of short-chain fatty acids and gas production after&#xD;
      incubation with different mixes of Inulin and Polyphenols used during the In Vivo part of the&#xD;
      study . Volunteers will be asked to follow a diet poor in (poly)phenols and fermentable fiber&#xD;
      for 2 days before fecal donation.&#xD;
