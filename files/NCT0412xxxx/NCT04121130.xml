  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focused shockwaves are generated electrically, either within the applicator (electrohydraulic&#xD;
      technique), or externally to it in the focal zone (electromagnetic or piezoelectric&#xD;
      techniques), and then propagate to a designated focal point in order to treat it. Most&#xD;
      research in shockwave therapy has focused on understanding the mechanism which results in the&#xD;
      establishment of a mechano-sensitive feedback loop between the acoustic impulse and the&#xD;
      stimulated cells, and involves specific transduction pathways and gene expression. Taking as&#xD;
      valid the current physiopathological hypothesis of myofascial pain (MPS) and considering the&#xD;
      mechanotransduction effect of ESWT in other diseases, it could be posited that ESWT in MPS&#xD;
      may increase perfusion, promote angiogenesis and alter the pain signaling in ischaemic&#xD;
      tissues caused by the influx of calcium. On the other hand, recent articles have demonstrated&#xD;
      that free nerve endings degenerate after the application of ESWT, and that ESWT produces a&#xD;
      transient dysfunction of nerve excitability at the neuromuscular junction, by bringing about&#xD;
      the degeneration of AChR. Finally, following a pure mechanistic approach, shockwaves might be&#xD;
      able to break-up the Actine-myosin links, as they are propagating perpendicularly to the&#xD;
      sarcomere contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: To obtain pain relief and improvement in functional and quality of life&#xD;
      scales, by performing 3 ESWT sessions, 1 per week (0,10 mJ/mm2; 2000 impulses; 5 Hz) in the&#xD;
      most painful tender and/or trigger points of the upper trapezius muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To analyze the effectiveness of Focused Shockwave Treatment in myofascial&#xD;
      pain of the upper trapezius muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blind randomized clinical trial that will be conducted in Quirónsalud&#xD;
      Barcelona, Spain. The study will enroll 60 patients suffering of myofascial pain of the upper&#xD;
      trapezius muscle over a 5-months period. The overall duration of the trial will be&#xD;
      approximately 8 months. The trial will end when the last subject has the last visit, at 12&#xD;
      weeks (3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol calls for 7 visits to be performed over a 12-weeks period for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 60 patients suffering of myofascial pain of the upper trapezius&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Assignment Procedures i. Randomization Procedures: The investigators will use block&#xD;
      randomization, which is commonly used in the two treatment situations where the samples of&#xD;
      the two treatments must be equal or equally equal. The process will involve recruiting&#xD;
      participants in short blocks and ensuring that half of the participants within each block are&#xD;
      assigned to &quot;A&quot; and the other half to &quot;B&quot;. Within each block, however, the order of patients&#xD;
      will be random. The patients will be considered blocks of four dimensions: 1. AABB, 2. ABAB,&#xD;
      3. ABBA, 4. BAAB, 5. BABA, 6. BBAA. The investigators will randomly select between these six&#xD;
      different blocks for each group of four recruited participants. The random selection will be&#xD;
      done using a list of random numbers generated using statistical software (Excel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Masking Procedures: The participants will be blinded to the type of ESWT treatment and&#xD;
      the assessor, data managers, statistician and study monitors will be blinded to the&#xD;
      allocation. All participants who receive ESWT treatment will be treated using the same device&#xD;
      (Duolith® SD-1 STORZ Medical, Switzerland) regardless of what group patients are included in.&#xD;
      The participants will not be able to predict the allocated group based on the appearance of&#xD;
      the ESWT treatment. The blinding will be maintained until the data are locked. For blinding&#xD;
      evaluation, allocation guessing will be assessed immediately after the final treatment.&#xD;
      Practitioners and assessors will be instructed to treat the participants according to&#xD;
      predefined standard operating procedures during the trial to maintain blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering of myofascial pain of the upper trapezius muscle, will be selected for&#xD;
      this study, sign up for an informed consent form, informed about the details of the procedure&#xD;
      and the potential risks before treatment and randomized into 2 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A (F-ESWT group): 3 sessions, one per week, of focused extracorporeal shockwave&#xD;
           treatment (2000 impulses at 0.10 mJ/mm2 per session).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (placebo group): 3 sessions, one per week, of sham focused extracorporeal&#xD;
           shockwave treatment (2000 impulses at 0.01 mJ/mm2 per session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatments will be performed by the senior authors. In all cases, a focused&#xD;
      electromagnetic shockwave device will be used (Duolith® SD-1, STORZ Medical, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed with the patient in sitting position, while the patient is&#xD;
      lying in a pillow. The treatment area will be prepared with a coupling ultrasound gel to&#xD;
      minimize the loss of shockwave energy at the interface between the tip of the applicator and&#xD;
      the skin. No local anesthesia will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment protocol All patients will receive a specific exercise protocol that includes&#xD;
      home exercises and ergonomic indications to prevent an exacerbation of upper trapezius&#xD;
      myofascial pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algometric Evaluation (PA): Pressure algometry [PA] is employed for quantification of&#xD;
      tenderness in diagnosis of tender spots, trigger points, fibromyalgia and muscle spasm. The&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold [PPT], i.e., the minimum pressure that induces pain or discomfort&#xD;
      expresses the degree of sensitization affecting the nerve fibers by sensitizing substances.&#xD;
      It offers the possibility to make a quantification of tenderness in myofascial and other&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): The visual analogue scale (VAS) is considered to be one of the&#xD;
      best methods available for the estimation of the intensity of pain. The VAS provides a&#xD;
      continuous scale for magnitude estimation and consists of a straight line, the ends of which&#xD;
      are defined in terms of the extreme limits of pain experience. Respondents mark the location&#xD;
      on the 10-centimeter line corresponding to the amount of pain experienced. This gives the&#xD;
      greatest freedom to choose pain's exact intensity. It also gives the maximum opportunity for&#xD;
      each respondent to express a personal response style. VAS data of this type is recorded as&#xD;
      the number of millimeters from the left of the line with the range 0-100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roles and Maudsley (RM): The RM scale is a subjective 4-point patient assessment of pain and&#xD;
      limitations of activity.30 The RM score has been used extensively at centers throughout the&#xD;
      world to assess outcome after SWT. On the scale, 1 point indicates an excellent result with&#xD;
      the patient having no symptoms. Two points indicate a good result with the patient&#xD;
      significantly improved from the pretreatment condition and satisfied with the result. Three&#xD;
      points indicate a fair result with the patient somewhat improved from the pretreatment&#xD;
      condition and partially satisfied with the treatment outcome. Four points indicate a poor&#xD;
      outcome with symptoms identical or worse than the pretreatment condition and dissatisfaction&#xD;
      with the treatment result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L): The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of&#xD;
      health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health&#xD;
      for clinical and economic appraisal. It is a simple questionnaire designed for completion by&#xD;
      the person being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EuroQol five dimensions VAS (EQ-5D-3L VAS): The EQ-5D VAS is a standardized measure of global&#xD;
      health status, defined trough a scale from 0 (worst health status) from 100 (best health&#xD;
      status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likert scale (1-6): Degree of recovery compared with baseline, measured on a 6-point Likert&#xD;
      scale (completely recovered to much worse). Success rates will be calculated by dichotomizing&#xD;
      responses. Subjects who will report themselves completely recovered or much improved will be&#xD;
      counted as successes, and subjects who will report themselves somewhat improved, same, worse,&#xD;
      or much worse will be counted as failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;

      ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ethical Standard: This clinical study was designed and shall be conducted and reported&#xD;
           in accordance with the International Conference for Harmonization (ICH) Harmonized&#xD;
           Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations&#xD;
           (including European Directive 2001/20/EC), and with the ethical principles laid down in&#xD;
           the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Independent Ethics Committee: The protocol, informed consent form, recruitment&#xD;
           materials, and all subject materials will be submitted to an Independent Ethics&#xD;
           Committee (IEC) in each center for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol&#xD;
           and the consent form must be obtained before any subject is enrolled. The implementation&#xD;
           of any change in the protocol will not be permitted until the principal investigator and&#xD;
           the IEC have provided written approval of the change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed Consent Process: Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the&#xD;
           individual agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout study&#xD;
           participation. An extensive discussion of the risks and possible benefits of study&#xD;
           participation will be held with the subjects. A consent form describing in detail the&#xD;
           study procedures and risks will be given to the subject. Consent forms will be&#xD;
           IEC-approved, and the subject is required to read and review the document or have the&#xD;
           document read to him or her. The investigator or designee will explain the research&#xD;
           study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise. The subject will sign the&#xD;
           informed consent document prior to any study-related assessments or procedures. Subjects&#xD;
           will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with their families and take all the&#xD;
           time patients need prior to agreeing to participate. The patients may withdraw consent&#xD;
           at any time throughout the course of the study. A copy of the signed informed consent&#xD;
           document will be given to the subjects for their records. The rights and welfare of the&#xD;
           subjects will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their clinical&#xD;
           care will not be adversely affected if the subjects decline to participate in this&#xD;
           study. The consent process will be documented in the clinical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subject Confidentiality: Subject confidentiality shall be guaranteed at all times by the&#xD;
           investigators, study staff, and the sponsor and their delegates. The study protocol,&#xD;
           documentation, data, and all other information generated will be strictly confidential.&#xD;
           No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized&#xD;
           third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all study&#xD;
      documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not&#xD;
      limited to the medical records of the study subjects. The clinical study site will permit&#xD;
      access to such records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING All study data are to be recorded on a database. All patient&#xD;
      data shall be reported on the database in an anonymous fashion, the patient only being&#xD;
      identified by the patient number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will be responsible for the completeness, accuracy and timeliness of the&#xD;
      data reported. All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure&#xD;
      the accurate interpretation of data. The Investigator is required to verify the data&#xD;
      transcribed onto the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study monitors then have to check the database against the source documents for accuracy&#xD;
      and validity as per the monitoring schedule, as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Data Management Responsibilities Data collection and accurate documentation are the&#xD;
      responsibility of the study staff under the supervision of the investigator. All source&#xD;
      documents and laboratory reports must be reviewed by Site staff and data entry staff, who&#xD;
      will ensure that they are accurate and complete. Unanticipated problems and adverse events&#xD;
      must be reviewed by the investigator or designee.&#xD;
