  <brief_summary>

      Pancreas graft quality directly affects morbidity and mortality rates after pancreas&#xD;
      transplantation (PTx). The criteria for pancreas graft allocation are restricted, which has&#xD;
      decreased the number of available organs. Suitable pancreatic allografts are selected based&#xD;
      on donor demographics, medical history, and the transplant surgeon's assessment of organ&#xD;
      quality during procurement. Quality is assessed based on macroscopic appearance, which is&#xD;
      biased by individual experience and personal skills. Therefore, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the histopathological quality of unallocated pancreas organs to determine how many&#xD;
      unallocated organs are of suitable quality for PTx, based on histopathologic evaluations. The&#xD;
      reasons for allocation rejection will be reported and the correlation between cause of&#xD;
      allocation rejection and histopathological quality of the allocated organ will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter cross-sectional explorative study. The demographic data and medical&#xD;
      history of donor and cause of rejection of the allocation of graft will be recorded. Organs&#xD;
      of included donors will be explanted and macroscopic features such as weight, color, size,&#xD;
      and stiffness will be recorded. A tissue sample of the organ will be fixed for further&#xD;
      microscopic assessments. Histopathologic assessments will be reported 6 hours (or at time of&#xD;
      organ delivery if later than 6 hours), 9 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours, and 18 hours after&#xD;
      procurement. 100 pancreases will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;

      With advances in surgery and immunosuppressive therapy, PTx has become an accepted and&#xD;
      standardized therapeutic surgery worldwide. Today, PTx is a promising treatment for type 1&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and for patients undergoing total pancreatectomy because of benign disease.&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that PTx can provide a good glycemic control and insulin&#xD;
      independence and improve diabetic lesions including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and&#xD;
      vasculopathy. Furthermore, thanks to improved immunosuppressive agents, prophylaxis against&#xD;
      infections and thrombosis, and modifications in surgical approaches, outcomes after whole&#xD;
      organ PTx has consistently improved over the past 20 years. The 1- and 5-year patient&#xD;
      survival rates after PTx are approximately 95% and 85%, respectively, and the 1-, and 5-year&#xD;
      graft survival rates are 90%, and 70%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity and mortality still occurs after PTx. Morbidity and mortality rates after PTx are&#xD;
      mainly related to pancreas graft quality. To decrease these, some restricted criteria for&#xD;
      pancreas graft allocation have been defined. However, these allocation criteria have&#xD;
      decreased the overall availability of pancreas organs. Consequently, despite an increase in&#xD;
      organs from deceased donors, organ utilization (20% of all potential donor pancreases are&#xD;
      ultimately used for whole organ transplantation) and also PTx rates (10% overall decline)&#xD;
      have decreased. In the US, only 13% of deceased donors provide a pancreas that is utilized&#xD;
      for transplantation. Data from Eurotransplant indicate that only 27% of donor pancreases are&#xD;
      transplanted, either as whole pancreas grafts or as islet grafts. In addition to the&#xD;
      restricted pancreas allocation criteria, some allocated/offered organs are not accepted by&#xD;
      transplant surgeons (which is biased by individual experience and personal skills) after an&#xD;
      organ quality assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longer waiting lists, increased waiting times, and donor shortages have increased the need&#xD;
      for and number of extended donor criteria organs that are accepted for transplantation. To&#xD;
      date, the most important selection criteria to identify suitable pancreatic allografts are&#xD;
      donor demographics, donor medical history (age, gender, cause of death, etc.), and the&#xD;
      transplant surgeon's own organ quality assessment based on macroscopic appearance. However,&#xD;
      it is unclear, whether unallocated organs have a poor histopathologic quality for&#xD;
      transplantation. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic histopathologic quality&#xD;
      assessment of unallocated pancreas grafts has been performed, so far. In this study, for the&#xD;
      first time, the histopathological quality of unallocated pancreas organs from brain-dead&#xD;
      donors will be assessed to determine the number of unallocated organs that were potentially&#xD;
      suitable for transplantation.&#xD;
