  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifth metatarsal stress fracture is a failure of a healthy metatarsal bone subject to&#xD;
      repetitive microdamages. It has a high prevalence in soccer players and is classified as a&#xD;
      high-risk stress fracture. Based on Torg classification, the treatment options may be&#xD;
      conservative or surgical. The recent increase of evidences about Shock Wave Treatment in&#xD;
      different bone pathologies, including stress fractures, suggests the possibility to use this&#xD;
      conservative intervention option also in patients candidate for surgery. This randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial included 18 soccer players diagnosed of proximal fifth metatarsal stress&#xD;
      fracture, randomly matched in Surgery group and Shock Wave group. Patients of Surgery group&#xD;
      were treated with intramedullary screw fixation; patients of Shock Wave group received 3&#xD;
      weekly sessions of Focused Shock Wave Treatment (F-ESWT), using an electrohydraulic device&#xD;
      set to an energy flux density (EFD) of 0.21 mJ/mm2 and 2000 impulses. Patients of both groups&#xD;
      were followed monthly until their return to play (RTP) using radiography, Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale (VAS), Tegner Activity Level Scale and AOFAS score.&#xD;

    <description>Tegner activity scale grades the daily life activities and recreational and professional sports practice. A score of 0 represents sick leave or disability pension because of knee problems, whereas a score of 10 corresponds to participation in national and international elite competitive sports &gt;6 score can only be achieved if the person participates in recreational or competitive sport.</description>
