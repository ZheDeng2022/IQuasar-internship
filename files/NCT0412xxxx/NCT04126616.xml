    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent pulmonary disease&#xD;
      providing major morbidity and mortality. Bronchial obstruction is the cornerstone in&#xD;
      assessment of the disease whereas associated pulmonary vascular disease remains poorly known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving knowledge on pulmonary vascular adaptive skills in COPD patients could allow for&#xD;
      better understanding disease exacerbations, evolution towards chronic pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (PH) and therapeutics to be offered to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an innovative and non-invasive tool capable of pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular evaluation. This work aims at identifying pulmonary vascular impairment in COPD&#xD;
      patients using functional MRI.&#xD;

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent pulmonary disease&#xD;
      providing major morbidity and mortality. Bronchial obstruction is the cornerstone in&#xD;
      assessment of the disease whereas associated pulmonary vascular disease remains poorly known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it has been shown that emphysema, frequently observed in COPD, contains major&#xD;
      vascular lesions. Alteration of pulmonary vascularisation have been found during exacerbation&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it is well established that such vascular lesions form the substrate for&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction, expressed as an impairment of vascular adaptation during exercise,&#xD;
      and evolving towards chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH). Owing to its severe effects on the&#xD;
      right-sided heart, it signs a pejorative turn in patients' survival and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, COPD patients' phenotypes are very heterogeneous and the clinical response to PH&#xD;
      treatments is variable; while some get a benefit, others are counter-indicated due to adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving knowledge on pulmonary vascular adaptive skills in COPD patients could allow for&#xD;
      better understanding disease exacerbations, evolution towards PH and therapeutics to be&#xD;
      offered to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This area of research remains widely unknown because of the lack of simple tools to assess&#xD;
      pulmonary vascularisation which could be used in clinical routine. Magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) is an innovative and non-invasive tool capable of pulmonary vascular evaluation. This&#xD;
      work aims at identifying pulmonary vascular impairment in COPD patients using functional MRI.&#xD;
