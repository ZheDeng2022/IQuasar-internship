    <textblock>
      The Therapist Education and Massage for Parent-Infant Outcomes program is evidence-based and&#xD;
      includes infant massage, physical therapy interventions including developmental support and&#xD;
      play activities to promote infant behavioral-motor development, principles of family-centered&#xD;
      care, and multiple modes of educational delivery to enhance parent retention of knowledge,&#xD;
      parent-infant bonding, and confidence in continuing physical therapy interventions after&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Therapist Education and Massage for Parent-Infant Outcomes program involves components&#xD;
      during and after hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During infant hospitalization • Visit 1: Early Parent Education Session: Initiated within 3&#xD;
      weeks of infant birth. The therapist will educate the parent about the importance of infant&#xD;
      positioning, the impact of prematurity on the motor and sensory systems, and how to read and&#xD;
      respond to infant behavioral-motor cues using a written pamphlet with pictures to supplement&#xD;
      the verbal education lasting about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The therapist will ask the parent to complete a contact information form and a&#xD;
           demographic form and a baseline questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visits 2-8: Weekly Parent Education Sessions &lt;34 weeks: Following the initial&#xD;
                parent education session, the therapist will hold weekly parent education sessions,&#xD;
                ideally at the time of therapy. When the infant is this young (&lt;34 weeks&#xD;
                gestation), therapist intervention and education will focus on infant&#xD;
                behavioral-motor cues, reading/response to infant cues, positioning&#xD;
                strategies/concerns, and developmentally appropriate stimulation of the infant. If&#xD;
                the parent is not available for all therapy sessions, then the parent will receive&#xD;
                a weekly update about their infant's progress face-to-face and/or via video chat.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visits 9-10: Infant Massage Parent Education Sessions: Parent-administered infant&#xD;
                massage will be incorporated into the therapy plan of care as soon as the infant's&#xD;
                medical provider determines that the infant is physiologically stable and can&#xD;
                tolerate massage. This time is generally once the infant is approximately 34 weeks&#xD;
                gestational age, approximately 1500 grams, and is demonstrating temperature&#xD;
                stability out of the isolette for short periods. At a minimum, the therapist will&#xD;
                teach massage for the back or lower extremities over 2 parent education sessions.&#xD;
                The therapist will demonstrate massage strokes on a doll using verbal cues to guide&#xD;
                the parent while the parent administers massage on the infant. An instructional&#xD;
                massage pamphlet will be provided. Once the therapist has determined parent safety&#xD;
                with massage administration, parents will be encouraged to practice infant massage&#xD;
                when they visit the baby and to note when they do this by marking a card at the&#xD;
                bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre and Post both massage sessions, the Primary Investigator or study coordinator will&#xD;
           collect salivary cortisol via buccal swab as a measure of physiologic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visits 11+: Weekly Parent Education Sessions &gt;34 weeks: Weekly parent education&#xD;
                once the infant is &gt;34 weeks will begin to incorporate hands-on developmental play&#xD;
                activities, introduction to visual engagement, and postural control practice in&#xD;
                variety of positions that the infant tolerates. Additionally, the therapist and&#xD;
                parent may choose to review massage at these visits. If the parent is not available&#xD;
                for all therapy sessions, then the parent will receive a weekly update about their&#xD;
                infant's progress face-to-face and/or via video chat.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Final Visit during hospitalization: Within the week of hospital discharge, the&#xD;
                therapist will schedule a face-to-face parent education session lasting about 30&#xD;
                minutes to review age-appropriate developmental play activities for home and review&#xD;
                infant massage. A supplemental handout and therapist email and pager information&#xD;
                will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At this visit, the therapist will have the parent fill out a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow- up procedures (by visits) The program has additional components that extend beyond&#xD;
      the hospital period. Parent and infant outcome measures will be collected at the first&#xD;
      follow-up and 12 month corrected age follow-up clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospitalization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Parent Education Post-Discharge: The therapist will call the parent within 2&#xD;
           weeks of discharge to follow up about discharge education and massage. During this phone&#xD;
           call, the therapist will review the home program and massage techniques. The therapist&#xD;
           will also answer any parent questions. Therapist email and pager information will be&#xD;
           provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 2-12 (approximate): Bi-weekly emails (or texts): The therapist will send&#xD;
           bi-weekly emails or texts (depending on parents' preference) with developmental play&#xD;
           activity and massage reminders and tips from hospital discharge through the first follow&#xD;
           up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 13 (approximate): First Visit Follow-up Massage Review Session: At the infant's&#xD;
           first follow-up appointment with the multidisciplinary neonatology team, the therapist&#xD;
           will provide a gross motor screening assessment and education. In addition, as part of&#xD;
           the program, a therapist will facilitate a parent-administered infant massage session to&#xD;
           provide an opportunity for parent to receive feedback on technique from the therapist.&#xD;
           This session will address any safety concerns, infant changes, and parent questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o At this visit, the therapist will have the parent fill out a questionnaire for ongoing&#xD;
           measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 14+ (approximate): Bi-weekly emails (or texts): The therapist will continue to&#xD;
           send bi-weekly emails or texts (depending on parents' preference) with developmental&#xD;
           play activity and massage reminders until the 12 month followup appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 Month Follow-up Appointment: At the standard of care 12 month corrected age follow-up&#xD;
           appointment with the multidisciplinary neonatology team, the PI or study coordinator&#xD;
           will interview the parent about acceptability of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At this visit, the therapist will have the parent fill out a questionnaire for&#xD;
                ongoing measurement&#xD;
