  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lingual microcystic lymphatic malformations (LMLMs) are rare congenital vascular&#xD;
      malformations, presenting as clusters of cysts filled with lymph fluid or blood. They are&#xD;
      responsible for a heavy burden even with small well-limited lesions because of oozing,&#xD;
      bleeding, infections, or even speech, chewing or breathing impairment. Pain and aesthetic&#xD;
      prejudice are also frequently reported. The natural history of LMLMs is progressive&#xD;
      worsening. LMLMs complex management requires multidisciplinary care in specialised centres,&#xD;
      and the &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach is frequently used. In complicated lymphatic malformations,&#xD;
      whatever the location, treatment with oral sirolimus, an mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin)&#xD;
      inhibitor, is often used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical sirolimus is a known effective treatment for some cutaneous conditions such as&#xD;
      angiofibromas in tuberous sclerosis. Topical applications of sirolimus on the buccal mucosae&#xD;
      have been reported in erosive lichen planus and oral pemphigus vulgaris with good tolerance&#xD;
      and none to slight detectable blood sirolimus concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 1mg/mL sirolimus&#xD;
      solution applied once daily on mild to moderate lingual microcystic lymphatic malformation in&#xD;
      children and adults after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks of treatment as compared to usual&#xD;
      care (no treatment).&#xD;

      This is a randomized, open-labelled, multicenter pilot study using an individually randomized&#xD;
      stepped wedge design over a 24 weeks period to evaluate topical application of 1 mg/mL&#xD;
      sirolimus solution, 0.5 mL to 1 mL according to the size of the lesion, once daily, on&#xD;
      lingual microcystic lymphatic malformation that do not require systemic treatment, the&#xD;
      experimental intervention versus usual care (no treatment), the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this design, subjects are included in a cohort where at a randomized time (W0, W4, W8 or&#xD;
      W12), they switch from an observational period to the interventional period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed for 24 weeks&#xD;
