      To evaluate, in primary care, the sensitivity of Heterophory-Vertical-Labile (HV-Labile) in&#xD;
      ambulatory screening for Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) and Developmental Coordination&#xD;
      Disorder (DCD). in children aged 8 to 12 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      General practitioners during a day of professional training on learning disabilities will be&#xD;
      trained to perform the proprioceptive Maddox, to search for a HVLabile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each trained practitioner will then test at least six children aged 8 to 12 years old in his&#xD;
      or her practice, seen at random&#xD;
&#xD;
      250 to 300 physicians will be trained as part of this research&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cross-sectional study with prospective recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search for a Vertical Labile Heterophory (HV-Labile).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prescription of a standardized speech and language screening assessment for HV-Labile,&#xD;
           and in the same number of children without HV-Labile by secondary coupling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delivery of symptomatic questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of learning disabilities, the attending physician should look for a possible&#xD;
           etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adapted speech therapy care for more than six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speech and language therapy check-up at more than six months.&#xD;

    <description>The study undertaken with 100 all-view children shows a strong correlation between the presence of SDP-HV-labile and the presence of specific learning disorders. She encourages us not to neglect the proprioceptive approach in the study of the SLD.</description>
