  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of licensed rotavirus vaccines in LMICs is limited by their lower immunogenicity&#xD;
      and efficacy in these settings. Improved vaccines and vaccination schedules would result in&#xD;
      substantially greater reductions in infant diarrhoeal disease and mortality.&#xD;
      Placebo-controlled trials of new rotavirus vaccines are no longer ethical, leading to&#xD;
      challenges for traditional routes of licensure for vaccines that are in the development&#xD;
      pipeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A HIC model of rotavirus would address these challenges, whilst also offering an opportunity&#xD;
      to study the causes of poor oral vaccine immunogenicity. Rotarix™ is in routine use in Zambia&#xD;
      administered at 6 and 10 weeks infant age. Shedding of rotavirus vaccine after vaccination&#xD;
      has recently been explored as a measure of mucosal immunity, analogous to oral poliovirus&#xD;
      vaccine challenge models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to explore methodological development of an attenuated vaccine as a HIC model to&#xD;
      advance rotavirus immunology and vaccinology in Zambian infants. We will evaluate use of&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedures including sublingual/submandibular sampling and stool&#xD;
      collection for viral shedding as measures of vaccine-induced and naturally acquired mucosal&#xD;
      immunity. This approach holds the potential to develop the first rotavirus HIC model in a&#xD;
      low-income country and could be used to accelerate licensure of new rotavirus vaccines and&#xD;
      explore causes of poor oral vaccine efficacy as well as correlates of vaccine protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, we will recruit a cohort of 22 Zambian infants receiving Rotarix™ at 6 and 10&#xD;
      weeks as part of their routine immunisation. Infants will be followed up actively on the day&#xD;
      of vaccination, days 1,3,5 and 7 following each vaccine dose for collection of stool and&#xD;
      saliva samples. Blood samples for IgA and IgG titres will be collected on days 0, 28, 31 and&#xD;
      56, and standard ELISA methods used to determine vaccine seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work brings together collaborators at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in&#xD;
      Zambia, Imperial College in UK and Christian Medical College, Vellore in India to prepare the&#xD;
      Zambian centre as a potential HIC model site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhoeal disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children,&#xD;
      particularly those living in the developing countries of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa1.&#xD;
      Rotavirus is the most common causative agent of moderate to severe diarrhoea in children&#xD;
      under age five, responsible for an estimated 215,000 infant deaths every year, most of which&#xD;
      occur within lower and middle-income countries (LMICs)2. The widespread introduction of two&#xD;
      World Health Organisation (WHO)-approved rotavirus vaccines , RotarixTM, (GlaxoSmithKline&#xD;
      Biologicals, Belgium) and RotaTeq, (Merck and Co, New Jersey), has contributed substantially&#xD;
      to reducing the number of rotavirus-associated hospitalisations and deaths3-18. However, even&#xD;
      with these gains, rotavirus vaccines have repeatedly demonstrated lower immunogenicity,&#xD;
      effectiveness, efficacy and duration of protection in children living in LMICs as compared to&#xD;
      high-income countries19,20,21. Thus, even after the introduction of rotavirus vaccines (RV),&#xD;
      rotavirus remains the leading cause of diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality within these&#xD;
      settings. Improved RV would result in substantially greater reductions in diarrhoeal disease&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality among infants; there is, therefore, an urgent need to understand the&#xD;
      reduced performance of currently available live attenuated oral vaccines in LMICs, to inform&#xD;
      and accelerate the development of maximally effective therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have suggested that alternative schedules could also enhance immunogenicity&#xD;
      and eventual vaccine performance in LMICs22,23. In addition, new RV candidates with&#xD;
      alternative routes of administration are under development, and show promise for improved&#xD;
      vaccine performance21,24,25. However, traditional pathways for licensure of new vaccines that&#xD;
      are in the development pipeline through clinical trials have become challenging, with&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trials no longer considered ethical, and field efficacy trials requiring&#xD;
      increasingly larger cohorts to compare new candidates against existing vaccines. Human&#xD;
      Infection Challenge (HIC) models have historically been employed to accelerate vaccine&#xD;
      development and offer an opportunity to study both pathogenesis and vaccine immunogenicity&#xD;
      mechanisms particularly in human-restricted pathogens. HIC models have not been widely used&#xD;
      and accepted in LMICs even though there are scientific and ethical merits of considering the&#xD;
      unique opportunity this methodology offers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to explore the methodological development of an attenuated vaccine as a HIC model&#xD;
      to advance rotavirus immunology and vaccinology in Zambian infants. We will also evaluate the&#xD;
      use of minimally invasive procedures, including collection of saliva for antibody measurement&#xD;
      and stool samples for vaccine virus shedding as measures of vaccine-induced mucosal immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 To profile rotavirus specific IgA and IgG responses to vaccination and determine&#xD;
      correlation between serum and saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective 1a: To profile rotavirus specific IgA and IgG responses at baseline (Day&#xD;
      0), pre-dose 2 (day 28) and 1 month post dose 2 (day 56) in serum and saliva to determine&#xD;
      seropositivity and vaccine seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 To profile cytokine immune responses and determine correlation between serum and&#xD;
      saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective 2a: Determine cytokine profiles in serum and saliva at baseline (Day 0)&#xD;
      and track their association with vaccine seroconversion (day 56).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective 2b: To profile cytokine responses immediately before dose 2 vaccination&#xD;
      (day 28), and at 3 days after administration of the second vaccine dose (day 31: rotavirus&#xD;
      vaccine challenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To assess the relationship of antibody levels in serum and saliva at the time of&#xD;
      vaccination (day 0) and on days 28, 31, and 56, against faecal shedding of RV strain in stool&#xD;
      collected and on days 3,5,7,14 and 21, and also on day 28 and post dose 2 vaccination days&#xD;
      31, 33, 35, 42, 49 and 56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: To profile and characterize the immediate cytokine immune response to the&#xD;
      vaccine in saliva collected on day 0 and day 31, in order to determine whether saliva could&#xD;
      serve as a satisfactory proxy for serum in evaluating vaccine-induced mucosal immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Design An exploratory and observational cohort study following infants receiving&#xD;
           two standard doses of live, attenuated, oral Rotarix™ administered at 6 &amp; 10 weeks.&#xD;
           Infants will be enrolled during the routine EPI visit for week 6 immunizations following&#xD;
           administration and provision of written informed consent by their mothers/legal&#xD;
           guardians. Each infant will remain in the study for up to 56 days during which they will&#xD;
           be intensively followed up with study activities and/or scheduled study clinic visits&#xD;
           (summarized in Table 1 below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study site and population The study will be conducted at George Clinic in Lusaka where&#xD;
           the government maternal child health (MCH) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics as&#xD;
           well as the CIDRZ George Clinical Study Site are co-located. George Clinic has a&#xD;
           catchment population of 145,23053 and is located in a typical peri-urban setting in&#xD;
           Lusaka within a surrounding slum. We plan to recruit participants as they randomly&#xD;
           attend the health facility. CIDRZ has a good research facility already existing at this&#xD;
           clinic and below is a schematic image of the site plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Selection of participants, sampling methods and sample size Sample size Considerations&#xD;
           Participants will be randomly selected from mother-infant pairs attending routine&#xD;
           antenatal care at George Clinic. As this will be an exploratory and methodological&#xD;
           development study, no formal sample size calculations have been undertaken. We have&#xD;
           pragmatically decided to enroll 20 infants which is generally acceptable for phase&#xD;
           I-type studies. In case of an estimated 10% attrition due to loss to follow up, we have&#xD;
           adjusted the sample to recruit 22 infants.&#xD;
