    <textblock>
      Risk prediction in in inherited heart rhythm conditions that may cause sudden cardiac arrest&#xD;
      or death is difficult. Sometimes the risks may be low but the loss of life in an otherwise&#xD;
      healthy young individual is catastrophic. Clinicians often treat to the extreme to prevent&#xD;
      this and so often those at unknown risk for a serious cardiac event are treated with an&#xD;
      implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to protect against sudden death even though the&#xD;
      risk is low or unknown. ICDs them selves are not without adverse events such as needing&#xD;
      battery replacements, mechanical complications, inappropriate shocks and body image and self&#xD;
      esteem issues for the patient. This study will use an inject able monitor that is less&#xD;
      invasive to monitor inherited heart rhythm patients long term to help gather long term heart&#xD;
      rhythm data (3 years) on patients with an inherited heart rhythm that will help to detect&#xD;
      symptoms of dangerous heart rhythms so that the appropriate care can be provided.&#xD;

      Risk stratification is challenging in latent genetically mediated sudden death syndromes,&#xD;
      where the absolute risks are low but the loss of life is catastrophic in otherwise well young&#xD;
      individuals. Countering this is the manifest drawbacks of liberal use of Implantable&#xD;
      Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICDs) in this population, who may suffer harm from the&#xD;
      limitations of ICDs with respect to repeated generator changes, lead/mechanical&#xD;
      complications, non-target shocks and issues with body image and self esteem. This balance is&#xD;
      struck with patients and clinicians in the inherited arrhythmia clinics daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator has a longstanding interest in cardiac monitoring and syncope,&#xD;
      with extensive experience with cardiac monitoring technologies. Recently published data from&#xD;
      the study team indicates that 69% of unexplained cardiac arrest patients had suffered&#xD;
      syncope, presyncope, chest pain or palpitations, significantly greater than the 43% incidence&#xD;
      in their first-degree relatives8. The prevalence of syncope was 34% in those patients with&#xD;
      subsequently diagnosed inherited causes of cardiac arrest. This suggests an excellent&#xD;
      opportunity to detect symptomatic and asymptomatic arrhythmias in patients to risk stratify&#xD;
      patients and direct ICD resources to patients that are likely to benefit. Coupling of&#xD;
      recording with remote monitoring of device-detected events enables a short time from detected&#xD;
      arrhythmia to reporting and resultant clinical decision-making (base station in the patient's&#xD;
      home transmits any acquired data daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intermediate risk population is seen regularly in the inherited arrhythmia clinic, based&#xD;
      on a wide array of clinical features that are proven or suspected risk markers in patients&#xD;
      who either prefer to avoid an ICD, or whose risk is insufficient to clearly warrant an ICD.&#xD;
      The risk in these individuals is hampered by the relatively uncommon short-term risk of&#xD;
      spontaneous arrhythmia that is detected by routine 24-48 Holter surveillance to assist as a&#xD;
      &quot;tie breaker&quot;, to favor more aggressive therapy with an ICD. This study will extend the&#xD;
      monitoring period of intermediate risk patients to 3 years and enable detection of&#xD;
      symptomatic and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmia that would inform risk discussion with&#xD;
      the patient and favor more aggressive therapy. The latter may involve incremental drug&#xD;
      therapy, cardiac sympathectomy or an ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loop recorder implantation (Reveal LINQ, Medtronic, Minneapolis MN), also called an&#xD;
      insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) has the ability to analyze the beat to beat variability of&#xD;
      cardiac cycles on a 2 minute ECG strip and stores the tracing for visual confirmation of any&#xD;
      cardiac events. The device also provides the patient with the ability to activate the device&#xD;
      manually and so facilitates analysis of heart rhythm during symptomatic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is manufactured and will be provided by Medtronic Canada Ltd, 99 Hereford Street,&#xD;
      Brampton, Ontario L6Y 0R3 +1 905-460-3800. The Medtronic Reveal LINQ is a programmable device&#xD;
      that continuously monitors a patient's ECG and other physiological parameters. The device&#xD;
      records cardiac information in response to automatically detected arrhythmias and patient&#xD;
      activation. The form factor of the device has changed from that similar to a USB thumb drive&#xD;
      that requires surgical implantation to that of a paper clip that can be injected in a&#xD;
      minimally invasive environment including office based clean rooms. This device is small&#xD;
      leadless and is inserted under the skin, in the chest. The device can be inserted by the&#xD;
      physician in the office, saving precious healthcare resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Adverse Events include but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device rejection phenomena (including local tissue reaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device migration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Erosion through the skin&#xD;
