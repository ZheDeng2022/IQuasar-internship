  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to quantify the magnitude of the effect of itraconazole&#xD;
      co-administration on the PK of savolitinib. The exposure to savolitinib is predicted to&#xD;
      increase when co-administered with the potent cytochrome P (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor itraconazole&#xD;
      since CYP3A4 (via CYP450) is involved in the metabolism and elimination of savolitinib.&#xD;

      This study will be an open-label, 3-period, fixed-sequence study in non-Japanese healthy male&#xD;
      subjects conducted at a single study centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A screening period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Three treatment periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Treatment Period 1 consists of 15 days with admission on Study Day -1, followed by&#xD;
                a single dose administration of savolitinib on Study Day 1 followed by a washout&#xD;
                period of at least 14 days. Subjects will be discharged from the study centre on&#xD;
                Day 3, after the last PK sample is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Treatment Period 2 consists of 4 days with admission on Study Day 14, followed by&#xD;
                itraconazole administration for 3 days (200 mg BID on Study Day 15, 200 mg QD on&#xD;
                Study Days 16 and 17).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Treatment Period 3 consists of 3 days, starting immediately after the end of&#xD;
                Treatment Period 2 comprising of single dose administration of savolitinib (200 mg)&#xD;
                on Study Day 18 and itraconazole administration (200 mg QD) on Study Days 18 and&#xD;
                19. The subjects will be discharged from the study centre on Study Day 20 after the&#xD;
                last PK sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Follow-up Visit will occur at least 14 days after the last dose of savolitinib PK&#xD;
           sample in Treatment Period 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects will be admitted to the study centre on 2 different occasions: Study Day-1&#xD;
           (Study Day -1) to Study Day 3 of Treatment Period 1 and Day -1 (Study Day 14) of&#xD;
           Treatment Period 2 to Day 3 (Study Day 20) of Treatment Period 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drugs will be administered as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment Period 1: Single administration of savolitinib (200 mg) will occur on Study&#xD;
           Day 1 after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast followed by PK sampling for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment Period 2: Itraconazole administered BID (200 mg BID) on Study Day 15, and (200&#xD;
           mg QD) on Study Days 16 and 17, 1 hour before breakfast (and before dinner, when&#xD;
           applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment Period 3: A single combination of itraconazole (200 mg) 1 hour before&#xD;
           breakfast + savolitinib (200 mg) after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast on Study Day&#xD;
           18, and a single dose of itraconazole (200 mg) on Study Day 19, 1 hour before breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be involved in the study for up to 60 days.&#xD;
