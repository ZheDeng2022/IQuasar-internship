      Introduction Measurement of fractional nitric oxide (NO) concentration in exhaled breath&#xD;
      (FeNO) has been shown to be a non-invasive, quantitative biomarker related to airway&#xD;
      inflammation. Although there is inadequate evidence to support the use of FENO to aid the&#xD;
      diagnosis of asthma, recent studies demonstrate the usefulness of FENO in phenotyping and&#xD;
      management of asthma. American Thoracic Society (ATS) Clinical Practice Guideline recommended&#xD;
      the use of FeNO in the diagnosis of eosinophilic airway inflammation and in determining the&#xD;
      likelihood of steroid responsiveness in individuals with chronic respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      possibly due to airway inflammation. The guideline recommends in adults with FENO less than&#xD;
      25 parts per billion (ppb) indicates eosinophilic inflammation and responsiveness to&#xD;
      corticosteroids are less likely, and greater than 50 ppb indicates eosinophilic inflammation&#xD;
      and, in symptomatic patients, responsiveness to corticosteroids are likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a validation study of ATS guideline showed almost one-fourth of patients had&#xD;
      intermediate FENO values (i.e. 25-50ppb), which may limit the clinical usefulness of the ATS&#xD;
      FeNO cut-points. Furthermore, FENO values are affected by multiple factors. In a recent study&#xD;
      that assessed the determinants of FENO in men and women without lung diseases using data from&#xD;
      25 centres across 11 European countries and Australia involving 3881 subjects, it was found&#xD;
      that gender, smoking status, height, IgE sensitization would affect the FeNO level measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prior study also showed the FeNO levels of healthy Chinese children and adult without&#xD;
      significant lung diseases are higher than the Caucasian population. An earlier genotyping&#xD;
      findings of nitric oxide synthase genes suggested that the frequencies of minor alleles&#xD;
      associated with nitric oxide production were substantially lower in Chinese subjects.&#xD;
      Therefore, ethnic-specific references must be considered when setting the cut-off values for&#xD;
      assessing asthma status in different populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many studies on the cut-off of FeNO for making a diagnosis of asthma. There are,&#xD;
      however, not much information on the level of FeNO in Chinese asthma patients with different&#xD;
      levels of asthma control in a real-life setting and whether the ATS clinical practice&#xD;
      guideline is applicable for Chinese asthma subjects given that the healthy subjects had a&#xD;
      higher FeNO than the Caucasian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the level of FeNO in Chinese asthma patients with respect&#xD;
      to the different levels of asthma control over a period of 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Subject recruitment This is an observational study in which FeNO was measured in&#xD;
      Chinese adults asthma patients in Hong Kong. Subjects will be recruited from the general&#xD;
      medical and respiratory clinic of the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. After an&#xD;
      explanation of the study, the investigator will obtain the written informed consent from all&#xD;
      the patients who meet the inclusion criteria and with no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Chinese subjects aged between 18 and 90 years and have a diagnosis of asthma according to&#xD;
      The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline 2019. Asthma is defined as those with a&#xD;
      consistent history and prior documented evidence of variable airflow obstruction, with&#xD;
      evidence of an increase in FEV1 greater than 12% or 200 mL following bronchodilator or&#xD;
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness on bronchial provocation testing, when stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with respiratory diseases with other known respiratory diseases including&#xD;
           chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis (TB)-destroyed lung&#xD;
           parenchyma, history of lung resection and lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals older than 40 years with a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients currently randomized in other clinical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, healthy subjects with no respiratory symptoms and asthma as defined above, and&#xD;
      other significant lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of&#xD;
      tuberculosis and bronchiectasis) with normal CXR will be recruited as control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment, asthma patient will be followed up in the research clinic every 4 months&#xD;
      for one year. Patients will have the following assessment in each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic characteristics of the subjects Demographic characteristics of the subjects&#xD;
           will include age, body weight and height, symptoms, age of onset of disease,&#xD;
           exacerbations or hospital admission in the past 12 months for asthma, medications taking&#xD;
           and vaccinations in the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FeNO measurement FeNO will be measured before spirometry. FeNO will be measured online&#xD;
           using a NIOX VERO (Circassia, Oxford, UK) according to ATS/ERS recommendations. Subjects&#xD;
           will be in the sitting position (with no nose clip), exhale to residual volume, insert a&#xD;
           mouthpiece, inhale to total lung capacity, and then exhale for 10 seconds at a constant&#xD;
           flow rate of 50mL/s. The measurement will be repeated until three FeNO values varied&#xD;
           less than 10% or two values varied less than 5%. The mean FeNO (in ppb) will then be&#xD;
           recorded. All subjects have to refrain from strenuous physical activity or exercise for&#xD;
           at least 30 minutes prior to FeNO measurement. In addition, subjects shall avoid eating&#xD;
           for 1 hour and caffeine ingestion for 6 hours before the test. Subjects will not be&#xD;
           tested within 4 weeks of an upper or lower respiratory tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator Spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator&#xD;
           according to the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society standards&#xD;
           will be performed.14 The updated predicted spirometry values for Hong Kong Chinese will&#xD;
           be used to calculate the predicted lung function.ong Kong Chinese will be used to&#xD;
           calculate the predicted lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Home peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) monitoring Patients will be asked to measure their&#xD;
           home PEFR using a PEFR monitoring meter (Mini-Wright, Clement Clarke International Ltd,&#xD;
           Essex, UK) and will be asked to record their PEFR as the best of three recordings in the&#xD;
           morning before the use of inhalers. Mean PEFR is the mean of the daily PEFR for the 2&#xD;
           weeks before the follow-up. PEFR variability was calculated using the Min%Max index&#xD;
           (minimum PEFR, expressed as a percent of the best PEFR over 2 weeks before follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Forced Oscillatory assessment of airway resistance Airway resistance and reactance will&#xD;
           be assessed using the TremoFlo C-100 (Thrasys, Halifax, Canada). Forced oscillatory&#xD;
           measures the resistance and reactance of the respiratory system during tidal breathing&#xD;
           by superimposing a gentle multi-frequency airwave onto the patient's respiratory&#xD;
           airflow. The parameters of airway resistance measured will include low-frequency&#xD;
           resistance at 5 Hz denoted as R5 and difference from 5 Hz to 19 Hz denoted as R5 to R19.&#xD;
           Low-frequency reactance at 5 Hz is denoted as X5, resonant frequency when elasticity&#xD;
           balances inertia (i.e. Fres) and the low-frequency reactance area (i.e. ALX) are&#xD;
           reactance parameters being assessed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood test Routine blood test, including blood eosinophil count and total IgE level as&#xD;
           determined by clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Skin prick test Skin prick test was performed with a panel of allergen extracts&#xD;
           including cat, dog, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D. farinae, Aspergillus, Mold&#xD;
           Mix, Tree Mix and cockroach. A minimum wheal size of 3 mm will be defined as a positive&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Assessment of asthma control Asthma control in the past 4 weeks will be assessed. They&#xD;
           will be evaluated and classified into different levels of asthma symptom control,&#xD;
           according to GINA 201914 (appendix 1). The asthmatic attacks that required courses of&#xD;
           systemic steroid or hospitalization will be documented (by asking the patient and also&#xD;
           checking with health records). In addition, Asthma Control Test and Asthma control&#xD;
           questionnaire will be used to assess asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For control subject, they will attend the research clinic once to have assessments of&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, FENO level, spirometry, airway resistance, blood and skin test&#xD;
      as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint of the study: FeNO level in Chinese asthma of different levels of asthma&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: FeNO level and risk of exacerbation in the subsequent 12 months,&#xD;
      correlation of FeNO with makers of atopy and lung function including skin prick test, IgE&#xD;
      level, eosinophil level and lung function parameters (spirometry and airway resistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Data will be analyzed by the Statistical Package of the Social Science Statistical&#xD;
      software (SPSS) for Window, Version 22.0.0 (IBM SPSS Inc, IL, USA). The clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of the subjects will be expressed as mean (SD) for normally distributed&#xD;
      parameters or median (IQR) for non-normally distributed ones. FeNO levels between different&#xD;
      levels of asthma control will be assessed by one-way ANOVA, while within individual&#xD;
      variations with regard to the level of control and over time will be assessed by ANOVA with&#xD;
      repeated measures, adjusted by age, sex, height and presence of atopy. Comparison of the FeNO&#xD;
      levels of the asthma and control group will be assessed by independent sample t-test. Levels&#xD;
      of FENO and time to first exacerbation will be assessed by Cox proportional-hazards model and&#xD;
      log-rank test as appropriate. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
