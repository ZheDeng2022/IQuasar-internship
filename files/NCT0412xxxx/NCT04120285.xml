    <textblock>
      We propose to carry out a treatment experiment in which we evaluate the extent to which&#xD;
      randomizing primary care clinicians have access to remote internet-based Cognitive Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy (eCBT) in rural West Virginia (WV) will help improve treatment of patients with Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder (MDD). WV is one of the most rural states in America and mental health&#xD;
      treatment resources are low (ranked 42nd among the 50 states); especially in rural parts of&#xD;
      the state.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pragmatic trial of the comparative effectiveness of two levels of&#xD;
      remote internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (eCBT) to treat major depressive disorder&#xD;
      (MDD) with and without comorbidities. The investigators intend to recruit 3,360 patients&#xD;
      receiving primary care MDD treatment in a rural integrated network of Federally Qualified&#xD;
      Health Centers (FQHCs) throughout West Virginia (WV). The investigators two main aims will be&#xD;
      to use experimental methods to evaluate the aggregate effects of these interventions on&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes and to investigate predictors of heterogeneity of treatment&#xD;
      effects. MDD treatment in WV is far from optimal, with rural patients especially underserved.&#xD;
      WV is the 2nd most rural state in the US, has the 2nd lowest per capita income and has the&#xD;
      highest proportion of residents covered by Medicaid. Need for services is high, as indicated&#xD;
      by WV having the highest suicide rate of any state east of the Mississippi River and the&#xD;
      highest opioid death rate in the country. Yet WV ranks only 42nd in overall mental health&#xD;
      care. The vast majority of MDD treatment in WV is in primary care and consists largely of&#xD;
      antidepressant medication (ADM). Electronic medical records (EMRs) show that 88% of primary&#xD;
      care MDD patients in WV's FQHCs are treated exclusively with ADM and that the other 12% are&#xD;
      treated with ADM plus psychotherapy. The limited number of patients who can access&#xD;
      psychotherapy usually must go on a waiting list (often 3+ months) and travel long distances&#xD;
      for treatment once available. Access to telephone or videoconference psychotherapy is&#xD;
      limited. Yet 75% of depressed primary care patients express a desire for psychotherapy either&#xD;
      alone (40%) or in combination with ADM (35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mismatch between treatment availability and preference is important because MDD&#xD;
      remission increases substantially when patients are treated with their preferred type. There&#xD;
      is thus good reason to believe that providing access to eCBT will improve MDD treatment&#xD;
      outcomes in our trial. Indeed, prior controlled trials show that both types of eCBT the&#xD;
      investigators will randomize yield significantly better outcomes than waiting list controls.&#xD;
      Controlled trials also show that guided eCBT yields equivalent outcomes to telephone and&#xD;
      face-to-face CBT, but at much lower cost. Other controlled trials show that combined CBT-ADM&#xD;
      yield significantly better outcomes than either CBT-alone or ADM-alone, although these&#xD;
      comparisons have been made only for face-to-face CBT. These results provide good reason to&#xD;
      believe that offering eCBT in rural FQHCs throughout WV could improve MDD outcomes. Existing&#xD;
      research on eCBT in rural areas, while promising, has been limited, making the research the&#xD;
      investigators propose important to provide actionable information for patients and other&#xD;
      stakeholders. Results intend to inform decisions about whether to offer/use eCBT, with what&#xD;
      level of guidance, and for whom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unguided eCBT is web-based CBT completed with computerized feedback but no clinician&#xD;
      involvement after an initial orientation meeting. Guided eCBT is web-based CBT completed with&#xD;
      a remote eCoach who communicates with the patient via email, text, and telephone. eCoaches&#xD;
      also provide elements of remote collaborative care case management, such as encouraging ADM&#xD;
      adherence, monitoring ADM side effects and treatment response, coordinating with the primary&#xD;
      care physician (PCP), and facilitating specialty referral. Collaborative care is known to be&#xD;
      highly effective in promoting MDD symptomatic remission. In addition, a study in Arkansas&#xD;
      FQHCs found that remote collaborative care case management out-performed on-site case&#xD;
      management in rural clinics too small to justify having a dedicated mental health case&#xD;
      manager on staff. However, remote collaborative care case management often involves&#xD;
      delivering telephone CBT. A major constraint on expanding the collaborative care model for&#xD;
      primary care MDD treatment, which has been used in urban but not rural WV clinics, is lack of&#xD;
      case managers who can deliver telephone CBT. Thus, expanding eCBT in rural WV would allow&#xD;
      offering a strongly evidence-based form of patients' preferred treatment (psychotherapy) and&#xD;
      a form of a well-validated rural MDD care model (collaborative care case management with&#xD;
      guided eCBT) that cannot be offered currently because of limited clinical resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given its documented efficacy and rapid spread, the investigators expect eCBT to become&#xD;
      widely available in rural WV as a result of our trial. But two real-life decisional dilemmas&#xD;
      will arise in that context. Primary care clinicians will be faced with the decision about&#xD;
      when to recommend eCBT and at what level of intensity. Patients will be faced with the&#xD;
      decision of whether to accept guided or unguided eCBT as part of their treatment plan. These&#xD;
      are non-trivial decisions, as eCBT incurs a time cost, and guided eCBT incurs a financial&#xD;
      cost and requires interactions with a supporter for patients who desire independence and&#xD;
      privacy. Further, eCBT has the potential to harm, as when lack of engagement leads the&#xD;
      patient to drop out of all treatment, including ADM, whereas that patient would have remitted&#xD;
      with ADM. Our heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) analyses will examine which patients&#xD;
      profit from guided eCBT, which do equally well or better with unguided than guided eCBT, and&#xD;
      which do as well or better with ADM in the absence of eCBT. A good deal of research has been&#xD;
      carried out on eCBT HTE, although not in conjunction with ADM. This research suggests that&#xD;
      the value of eCBT for MDD varies considerably depending on diverse patient characteristics&#xD;
      the investigators plan to study. As with the comparative effectiveness evidence for eCBT vs&#xD;
      other MDD therapies, though, research on MDD HTE up to now has focused on narrowly-defined&#xD;
      symptom outcomes. In addition, although more than two dozen consistently significant baseline&#xD;
      patient-reported predictors of MDD HTE have been documented, no single study ever considered&#xD;
      more than a handful of these predictors. In addition, past MDD HTE studies have been&#xD;
      underpowered. Our analysis will be based on a sample of 3,360 patients powered to detect HTE&#xD;
      in the entire sample. Our patient and provider partners have indicated that evidence about&#xD;
      the prescriptive predictors of these differences will be of great value in their treatment&#xD;
      selection decisions. The causal model underlying the design is drawn from previous studies&#xD;
      reviewed here: that MDD remission of primary care patients can be increased by adding eCBT to&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual (TAU) via mechanisms that include influencing cognitions and behaviors to&#xD;
      promote psychological recovery and encouraging increased ADM compliance. This model underlies&#xD;
      all aspects of our design (selection of population, interventions, measures, analytic&#xD;
      methods, procedures for handling confounding, time frame).&#xD;

    <measure>RDQ-7</measure>
    <time_frame>16-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess all study patients remission from depression with the Remission from Depression Questionnaire (RDQ-7) via self-report assessments at 16 week follow-up. Investigators will monitor patients at 26, 39, and 52 weeks to evaluate the long-term maintenance of remission (or recurrence). The RDQ-7 is a measure with 41 items. Items are reported on a 3-point rating scale (0=not at all or rarely true; 1 = sometimes; 2 = often or almost always true). The total scale score ranges from 0-82. Participants with a total score below or equal to 27 are considered in remission. Higher total scores reflect greater pathology.</description>

    <description>The investigators will assess all study participants severity of substance use using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Short Form v1.0 - Severity of Substance Use (past 30 days) at 16 week follow-up. Investigators will monitor participants at 26, 39, and 52 weeks to evaluate the long-term durability of our intervention. The PROMIS) Short Form v1.0 - Severity of Substance Use (past 30 days) is a measure with 7 items. Items are reported with five response options ranging in value from one to five. To calculate the total scale score, items are summed resulting in a range from 1-35. Higher total scores reflect that a participant uses a substance with greater severity.</description>
