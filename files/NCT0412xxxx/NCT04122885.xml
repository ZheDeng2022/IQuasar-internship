  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general goal of this study is to investigate the effect of treatment on serum&#xD;
      concentrations of proteins known to impact angiogenesis or tumor growth and establishment in&#xD;
      patients with peritoneal metastasis of various origin. Since the immune system is thought, by&#xD;
      many, to have an impact on tumor growth and development, this study also seeks to determine&#xD;
      the impact of abdominal surgery on postoperative immune function in PM patients, as judged by&#xD;
      proteins known to influence immune function. This study will not only characterize the&#xD;
      postoperative plasma but also to determine if the magnitude of any of the changes noted is&#xD;
      associated with a worse or improved oncologic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle purpose of this study is to gather perioperative serum/plasma samples from&#xD;
      patients with PM from a variety of different primary tumors (ovarian, gastric, and&#xD;
      colorectal) undergoing either CRS and HIPEC versus PIPAC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plasma samples obtained in this protocol will also be used to study the various plasma&#xD;
      proteins that influence immune function as well as those that influence angiogenesis. In&#xD;
      addition to the proteins mentioned above, there are also a large number of other proteins&#xD;
      that have not been investigated thus far in the perioperative window; these proteins also&#xD;
      merit assessment. The plasma obtained via this study and protocol will also be used to search&#xD;
      for other tumor growth factors influenced by surgery or to investigate the impact of surgery&#xD;
      on immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine perioperative serum levels, over time, of a variety of serum proteins&#xD;
      including but not limited to IGFBP-3, VEGF, Ang 2, PlGF, sVCAM, CHI3L1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MCP-1&#xD;
      and proteins that influence immune function as well as other proteins in the following 2&#xD;
      groups of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PM patients treated with CRS and HIPEC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PM patients treated with PIPAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the perioperative blood protein results between the 2 different groups of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine, within each group, a possible correlation between the magnitude of these&#xD;
      effects on oncological outcome (patient overall survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To search for other surgery-influenced plasma or cellular factors that may influence&#xD;
      early postoperative tumor growth or that hold promise as tumor or prognostic markers.&#xD;

        Subjects will be recruited from the institutions involved. All patients must meet&#xD;
        inclusion/exclusion criteria (as indicated above) to be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each subject will undergo medical examination during the screening visit (Visit 1) prior to&#xD;
        enrolment. The personal data and detailed medical history will be recorded. The screening&#xD;
        will take place no more than 6 weeks before intervention. This screening procedure will&#xD;
        consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Checking of inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Detailed history including medical history&#xD;
