  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digestive Functional Disorders (DFD), represent 50% of medical check ups, the symptoms&#xD;
      interfere with patients quality of life and generate high health costs. On the other hand,&#xD;
      with the worldwide overweight and obesity increase,causing an over production of low-calorie&#xD;
      products, which increase the non-caloric sweeteners (NCS) consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A diet without NCS will reduce gastrointestinal symptoms in volunteers with&#xD;
      dyspepsia and IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To asses the effect of a diet without NCS, on the gastrointestinal symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with dyspepsia and IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To compare the effect of a diet without NCS against a diet with NCS on&#xD;
      anthropometry, changes in body composition, biochemical parameters, glucose and insulin. To&#xD;
      asses the change in the gut microbiota using real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: it will be an experimental, open, parallel, controlled study lasting 12 weeks,&#xD;
      patients with dyspepsia or IBS will be randomized assigned to a diet with or without NCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory studies, dietary and symptoms questionnaires, anthropometry measurements and&#xD;
      faecal sample will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Results: A double data capture will be carried out to minimize errors, for the&#xD;
      statistical analysis of using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version&#xD;
      25, descriptive statistics will be used to report the baseline data of the volunteers. Using&#xD;
      means and standard deviation, the variables of gastrointestinal symptoms will be used a&#xD;
      chi-square test and a p &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. Different analyzes will be done&#xD;
      to evaluate volunteers with IBS and those with dyspepsia. For the intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      analysis, a comparison will be made between the percentages of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and&#xD;
      Actinobacteria of sample 1 and 2 and a chi-square test will be performed considering a p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 significant&#xD;

      Recruitment will be carried out in the gastroenterology service, where patients will have&#xD;
      their diagnosis of IBS or dyspepsia, participants are invited to participate in the study to&#xD;
      subsequently sign the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once signed the patient is scheduled for blood studies, their nutritional evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out and their menu will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 12 weeks to re-conduct their nutritional evaluation and&#xD;
      laboratory studies.&#xD;
