  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation phase I study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and preliminary efficacy of KN044 in participants with all advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      who are not able to have current standard anti-tumor therapies. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) , to characterise the safety, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of KN044 as a single&#xD;
      agent in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve patients and follow the standard &quot;3 + 3&quot;design. KN044 will be&#xD;
      antimedical intravenously over 30 minutes with planned doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 6,10&#xD;
      mg/kg Once every 3 weeks for first 4 doses, then every 3, or 6, or 12 weeks for up to 1 year&#xD;
      if no intolerable toxicities occur and per agreement with investigator antimedical monitor&#xD;
      based on emerging data.&#xD;
