    <textblock>
      A Phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of a recombinant quadrivalent nanoparticle influenza vaccine with&#xD;
      Matrix-M1 adjuvant (NanoFlu) compared with a licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine in adults ≥ 65 years of age. Both vaccines will be formulated with the 4 influenza&#xD;
      strains recommended for the 2019-20 Northern hemisphere influenza season. Approximately 2650&#xD;
      subjects (1325 subjects/group) will be enrolled and randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups&#xD;
      to receive either NanoFlu or active comparator. Subjects will be followed for approximately 1&#xD;
      year following injection; with primary immunogenicity analyses based on Day 28 sera. This&#xD;
      trial will be conducted in the United States at approximately 19 clinical sites.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinically-stable adult male or female, ≥ 65 years of age. Subjects may have 1 or more&#xD;
             chronic medical diagnoses, but should be clinically stable as assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ambulatory status, living independently in the community or in a residential&#xD;
                  facility providing minimal assistance (eg, meal preparation and transport),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absence of changes in medical therapy within 1 month due to treatment failure or&#xD;
                  toxicity,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absence of medical events qualifying as serious adverse events within the prior 2&#xD;
                  months, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absence of known, current, and life-limiting diagnoses which render survival to&#xD;
                  completion of the protocol unlikely in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to give informed consent prior to trial enrollment, and&#xD;

          2. Participation in any previous Novavax influenza vaccine clinical trial(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of a serious reaction to prior influenza vaccination, known allergy to&#xD;
             constituents of Fluzone Quadrivalent or polysorbate 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks following a previous influenza&#xD;
             vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Received any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination and any influenza&#xD;
             vaccine within 6 months preceding the trial vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive illness, congenital or acquired, based on&#xD;
             medical history and/or physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants&#xD;
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the&#xD;
             trial vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a&#xD;
             systemic dose ≥ 10 mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical,&#xD;
             inhaled, and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months&#xD;
             preceding the administration of the trial vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or&#xD;
             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature ≥ 38.0°C, on the planned&#xD;
             day of vaccine administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would pose a health risk to the&#xD;
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or&#xD;
             interpretation of trial results (including neurologic or psychiatric conditions deemed&#xD;
             likely to impair the quality of safety reporting).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known disturbance of coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Suspicion or recent history (within 1 year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or other&#xD;
