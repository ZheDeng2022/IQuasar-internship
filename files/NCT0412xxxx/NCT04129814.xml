    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to study the influence of periodontal therapy (non-surgical)&#xD;
      on the severity of erectile dysfunction(ED) among patients with chronic periodontitis and&#xD;
      moderate or severe ED.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      there no sufficient data to determine a possible link between erectile dysfunction ( ED) and&#xD;
      periodontitis. Therefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to study the influence of&#xD;
      periodontal therapy (non-surgical) on the severity of ED among patients with chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis and moderate or severe ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The total number of patients in the current trial will be 140 to requite dropout&#xD;
      rate during follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial is a single-blinded, randomized, parallel, controlled clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients with severe or moderate ED will selected from attendants of Andrology&#xD;
      Outpatients Clinic, Tanta University Hospital and will referred to Periodontology Department,&#xD;
      Tanta University. Statistical software (STATA 13.1, Stata Corp, Texas, USA) will be used on&#xD;
      study participants for random allocation that identify to which group the patients will&#xD;
      enrolled, using 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention protocol The patients will included in this study if they met the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The IIEF is an appropriate questionnaire that is used for assessment of men sexual&#xD;
      function, especially the ED. . Subjects with scores &gt; 25 will assessed as men with normal&#xD;
      sexual function while those with scores ≤ 25 will diagnosed as patients with ED. Following&#xD;
      this, participants will directed to periodontology department to assess their periodontal&#xD;
      health . After periodontal screening, all eligible patients will informed of potential risks,&#xD;
      study objective, and benefits of their participation in this study. Non-surgical periodontal&#xD;
      treatment that will be performed by the same periodontist for all participants within a test&#xD;
      group at baseline and after three months for patients in a control group. Therefore, no&#xD;
      periodontal treatment will be performed during the follow-up period in control group. D&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and periodontal evaluation Thorough medical history, data on age, gender and&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics will be gathered for all participants in studied groups at&#xD;
      baseline. A full-mouth periodontal screening will be carried out by one specialist using a&#xD;
      manual probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). Prior the current study, test-retest exercises&#xD;
      will be performed in 20 patients to assess intra-examiner calibration. The periodontal&#xD;
      parameters will be assessed at baseline and at 3 months that consist of PD, CAL, visible&#xD;
      dental plaque (will be assessed at 4 sites per each tooth using a probe and will be recorded&#xD;
      as present or absent) and bleeding on probing (BOP) (will be recorded as ratio of sites&#xD;
      displaying bleeding after light probing) 10. After exclusion of third molars; for each tooth&#xD;
      BOP, CAL and PD will be monitored at 6 sites. The IIEF scores will be recorded at baseline&#xD;
      and 3 months for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokine collection and evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative assessment of TNF-α in saliva and serum will be done by commercially available&#xD;
      kit (Ray Bio Human TNF-α Enzyme Immunoassay).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After periodontal and medical screening, all eligible patients will informed of potential risks, study objective, and benefits of their participation in this study. Non-surgical periodontal treatment consisted of oral hygiene instructions (OHI), single session full-mouth scaling and root planing (SRP) that will be performed by the same periodontist using Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) and ultrasonic apparatus (Cavitron Select SPC, Dentsply professional, New York, USA) for all participants within a test group at baseline and after three months for patients in a control group because of ethical reasons. Therefore, no periodontal treatment will be performed during the follow-up period in control group.</intervention_model_description>
