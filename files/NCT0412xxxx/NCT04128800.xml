      To evaluate the objective remission rate and disease control rate of apatinib mesylate&#xD;
      tablets combined with S-1 in the treatment of advanced small cell lung cancer patients with&#xD;
      failed or dangerous radiotherapy or chemotherapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with the highest morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      world. Small cell lung cancer accounts for about 15-20% of all lung cancer. Although the&#xD;
      initial treatment is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, patients with small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer are prone to recurrence and metastasis in the early stage, and ultimately lead to&#xD;
      death due to the lack of effective treatment after the disease progresses. Patients with&#xD;
      relapsed small cell lung cancer had a poor prognosis; untreated patients had only two to&#xD;
      three months of expected survival.Therefore, it is urgent to find a method to treat SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two single-arm phase II clinical studies on small cell lung cancer have evaluated the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of bevacizumab combined with first-line chemotherapy for extensive SCLC.&#xD;
      Two phase II single arm studies showed good efficacy and safety. Apatinib and bevacizumab are&#xD;
      both antiangiogenic agents. S-1 is a new oral fluoropyrimidine anticancer agent, but S-1 has&#xD;
      shown a high remission rate for metastatic NSCLC and relapsed NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the good efficacy and tolerability of oral chemotherapeutic agent S-1, and the&#xD;
      lack of suitable targeted drugs after NGS treatment in relapsed S LCL patients after previous&#xD;
      multithreaded treatment, this clinical trial is to study the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      combination of anti-angiogenesis drugs and S-1 in patients with failed or dangerous SCLC&#xD;
      after second-line or more radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;
