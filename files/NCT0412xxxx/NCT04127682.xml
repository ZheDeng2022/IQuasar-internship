      Antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in pediatric care all over the&#xD;
      world. Over prescription of antibiotics is a major public health problem and the most&#xD;
      important factor in the emergence of antibiotic resistance. It is important to study&#xD;
      physicians' antibiotic prescribing behavior to understand its determinant and for further&#xD;
      planning of appropriate interventions to optimize antibiotic prescription.&#xD;

      Antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in pediatric care all over the&#xD;
      world. Over prescription of antibiotics is a major public health problem and the most&#xD;
      important factor in the emergence of antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Egypt, a recent study conducted in El-Minya governorate to investigate antibiotic use in&#xD;
      PHC centres and in governmental hospitals, revealed that physician prescriptions of&#xD;
      antibiotics for ARIs were extremely high as 82% of pediatric visits for ARIs resulted in an&#xD;
      antibiotic prescription. Most of these infections are caused by viruses and do not require&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices have been reported from&#xD;
      various countries with varying results. No single intervention appears to have superior&#xD;
      efficacy, but combinations of interventions are typically more effective, and strategies that&#xD;
      target health care professionals and/or patients (or parents of young children) have achieved&#xD;
      success at reducing antibiotic prescriptions for ARIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the emergence of antibiotic resistance and international efforts to reduce antibiotic&#xD;
      use, prescription still high and inappropriate. Children are a vulnerable group and&#xD;
      inappropriate antibiotic prescription may affect their health and may contribute to&#xD;
      development of many diseases as allergies beside emergence of antibiotic resistance. Also,&#xD;
      most of acute respiratory infections in children are viral infections and they receive&#xD;
      antibiotic for it. So,, it is important to study physicians' antibiotic prescribing behavior&#xD;
      to understand its determinant and for further planning of appropriate interventions to&#xD;
      optimize antibiotic prescription.&#xD;
