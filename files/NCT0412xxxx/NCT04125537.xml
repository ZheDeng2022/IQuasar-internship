  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pathways Collaborative is the first attempt to implement supportive (palliative) kidney&#xD;
      care at multiple sites in the United States. While supportive kidney care is growing in other&#xD;
      countries, notably Canada, Australia, and Great Britain, it is not yet known how to integrate&#xD;
      it into the unique nephrology environment in the United States. In Phase 1 of Pathways&#xD;
      (completed), we developed an evidence-based change packet of 14 best practices for&#xD;
      integrating supportive care practices into the continuum of care for patients with end stage&#xD;
      kidney disease (ESKD). In Phase 2 (described in this application), we will conduct a learning&#xD;
      collaborative to help up to 15 dialysis and CKD centers implement these best practices. The&#xD;
      learning collaborative is based on the IHI Collaborative Model for Achieving Breakthrough&#xD;
      Improvement. This model is a tested systematic approach to quality improvement designed to&#xD;
      help organizations close the gap between current and future practice based on evidence-based&#xD;
      best practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pathways Project faculty will work with up to 15 change teams at dialysis centers to&#xD;
      create a system to identify seriously ill patients with kidney disease; conduct conversations&#xD;
      with them so that their values, preferences, and goals for current and future medical&#xD;
      treatment are known and respected; assess and address patients' physical, psychological and&#xD;
      spiritual needs; and coordinate care throughout the healthcare system so patients receive&#xD;
      only the care they want in settings in which they wish to be.&#xD;

      Aim 1: Hold Breakthrough Collaborative for integrating supportive care into kidney care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve an overall improvement in aligning treatment with patient values and preferences,&#xD;
      satisfaction with care, quality of life, and symptom and pain management, Pathways Project&#xD;
      Collaborative teams will embark on an 18-month Collaborative beginning spring 2019. Beginning&#xD;
      in May 2019, there will be a 4-month observation period to obtain baseline measurements of&#xD;
      current supportive care practices at the participating sites. Through the application of the&#xD;
      Pathways Project change package, project teams will enhance the delivery of supportive care&#xD;
      processes for patients with kidney disease, specifically through the testing and&#xD;
      implementation of shared decision-making and advance care planning; systematically&#xD;
      identifying seriously ill patients; and providing palliative dialysis to seriously ill&#xD;
      patients with advanced Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) whose goals are not compatible with&#xD;
      standard dialysis schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Revise Pathways change package and resources in preparation for dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summer 2020, the Pathways Project Advisory Committee, including patient subject matter&#xD;
      experts, will revise and strengthen the change package, resources and tools based on the&#xD;
      knowledge gained through the Collaborative. The revisions will incorporate the dialysis&#xD;
      center/ESCO teams' experience during the collaborative along with the preliminary evaluation&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Develop strategy for dissemination In fall 2020, the Pathways Project Advisory&#xD;
      Committee will develop a strategy to disseminate the revised change package and results of&#xD;
      the Collaborative. The dissemination strategy will include outreach to three audiences based&#xD;
      on the outcomes of the Pathways Project: 1) the professional and scientific community through&#xD;
      presentations at national meetings and articles in peer-reviewed journals; 2) the large&#xD;
      dialysis organizations and those who oversee quality of dialysis care including the Forum of&#xD;
      ESKD Networks, the individual networks, and the American Health Quality Association; and 3)&#xD;
      policy makers including members of Congress and CMS to advocate for changes to improve&#xD;
      patient-centered care for patients with kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these aims we will employ three primary tactics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Breakthrough Collaborative Model - The&#xD;
           Collaborative Model is the primary intervention for this project. It has been used to&#xD;
           foster successful change adoption in numerous settings with a variety of health&#xD;
           problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The ESCO Model - ESCO stands for ESKD Seamless Care Organizations. ESCO's are a pilot&#xD;
           program conducted by CMS to test value-based payment models for dialysis care. The ESCO&#xD;
           program brings together economic incentives and organizational innovation factors to&#xD;
           create a fertile field for uptake of innovations in patient- and family-centered care in&#xD;
           the kidney care continuum. At least four of the participating dialysis centers are part&#xD;
           of ESCO demonstration. Three centers (at American Renal Associates) are part of a&#xD;
           similar private initiative to provide an integrated care model for ESKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Pathways Change Package - Provides an evidence-based set of changes and tools&#xD;
           collated from the research literature and experiences and efforts of exemplars and&#xD;
           organizations that have already successfully adopted supportive care best practices and&#xD;
           shown positive outcomes. Justification for the study: Dialysis patients have significant&#xD;
           unmet palliative care needs and arguably are the chronic disease patient population who&#xD;
           receive the worst end-of-life care because of high intensity care (intensive care unit&#xD;
           admission with frequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
           feeding tube use compared to patients with cancer and other chronic diseases) at the end&#xD;
           of life with very low referral to hospice. They have a high symptom burden, multiple&#xD;
           co-morbid illnesses, and a shortened life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A collaborative quality improvement approach with training of independent&#xD;
      dialysis centers and CKD practices in supportive care best practices will lead to&#xD;
      improvements in patient and staff-reported outcomes in patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: Will a collaborative quality improvement approach to spreading supportive&#xD;
      care best practices at dialysis centers and affiliated CKD clinics measurably increase the&#xD;
      provision of supportive care best practices leading to more effective goal-concordant care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant background information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence in the United States of a comprehensive medical management without dialysis&#xD;
      pathway which is available and selected by about 15% of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      patients in other countries is a major deficit in U.S. kidney care. In other ways as well,&#xD;
      the current care of patients with advanced CKD in the U.S. is not patient-centered, nor does&#xD;
      it utilize supportive care [i] approaches to optimize patients' quality of life. The Pathways&#xD;
      Project is seeking to address these deficits through the implementation of a Collaborative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a 2013 survey of dialysis center staff, only 4.5% of 487 respondents believed they were&#xD;
      presently providing high-quality supportive care including at the end-of-life. When asked&#xD;
      what one change could most improve supportive care in their dialysis center, the top choice&#xD;
      was &quot;guidelines to help with decision making in seriously ill patients.&quot; The second most&#xD;
      frequently selected choice was the availability of supportive care consultation to patients.&#xD;
      With the exception of a few innovative practices, specialty supportive care consultations are&#xD;
      not generally available to patients on dialysis. In those places where supportive care&#xD;
      consultation is an option for seriously ill patients on dialysis, nephrologists and their&#xD;
      teams typically have not been trained in eliciting shared decision-making, communication, and&#xD;
      symptom management skills that would help them deliver primary supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shared decision-making is a necessary component to informed consent for patients with&#xD;
      advanced CKD. The American Society of Nephrology (ASN) has recommended shared decision-making&#xD;
      prior to the initiation of dialysis. Despite ASN's recommendation, shared decision-making-the&#xD;
      process in which patients and their family collaborate with healthcare providers to develop a&#xD;
      care plan and make decisions about treatments based on patient preferences and values as well&#xD;
      as the clinical risks and advantages-is poorly integrated into the care of patients with&#xD;
      kidney disease. Most nephrologists express lack of comfort in discussing end-of-life issues.&#xD;
      Consequently, most patients with CKD and those on dialysis have little awareness of their&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients older than 75 years are the fastest growing segment of the dialysis population, but&#xD;
      these patients, especially if they are frail or have co-morbidities, may not experience a&#xD;
      survival benefit from dialysis treatment.The current default is to start elderly patients&#xD;
      with advanced kidney disease and multiple co-morbid conditions on dialysis irrespective of&#xD;
      their prognosis or likelihood of benefit. The symptom burden for patients with advanced CKD&#xD;
      is comparable to that for patients on dialysis, and symptoms are under-recognized and&#xD;
      under-treated because of lack of nephrology clinician expertise in supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptom burden of patients on dialysis rivals that of those with cancer, and their&#xD;
      five-year survival rate is worse. This tremendous suffering leads to staggering rates of&#xD;
      voluntary dialysis withdrawal as high as 35% in the oldest groups, yet hospice and supportive&#xD;
      care are underutilized. As a result, patients on dialysis are subjected to more aggressive&#xD;
      treatment at the end-of-life than patients with other serious illnesses. Most patients die in&#xD;
      the hospital and often after intensive procedures including mechanical ventilation, feeding&#xD;
      tube placement, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Families of deceased dialysis patients&#xD;
      rate the quality of their loved ones' end-of-life care worse than families of those with&#xD;
      cancer and other chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need to improve the care of patients with advanced and end stage kidney&#xD;
      disease (ESKD). The current situation offers the opportunity to intervene with multiple&#xD;
      evidence-based supportive care best practices to transform the care of these seriously ill&#xD;
      patients by improving the delivery of supportive care throughout the continuum of kidney&#xD;
      disease and making available to seriously ill patients who wish to withdraw from dialysis,&#xD;
      delay dialysis, or avoid dialysis, a pathway that offers medical management without dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [i] In surveys of patients and physicians, they prefer the term supportive care over&#xD;
      palliative care. The term palliative care will be used to refer to the specialist title of&#xD;
      physicians with board certification in hospice and palliative medicine along with specialist&#xD;
      palliative care teams and to the practice of &quot;palliative dialysis&quot; which has a particular&#xD;
      definition in the literature. Primary supportive care includes basic communication and&#xD;
      symptom management skills provided by other than specialty-trained clinicians.&#xD;

        The study population of subjects will include dialysis patients who were determined to be&#xD;
        seriously ill according to the &quot;surprise question&quot; screening tool. (360 at baseline and 360&#xD;
        at the end of the study 18 months later. This includes about 20 patients for pre-testing&#xD;
        the survey.) Facility-level monthly report: One report per dialysis center or CKD practice&#xD;
        will be obtained monthly. Reports cover all patients at the site, but data only reported in&#xD;
        aggregate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient level demographic/utilization information. This is collected on all patients who&#xD;
        are identified as seriously ill (usually 20% of patients). We expect 300 patients to be&#xD;
        identified at baseline (20% of the 1500 total patients).&#xD;
