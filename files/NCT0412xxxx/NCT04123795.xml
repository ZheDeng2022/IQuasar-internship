    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI75 response assessments are based on at least 75% improvement in the PASI score from Baseline. This is a scoring system that averages the redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic lesions (on a 0-4 scale), and weights the resulting score by the area of skin involved. Body divided into 4 areas: head, arms, trunk to groin, and legs to top of buttocks. Assignment of an average score for the redness, thickness, and scaling for each of the 4 body areas with a score of 0 (clear) to 4 (very marked). Determining the percentage of skin covered with PSO for each of the body areas and converting to a 0 to 6 scale. Final PASI= average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the psoriatic skin lesions, multiplied by the involved psoriasis area score of the respective section, and weighted by the percentage of the person's affected skin for the respective section. The minimum possible PASI score is 0= no disease, the maximum score is 72= maximal disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a child's quality of life (Lewis-Jones and Finlay, 1995). The CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire with 4 response options (Not at all/Not relevant=0, A little=1, Quite a lot=2, and Very much=3) and a recall period of 1 week. In addition to evaluating overall quality of life, the CDLQI can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and treatment. The CDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0; the higher the score, the greater impairment in quality of life.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
