  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ankle and/or foot injuries incidence is high. Lateral ankle sprains are most common&#xD;
      diagnosis, while fractures represent less than 15% of final diagnosis. Ankle and/or foot&#xD;
      injuries are associated with significant morbidity in terms of pain and chronic instability.&#xD;
      The societal cost of these injuries is significant mainly related to hospital care and&#xD;
      sick-leave. In summary ankle and/or foot injuries are very frequent reason for emergency&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that an accelerated nursing care system for traumatized ankle and/or&#xD;
      foot patients is feasible and allows patients to be cared for in accordance to current&#xD;
      medical recommendations. Such a branch should be followed by a return to work and sports&#xD;
      within a time frame consistent with the literature. The duration of patient management in&#xD;
      emergency department should be short, less than that observed in a historical cohort. Finally&#xD;
      patient satisfaction should be high. In the medium term, the implementation of an accelerated&#xD;
      nursing branch for the diagnosis and treatment of ankle and/or foot injuries should&#xD;
      contribute to effective care and reduction of over activity in emergency departments.&#xD;

      The incidence of ankle and/or foot injuries is high. Lateral ankle sprains are the most&#xD;
      common diagnosis, while fractures represent less than 15% of the final diagnosis. Ankle&#xD;
      and/or foot injuries are associated with significant morbidity in terms of pain and chronic&#xD;
      instability. The societal cost of these injuries is significant mainly related to hospital&#xD;
      care and sick-leave. Ankle and/or foot injuries are very frequent reason for emergency&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the accelerated nursing branch for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of ankle and/or foot injuries in emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Follow-Up duration: 1 month (30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Training volunteer emergency department nurses. The training course of 10-hours session&#xD;
           (2 hours e-learning and 8 hours attendance) will cover all aspects of management of&#xD;
           ankle and/or foot injuries (from diagnosis to treatment). The nurses will have at least&#xD;
           one year of clinical experience in emergency department. This training will be conducted&#xD;
           by medical experts (emergency doctor, radiologist and orthopedist ). At the end of the&#xD;
           training a formative assessment both theoretical and practical will be carried out with&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following intervention will be performed by emergency nurses:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain intensity assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Record of the trauma mechanism and history of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ottawa rules and clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Radiographic prescription and interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prescription and interpretation of additional examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Foot and Ankle Survey (FAO)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of ankle joint function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment: medicine prescription, immobilization, physiotherapy…. Following the&#xD;
                management of ankle and/or foot injuries patients by a nurse, every working day a&#xD;
                systemic review of the emergency file including X-rays performed will be carried&#xD;
                out by a medical staff composed of an emergency doctor, an orthopedist and a&#xD;
                radiologist. This review will be done every morning in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enroll patients admitted to the emergency department for ankle and/or foot injuries. The&#xD;
           ability of trained nurses to treat these traumas will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phone follow-up of patient after one month to collect data: the date of return to work&#xD;
           or sports, patient satisfaction and possible consultation (by a physician, an&#xD;
           orthopedist and/or care consummation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of data will be collected: clinical and paraclinical parameters. Clinical&#xD;
      parameters: respiratory rate, saturation, blood pressure, heart rate, Glasgow score , weight,&#xD;
      size, Numerical Scale ranges of pain , Ottawa rule, treatment, radiography..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paraclinical parameters: radiography examination, X-ray interpretation, Foot and Ankle&#xD;
      Survey(FAS), Evaluation of ankle joint function, patient satisfaction survey, follow-up at&#xD;
      one month (30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall adequacy of care will be assessed at the end of the study by a committee of&#xD;
      experts whose judgment will be based on the latest medical recommendations. This expert&#xD;
      committee will consist of an orthopedic physician, a radiologist, an emergency physician and&#xD;
      a quality health executive (nurse) and will make decisions by consensus. These members will&#xD;
      be independent of the investigators of the study. The delivered care will be considered&#xD;
      globally adequate if it respects the recognized indications of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Realization and interpretation of radiography (Ottawa criteria and early radiography&#xD;
           service protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analgesic treatments according to the recommendations of the scientific societies&#xD;
           (acetaminophen for EN&gt; 0 +/- WHO step 2 treatment for pain of moderate intensity and WHO&#xD;
           step 3 for pain of severe intensity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immobilization: according to the recommendations of the scientific societies: protocol&#xD;
           RICE (Rest, Ice,Compression and elevation) immobilization plastered in case of fracture&#xD;
           etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specialist advice: orthopedic opinion if a fracture or other severe pathology is&#xD;
           detected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Estimation enrollment: 66 participants A sample of 60 patients can be used to estimate an&#xD;
      adequate percentage of care tending towards 100% (optimal management defined by the experts),&#xD;
      with an accuracy of 5% corresponding to the lower limit of the one-sided confidence interval.&#xD;
      95% (PASS vs 15.0.5., NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA). This is equivalent to establishing&#xD;
      95% non-inferiority using an exact one-sided test with a power of 80% (Normal approximation).&#xD;
      A rate of patients lost to follow-up estimated at 10% implies that 66 patients will have to&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of managing ankle or foot&#xD;
      trauma by an emergency nurse protocol, describing the percentage of patients who are&#xD;
      adequately cared for by this protocol. Statistical methods will therefore be essentially&#xD;
      descriptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive analysis will cover all the variables collected. The quantitative parameters&#xD;
      for which normality has been accepted will be described by mean and standard deviation. They&#xD;
      will be expressed as median, 25th and 75th percentiles when normality has been rejected. The&#xD;
      qualitative parameters will be expressed in numbers and percentages framed by their 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse events The individual risk is related to a possible misdiagnosis of the nurse&#xD;
      who took care of the patient, requiring a further consultation with a general practitioner or&#xD;
      emergency. A systematic re-reading of x-rays by the daily medical staff is planned in working&#xD;
      days. Patients will be contacted directly by an emergency doctor to advise them to consult&#xD;
      their treating or specialist doctor, in case of anomaly detected during the re-reading of the&#xD;
      radiography and / or a marked adequacy on the immobilization techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following adverse events are likely to occur, related to the management of&#xD;
      on-trial trauma care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications related to limb immobilization (venous thrombosis, eschar, nerve and/or&#xD;
           vascular compression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications related to analgesics Given the purpose of the research and the low risk&#xD;
           associated with the investigation procedures, no monitoring committee and no interim&#xD;
           analysis are planned. In the event of a security alert, the expert committee will inform&#xD;
           the promoter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of an adverse event considered to be severe by the investigator and possibly&#xD;
      involving the health of the subjects, the investigator may stop the study in agreement with&#xD;
      the promoter.&#xD;
