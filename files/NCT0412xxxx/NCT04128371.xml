      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gleich syndrome is also called episodic angioedema with eosinophilia (EAE). People with EAE&#xD;
      have episodes of swelling. They may also have itching, hives, fever, and weight gain. During&#xD;
      episodes, the body has very high numbers of white blood cells, especially a kind called&#xD;
      eosinophils. Researchers think a drug called mepolizumab could help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if mepolizumab causes EAE symptoms to be less severe and happen less often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 or older with EAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under NIH protocol 94-I-0079.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 8 visits over about 6 months. The timing of some visits will depend on&#xD;
      each participant s EAE episodes. Visits will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional bone marrow collection at first or second visit. For this, a needle will be&#xD;
           inserted through the participant s hip bone into the marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get mepolizumab 3 times over about 3 months. They will get their first dose&#xD;
      when their eosinophils are at their lowest point. They will get the drug by IV. A needle will&#xD;
      guide a thin plastic tube into an arm vein. The drug will be given through the tube over&#xD;
      about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a daily online log for about 3 months. The log will track their&#xD;
      weight, temperature, and EAE symptoms. During the whole study, they will complete 2 online&#xD;
      questionnaires about their symptoms. They will fill out 1 daily and 1 monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood and urine tests 2-3 times a week. For these, they will go to&#xD;
      their local doctor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Episodic angioedema with eosinophilia (EAE), also known as Gleich s Syndrome,is a rare&#xD;
      disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of urticaria, fever, angioedema, weight gain and&#xD;
      dramatic eosinophilia that occur at 3- to 6-week intervals and resolve with spontaneous&#xD;
      diuresis in the absence of therapy. Although the syndrome is often classified in the broad&#xD;
      category of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), EAE is a distinct eosinophilic&#xD;
      syndrome that is remarkably homogeneous in clinical presentation. More recently, it has&#xD;
      become apparent that there is multilineage cycling, involving lymphocytes and neutrophils in&#xD;
      addition to eosinophils. Early studies described cyclic elevations of serum interleukin 5&#xD;
      (IL-5) preceding the rise in eosinophilia, and additional studies have shown cyclic&#xD;
      elevations in other type II cytokines as well as in eosinophilic chemokines. Aberrant T cells&#xD;
      with a CD3-CD4+ surface phenotype have also been detected in the majority of subjects with&#xD;
      EAE. The cyclic nature of the disorder and the involvement of multiple cell lineages have&#xD;
      made it difficult to determine the underlying cause of EAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that IL-5 driven eosinophilia is central to the pathogenesis of EAE.&#xD;
      Suppression of eosinophil cycling by blocking IL-5 would help determine whether eosinophils&#xD;
      are indeed the main drivers of the symptoms of angioedema and urticaria and pave the way for&#xD;
      future mechanistic studies investigating the etiology of this unusual disorder. The purpose&#xD;
      of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of mepolizumab, a humanized antibody to IL-5,&#xD;
      on eosinophil cycling in 12 subjects with EAE. Subjects with EAE will undergo screening on&#xD;
      the National Institutes of Health protocol 94-I-0079 to establish the periodicity of their&#xD;
      cycling (if not previously determined) and the optimal timing for the baseline visit. After&#xD;
      screening, subjects will be followed closely with signs and symptoms recorded in a daily log&#xD;
      and daily and monthly questionnaires, as well as complete blood counts and research blood&#xD;
      collected for one cycle prior to administration of mepolizumab. Subjects will receive a total&#xD;
      of 3 monthly administrations of mepolizumab at 700 mg, followed by drug de-escalation over 6&#xD;
      additional monthly administrations for subjects who demonstrate benefit from mepolizumab. All&#xD;
      subjects will have a follow-up visit about 1 month after the last study administration of&#xD;
      mepolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be reduction of symptoms and severity of symptoms after&#xD;
      mepolizumab. Secondary endpoints will include reduction in peak eosinophils after&#xD;
      mepolizumab, continued suppression of absolute eosinophil count and reduction in symptoms&#xD;
      following monthly dosing of mepolizumab therapy.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for participation in the study only if all of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is male or female, aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has a documented diagnosis of EAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has symptoms of EAE in the cycle prior to screening, including but not&#xD;
             limited to fever, swelling, hives or rashes, weight gain, muscle pain, and&#xD;
             lymphadenopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Cycling of eosinophils is ongoing as indicated by a peak AEC greater than or equal to&#xD;
             1500/mm^3 during at least one cycle in the prior 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If taking corticosteroids, the subject is able and willing to stay on a stable dose&#xD;
             for 6 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject agrees to storage of study samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject is able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Females are eligible for this study if they are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  of non-childbearing potential (i.e., women who have had a hysterectomy or tubal&#xD;
                  ligation or are postmenopausal as defined by no menses in 1 year); OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  of childbearing potential but willing to practice effective contraception or&#xD;
                  abstinence during administration of the study drug and for 100 days (5 terminal&#xD;
                  half-lives) after administration of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Not breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy: The effects of mepolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
        reason, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (see below&#xD;
        for acceptable methods) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and&#xD;
        for &gt;5 terminal half-lives (approximately 100 days) after administration of the last dose&#xD;
        of study drug. Nonreproductive potential is defined as post-menopausal, male partner who&#xD;
        has azoospermia or is surgically sterile (at least 6 weeks before screening) and is the&#xD;
        sole sexual partner, surgical sterility, or a congenital or acquired condition that&#xD;
        definitely prevents conception. Further, postmenopausal is defined as at least 12&#xD;
        consecutive months with no menses at age 50 or older, or a high follicle-stimulating&#xD;
        hormone level in the postmenopausal range at ages 45-50 years in subjects not using&#xD;
        hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females with reproductive potential must either practice complete and uninterrupted&#xD;
        abstinence from heterosexual activity or use 2 of the following methods of contraception&#xD;
        with their partners. The 2 methods must include either 2 barrier methods, or 1 barrier&#xD;
        method and 1 non-barrier method, both of which must be consistently used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Barrier Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diaphragm with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cervical cap with spermicide or contraceptive sponge (for nulliparous subjects only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female condom (cannot be used together)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-Barrier Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of &lt;1%&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hormonal contraception: pill (estrogen/progestin or progestin-only), patch, vaginal&#xD;
             ring, rod implanted in the skin, or subcutaneous injection methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females of childbearing-potential must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to&#xD;
        receiving mepolizumab at each on-site study visit. During the course of the study, if a&#xD;
        woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant, she should inform the study staff and&#xD;
        her primary care physician immediately. A pregnancy registry has been created for subjects&#xD;
        who become pregnant while receiving the approved dose of mepolizumab (100 mg subcutaneous&#xD;
        injection) for asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Fertility: There is no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no adverse effects&#xD;
        of anti-IL-5 treatment on fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will not be eligible to participate in the study if any of the following&#xD;
        conditions are fulfilled at the time of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents including but not limited&#xD;
             to cyclosporine, interferon-alpha, azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
             within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Treatment with biologics including but not limited to mepolizumab, IVIG, anti-TNF&#xD;
             agents, rituximab, benralizumab, alemtuzumab, reslizumab, dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and&#xD;
             omalizumab within 6 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer). Subjects who&#xD;
             received rituximab at any time in the past must have normal B-cell numbers to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Co-morbid illness, alcohol or substance abuse, or any other condition (e.g., HIV,&#xD;
             active hepatitis) that, in the opinion of the investigator, places the subject at&#xD;
             undue risk by participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Treatment with a daily dose of corticosteroids &gt;40 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials is restricted, other than&#xD;
        enrollment on observational studies or those evaluating the use of a licensed medication.&#xD;
        Study staff should be notified of co-enrollment as it may require the approval of the&#xD;
        investigator.&#xD;
