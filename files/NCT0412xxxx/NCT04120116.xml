  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2a single and repeat dose exploratory efficacy study of intratympanic FX-322&#xD;
      compared to placebo in healthy male and female adults with stable sensorineural hearing loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) accounts for about 90% of all cases of hearing loss. This&#xD;
      phase 2a study will assess the exploratory efficacy, as well as the local and systemic safety&#xD;
      of single and repeat intratympanic doses of FX-322 compared to placebo in approximately 96&#xD;
      subjects with stable mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss, with a medical&#xD;
      history consistent with either excessive noise exposure or idiopathic sudden sensorineural&#xD;
      hearing loss.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adults aged 18-65 years inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Established diagnosis of stable sensorineural hearing loss by standard audiometric&#xD;
             measures for â‰¥ 6 months prior to the Screening visit (no changes in air conduction&#xD;
             greater than 10 dB at a single frequency or greater than 5 dB at two contiguous&#xD;
             frequencies from the prior audiogram to the Screening audiogram in the study ear).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented medical history consistent with hearing loss being caused by noise exposure&#xD;
             or sudden sensorineural hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) within 26-70 dB in the ear to be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential or will need to utilize two&#xD;
             methods of highly effective contraception during the study participation (e.g.&#xD;
             hormonal contraception or an intrauterine device and condoms) or remain abstinent.&#xD;
             Male subjects should use condoms with spermicide during the course of the study or&#xD;
             remain abstinent. Subjects should not donate sperm or ova during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous participation in FX-322 clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Currently on any medication consisting of valproic acid, valproate sodium, or&#xD;
             divalproex sodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Perforation of tympanic membrane or other tympanic membrane disorders that would&#xD;
             interfere with the delivery and safety assessment of an intratympanic medication or&#xD;
             reasonably be suspected to affect tympanic membrane healing after injection in study&#xD;
             ear. This includes a current tympanostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any conductive hearing loss of greater than 15 dB at a single frequency or greater&#xD;
             than 10 dB at two or more contiguous octave frequencies in the study ear at the&#xD;
             Screening visit or on the prior audiogram (if the Investigator feels there is not a&#xD;
             true conductive hearing loss, the Medical Monitor should be consulted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active chronic middle ear disease or a history of major middle ear surgery, as an&#xD;
             adult, in the ear to be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has had an intratympanic injection in either ear within 6 months of the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of clinically significant vestibular symptoms at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of clinically significant systemic autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of head or neck radiation treatment or exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of platinum-based chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Exposure to another investigational drug within 28 days prior to injection of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Evidence of any active or chronic disease or condition that could interfere with, or&#xD;
             for which the treatment of might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that&#xD;
             would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             following a detailed medical history, physical examination, and vital signs (systolic&#xD;
             and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of substance abuse within 2 years of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Positive test for drugs of abuse at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Positive urine pregnancy test or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any known factor, condition or disease that, in the view of the Investigator, might&#xD;
             interfere with treatment compliance, study conduct or interpretation of the results&#xD;
             (e.g. previous high-dose aminoglycoside treatment).&#xD;
