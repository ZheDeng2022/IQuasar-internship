    <measure>Safety and tolerability - Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AE).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 will be used to evaluate the clinical safety of the treatment in this study. Intensity of all adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v 4.0 on a five-point scale (Grade 1 to 5). AEs not listed on the NCI-CTCAE should be graded according below. Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life threatening/disabling; Grade 5: Death.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) - QoL will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Trial in Cancer QOL core (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire (version 3) [Quality of life questionnaire - QLQ]</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionaire of 30-item and it incorporates 9 multi-item scales:5 functional scales (Physical,Role,Cognitive,Emotional and Social Functioning);3 symptom scales (Fatigue,Pain and Nausea/Vomiting) and a Global Health Status/QoL scale.6 single item scales are also included (Dyspnoea,Insomnia,Appetite Loss,Constipation,Diarrhoea and Financial Difficulties).Version 3.0 has 4-point scales for the first 5 items comprising the Physical Functioning scale.These are coded with the same response categories as items 6 to 28,namely &quot;1 Not at all&quot; (minimum value),&quot;2 A little&quot;,&quot;3 Quite a bit&quot; and &quot;4 Very much&quot; (maximum value).The last 2 question foresee a 7-point response scale:minimum value is &quot;1 Very poor&quot;,maximum value is &quot;7 Excellent&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) - QoL will be assessed using disease specific modules for Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET), the EORTC QLQ GINET21 (EORTC QLQ Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors 21).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-GINET21 contains 21 items:4 single-item assessments relating to muscle and/or bone pain (MBP),body image (BI),information (INF) and sexual functioning (SX),together with 17 items organised into 5 proposed scales:endocrine symptoms (ED 3 items),GI symptoms (GI 5 items),treatment-related symptoms (TR 3 items),social functioning (SF) of the new module (SF21, 3 items) and disease-related worries (DRW 3 items).The response format of the questionnaire is a 4-point Likert scale:&quot;1 Not at all&quot; (minimum value),&quot;2 A little&quot;,&quot;3 Quite a bit&quot; and &quot;4 Very much&quot; (maximum value).</description>
