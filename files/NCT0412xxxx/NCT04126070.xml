      This research study is studying a combination of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      immunotherapy as a possible treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a drug of your physician's choice. This may&#xD;
           include leuprolide (Lupron), goserelin acetate (Zoladex), or degarelix (Firmagon).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Docetaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase 2 clinical trial. Phase 2 clinical trials test the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of investigational drug(s) to learn whether the drug(s) work in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug(s) are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved nivolumab for hormone sensitive&#xD;
      prostate cancer. However, nivolumab has been approved for other uses, including for advanced&#xD;
      melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, kidney cancer, and bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. FDA has not approved docetaxel as a treatment option for hormone sensitive prostate&#xD;
      cancer. However, docetaxel is approved for advanced hormone resistant prostate cancer and&#xD;
      other cancers. There is also evidence from a high quality, phase 3 randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      supporting the use of docetaxel in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients who&#xD;
      have a high burden of metastasis. Docetaxel is an off-label indication for hormone sensitive&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. FDA has approved androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) agents, including leuprolide&#xD;
      (Lupron), goserelin acetate (Zoladex), or degarelix (Firmagon), as a treatment option for&#xD;
      hormone sensitive prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of ADT, also called hormonal therapy, with docetaxel chemotherapy and&#xD;
      nivolumab immunotherapy is considered investigational. ADT cuts off the supply of&#xD;
      testosterone and is the standard of care for hormone sensitive prostate cancer. The addition&#xD;
      of docetaxel chemotherapy has been found to prolong life for prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      starting hormonal therapy for the first time for metastatic disease, who also have a large&#xD;
      volume of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another anti-cancer treatment modality is called immunotherapy. The immune system can kill&#xD;
      cells that are recognized as different or dangerous, such as infected cells and cancer cells.&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an antibody (a type of human protein) that work to stimulate the body's immune&#xD;
      system to recognize and fight cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy may make cancer cells more recognizable to the immune&#xD;
      system, and make cancer cells more susceptible to immunotherapy. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      examine the activity and safety of hormonal therapy combined with docetaxel chemotherapy and&#xD;
      nivolumab immunotherapy for hormone sensitive prostate cancer. The study is designed to&#xD;
      enrich for patients whose tumors may be more most responsive to this treatment strategy. All&#xD;
      patients will receive the same treatment of ADT combined with docetaxel chemotherapy and&#xD;
      nivolumab immunotherapy.&#xD;

               -  Subjects who underwent successful ImmunoProfile pre-screening but failed&#xD;
                  OncoPanel pre-screening may be allocated to Cohort 2 or Cohort 3 based on&#xD;
                  ImmunoProfile results and assuming DDRD negativity, at the discretion of the&#xD;
                  Sponsor-Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Before one of the study cohorts enrolls 15 of 20 subjects (Cohort 3 is&#xD;

                  treatment if they meet all eligibility criteria with the exception that OncoPanel&#xD;
                  analysis is ongoing. These patients will be allocated into their respective&#xD;
                  cohort after OncoPanel results return.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to provide leftover metastatic biopsy tissue for correlative studies, if&#xD;
             obtained for clinical purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, nivolumab can cause&#xD;
             fetal harm. For this reason non-sterilized men who are sexually active with a female&#xD;
             partner of childbearing potential treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for 7 months after last dose of nivolumab administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate contraception includes male condom plus spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Not engaging in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional&#xD;
                  abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable&#xD;
                  methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects in this study should refrain from sperm donation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document,&#xD;
             or have a legally authorized representative sign on the subject's behalf&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have received prior ADT (LHRH analogue +/- antiandrogen),&#xD;
             chemotherapy, or immunotherapy for prostate cancer. The following exception is&#xD;
             allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to docetaxel (including any drugs formulated with polysorbate 80),&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure as defined by the Site Investigator within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;

             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. HIV-positive subjects on combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for nivolumab to be&#xD;
             less clinically active in this population. In addition, these subjects are at&#xD;
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive chemotherapy&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Celiac disease controlled by diet alone&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with inactive disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after&#xD;
                  consultation with the study physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection including tuberculosis, hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface&#xD;

                  hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with positive HCV antibody are eligible if polymerase chain reaction is&#xD;
                  negative for HCV RNA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the&#xD;
             first dose of study chemoimmunotherapy, with the following exceptions:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g.,&#xD;
                  intraarticular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not exceeding 10mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or its equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., premedication for&#xD;
                  iodinated contrast allergy before CT scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of Minorities&#xD;
&#xD;
