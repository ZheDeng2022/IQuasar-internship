  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute low back pain is the fifth most common presenting complaint to the emergency&#xD;
      department, accounting for approximately 4.4% of annual visits. The treatment for acute low&#xD;
      back pain is often NSAIDs or other analgesic medications. Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment&#xD;
      (OMT) has been shown to be an effective treatment modality for acute low back pain, however,&#xD;
      it's use in the emergency department setting is not well described. The adjunct of OMT has&#xD;
      the potential to increase patient satisfaction, decrease length of stay and decrease the&#xD;
      number of unnecessary prescription medications. We plan to investigate the use of OMT in the&#xD;
      setting of acute complaints of low back pain in comparison to the use of nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as primary treatment modality. The study will be a&#xD;
      non-blinded randomized-control trial and will take place in an academic tertiary care center&#xD;
      in urban Philadelphia, PA over an approximate one-year timespan. We will utilize&#xD;
      osteopathic-trained attending and resident physicians to perform the manipulation. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into one of three treatment groups: appropriately dosed NSAID therapy&#xD;
      alone, OMT in addition to NSAID therapy, or OMT alone. The primary outcome will be the&#xD;
      difference in pain score before and after treatment using a VAS scale. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include patient and physician satisfaction immediately following treatment. Results will&#xD;
      be shared by means of publication to the osteopathic and allopathic communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to describe the efficacy of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment&#xD;
      (OMT) compared to NSAIDs in decreasing pain in adults with acute low back pain in the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED). This study would provide an additional novel adjunct for pain&#xD;
      management of painful procedures in the emergency department. Currently in the emergency&#xD;
      department the complaint of low back pain comprises 4.4% of visits annually and is an area of&#xD;
      patient dissatisfaction surrounding the pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this project will be measure the level of pain pre and post procedure in&#xD;
      adults receiving ibuprofen (NSAID), OMT, or OMT/ibuprofen for low back pain. Secondary aims&#xD;
      include patient and physician post procedure satisfaction scores, length of stay in ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Measure the level of pain pre and post procedures in adults receiving ibuprofen, OMT,&#xD;
      or OMT/Ibuprofen. Hypothesis: The level of pain for patients receiving OMT will be decreased&#xD;
      to a greater extent that those receiving only NSAIDs for low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM2: Measure the patient and physician satisfaction with the adjunct of OMT in regard to&#xD;
      ability to manage pain based on satisfaction scores from questionnaire. Hypothesis: There&#xD;
      will be greater satisfaction in the patients receiving OMT and OMT/NSAIDs than those&#xD;
      receiving only OMT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, randomized- controlled trial of patients with acute low&#xD;
      back pain in the ED of an urban, tertiary, academic medical center. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of three groups: Ibuprofen (800 mg), Ibuprofen (800 mg)/OMT, or OMT only&#xD;
      for the treatment of acute low back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research associates as well as the health care team (both residents and attending&#xD;
      physicians) will screen patients who present to the ED with the chief complaint of back pain&#xD;
      and may qualify for the study. Research associates will use the electronic medical record for&#xD;
      screening, and they will be in charge of informed consent, enrollment, as well as data&#xD;
      collection. The research study team (osteopathic emergency physicians) will be in charge of&#xD;
      performing the OMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Involved in the Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial medical assessment will be made in accordance with established clinical procedures,&#xD;
      including the history, physical examination, and vital signs. If by clinical assessment the&#xD;
      patient meets eligibility criteria, then they will be approached by a research associate for&#xD;
      enrollment in the study and will obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, the patient will fill out a pre intervention 100 mm VAS baseline pain&#xD;
      scale. The patient will be randomized to one of the three treatment arms; NSAID (ibuprofen),&#xD;
      OMT/NSAID (ibuprofen), or OMT alone by using a randomization scheme generated using the web&#xD;
      site Randomization.com (http://www.randomization.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, subjects in the NSAID arm will be assessed using a VAS prior to medication&#xD;
      administration. They will then be given 800 mg of ibuprofen and subjects' pain will be&#xD;
      assessed using the VAS at 45 minutes after NSAID administration. Subjects in the NSAID/OMT&#xD;
      arm will be assessed using a VAS prior to medication administration and OMT. They will then&#xD;
      be given 800 mg of ibuprofen and within 10 minutes will receive OMT. The subject's pain will&#xD;
      be assessed using the VAS at 45 minutes after NSAID administration and completion of OMT. The&#xD;
      OMT only arm will be assessed using a VAS prior to any OMT. OMT will then be performed and&#xD;
      subjects' pain will be assessed using the VAS at 45 minutes after OMT is completed. The&#xD;
      method of OMT will be left to the discretion of the treating physician, but will be recorded&#xD;
      in the data collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's clinical data (refer to data management) will be entered into a standardized&#xD;
      data collection form. Study will end 45-60 minutes after randomized intervention. Once the&#xD;
      procedure is complete subjects will fill out a post procedure satisfaction questionnaire. The&#xD;
      physician will also fill out a post procedure questionnaire.&#xD;
