  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the hydronidone capsules (specification: 30&#xD;
      mg/particle, test preparation) developed by Shanghai Ruixing Gene Technology corporation with&#xD;
      Self reference preparation hydronidone capsule (specification: 15 mg/capsule) Differences in&#xD;
      the extent and rate of absorption of healthy male subjects in Fasting state in China. Through&#xD;
      the main pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioavailability, whether the two are&#xD;
      bioequivalent, and provide a basis for the registration of the test preparation&#xD;
