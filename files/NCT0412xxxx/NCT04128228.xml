  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early trauma is associated with clinical challenges in treatment alcoholism, including&#xD;
      complex clinical symptoms and higher relapse rates. To better understand this phenomena, this&#xD;
      study will examine the neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcoholism, early trauma, and&#xD;
      high relapse risk. The current study utilizes a multimodal neuroimaging technique combining&#xD;
      brain and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) measures in a prospective clinical&#xD;
      outcome design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will recruit four demographically-matched groups (total N=160; N=40 each;&#xD;
      equal gender) including alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients with and without early trauma,&#xD;
      and healthy controls with and without early trauma. General study procedures include&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan(s), eight weeks of outpatient treatment,&#xD;
      and a follow-up phase. During the fMRI session, participants will engage in a task involving&#xD;
      the viewing of stress, alcohol, neutral pictures using a well-validated sustained emotion&#xD;
      provocation task, while their brain and stress hormone data are concurrently collected.&#xD;
      Controls will participate in a single fMRI session at baseline, and AUD patients will&#xD;
      participate in two fMRI sessions before and after outpatient treatment. Subsequently after&#xD;
      the scan(s), all participants will be prospectively followed for daily monitoring of stress,&#xD;
      alcohol, and health related behaviors using a smartphone app. Controls will be followed for&#xD;
      30 days. AUD patients will be followed for 90 days, which includes face-to-face interviews at&#xD;
      14, 30, 90 days in addition to daily monitoring using a mobile app.&#xD;
