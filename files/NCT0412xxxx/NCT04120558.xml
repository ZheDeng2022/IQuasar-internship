  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major lower limb amputation is a life changing surgical procedure to treat complications of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease. The level of function after amputation is&#xD;
      dependent on pre-morbid levels of activity, age, co-morbidities and the level of amputation.&#xD;
      The level of amputation performed is determined by level of disease and surgical assessment.&#xD;
      Below knee amputation provides the best functional outcomes due to the benefits of keeping&#xD;
      the knee intact. When a below knee amputation is not possible, routine practice is to perform&#xD;
      an above knee amputation. Greater challenges for rehabilitation present at this level due to&#xD;
      the shorter lever. Amputation through the knee is less commonly performed despite its&#xD;
      reported benefits which include a long mechanical lever arm, an endbearing stump and greater&#xD;
      muscle control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review recommends further comparison of through knee and above knee&#xD;
      amputation. The recommended areas of research are gait biomechanics and quality of life for&#xD;
      these patient groups. Therefore, the aim of this research is to compare and contrast the&#xD;
      long-term functional mobility and quality of life outcomes of limb wearing through knee and&#xD;
      above knee amputees. The study will be split into two workstreams, the first focusing on&#xD;
      functional outcomes and the second focusing on quality of life using semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;

    <description>Semi-structured interviews will be undertaken with at least 24 and up to as many as 36 through knee and above knee amputees. A topic guide will be used to interview participants about perceived functional ability, body image, adapting post amputation and overall quality of life. A sampling frame will be used to ensure a range of views are sought (e.g. both men and women with through and above knee amputations; and with different mobility levels). Thematic analysis will be used to analyse the data. Focus group discussions will be informed by the findings of the interviews.&#xD;
The themes that emerge from the semi-structured interviews will be further explored using focus groups and allow for comparison of the experiences between through knee and above knee amputees.</description>

    <description>Function in sitting and sit-and-reach will be assessed in non-ambulatory (wheelchair users) individuals. An overall score for each sitting activity will be recorded and the distance reached will be calculated.&#xD;
Walking, timed-up-and-go, L-test, balance in sitting and standing, seated activities will be assessed in ambulatory (prosthetic using) individuals. The time taken, distance walked, distance reached, and the overall scores for each activity will be compared between the two groups. Fear of falls and confidence levels when performing tasks will be investigated using two questionnaires.&#xD;
The EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 will be issued to the non-ambulatory and ambulatory participants to complete when attending the testing session.&#xD;
