  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare and severe congenital developmental disorder&#xD;
      characterized by congenital anomalies and intellectual disability with a long term memory&#xD;
      deficit. The main challenge is to improve the intellectual and memory efficiency of these&#xD;
      patients. CREBBP and EP300 are the two genes known to cause RSTS. Both paralogs play a major&#xD;
      role in chromatin remodeling and encode for transcriptional co-activators interacting with&#xD;
      many proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to characterize the histone acetylation profiles in order to&#xD;
      identify specific acetylation markers during normal and pathological neuronal differentiation&#xD;
      of cortical and pyramidal neurons in RSTS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CREBBP and EP300 are the two paralog genes associated with RSTS determinism and code for CBP&#xD;
      and p300, respectively. These proteins are transcriptional coactivators that possess a&#xD;
      catalytic lysine acetyl transferase (KAT) domain involved in the acetylation of lysine&#xD;
      residues of histones but also other proteins. CBP and p300 promote transcription by creating&#xD;
      a chromatin environment that is favorable for gene expression and by linking different&#xD;
      transcription factors to each other. They thus orchestrate the regulation of the&#xD;
      transcription machinery, from the basal promoter to the enhancers of the target genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSTS is considered a genetic model of neurodevelopmental anomaly with an epigenetic&#xD;
      component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histone acetylation is one of the major post-translational modifications (PTMs) of these&#xD;
      proteins that provide for the formation and control of chromatin structure. When&#xD;
      differentiating embryonic cells, this modification plays a key role in transcriptional&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mouse models of RSTS have made the link between the modulation of histone acetylation and&#xD;
      the formation of memory by showing their key role in neuronal plasticity. However no data&#xD;
      exists on the acetylation of histones in the neurons of RSTS patients. Furthermore, in&#xD;
      humans, the molecular pathways impacted by these alterations during neurodevelopment are not&#xD;
      specified, especially in the pyramidal neurons which are the precursors of hippocampal&#xD;
      neurons involved in the encoding and storage of memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In RSTS a loss of CBP function results in a deficit in KAT activity, which is responsible for&#xD;
      altering histone acetylation, leading to inappropriate changes in chromatin structure. The&#xD;
      consequence of a mutation is a result of a deregulation of the activity of genes involved in&#xD;
      development. No neuronal level studies are currently available on the functional link between&#xD;
      histone acetylation and deregulated genes in the RSTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, investigators will identify target genes whose epigenetic regulation is&#xD;
      mediated by histone acetylation. More specifically, the study will focus on chromatin&#xD;
      dynamics during normal and pathological neuronal differentiation of cortical and pyramidal&#xD;
      neurons. Investigators will determine among the CBP-dependent histone markers, those that are&#xD;
      modified in RSTS patients cells and the loci they control. In parallel, investigators will&#xD;
      define genes whose neuronal expression is altered in RSTS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integration of all these data will allow us to specify which genes are deregulated during&#xD;
      neuronal differentiation as a consequence of CBP lysine acetyltransferase function loss.&#xD;
