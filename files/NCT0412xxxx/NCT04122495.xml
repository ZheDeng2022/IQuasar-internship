      This project aims to study the benefits of probiotics namely Bifidobacterium lactis M8 in&#xD;
      treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in young children, which are found&#xD;
      common among children in Malaysia aged from 0-24 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Respiratory illnesses are the most common acute diseases in children where no virtually&#xD;
      effective treatments or prophylaxes are available for these infections. Probiotics on the&#xD;
      other hand have gained increasing evidences as an effective therapy in preventing respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections. While the precise mechanisms of using probiotics in management of&#xD;
      respiratory infections are largely unknown, speculations include: probiotics compete against&#xD;
      pathogens; increase the barrier function in respiratory epithelium; immunostimulatory effects&#xD;
      by enhancing cellular immunity with increased activity of natural killer cells and&#xD;
      macrophages in airways. Hence, probiotics may offer safe means of reducing the risk of early&#xD;
      respiratory related illnesses, common cold and antibiotic use, and the risk of recurrent&#xD;
      respiratory infections, thereby represent a simple, safe, effective, available and affordable&#xD;
      method for preventing respiratory infections in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the various types of probiotics, Bifidobacterium is one of the best-known probiotic&#xD;
      genus in the world, and it is widely applied in the dairy industry as a probiotic. Evidences&#xD;
      from more than 100 scientific publications based on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies&#xD;
      and long consumption history support the safety and health benefits of Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      strains. The ingestion of yogurt fortified with B. longum reduced harmful bacteria such as&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus and C. perfringens, while at the same time alter the&#xD;
      microbiota gut profile of volunteers with a significant increase of beneficial microbes&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. Additionally, putrefactive substances in the&#xD;
      intestinal environment were also reduced in the presence of the probiotic supplement. Such&#xD;
      findings suggest that Bifidobacterium strains are safe and could be used further to evaluate&#xD;
      its effect in preventing diarrhea and/or respiratory-related illness prevalence in young&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium lactis M8 was isolated from breast milk samples collected from healthy woman&#xD;
      in China. M8 was selected as it was the best among 857 other strains with excellent tolerance&#xD;
      to gastric acid, intestinal fluid and bile salt of the digestive system. M8 is manufactured&#xD;
      under a ISO9001 and ISO22000 certified manufacturing plant (JinHua YinHe Biological&#xD;
      Technology Co. Ltd., China). M8 does not contain any porcine or bovine ingredients and has&#xD;
      obtained the HALAL certification from ARA HALAL Development Services Center Inc. (ARA), which&#xD;
      is recognized by JAKIM, Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M8 is incorporated and sold in the market of China, Taiwan and Singapore in a variety of&#xD;
      products, ranging from dairy (yoghurt and fermented milk). The product M8 contains good&#xD;
      bacteria Bifidobacterium lactis M8 and primarily maltodextrin as carrier while placebo&#xD;
      contains primarily maltodextrin. Sachets of products containing probiotic M8 and placebo&#xD;
      appear as light yellow powder. Both M8 and placebo products are kept at storage temperature&#xD;
      range below 30oC according to the condition recommended by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 120 respiratory-related hospitalized children from age 0-24 months old will&#xD;
      be recruited for this study.&#xD;
