      This study will test the feasibility and acceptability of increasing PA in metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer (MBC) patients using a smartphone app, fitbit and coaching.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the present study is to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of a 12 week mHealth intervention to increase PA in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients&#xD;
      using a two-arm randomized control trial (RCT). We will also examine the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on symptom burden, quality of life, and functional performance. Inactive MBC&#xD;
      patients (n=50) will be assigned to Fit2ThriveMB or education control. Participants assigned&#xD;
      to the Fit2ThriveMB will receive the Fit2ThriveMB smartphone app, Fitbit, and coaching calls.&#xD;
      Participants in the education control will be asked to download the app cancer.net from the&#xD;
      American Society of Clinical Oncology, will receive educational materials and calls during&#xD;
      the intervention period and the Fitbit following completion of 12 week assessments.&#xD;

    <description>The Fit2thriveMB app will encourage participants to increase their physical activity. Participants will be provided with educational information on physical activity and effective behavior change strategies for incorporating more physical activity into their daily lives to increase their step count. Participants will be prompted each morning to report the intensity of their symptom burden (0 to 10). Based on their symptom rating and their previous day's step counts, participants will be provided with three different options or levels of goals for that day to either increase or decrease 10-20% or remain constant.</description>
