  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with stable autoimmune hepatitis disease currently being administered&#xD;
      corticosteroids with or without azathioprine (AZA) treatment will be be treated with&#xD;
      Cannabidiol instead of standard of care treatment with corticosteroids&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be included if they are in stable remission with a prednisone at the lower&#xD;
      stable dose to maintain remission with or without azathioprine , Budesonide with or without&#xD;
      azathioprine or azathioprine alone for at least 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be switch from standard of care to treatment with Cannabidiol for 12 months.&#xD;
      They will receive increasing doses of Cannabidiol over a period of one month. Dosage will&#xD;
      start at 25 mg Cannabidiol twice a day and will be increased every seven days, if no side&#xD;
      effects are observed, to 50 mg, 100 mg and finally to 150 mg Cannabidiol twice a day&#xD;
      respectively, as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this month, if the 150 mg twice a day dose level is deemed safe for one week,&#xD;
      the standard of care will be stopped at once and patients will continue receiving only&#xD;
      Cannabidiol 150 mg twice a day for an additional period of 11 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be offered to undergo liver biopsy in the screening period to prove&#xD;
      histological remission along with the biochemical remission (not mandatory for inclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 months of treatment with Cannabidiol all patient will undergo liver biopsy for&#xD;
      confirmation of histological remission and then the treatment will be stopped as for&#xD;
      physician decision and guidelines of treatment of autoimmune hepatitis disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case of flare defined as elevation in liver enzymes and immunoglobulins in consecutive&#xD;
      blood test the patient will reintroduced for standard of care treatment at a dosage as of&#xD;
      investigator decision and the Cannabidiol will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be withdrawn from the study but will continue follow up until returning to&#xD;
      stable inactive disease as define as normalization of liver enzymes and immunoglobulin level&#xD;
      in consecutive blood tests.&#xD;
