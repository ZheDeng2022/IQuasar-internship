      This Community-Based Participatory Action Research (CBPAR) aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a community-based participatory English as a Second Language (ESL) health&#xD;
           literacy curriculum for lead exposure that can be used in other locations or programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the outcomes of the curriculum, including changes in knowledge about lead,&#xD;
           access to health resources, and health behavioral changes to reduce lead exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the implementation of the ESL health literacy curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research focuses on ESL health literacy classes provided to Hispanic adults to reduce&#xD;
      lead exposure. This research will use a pilot test with a pre-post test design. The program&#xD;
      will last for 8 weeks; with weeks 1 and 8 as the assessment weeks. The curriculum uses&#xD;
      pedagogies that move participants from health literacy as functional skill to health literacy&#xD;
      as social practice where knowledge is used for empowerment and meaningful change. The goals&#xD;
      of this research are to demonstrate increased health literacy knowledge, improved health&#xD;
      behaviors, increased access to health services, and improved English language proficiency for&#xD;
      Hispanic residents of Flint in relation to lead exposure prevention.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will last 8-weeks, and the first and last classes will be devoted to survey assessments. Participants will be asked to reflect on their health knowledge and behaviors, and how they have changed since starting the program. The curriculum administered during the classes will use pedagogies for health literacy as a practice. It will focus on skills needed to learn about lead exposure in the ESL classroom: (1) vocabulary; (2) grammar; and (3) identifying risk factors, symptoms and preventive strategies. A focus on health literacy as practice will include personal engagement using language in context: (1) role-play interactions about lead exposure prevention; (2) discussing views about risk, and how to talk about it with peers and family members; (3) identifying sources of reliable health information; and (4) learning to ask for support and resources.</description>
