    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project funded by the Foundation Fighting Blindness is to&#xD;
      characterize the natural history of disease progression in patients with EYS mutations in&#xD;
      order to accelerate the development of outcome measures for clinical trials.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This natural history study of patients with EYS mutations will accelerate the development of&#xD;
      outcome measures for clinical trials. Sensitive, reliable outcome measures of retinal&#xD;
      degeneration will greatly facilitate development of treatments for retinitis pigmentosa due&#xD;
      to EYS mutations. Together these approaches are expected to have an impact on understanding&#xD;
      EYS-related retinal degeneration, developing experimental treatment protocols, and assessing&#xD;
      their effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals and expected impact of this natural history study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the natural history of retinal degeneration in patients with biallelic&#xD;
           mutations in the EYS gene&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify sensitive structural and functional outcome measures to use for future&#xD;
           multicenter clinical trials in EYS-related retinal degeneration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify well-defined subpopulations for future clinical trials of investigative&#xD;
           treatments for EYS-related retinal degeneration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the natural history study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize the natural history of retinal degeneration associated with biallelic&#xD;
           pathogenic mutations in the EYS gene over 4 years, as measured using functional,&#xD;
           structural, and patient-reported outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate whether structural outcome measures can be validated as surrogates for&#xD;
           functional outcomes in individuals with biallelic pathogenic mutations in the EYS gene&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate possible risk factors (genotype, phenotype, environmental, and comorbidities)&#xD;
           for progression of the outcome measures at 4 years in individual with biallelic&#xD;
           pathogenic mutations in the EYS gene&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate variability and symmetry of left and right eye outcomes over 4 years in&#xD;
           individuals with biallelic pathogenic mutations in the EYS gene&#xD;
