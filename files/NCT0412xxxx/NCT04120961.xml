  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the development of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with coronary&#xD;
      heart disease (CHD), unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LWMH)&#xD;
      have been the preferred anticoagulants in peri-operative period. However, UFH has some&#xD;
      defects, such as incomplete and unstable inhibition of thrombin, large individual&#xD;
      differences, multiple monitoring of activated coagulation time (ACT), ineffective thrombin&#xD;
      binding to fibrin, non-specific protein binding and induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Compared&#xD;
      with UFH, LWMH has lower non-specific protein binding rate, but it is not superior to UFH in&#xD;
      efficacy, hemorrhage and HIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bivalirudin can bind specifically to thrombin catalytic site and anionic external binding&#xD;
      site, directly inhibit thrombin activity, thereby inhibiting thrombin-catalyzed and induced&#xD;
      reactions. At the same time, thrombin can also inactivate it by enzymatic hydrolysis of&#xD;
      bivalirudin. Therefore, the inhibition of bivalirudin on thrombin is reversible and&#xD;
      transient, and the risk of bleeding after drug withdrawal is relative small. It has been&#xD;
      reported that bivalirudin can significantly reduce the risk of peri-operative bleeding during&#xD;
      PCI period compared with UFH. Clopidogrel had not yet played a role in most patients after&#xD;
      emergency PCI, and there was a &quot;blank period&quot; for 2-4 hours without effective antithrombotic&#xD;
      concentration, which was also the peak period of acute stent thrombosis. Han and coworkers&#xD;
      have shown that for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients undergoing emergency PCI,&#xD;
      whether or not glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were added, prolonged peri-operative use of&#xD;
      bivalrudin was significantly better than UFH in terms of net clinical adverse event. However,&#xD;
      for patients with elective PCI (ePCI), prolonged bivalirudin use was only used in some&#xD;
      patients in REPLACE-2 and ISAR-REACT-3 studies, and the prolonged time of bivalrudin use&#xD;
      after ePCI was not definite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in the current study we aim to explore the efficacy and safety of prolonged&#xD;
      bivalirudin use 4 hours after elective PCI in patients with CHD.&#xD;

      The current study is designed as a single-center, randomized and prospective study aiming to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of prolonged continuous use of bivalirudin 4 hours after&#xD;
      ePCI for the treatment of peri-operative myocardial injury (PMI) compared with the&#xD;
      bivalirudin use during ePCI. Based on previous study reported and estimated 10% loss&#xD;
      follow-up of these patients in each arm, a total of 330 patients with CHD were required in&#xD;
      our study, and with 165 patients per group as a ratio of 1:1 randomization.&#xD;
