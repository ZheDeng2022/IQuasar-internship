  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a sustainable non-elemental diet can be used as&#xD;
      a probiotic tool to alter the dysbiotic microbiome found in individuals with ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis and thereby decrease disease activity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC), is&#xD;
      complex and poorly understood, but the current hypothesis is that IBD arises from an aberrant&#xD;
      immune response to commensal bacteria in a genetically susceptible host, and is triggered by&#xD;
      environmental factors. Environmental factors such as the microbiome and diet, play a&#xD;
      significant role in the risk of IBD. Diet has been identified as one of the main drivers of&#xD;
      the microbiome composition and the microbiome and diet can work in tandem to affect host&#xD;
      physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of patient interest in diet and numerous diet studies, currently there is no diet&#xD;
      that is clinically validated or universally agreed upon for adult IBD patients. We also lack&#xD;
      rigorous studies to show how the microbiome is influenced by diet and affects patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to use a sustainable non-elemental diet aimed at altering the microbiome in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderately active UC to alter their disease activity.&#xD;
