  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation remains an important unmet medical need. Patients are currently often&#xD;
      dissatisfied with treatment, because of lack of predictability of the laxative, side effects&#xD;
      (mainly abdominal pain) and perceived decrease of efficacy with time. A recent systematic&#xD;
      review1 of a range of laxatives reported that bisacodyl increases the number of complete&#xD;
      spontaneous bowel movements statistically significant compared to placebo. Recently&#xD;
      non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques have been developed to assess small&#xD;
      intestinal fluid distribution, transit and motility as well as colonic fluid, volumes and&#xD;
      motility in healthy volunteers and constipated subjects. Other laxatives such as movecol and&#xD;
      ispaghula have been investigated using this methodology. This study will use these novel&#xD;
      techniques to further characterize bisacodyl's mode of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to assess the effect of multiple doses of bisacodyl on the gut motor&#xD;
      function and its effect on water distribution within the small and large intestine in&#xD;
      subjects with occasional constipation by MRI. It may allow better understanding of the&#xD;
      relative importance of both the secretory and the prokinetic effect of bisacodyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since bisacodyl, is often used by self-medicating people with constipation it is proposed to&#xD;
      study subjects suffering from occasional constipation. As such subjects often take the drug&#xD;
      intermittently it would be of interest to study both the acute response after single dose and&#xD;
      the response after several days of treatment to see if this alters the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will be performed as a cross-over with 2-period and 2-treatment&#xD;
      (bisacodyl/placebo), for assessing the effects over of multiple doses of 5mg bisacodyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations will be performed after multiple doses of bisacodyl or placebo in two different&#xD;
      time periods, separated by a 2 week washout period between end of period 1 and start of&#xD;
      period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit individuals ≥18yrs from the general public who consider themselves as&#xD;
      suffering from occasional constipation and who self-medicate with an occasional over-the&#xD;
      counter (OTC) laxative, not more than once a week. Up to 18 adult healthy subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited to ensure 10 evaluable subjects. An evaluable subject is defined as participant&#xD;
      having the primary endpoint assessed (ascending colon T1 300, 375, and 450 minutes correctly&#xD;
      evaluated) for the two periods of the crossover.&#xD;
