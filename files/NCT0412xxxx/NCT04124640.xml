  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decrease or absence sexual desire and arousal is the alteration of the sexual sphere that&#xD;
      women most commonly refer to in adulthood and old age. Many women can refer a decrease or&#xD;
      absence of desire and / or arousal without having the disorder typified in the DSM-5, but&#xD;
      that can cause discomfort, worry and relationship problems in their day to day. Libicare® is&#xD;
      a food supplement whose ingredients could have positive effects on the improvement of sexual&#xD;
      function in women with low desire and arousal levels. The main ingredients of Libicare® are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trigonella Foenum-graecum (Trigonella) (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tribulus Terrestris (Tribulus) (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Turnera Diffusa (Damiana) (3)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to describe the effectivity of LIBICARE® in the improvement of desire&#xD;
      and sexual arousal in women between 45 and 65 years old, in real life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the 6 domains of the EVAS-M scale at 2 and 4 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the safety of LIBICARE® by collecting serious and non-serious adverse&#xD;
           events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of patient satisfaction with treatment at 2 and 4 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapeutic compliance in taking the food supplement at 2 and 4 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of the hormonal variation in relation to the values of total testosterone, free&#xD;
           testosterone and SHBG, at the beginning, at 2 months and at 4 months of treatment, in&#xD;
           those patients in which it is determined by routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the degree of usefulness of the EVAS-M scale in clinical practice after 4&#xD;
           months of treatment.&#xD;
