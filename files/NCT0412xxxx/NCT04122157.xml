      Summary from initial protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: Validation of the uncoated SL-PLUS® MIA stem within an observation study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective, single-center, observational, non-comparative study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 135 consecutive cases (uncoated SL-PLUS® MIA implants)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Implantation of a total hip endoprosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main goals/endpoints: Radiological: radiolucent lines, osteolysis, hypo- and hypertrophy of&#xD;
      the cortex, loosening of the implant or migration; clinical: Harris Hip Score,&#xD;
      implant-related complications, revisions; patient questionnaire (WOMAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type and extent of the risks associated with the study participation as well as benefits for&#xD;
      the patient: All patients will benefit from the hip prostheses without exception. There are&#xD;
      no increased risks for the patients participating in the study compared to patients who do&#xD;
      not participate. Normal, necessary follow-up exams will be performed over the course of 10&#xD;
      years. These follow-up exams will then be quantitatively evaluated within the scope of the&#xD;
      study in accordance with a standardized protocol. Accordingly, the benefit for the patients&#xD;
      from the participation in the study is currently not yet foreseeable.&#xD;

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HHS) is a clinician-based outcome measure frequently used for the evaluation of patients following a total hip arthroplasty.The score considers information on pain, function and range of motion. The scale ranges from 0 - 100 whereas, a higher score indicates a favorable outcome.</description>

    <measure>WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:&#xD;
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on I off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties. The scale ranges from 0 - 100 whereas, a higher score indicates a favorable outcome.</description>
