  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Widespread recognition of the current and projected impact of the dementia epidemic has&#xD;
      spurred research into novel drug discovery efforts. It is well recognized by most that&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease is not the only form of dementia and that beginning to turn attention to&#xD;
      other disease states is critically important in order to alleviate this burden on the elderly&#xD;
      population today This proposal seeks to further progress in this area through the repurposing&#xD;
      an existing drug therapy as a potential treatment for Hippocampal Sclerosis of Aging. This&#xD;
      disease is seldom recognized clinically and yet is the number one Alzheimer's disease mimic&#xD;
      the confounds are diagnostic and treatment of subjects suffering from dementia and as of yet&#xD;
      has no potential therapeutic interventions identified. As such, the proposed study represents&#xD;
      a cutting-edge, data-driven, low-cost, exploration of a novel disease relevant pathway that&#xD;
      may hold promise for global efforts targeting late life dementia which is a major health&#xD;
      priority in America today.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a pilot clinical trial investigating a potential treatment for&#xD;
      hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging), a prevalent, high-morbidity mimic of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). &quot;AD mimics&quot; (diseases with pathologies other than AD but with similar symptoms)&#xD;
      are increasingly appreciated to be important causes of dementia. HS-Aging is a major subtype&#xD;
      of dementia, affecting ~10-25% of all persons beyond age 85 and is generally misdiagnosed as&#xD;
      AD. The primary aims of this study are to test the safety and efficacy of nicorandil for&#xD;
      HS-Aging, based on much prior work elucidating a pharmacologically targetable mechanism for&#xD;
      this common cause of cognitive decline and dementia in the aging population. Nicorandil is a&#xD;
      vasorelaxant drug, used clinically to treat angina and heart disease disease in the elderly,&#xD;
      that has not been tested in humans for the prevention or treatment of dementia. The proposed&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial represents the first attempt to expedite drug discovery in HS-Aging, and&#xD;
      will guide the rational design of future large-scale Phase II &amp; III prevention trials for&#xD;
      this prevalent disease that is a major contributor to the personal suffering of patients and&#xD;
      caregivers as well as a major cost to health care expenditures in America today. The&#xD;
      potential success of this trial will not only help millions within immediately available&#xD;
      treatment for their condition but may also ameliorate the booming economic burden of&#xD;
      healthcare costs in America today related to late life dementia.&#xD;
