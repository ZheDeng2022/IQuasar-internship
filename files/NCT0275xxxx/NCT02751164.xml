      1. Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           To conduct an analysis of the Case Mix Programme database to evaluate the association&#xD;
           between day and time of admission to critical care and acute hospital outcome for&#xD;
           unplanned admissions to National Health Service adult, general critical care units in&#xD;
           England, Wales and Northern Ireland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary exposure variable will be the day and time of admission to the critical care&#xD;
           unit, dividing the week into 14 time periods: Monday 08:00-17:59; Monday 18:00-Tuesday&#xD;
           07:59; Tuesday 08:00-17:59, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For summary tables, these will be collapsed into the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weekday daytime: Monday-Friday 08:00-17:59&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weekend daytime: Saturday-Sunday 08:00-17:59&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weekday night: Monday-Friday 18:00-07:59 the next day&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weekend night: Saturday-Sunday 18:00-07:59 the next day&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome will be acute hospital mortality, defined as death before ultimate&#xD;
           discharge from acute hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Key confounders&#xD;
&#xD;
           The key potential confounders to be adjusted for in the analysis are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe conditions in the past medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prior dependency&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of days from hospital admission to critical care unit admission&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Location prior to admission&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within 24 hours prior to admission to critical&#xD;
                care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary reason for admission to critical care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute severity of illness - Intensive Care National Audit &amp; Research Centre&#xD;
                (ICNARC) Physiology Score&#xD;
&#xD;
           Age will be defined as the age in whole years at the time of admission to the critical&#xD;
           care unit and will be included in the model as a linear term.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Severe conditions in the past medical history will be defined according to the Acute&#xD;
           Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II methodology and must have been&#xD;
           evident and documented in the six months prior to admission to the critical care unit.&#xD;
           Conditions will be categorised into seven binary covariates:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe cardiovascular disease - fatigue, claudication, dyspnoea or angina at rest&#xD;
                (New York Heart Association functional class IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe respiratory disease - shortness of breath with light activity due to&#xD;
                pulmonary disease or home ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  End-stage renal failure - requirement for chronic renal replacement therapy for&#xD;
                irreversible renal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe liver disease - biopsy proven cirrhosis, portal hypertension or hepatic&#xD;
                encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Haematological malignancy - acute or chronic myelogenous/lymphocytic leukaemia,&#xD;
                multiple myeloma or lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Metastatic disease - distant metastases documented by surgery, imaging or biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immunocompromise - radiotherapy, chemotherapy, daily high-dose steroids, HIV/AIDS&#xD;
                or congenital immuno-humoral or cellular immune deficiency state&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior dependency will be assessed based on the ability to perform usual daily activities&#xD;
           (e.g. bathing, dressing, going to the toilet, moving in/out of bed/chair, continence and&#xD;
           eating) during the two weeks prior to admission to acute hospital and prior to the onset&#xD;
           of the acute illness, categorised as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Able to live without assistance in daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Some (minor/major) assistance with daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total assistance with all daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
           The number of days from acute hospital admission to critical care unit admission will be&#xD;
           categorised as 0 days (i.e. admission to the critical care unit on the same calendar day&#xD;
           as admission to hospital), 1 day, 2 days, 3-7 days or 8 or more days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Location prior to admission to the critical care unit will be categorised as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Emergency department/not in hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Theatre (emergency/urgent surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ward, obstetric area or intermediate care area Patients admitted from a transient&#xD;
                area (e.g. imaging, specialist treatment area, recovery) will be assigned to a&#xD;
                category according to their previous location.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CPR within 24 hours prior to admission to critical care will be defined as receipt of&#xD;
           internal or external cardiac massage (with or without defibrillation) and categorised as&#xD;
           either in-hospital (administered by an in-hospital resuscitation team or equivalent),&#xD;
           out-of-hospital or no CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary reason for admission to the critical care unit will be recorded using the&#xD;
           ICNARC Coding Method, a hierarchical coding method specifically designed for recording&#xD;
           reasons for admission to critical care. For descriptive tables, primary reason for&#xD;
           admission will be categorised according to the body system (respiratory, cardiovascular,&#xD;
           gastrointestinal, neurological, genitourinary, endocrine or&#xD;
           musculoskeletal/dermatological). For modelling, primary reason for admission will be&#xD;
           categorised according to body system and pathological/physiological process (e.g.&#xD;
           respiratory infection), with categories containing fewer than 100 admissions combined at&#xD;
           the body system level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acute severity of illness will be assessed using the ICNARC Physiology Score based on&#xD;
           the highest/lowest values of 12 physiological parameters during the first 24 hours&#xD;
           following admission to the critical care unit. The APACHE II Score will also be reported&#xD;
           as a descriptor of severity of illness but not included in modelling due to collinearity&#xD;
           with age, past medical history and physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Delayed admission to the critical care unit (defined as a delay of at least one hour&#xD;
           between the documented decision to admit a patient to the critical care unit and the&#xD;
           actual admission, and further subcategorised as a delay of more than 4 hours versus up&#xD;
           to 4 hours) will be explored as a potential mediator of the effect of day/time of&#xD;
           admission on outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Handling of missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
           From previous analyses of this high-quality clinical database, levels of missing data&#xD;
           are anticipated to be very low. Patients missing the primary outcome or key confounders&#xD;
           (age, location prior to admission, primary reason for admission) will therefore be&#xD;
           excluded from the analysis. Patients missing other binary/categorical&#xD;
           confounders/mediators will be assumed to be in the lowest risk category (i.e. no severe&#xD;
           conditions in past medical history, no assistance with daily activities, no CPR, no&#xD;
           delay). Following standard approaches, missing physiological parameters will be assumed&#xD;
           to be normal and assigned zero points in the ICNARC Physiology Score (except for&#xD;
           patients missing all physiology, who will be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;

      Logistic regression modelling, reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Three&#xD;
      multilevel logistic regression models will be fitted on the outcome of acute hospital&#xD;
      mortality (each including a random effect of critical care unit):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unadjusted model with a single covariate of day/time of admission (8-hour categories)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adjusted for the following additional covariates:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age (linear)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe conditions in past medical history (binary)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prior dependency (categorical)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of days from hospital admission to critical care unit admission&#xD;
                (categorical)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Location prior to admission (categorical)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CPR prior to admission (categorical)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary reason for admission (categorical: body system and pathological/&#xD;
                physiological process)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ICNARC Physiology Score (linear)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Including an additional covariate of delayed admission (no delay, up to 4 hour delay, &gt;4&#xD;
           hour delay) to evaluate mediation of the effect of day/time of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypothesis tests will be conducted on each model:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The global effect of day/time of admission (test of homogeneity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A comparison of weekend (Sat 08:00-Mon 07:59) versus weekday (Mon 08:00-Sat 07:59)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A comparison of night (18:00-07:59) versus daytime (08:00-17:59)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A comparison of weekend daytime (Sat-Sun 08:00-17:59) versus weekday daytime (Mon-Fri&#xD;
           08:00-17:59)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A comparison of weekend night (Sat-Sun 18:00-07:59 the next day) versus weekday night&#xD;
           (Mon-Fri 18:00-07:59 the next day)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-estimation marginal predicted mortality holding all other covariates at the values&#xD;
      observed in the dataset (and zero random effect) will be reported by day/time of admission&#xD;
      (14 categories)&#xD;
