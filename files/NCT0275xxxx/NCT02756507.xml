  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depressive disorders are common in adolescents, however they are often&#xD;
      unrecognized. Rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), a form of cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) is efficient for children and adolescents. School settings are appropriate&#xD;
      environments to deliver such interventions for vulnerable youths. Given youth's access and&#xD;
      predilection to use technology, a video-based prevention program was developed. The present&#xD;
      study aims to investigate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic REBT prevention program for&#xD;
      internalizing symptoms in adolescents, implemented in a school setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classes from different Romanian public schools will be randomized in either intervention or&#xD;
      wait list group.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevention program will be group-based, delivered in 6 sessions, over 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the six modules aimed a different component: Psychoeducation, Relaxation,&#xD;
      Relationship between cognitive distortions/irrational beliefs and emotions, Cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring, Exposure/ behavioral activation and problem solving, Maintenance of gainings.&#xD;
      Despite specific activities, for each session a video cartoon on that subject will be viewed&#xD;
      and discussed. Homework would be given at every session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REBT prevention programs delivered in school settings represent ecological modalities to&#xD;
      target vulnerable groups. Technology components added to traditional programs may lead to&#xD;
      greater motivation and satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents will complete assessments at four time-points: T1 (baseline), T2&#xD;
      (post-intervention), T3 (3 months follow-up) and T4 (12 months follow-up).&#xD;
