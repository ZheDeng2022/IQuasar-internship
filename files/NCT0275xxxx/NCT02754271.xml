  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training for older hemodialysis patients can greatly improve many of the negative&#xD;
      effects and poor health outcomes associated with end-stage kidney disease. Exercise has yet&#xD;
      to be incorporated effectively and systematically into routine care. Exercise programs remain&#xD;
      rare. When such programs are implemented, their participation rates vary, and they neglect&#xD;
      home and community-based activities, as well as the involvement of family caregivers to&#xD;
      support and reinforce exercise. This study is intended to address these limitations by&#xD;
      introducing a highly accessible and compelling educational film, Fit for Dialysis, designed&#xD;
      to introduce, motivate, and sustain exercise for wellness amongst older hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients, and exercise counseling and support by family caregivers, nephrologists, and&#xD;
      nurses. The objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether and in what ways Fit for&#xD;
      Dialysis improves outcomes and influences knowledge/attitudes regarding the importance of&#xD;
      exercise-based principles of wellness in the context of end-stage renal disease. Ultimately&#xD;
      Fit for Dialysis could be used as a model for dialysis education that supports guideline&#xD;
      recommendations that exercise be incorporated into the care and treatment of dialysis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study introduces a highly accessible and compelling educational film designed to&#xD;
      introduce, motivate, and sustain patient exercise for wellness amongst older hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients, and exercise counseling and support by nephrology staff and family caregivers. Fit&#xD;
      for Dialysis is a filmed drama that is based on focus group research with older hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients, family caregivers, and health care practitioners that highlighted patients' desire&#xD;
      to exercise as well as discouragement of patients to do so by overprotective families, and&#xD;
      nurses' preferences for patient sedentariness during hemodialysis. Fit for Dialysis was&#xD;
      tailored to the exigencies of out-patient hemodialysis settings by acknowledging and&#xD;
      providing a roadmap to overcome the disciplinary silos and paternalism towards patients which&#xD;
      inhibit exercise during hemodialysis, and highlighting some of the life circumstances that&#xD;
      may influence patients' self-management of exercise behaviours at home and in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to advance our understanding of the ways in which Fit for Dialysis influences&#xD;
      participant outcomes, a prospective 2-site parallel intervention trial will be implemented&#xD;
      that will compare the film + a 16-week exercise program in one hospital, with a 16-week&#xD;
      exercise-only program in another hospital. Each hospital will have a 12-week follow-up.&#xD;
      Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used including semi-structured interviews, and&#xD;
      physical fitness and activity measures. These data will be used to explore the impact of Fit&#xD;
      for Dialysis on: the knowledge/attitudes of patients, family caregivers, and staff regarding&#xD;
      exercise-based principles of wellness; the education, motivation, or maintenance of patient&#xD;
      exercise during dialysis, at home, and in the community; adherence to exercise prescription;&#xD;
      and patient physical fitness and activity outcomes. The study will also explore factors&#xD;
      related to family caregivers, nephrologists, nurses, and hospital administrators, and&#xD;
      patients' home and community environments that may impact the successful uptake of the key&#xD;
      messages of Fit for Dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention site (film+exercise hospital), 30 patients will view Fit for Dialysis and&#xD;
      participate in the exercise program; at the exercise-only hospital, 30 patients will only&#xD;
      exercise. A family caregiver of each participating patient will either view Fit for Dialysis&#xD;
      and read an information letter on the benefits and contraindications of exercise (in the&#xD;
      film+exercise hospital), or will only read the information letter (in the exercise-only&#xD;
      hospital). In the film+exercise hospital, five nephrologists, 10 nurses and 3 administrators&#xD;
      will also view the film. In both hospitals, 10 patients, 10 family caregivers, 10 nurses, 5&#xD;
      nephrologists, 3 administrators, and the physiotherapist assistants will be interviewed.&#xD;
