  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with NMD can suffer from a range of respiratory problems due to respiratory muscle&#xD;
      weakness. Cough muscle weakness worsens secretion clearance from the airways, and increases&#xD;
      the risk of infection. As a result, these patients often require chest physiotherapy or are&#xD;
      supported with devices to aid clearance (such as mechanical insufflation-exsufflation) to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of infection. Although evidence supports the use of these devices, the&#xD;
      optimal technique or settings on the device are not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new technology that involves wearing a belt of&#xD;
      sensors around the chest that provides information on how well the lungs are being filled&#xD;
      with air. It allows a non-invasive assessment of the effect of each secretion clearance&#xD;
      technique on lung ventilation in real-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare how well the lung is filled with air between three different&#xD;
      techniques for secretion clearance (clearing mucus and phlegm from the airways), in order to&#xD;
      determine which of the techniques is the most effective, in patients with NMD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, bedside monitoring technique that&#xD;
      provides semi-continuous, real-time information about the regional distribution of the&#xD;
      changes in electrical resistivity of the lung tissue due to variations in ventilation in&#xD;
      relation to a reference state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information is gained by repeatedly injecting small alternating electric currents (usually 5&#xD;
      mA) at high frequency of 50 - 80 kHz through a system of skin electrodes (usually 16) applied&#xD;
      circumferentially around the thorax in a single plane between the 4th and 6th intercostal&#xD;
      space. While an adjacent pair of electrodes 'injects' the current ('adjacent drive&#xD;
      configuration'), all the remaining adjacent passive electrode pairs measure the differences&#xD;
      in electric potential. A resistivity (impedance) image is reconstructed from this data by a&#xD;
      mathematical algorithm using a two dimensional model and a simplified shape to represent the&#xD;
      thoracic cross-section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting image possesses a high temporal and functional resolution making it possible to&#xD;
      monitor dynamic physiological phenomena (e.g., delay in regional inflation or recruitment) on&#xD;
      a breath by breath basis. It is important to realize that the EIT images are based on image&#xD;
      reconstruction techniques that require at least one measurement on a well-defined reference&#xD;
      state. All quantitative data are related to this reference and can only indirectly quantify&#xD;
      (relative) changes in local lung impedance (but not absolute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with respiratory muscle weakness have reduced cough strength and this can cause&#xD;
      difficulties with clearing respiratory secretions. This impaired secretion clearance can lead&#xD;
      to respiratory infections and acutely can causing small airway occlusion with subsequent&#xD;
      ventilation-perfusion mismatch adversely effecting pulmonary mechanics. The use of cough&#xD;
      assist devices, such as mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) can improve secretion&#xD;
      clearance. Although there is evidence that these devices can improve secretion clearance the&#xD;
      optimal pressures or technique required to provide effective secretion clearance is not&#xD;
      known. Furthermore the use of high pressure swings that are now frequently used in clinical&#xD;
      practice could lead to lung derecruitment. The use of EIT would allow a novel and effective&#xD;
      method of assessing the ability to clear secretions and optimise ventilated lung in&#xD;
      neuromuscular patients with poor cough and assess post procedure derecruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIE: A pilot physiological study will be performed in patients with neuromuscular disease&#xD;
      with acute (10 patients) and chronic (10 patients) secretion management issues that require&#xD;
      clinical use of MIE. These patients will be studied using 3 different clearance strategies&#xD;
      low pressure MIE, higher pressure MIE and standard airway techniques. The project will assess&#xD;
      differences in regional ventilation following augmented airway clearance and inform potential&#xD;
      endpoints and feasibility for a larger trial regarding speed of recovery from respiratory&#xD;
      infections in patients with neuromuscular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of data regarding the physiological efficacy of MIE devices and although&#xD;
      clinical consensus regards them as a beneficial adjunct to the management of patients with&#xD;
      respiratory muscle weakness causing a reduction in effective secretion clearance it is less&#xD;
      clear the optimum protocol to achieve secretion clearance. The aim of chest physiotherapy is&#xD;
      to achieve clearance of airway secretions and allow improved gas exchange by enhancing&#xD;
      ventilation and perfusion matching within the lung. The data suggesting optimum pressures for&#xD;
      MIE are based around early work on achieving enhanced cough peak expiratory flow. More&#xD;
      recently higher pressures have been suggested to achieve enhanced airway clearance. There may&#xD;
      be potential beneficial effects with high pressure MIE by enhancing airway opening during the&#xD;
      insufflation pressure achieving a degree of lung volume recruitment. Conversely, high&#xD;
      insufflation pressures may adversely affect both pulmonary and cardiac physiology which may&#xD;
      be further impacted by the large pressure swing during exsufflation. This is particularly&#xD;
      relevant given the increasing co-morbid cardiomyopathy that occurs in many congenital&#xD;
      neuromuscular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial phase of the project would be to generate pilot data with a comprehensive&#xD;
      physiological evaluation of patients with neuromuscular disease and requirement of cough&#xD;
      augmentation with MIE devices. The patients will undergo a randomised protocol of chest&#xD;
      clearance with standard physio, low pressure and high pressure MIE. Data from this trial will&#xD;
      allow an optimal treatment strategy to be developed and if data suggested would provide&#xD;
      sufficient data to power an interventional trial to examine important clinical outcomes.&#xD;
