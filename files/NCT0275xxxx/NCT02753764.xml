  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo controlled 4 week crossover study to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of AZD7624 (an inhaled p38 inhibitor) in corticosteroid resistant (CR) asthmatics.&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study 10 symptomatic CR asthma patients with a FEV1% predicted &lt;80%&#xD;
      and normal bronchodilator response, 10 CS asthmatics and 10 healthy controls will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part A of the study, p38 MAPK activation will be measured in CR asthmatics and compared to&#xD;
      CS asthmatics. Assessment of p38 MAPK activation in whole blood samples from 5 CR and 5 CS&#xD;
      asthma patients will be performed. After fulfilling all enrollment criteria blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected from asthma patients at Visit 1 for the whole blood evaluation of MAPK&#xD;
      activation by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial visit, asthmatics will be given oral prednisone for 1 week and patients&#xD;
      will return for the spirometry assessment. Patients will be defined as CR if &lt;10% improvement&#xD;
      in FEV1 % predicted is observed and as CS if &gt;12% improvement in FEV1 % predicted is&#xD;
      observed. If at least 2 fold increase in p-p38 MAPK expression in CD14+ cells of CR asthma&#xD;
      patients is demonstrated when compared to CS asthmatics, Part B will be triggered. If no&#xD;
      difference in p38 MAPK phosphorylation will be observed in monocytes of CR and CS asthmatics&#xD;
      by flow cytometry assessment, the study will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B of the study, CR asthmatics will be randomized for treatment with AZD7624 or&#xD;
      placebo for one month in a cross over design; the ability of AZD7624 to inhibit p38 MAPK&#xD;
      activity will be assessed in CR patients. Five CR asthma patients from Part A may also take&#xD;
      part in Part B. Additional CR (n=10 total patients required) and CS asthmatics (n=5) will be&#xD;
      recruited in part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline levels of p38 MAPK and other biomarkers will also be assessed in CR asthmatics and&#xD;
      compared to both CS asthmatics and healthy volunteers. Patients will be enrolled and assessed&#xD;
      for baseline p38 MAPK activation as above in peripheral blood. Patients will be re-defined as&#xD;
      CR or CS as above based on changes in the lung function after 1 week of oral prednisone burst&#xD;
      as above. Levels of p38 MAPK activity and other biomarkers will be compared between CR and CS&#xD;
      patients (n=10 in each group based on recruitment for Part A and Part B) and also compared to&#xD;
      healthy volunteers (n=10). After 1 week following oral prednisone burst, CR patients will&#xD;
      return to undergo bronchoscopy with the collection of BAL and bronchial epithelial brushes.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of p38 MAPK activation. CS patients will not&#xD;
      undergo bronchoscopy, but will give a blood sample one week after oral prednisone burst for&#xD;
      the analysis of p38 MAPK activation. Blood samples will also be collected from healthy&#xD;
      controls during the initial visit to assess p38 MAPK activation. CR patients will be&#xD;
      randomized for treatment with p38 inhibitor AZD7624 or placebo (5 patients per group). After&#xD;
      4 weeks of treatment with AZD7624 or placebo, CR patients will undergo additional&#xD;
      bronchoscopy with the collection of BAL, brushes and blood. Patients will be monitored for&#xD;
      adverse events during the trial. After completion of first block of cross over treatment, CR&#xD;
      patients will undergo a 1 month wash-out period, after which, they will return for induced&#xD;
      sputum and blood collection, and then undergo the second crossover period with AZD7624 or&#xD;
      placebo. After the second 4 week treatment block, patients will come for sputum induction and&#xD;
      blood collection. In CR asthma patients assessment of lung function, asthma control, airway&#xD;
      hyperreactivity, p38 MAPK activation in peripheral blood, BAL, induced sputum samples and&#xD;
      cellular responsiveness to corticosteroids before and after treatment with AZD7624 will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
