      endTB Clinical Trial a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority, multi-country trial&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of new combination regimens for MDR-TB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimens examined combine newly approved drugs bedaquiline and/or delamanid with existing&#xD;
      drugs known to be active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (linezolid, clofazimine,&#xD;
      moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide). The study will enroll in parallel across 5&#xD;
      experimental and 1 standard-of-care control arms. Randomization will be outcome adapted using&#xD;
      Bayesian interim analysis of efficacy endpoints. Experimental regimens will contain&#xD;
      bedaquiline and/or delamanid and up to 4 companion drugs. Control-arm treatment may contain&#xD;
      one of the following (bedaquiline or delamanid) and companion drugs, constructed and&#xD;
      delivered according to local standard of care and consistent with WHO guidelines. Trial&#xD;
      participation in all arms will last at least until Week 73, and up to Week 104. In the&#xD;
      experimental arms, treatment will be for 39 weeks (participants in the experimental arms will&#xD;
      be allowed up to 47 weeks to complete the 39-week treatment course) and post-treatment follow&#xD;
      up for up to 65 additional weeks. In the control arm, treatment will be delivered according&#xD;
      to local standard of care (in consistence with WHO guidance); duration may vary and will be&#xD;
      approximately 86 weeks for the conventional regimen and 39-52 weeks for the standardized&#xD;
      shorter regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inferiority will be established for any experimental arm if the lower bound of the&#xD;
      one-sided 97.5% confidence interval around the difference in favorable outcome between the&#xD;
      control and experimental arms is greater than or equal to -12%.&#xD;
