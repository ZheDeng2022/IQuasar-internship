      This trial is a Phase 1b multicentre, multinational, randomized, double-blind with&#xD;
      single-blind arm and open label extension phase, placebo controlled, clinical trial&#xD;
      evaluating the safety and predictability of an escalating gluten consumption to activate&#xD;
      Coeliac Disease (CeD) in (a) a small cohort of people with diet-managed CeD treated with a&#xD;
      placebo (n=10), and in (b) cohorts following low (L3-10; n=40) and medium (L3-20; n=10) dose&#xD;
      hookworm inocula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators 4 aims for the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Undertake a multiple-phase and escalating gluten challenge assessing safety to gluten&#xD;
      exposure in hookworm-naïve and hookworm-infected people with CeD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: This phase Ib study recognizes that the evidence supporting this novel intervention is&#xD;
      rudimentary and addresses amongst others the following questions: (a) The importance of L3&#xD;
      dose on Participant health, and (b) the importance of L3 dose on the safety of escalating&#xD;
      gluten challenge and (c) the need for a comparator group should a phase II trial be&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Examine the changes in intestinal T cell responses induced by hookworm infection and&#xD;
      gluten exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Assess the impact of hookworm infection and purified hookworm-derived proteins on&#xD;
      gluten peptide-specific immune responses ex vivo.&#xD;

      This trial is a Phase 1b multicentre, multinational, randomized, double-blind with&#xD;
      single-blind arm and open label extension phase, placebo controlled, clinical trial&#xD;
      evaluating the safety and predictability of an escalating gluten consumption to activate&#xD;
      Coeliac Disease (CeD) in (a) a small cohort of people with diet-managed CeD treated with a&#xD;
      placebo (n=10), and in (b) cohorts following low (L3-10; n=40) and medium (L3-20; n=10) dose&#xD;
      hookworm inocula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1&amp;2/Clinical study: The primary outcome will be the safety of an escalating 30-week&#xD;
      gluten challenge in hookworm naïve or hookworm infected people with CeD following a&#xD;
      medium-high dose hookworm infection, assessed by the change of duodenal villous height to&#xD;
      crypt depth ratio (V:C) between pre-trial (week -2) and post-challenge (week 42). This will&#xD;
      be a binary variable defined as safe if gluten challenge is completed and V:C ratio &gt;2.0 and&#xD;
      there is &lt;20% change in its value from baseline or fail if drop out occurs prior to the&#xD;
      completion of the gluten challenge or V:C ratio is &lt;2.0 or its change from baseline is &gt;20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include safety of low and medium intensity hookworm infection at&#xD;
      intermediate (12 weeks and 24 weeks) endpoints of an escalating gluten challenge, assessed by&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events as well as general health. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures include changes in V:C ratio from baseline to intermediate endpoints,&#xD;
      progression through successful gluten challenge phases of the trial including a liberal diet,&#xD;
      mucosal intraepithelial lymphocyte count, Celiac Symptom Index (CSI questionnaire),&#xD;
      Celiac-Quality of Life Score (QOL questionnaire) and the serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue&#xD;
      transglutaminase (tTG) level of all cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims 3&amp;4/Associated in vitro cell measures and ex vivo mucosal stimulation investigations:&#xD;
      The associated studies are designed to more fully explore the immunological processes&#xD;
      underpinning the clinical outcomes, and to take advantage of mucosal tissue collected in&#xD;
      excess of the clinical requirements to test individual components of hookworm secretions&#xD;
      which we believe hold great potential as future therapies. These experiments are complex and&#xD;
      often depend on the quality of tissue and the cells collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure: After written informed consent is obtained at the screening visit and prior&#xD;
      to enrolment Participants may require some haematological work to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive hookworm larvae (L3-10 or L3-20) suspended in 2-3&#xD;
      drops of water applied to the skin and covered with a light dressing, or Tabasco® Sauce in&#xD;
      solution (Placebo Comparator). Before inoculation, each Participant will complete a QOL&#xD;
      questionnaire, submit a fresh faecal specimen, and undergo a blood draw and duodenal biopsy.&#xD;
      Thereafter each week for the duration of participation, a food diary and CSI questionnaire&#xD;
      will be submitted. At designated times, gluten will be introduced in escalating volumes.&#xD;
      Blood, faecal and biopsy collections, and a QOL questionnaire will also be collected. To&#xD;
      better evaluate the independent effect of L3 on host immunity, the L3-20 cohort will undergo&#xD;
      an endoscopy at week 12 in lieu of the week 36 intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Parameters/Analysis: General health assessments, physical examination and vital signs&#xD;
      will be obtained at screening and thereafter at designated clinic visits (or symptom driven&#xD;
      as required). Incidence and severity of Adverse and Serious Events including evidence of&#xD;
      gluten intolerance and hookworm related complications of Participants will be evaluated&#xD;
      formally through structured questionnaires (CSI weekly and QOL at the designated times) to be&#xD;
      scrutinised by the designated research nurse and informally through Participant initiated&#xD;
      personal contact with a research nurse or clinician. As well, blood for clinical safety and&#xD;
      histological results will be scrutinised contemporaneously (by a designated research nurse or&#xD;
      designated researcher) for incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities. Blood results&#xD;
      and symptom scores will be coded in a re-identifiable format before adding to an&#xD;
      access-restricted and secure database. Screening blood tests to include serum pregnancy test&#xD;
      at screening (a positive test will exclude the Participant from entering the trial) and urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test if pregnancy is suspected throughout the trial. The 12-month progression to a&#xD;
      liberal diet will be monitored by tTG evaluated monthly, with monthly CSI evaluation and&#xD;
      Participant contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Parameters/Analysis: Blood analysis: Complete blood count (CBC), IgA-tTG titre,&#xD;
      liver and renal function and iron tests and a screening serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
      performed at Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology (SNP) in Australia and Canterbury Health&#xD;
      Laboratories in New Zealand. From the residual blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will&#xD;
      be harvested (when circumstances permit) and serum will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faecal analysis: Samples will be collected in anaerobic collection bags with an aliquot to be&#xD;
      transferred into a provided screw top plastic jar, both to be frozen at -20°C for short term&#xD;
      storage and transport, and stored at -80°C long-term for parasite egg quantitative polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (qPCR) analysis to be performed by nominated un-blinded personnel supervised&#xD;
      by Prof. James McCarthy at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, with the results to&#xD;
      remain blinded to all other trial personnel. Faecal samples will also be stored for future&#xD;
      analysis of bacterial communities (the microbiota).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucosal analysis: Duodenal biopsies (14 pinch biopsies, consistent with previous trials) will&#xD;
      be taken by a nationally and trial accredited gastroenterologist supported by a sedationist&#xD;
      in an accredited facility. Four biopsies will be committed for conventional histology. To&#xD;
      ensure standardisation the Biopsy forceps to be used will be Boston Scientific Radial Jaw® 4&#xD;
      - 2.8mm. Paraffin embedded tissue sections (3 μm) will be stained with H&amp;E and anti-cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation 3 (anti-CD3). Clinical histopathology will be supervised by a specialist&#xD;
      in gastrointestinal pathology (A/Prof. Andrew Clouston) and reported contemporaneously for&#xD;
      clinical purposes. Best representative field images from each case will be selected by Prof.&#xD;
      Clouston, then coded in re-identifiable format before adding to an access-restricted and&#xD;
      secure database, and later scored for intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL)% and V:C by a single&#xD;
      pathologist (Dr. Greg Miller). At each time point, two four biopsy tissue samples will be&#xD;
      stored at -80°C in 10% glycerolRNA stabilisation solution for future gene expression and&#xD;
      microbiota analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Blood volume: 50 ml per collection x 6 from week minus 4 to week 42. 10 ml per month&#xD;
      for 12 months. Total 420 ml over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination: Gluten consumption is toxic when consumed by people with CeD.&#xD;
      Unlike a conventional trial testing an intervention to reverse disease, this trial relies on&#xD;
      gluten toxicity to promote disease activity. The trial primarily evaluates the safety of&#xD;
      gluten exposure in CeD in hookworm-infected Participants. The escalating gluten challenge&#xD;
      proposed is unprecedented, and whilst liberal gluten consumption is consumed by many people&#xD;
      with CeD either though ignorance of diagnosis or a conscious decision not to comply with&#xD;
      medical advice, it is anticipated this challenge will adversely affect the unprotected&#xD;
      placebo controls. Consistent with this concern, the control cohort has been kept small. The&#xD;
      study will consist of 60 participants, with 10 in the control group, 40 in the low-dose&#xD;
      hookworm group (L3-10) and 10 in the medium-dose hookworm group (L3-20).&#xD;
