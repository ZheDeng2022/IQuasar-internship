      This Mentored Career Development Award will lay the foundation for a career focused on&#xD;
      addressing two Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health priorities: 1) improving child access&#xD;
      to evidence-based mental health care, and 2) reducing the duration of untreated illness by&#xD;
      developing culturally-sensitive early interventions. The proposed research aims to assess&#xD;
      implementation barriers and facilitators as well as the impact of a brief caregiver coaching&#xD;
      early autism intervention adapted for use in a low resource setting. Data from this pilot&#xD;
      study would inform scalable early autism intervention programs for implementation in&#xD;
      underserved, low resource, and low-literacy populations globally.&#xD;

      In this proposal, the investigator's aim is to adapt the caregiver coaching version of the&#xD;
      Early Start Denver Model (P-ESDM) and conduct a pilot study to explore the impact of this&#xD;
      adapted intervention on child and caregiver outcomes in an African setting as well as&#xD;
      understand key facilitators and barriers to implementation of the intervention in this&#xD;
      setting. Importantly, this work aligns with an objective of the Federal Interagency Autism&#xD;
      Coordinating Committee Strategic Plan: to support community-based studies that assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of interventions in broader community settings including scalable early&#xD;
      intervention programs for implementation in underserved, low-resource, and low-literacy&#xD;
      populations. The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) was the first empirically-validated&#xD;
      comprehensive intervention for toddlers with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In a study of&#xD;
      P-ESDM that parallels the proposed study, Vismara et al (2009) demonstrated that in a brief&#xD;
      12 week, 1 hour per week, P-ESDM program with parents of toddlers with ASD, all but one&#xD;
      parent in the study acquired mastery of the ESDM techniques at or above the 85 percent&#xD;
      criterion by the fifth to sixth intervention session as measured by the ESDM fidelity scale.&#xD;
      Furthermore, high levels of correct implementation of the ESDM techniques were maintained at&#xD;
      follow-up for those parents who met fidelity and completed the program, with average percent&#xD;
      accuracy ranging from 93-97%. The brief intervention also resulted in sustained positive&#xD;
      growth in child social communicative behaviors. More recently, in an NIH-funded randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT), Rogers et al (2012) found that both P-ESDM and community&#xD;
      interventions were associated with increases in language and cognitive outcomes and decrease&#xD;
      in ASD symptoms, despite the fact that the community intervention involved a greater number&#xD;
      of intervention hours. Specifically, a 10-point increase in verbal developmental quotient&#xD;
      (DQ), a 4-5 point increase in overall DQ, and a decrease in social affect symptoms on the&#xD;
      Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule (ADOS) were found. Moreover, the intervention&#xD;
      resulted in lower levels of parenting stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site of the proposed study is the Center for Autism Research in Africa at the University&#xD;
      of Cape Town (Director, Prof Petrus de Vries). South Africa offers a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      study interactions among treatment, child, family, community and context, which act as&#xD;
      facilitators or barriers of intervention implementation, thus providing preliminary&#xD;
      information that could help match the right treatment to the right child and family. In a&#xD;
      recent multisite P-ESDM RCT Estes and colleagues reported that that this parent coaching&#xD;
      intervention helped to maintain parental adjustment directly after a child was diagnosed with&#xD;
      ASD. However, the numbers of negative life events were a significant predictor of parenting&#xD;
      stress and sense of competence. Child and caregiver factors, particularly prevalent in South&#xD;
      Africa (eg. poverty, malnutrition, HIV/AIDS), are known to affect child cognitive and&#xD;
      social-emotional development, as well as parenting stress. Gathering data on the feasibility&#xD;
      and impact of a scalable early ASD intervention in an environment where other significant&#xD;
      child and caregiver contextual challenges exist, offers a unique opportunity to examine&#xD;
      broader contextual factors affecting intervention implementation. The investigator will&#xD;
      therefore document the effects of broader contextual factors (for e.g. caregiver mental&#xD;
      health, negative life events, HIV/AIDS, and poverty) on treatment impact. In addition, this&#xD;
      study will further the understanding of how to implement mental health early interventions in&#xD;
      a low and middle-income country (LMIC) context, by examining processes used to train and&#xD;
      supervise non-specialist providers who will provide the caregiver coaching in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goal of this proposal is to advance understanding of affordable, sustainable&#xD;
      early intervention strategies for developmental disorders, including ASD that would benefit&#xD;
      all families regardless of resource availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: Adapt the P-ESDM treatment manual and training approach. P-ESDM is a brief,&#xD;
      scalable caregiver-mediated early autism intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: Pre-pilot the adapted P-ESDM training and intervention and refine&#xD;
      methodological details of the experimental protocol. This will provide information on the&#xD;
      structure, content, and feasibility of the adapted P-ESDM intervention and training approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: Pilot of the adapted P-ESDM with preschool aged children with ASD exploring&#xD;
      the impact on: a) child social communication abilities and overall developmental outcome, and&#xD;
      b) implementation outcomes.&#xD;
