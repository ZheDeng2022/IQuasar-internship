      A sequential multistage randomised clinical trial (SMART) to produce evidence to guide a&#xD;
      step-wise clinical approach for the treatment of ultra high risk patients and reduction of&#xD;
      risk for psychosis and other deleterious clinical and/or functional outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study treatment sequence involves three stages, which are referred to as steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1- Support and Problem Solving (SPS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trial participants receive SPS treatment in Step 1. Step 1 involves attending&#xD;
      weekly-fortnightly SPS sessions over a six week period and the Week 4 and 6 visits will also&#xD;
      include an interview with research staff who will assess the symptoms and mental state of&#xD;
      participants. These assessments will enable research staff to determine whether the therapy&#xD;
      has been effective in improving the participant's symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on how they respond to the six-week period of treatment in Step 1, participants are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a new treatment arm at the end of Step 1 as detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who improve with the SPS treatment they receive during Step 1, will be&#xD;
      randomised to either monthly SPS treatment for up to one year OR to three-monthly&#xD;
      appointments (Month 3, 6, 9 and 12) to monitor their mental state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not improve with the SPS treatment they receive during Step 1 will be&#xD;
      randomised to continue treatment in one of two groups in Step 2 as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2- Support and Problem Solving (SPS) OR Cognitive Behavioural Case Management (CBCM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 2, participants will receive either SPS OR Cognitive Behavioural Case Management for&#xD;
      a period of 18 weeks. Participants will be interviewed at two time points across this step so&#xD;
      that research staff can assess whether the therapy has helped improve their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who improve with the treatment they receive in Step 2 will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive either monthly SPS for a further six months OR to three-monthly appointments (Month&#xD;
      9, 12) to monitor their mental state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not improve with the treatment they receive in Step 2 will be randomised&#xD;
      to one of two treatment groups in Step 3 as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3 Cognitive Behavioural Case Management plus antidepressant medication OR Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioural Case Management plus placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to one of the two treatment groups in Step 3 will receive the&#xD;
      corresponding treatment over a six-month period. Both treatment groups will involve: regular&#xD;
      CBCM sessions; regular review by a clinician, as well as the assigned medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on which group participants are randomised to, they may either receive&#xD;
      antidepressant medication OR placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant does not improve, or deteriorates by 12 weeks into Step 3, they will be&#xD;
      given a choice to: continue with the treatment regime already assigned to them; increase the&#xD;
      dosage of their medication, or start a new medication. Upon their choosing, the medication at&#xD;
      this stage may either be an antipsychotic medication OR omega-3 fatty acids ('fish oil'),&#xD;
      taken in addition to the other treatment components of this step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention aspect of this study covers a 12 month period. After completion of this&#xD;
      intervention period, participants will also be invited to take part in two separate follow-up&#xD;
      interviews with research staff, at both 18 months and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US Pilot Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of California, Davis will oversee a pilot study for the implementation of the&#xD;
      STEP model in the Early Diagnosis and Preventative Treatment (EDAPT) clinic at UC Davis in&#xD;
      Sacramento, California. After giving informed consent, CHR patients and their families&#xD;
      entering treatment in the EDAPT program will be offered participation in the staged&#xD;
      intervention trial. CHR participants will be characterized with the Structured Interview for&#xD;
      Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) following standard procedures in the U.S. Similarly, defining risk&#xD;
      based on 3 core syndromes that span analogous dimensions of symptom severity from attenuated&#xD;
      to psychotic, a recent meta-analysis demonstrates that the SIPS reliably identifies youth at&#xD;
      clinical high risk for psychosis at a rate comparable to the CAARMS, which is used in the&#xD;
      main trial being conducted in the Orygen parent study. Thirty patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      followed through the protocol until 24 month follow up.The team will also harmonize CBT&#xD;
      practice with the CBCM model used at Orygen. All outcome measures will parallel those used in&#xD;
      the parent study at Orygen. UC Davis research staff will complete clinical and outcome&#xD;
      assessments with CHR participants at study entry, 6, 12 and 24 months. Data analysis will&#xD;
      also parallel those conducted in the parent study. However, the key measures will be&#xD;
      acceptance and retention in the staged treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US Focus Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of California, San Francisco will design, conduct and analyze output from a&#xD;
      series of focus groups to gather input from stakeholders regarding translation of STEP trial&#xD;
      interventions to the US healthcare system. This will include identifying barriers and&#xD;
      solutions to implementation of STEP trial interventions in the US context for CHR patients.&#xD;
      Groups will include CA county mental health leadership, private insurance mental health&#xD;
      leadership, mental health leadership at DHHS and the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services,&#xD;
      leadership from community-based organizations currently providing services for this&#xD;
      population, consumers, and family members.&#xD;
