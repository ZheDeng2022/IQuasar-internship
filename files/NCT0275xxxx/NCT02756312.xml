  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although bench data and retrospective studies have provided a promising picture of the&#xD;
      possible influence of anesthetic technique on the risk of tumor progression and patients&#xD;
      mortality, current evidence from RCTs is inadequate to show whether the type of anesthetics&#xD;
      might influence tumor progression and patient survival.There are many thousands of patients&#xD;
      with a cancer diagnosis undergoing surgery every year, and in the context of biological&#xD;
      plausibility, it should lead to the urgent undertaking of RCTs to further evaluate the&#xD;
      association between the anesthetic management and patient outcome.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single centre, randomized, parallel group controlled clinical trial in patients with primary HGG. All eligible patients will be 1:1 randomized to the TIVA or INHA group. The object of the trail is to evaluate the effect of propofol or sevoflurane on the prognosis of supratentorial HGG patients after craniotomy.</intervention_model_description>
