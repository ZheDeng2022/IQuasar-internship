  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose-escalation phase 1 trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of SHR3162 in participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) is a family of proteins that plays&#xD;
      important roles in multiple cellular processes, including single-strand DNA breaks, which if&#xD;
      left unrepaired, leads to double-strand breaks (DSB) during DNA replication. The DSB can be&#xD;
      repaired either through error-free homologous recombination (HR) or error-prone non-homology&#xD;
      end joining. In HR deficient cancer cells with mutations on HR genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2 or&#xD;
      partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), DSB cannot be efficiently and correctly repaired,&#xD;
      resulting in cell death. Viable cells, on the other hand, have normal HR and do not replicate&#xD;
      as often as cancer cells; thus they can survive PARP inhibition. PARP inhibitors are being&#xD;
      actively developed worldwide as promising anti-tumor therapeutics. The current trial will be&#xD;
      conducted in participants with advanced solid tumors for whom satisfactory treatments are not&#xD;
      yet available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose-escalation phase, patients will be enrolled sequentially into the 8 dose levels&#xD;
      of SHR3162 designated in this study(3-6 patients per cohort). One to two sentinel&#xD;
      participants in Cohort 1 who will be treated and closely monitored for 24 hours. If no&#xD;
      adverse effects are noted during the 24-hour period, dosing of further participants in the&#xD;
      cohort may continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose expansion part of the study, up to 12 additional participants will be enrolled at&#xD;
      the MTD.&#xD;
