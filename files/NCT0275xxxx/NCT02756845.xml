      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of talimogene laherparepvec in pediatric&#xD;
      subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors that are amenable to direct injection in the clinical&#xD;
      setting. Approximately 18 - 24 pediatric subjects are expected to be enrolled and treated&#xD;
      with at least 1 dose of talimogene laherparepvec into 2 cohorts stratified by age. DLT will&#xD;
      be evaluated based on at least 9 DLT-evaluable subjects in cohort A1. The DLT evaluation&#xD;
      period is 35 days from the initial administration of talimogene laherparepvec.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Approximately 18 to 24 treated pediatric subjects are expected to be enrolled into 2 cohorts stratified by age (permissible based on the incidence of DLTs, a minimum of 6 subjects/cohort and a minimum of 18 subjects total).&#xD;
Cohort A1 (12 to ≤ 21 years of age)&#xD;
Cohort B1 (2 to &lt; 12 years of age) Initially, 3 subjects 12 to ≤ 21 years of age are to be enrolled and treated at 100% of the recommended adult dose regimen of talimogene laherparepvec (cohort A1). The dose level review team (DLRT) will review the safety data of the first 3 subjects in the older age cohort A1 to decide if the younger age cohort B1 can be opened for enrollment. If a DLT occurs in the first 3 DLT-evaluable subjects in the older age cohort (A1 or A2), the younger age cohort will not open until a DLT rate &lt; 33% is observed with at least 6 DLT-evaluable subjects in the older age cohort (A1 or A2).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The first dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be administered at a dose of up to 4.0 mL of 10ᶺ6 PFU/mL followed by a dose of up to 4.0 mL of 10ᶺ8 PFU/mL 21 days (+3 days) later. Subsequent doses of up to 4.0 mL of 10ᶺ8 PFU/mL will be administered every 14 days (± 3 days) thereafter. Cohorts will be assigned as follows: Cohort A1 (age 12 to ≤ 21 years). Cohort B1 (age 2 to &lt; 12 years). The DLRT will review the safety data of the first 3 subjects in the older age cohort A1 to decide if the younger age cohort B1 can be opened for enrollment. If dose de-escalation is needed and if permissible based on the incidence of DLTs, additional DLT-evaluable subjects will be enrolled and treated at a lower dose level of talimogene laherparepvec. Dose de-escalation cohorts will be assigned as follows and the same DLT rules will be applied: Cohort A2 (age 12 to ≤ 21 years), Cohort B2 (age 2 to &lt; 12 years).</description>

    <description>Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection only into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, nodal tumors, and other non-visceral tumors with or without image ultrasound guidance. The first dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be up to 4.0 mL of 10^6 PFU/mL administered on day 1. The second injection, up to 4.0 mL of 10^8 PFU/mL (or up to 4.0 mL of 10^6 PFU/mL for a dose de-escalated cohort), will be administered 21 (+3) days after the initial injection. All subsequent injections, up to 4.0 mL of 10^8 PFU/mL (or up to 4.0 mL of 10^6 PFU/mL for a dose de-escalated cohort), will be administered every 14 (± 3) days. The treatment cycle interval may be increased due to toxicity.</description>

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
