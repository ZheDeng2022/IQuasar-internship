      While studies have shown that better outcomes are associated with brace wear compliance in&#xD;
      the scoliosis and clubfoot populations, compliance rates are still poor. Reasons identified&#xD;
      by patients, parents and research for not complying with prescribed brace wear include the&#xD;
      inconvenience or irritability of the child when in the brace in the case of clubfeet, and&#xD;
      fear of looking different from peers, clothes not fitting properly, or discomfort in the case&#xD;
      of scoliosis. While reasons for noncompliance are many and can be complex, there has been&#xD;
      some research to indicate that personality traits may play a role in brace wear compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the proposed study is to determine if personality traits are related&#xD;
      to compliance patterns for individuals undergoing brace treatment for AIS or Clubfeet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bracing compliance, or the ability of patients to tolerate prescribed bracing regimens, has&#xD;
      been shown to be related to the success of treatment. In pediatric orthopedics, bracing is&#xD;
      used as one treatment option for a number of diagnoses and reasons. Two populations that are&#xD;
      commonly prescribed bracing as part of the treatment paradigm are infants with clubfeet&#xD;
      following Ponseti casting and adolescents with scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis, bracing is used to stop or slow progression of&#xD;
      curves with the hope to delay or prevent the need for surgical intervention. Research has&#xD;
      shown that bracing significantly decreased curve progression in patients with adolescent&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis, and that the benefits of bracing increased with longer hours of brace&#xD;
      wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, bracing is common practice for treating infants with clubfeet. All infants with&#xD;
      clubfeet at SHC-Lexington are prescribed a bracing regimen following the completion of their&#xD;
      Ponseti casting protocol. Previous research has shown that noncompliance with brace wear is&#xD;
      strongly associated with recurrence of clubfeet in this population. Recurrence often leads to&#xD;
      surgical intervention for these infants. Previous Kosair funded research conducted at&#xD;
      SHC-Lexington investigated actual brace wear rates compared to the prescribed wear time in a&#xD;
      sample of infants with clubfeet. In that study, brace wear rate significantly declined in the&#xD;
      first three months of wear. That study did not look at factors related to the compliance with&#xD;
      brace wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While studies have shown that better outcomes are associated with brace wear compliance in&#xD;
      the scoliosis and clubfoot populations, compliance rates are still poor. Reasons identified&#xD;
      by patients, parents and research for not complying with prescribed brace wear include the&#xD;
      inconvenience or irritability of the child when in the brace in the case of clubfeet, and&#xD;
      fear of looking different from peers, clothes not fitting properly, or discomfort in the case&#xD;
      of scoliosis. While reasons for noncompliance are many and can be complex, there has been&#xD;
      some research to indicate that personality traits may play a role in brace wear compliance.&#xD;
      Work done by Rivett looked at personality traits of scoliotic girls who wore a Cheneau brace&#xD;
      (a brace not commonly prescribed in North America and the United Kingdom) and found that&#xD;
      those who were compliant with their bracing prescription tended to be more emotionally&#xD;
      mature, stable and realistic than the noncompliant group. Although not well studied,&#xD;
      personality traits of infants with clubfoot and their caregiver might similarly affect their&#xD;
      compliance with brace wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past work has shown that when braces are worn as prescribed, treatment outcomes are improved&#xD;
      in those with scoliosis and clubfoot, yet bracing compliance is a consistent problem in both&#xD;
      populations. With adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and clubfoot being the largest and third&#xD;
      largest populations seen at SHC-Lexington, 3700 active patients and 2500 active patients,&#xD;
      respectively, it is imperative that we address brace wear compliance in order to offer the&#xD;
      best treatment outcome possible. At SHC-Lexington, during 2013 approximately 30 AIS patients&#xD;
      and 50 infants with clubfoot were prescribed braces for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the proposed study is to determine if personality traits are related&#xD;
      to compliance patterns for individuals undergoing brace treatment for AIS or Clubfeet. This&#xD;
      pilot project will examine different measures used to assess personality traits of&#xD;
      adolescents with AIS, babies with clubfeet and their parent/guardian/caregiver. Using these&#xD;
      identified measures, the association between traits and degree of compliance with the bracing&#xD;
      prescriptions will be evaluated. If certain personality traits are identified as indicators&#xD;
      for noncompliance, then additional support should be offered to those patients.&#xD;
