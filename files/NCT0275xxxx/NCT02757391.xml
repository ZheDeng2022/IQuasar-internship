    <textblock>
      This phase I pilot trial studies the side effects of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T&#xD;
      cells in treating patients with gastrointestinal tumors that have spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body. Tumor cells and blood are used to help create an adoptive T cell therapy, such as&#xD;
      CD8+ T cell therapy, that is individually designed for a patient and may help doctors learn&#xD;
      more about genetic changes in the tumor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving CD8+ T cell therapy and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      may work better in treating patients with gastrointestinal tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety of using a personalized adoptive T cell therapy in patients with&#xD;
      advanced gastrointestinal malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the persistence of an immune response after T cell infusion. II. Determine the&#xD;
      clinical benefit of adoptive T cell therapy in advanced gastrointestinal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 2 days prior to CD8+ T cell infusion, patients receive cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Patients undergo CD8+ T cell infusion IV over 2 hours on&#xD;
      day 0 and receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Beginning&#xD;
      on day 1 about 24 hours after CD8+ T cell infusion, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes on weeks 3, 6, 12, and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 24 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Histopathologic documentation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma,&#xD;

             metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG/ Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study in such a manner that the risk&#xD;
             of pregnancy is minimized. Suggested precautions should be used to minimize the risk&#xD;
             or pregnancy for at least 1 month before start of therapy, and while women are on&#xD;
             study for at least 8 weeks after pembrolizumab is stopped. WOCBP include any female&#xD;
             who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is&#xD;
             not postmenopausal. Acceptable forms of birth control include condom, diaphragm,&#xD;
             hormonal, IUD, or sponge plus spermacide. Abstinence is also an acceptable form of&#xD;
             birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Men must be willing and able to use an acceptable method of birth control, during and&#xD;
             for at least 3 months after completion of the study, if their sexual partners are&#xD;
             WOCBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate vein access: consider PICC or other central line.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have adequate tissue (fresh or frozen) available or planned removal of&#xD;
             adequate tissue for analysis. At least 250mg of tumor are needed for peptide elution.&#xD;
             There is no specific time limit on how long the tissue can remain frozen prior to use.&#xD;
             The tissue will be collected and analyzed under Lab protocol PA15-0176.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients can have any lines (including zero) of prior therapy to sign consent prior to&#xD;
             tissue harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Toxicity related to prior therapy must either have returned to &lt;/= grade 1, baseline,&#xD;
             or been deemed irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. ELIGIBILITY FOR TREATMENT: ECOG/Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Bi-dimensionally measurable disease by radiographic imaging (CT scan) that represents&#xD;
             at least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. At least 4 Weeks must have elapsed since the last chemotherapy, radiotherapy or major&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Toxicity related to prior therapy must either have returned to less than or equal to&#xD;
             grade 1, baseline, or been deemed irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects must have received at least one line of chemotherapy prior to receiving&#xD;
             adoptive T cell therapy and should have exhausted standard of care systemic therapy&#xD;
             options. The decision to implement the T cell therapy will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
             treating physician. The timing and total exposure to chemotherapy will depend on the&#xD;
             tumor type in question (more systemic options for breast cancer; fewer for gastric&#xD;
             cancer, for example). Due to the heterogeneity of tumors being treated in this&#xD;
             protocol, the discretion of the treating physician in terms of timing of immunotherapy&#xD;
             will be critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. EXCLUSION FOR ENROLLMENT: Any other malignancy from which the patient has been&#xD;
             disease-free for less than 5 years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured&#xD;

             arrhythmias in EKG requiring drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active and untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases (including metastasis&#xD;

             diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Inadequate organ function at enrollment defined by: WBC less than or equal to 2000/uL.&#xD;
