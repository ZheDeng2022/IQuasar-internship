    <textblock>
      Norepinephrine (NE) is a potent vasopressor used in septic shock to reverse hypotension.&#xD;
      Early infusion of NE was associated with a favorable clinical outcome in a large cohort of&#xD;
      patients . When administered early, NE increases cardiac output (CO) in patients with septic&#xD;
      shock . This effect was suggested to be mainly related to an increased cardiac preload via&#xD;
      the α-adrenergic-mediated decrease in systemic venous capacitance . Whether NE exerts a&#xD;
      positive effect on cardiac contractility through β1-adrenergic stimulation is unclear. On the&#xD;
      one hand, the sensitivity of β1-adrenergic receptors can be abnormally reduced in septic&#xD;
      conditions. On the other hand, such a sepsis-induced down-regulation of β1-adrenergic&#xD;
      receptors may occur relatively late and thus, might not be observed when NE is administered&#xD;
      early. Our study was designed to examine the inotropic effects of NE when administered in the&#xD;
      early phase of human septic shock&#xD;

      It is a prospective observational study, in two 15-bed intensive care units, including adult&#xD;
      patients with septic shock who have a mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt; 65 mmHg within the first&#xD;
      three hours after the start of resuscitation. For every patient, the physician taking care of&#xD;
      the patient should have already decided to initiate NE or to increase its dose in order to&#xD;
      achieve a MAP value of at least 65mmHg without any other change of the associated therapy&#xD;
      (fluid administration, ventilator settings, other drugs). The study was approved by the&#xD;
      institutional review board of our institution (Comité de Protection des Personnes,&#xD;
      Paris-Ile-de-France VII). Informed patient (or next-of-kin) consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: demographic and clinical information (origin of sepsis, major elements of&#xD;
      the clinical history) were collected. The volume of fluids administered before inclusion, the&#xD;
      use of mechanical ventilation and the interval time between the start of resuscitation and&#xD;
      inclusion (T0) were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic data: At T0 and at T1, defined as the time a MAP value of at least 65 mmHg was&#xD;
      reached after initiating NE (or increasing its dose), heart rate (HR), systolic arterial&#xD;
      pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), MAP and blood lactate concentration were&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiographic data: Echocardiographic measurements were performed at T0 and&#xD;
      T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) examination were performed with 3.75 MHZ probe using a&#xD;
      CX50 Philips and a Vivid i (GE Healthcare) machine. Patients were on supine flat or lateral&#xD;
      supine positions depending on their respiratory tolerance. A four- and five-chamber apical&#xD;
      views were used in order to collect the following variables: left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction (LVEF) calculated by the biplane method of disks summation (modified Simpson's&#xD;
      rule), velocity-time integral (VTI) of the sub-aortic flow, tissue Doppler imaging of&#xD;
      tricuspid annular motion (Sa), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) measured by&#xD;
      M-mode echocardiography, the peak early (E) and late (A) transmitral flow velocity, the mean&#xD;
      early diastolic velocity (Ea) of the lateral mitral annulus, the ratios E/A and E/Ea and&#xD;
      tissue Doppler imaging of mean systolic velocity of the lateral mitral annulus (Sm). All the&#xD;
      parameters were averaged over three beats or five beats in case of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
