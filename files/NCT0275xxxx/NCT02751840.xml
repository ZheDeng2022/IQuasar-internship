    <textblock>
      Background. The prevalence of obesity has increased in the last two decades. To maintain body&#xD;
      weight energy expenditure (EE) should be equal to energy intake (EI). A low EE predisposes&#xD;
      individuals to weight gain and to obesity that can also results from low resting metabolic&#xD;
      rate (RMR). Caffeine (Caf) is an active food ingredient and is widely consumed globally, and&#xD;
      has an important impact on energy balance. Caf reduces appetite (EI) and increases EE, thus,&#xD;
      Caf has a potential role in body weight reduction. Caf causes higher total daily energy&#xD;
      expenditure (TDEE) in normal weight (NW) people compared to obese (OW). Moreover Caf is&#xD;
      linked to decreased fat oxidation in OW. There are differences between OW and NW in Caf&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, but no differences reported between NW and OW females in its effects on&#xD;
      RMR. There is a gender difference in the influence of Caf on metabolism. The investigators&#xD;
      are aware of no previous studies which compared the effect of Caf on the RMR of NW and OW&#xD;
      men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. 1) To compare the effect of Caf and coffee on resting metabolic rate (RMR) values&#xD;
      in healthy normal-weight (NW) men and overweight (OW) men. 2) To develop Caf intake frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire (in Hebrew)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. RMR values will be higher and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) values will be&#xD;
      lower in NW compared to the values measured in OW men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. 33 men (16 NW and 17 OW) were reported to the laboratory on 4 separate occasions&#xD;
      (placebo, Caf tablets, coffee and decaffeinated coffee). During the lab sessions they were&#xD;
      undergo complete anthropometric measurements and RMR measured (one of the study conditions)&#xD;
      using indirect calorimetry. Additionally, respiratory exchange ratio (RER) which is&#xD;
      calculated as the ratio between CO2 production (VCO2) and O2 consumption (VO2) (VCO2/VO2),&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate (HR) response recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of this study is that the results will contribute to the scientific basis of&#xD;
      weight control and health interventions programs (diet and physical activity) in overweight&#xD;
      men.&#xD;

      Methods. 16 NW and 17 OW men were reported to the laboratory on 4 separate occasions&#xD;
      (placebo, Caf tablets, coffee and decaffeinated coffee) each separated by 2-7 days. Before&#xD;
      the first meeting they refill caffeine, physical activity and medical questionnaires. The&#xD;
      investigators recruited only men who were healthy non-smokers with no comorbidities and the&#xD;
      daily caffeine consumption was under 400 mg. Before each meeting participants had to comply&#xD;
      guidelines outlined included fasting for 8 hours, avoiding intense physical activity 14 hours&#xD;
      and moderate exercise 2 hours before measurements. The meetings conducted in the morning when&#xD;
      the first session included anthropometric measurements (weight, height and waist&#xD;
      circumference) and body composition measurements using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)&#xD;
      and a digital caliper. Each session began with a measuring resting blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate (Polar telemetric systems), after that participants were given randomly placebo or Caf&#xD;
      tablets or coffee or decaffeinated coffee, waiting half an hour and then measuring the RMR&#xD;
      and respiratory exchange ratio (RER), for half an hour using indirect calorimetry (canopy&#xD;
      system). Then again measured blood pressure and heart rate at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated for 16 participant in each group, according to an expected&#xD;
      change of 3% at RMR values between the groups with the power of 80% and significance of 0.05&#xD;
      . standard deviation (SD).&#xD;
