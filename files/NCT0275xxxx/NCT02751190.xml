      In the present study the investigators aimed to investigate the relationship between surgical&#xD;
      methods and chronic pain in over 20 000 patients who underwent groin hernia repair in Sweden&#xD;
    </textblock>

      The Swedish Hernia Register (SHR) covers more than 98% of all groin hernia repairs in Sweden.&#xD;
      Approximately 16.000 hernia repairs is performed annually. All patients are identified by the&#xD;
      Swedish personal identification number (PIN), which is assigned at birth and used in&#xD;
      virtually all contacts with Swedish healthcare and authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables in the SHR are collected prospectively at the time of surgery, reported by the&#xD;
      surgeon. Variables collected are numerous and contain among else age, gender, method of&#xD;
      repair, anaesthesia type, hernia anatomy, recurrent or primary repair, sliding hernia,&#xD;
      handling of the hernia sac, resident or consultant surgeon, annual surgeon volume, and type&#xD;
      of unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed variable list is found at the Swedish National Board of Welfare website&#xD;
      (http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/register/registerservice/nationellakvalitetsregister/svensktbr&#xD;
      ackregister-nationell) Variables are validated thru annual validation of 10% of participating&#xD;
      units where register data are checked against chart review made on a randomized sample of&#xD;
      patients and units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient can be registered more than once and be followed in time, which is possible by using&#xD;
      the PIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative pain is not registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting 2013, a questionnaire regarding Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) is sent to&#xD;
      all patients having an groin hernia repair from September 2012 until December 2014. Patients&#xD;
      are identified in the SHR and postal addresses obtained through the register of the whole&#xD;
      population, using the PIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were sent a short form of Inguinal Pain Questionnaire (IPQ). IPQ is a validated pain&#xD;
      questionnaire, specifically designed for groin hernia repair. The key question sent were &quot;&#xD;
      Grade the pain you felt in the operated groin the last week&quot;. Patients then answered in a 7&#xD;
      grades scale, where pain was correlated to if it could be ignored and to what extent it&#xD;
      limited activities of daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire could be answered on regular paper or through a web questionnaire. One&#xD;
      reminder was sent if no answer was collected within 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical methods were divided in 5 groups. Total ExtraPeritoneal (TEP) (Reference group),&#xD;
      TransAbdominal PrePeritoneal (TAPP), Open anterior mesh technique (OAM i.e Lichtenstien),&#xD;
      Open anterior non mesh ( ONM i.e Shouldice, McVay, Bassini), Combined Anterior end posterior&#xD;
      Techniques (CAP i.e. Plug, Prolene Hernia System, Onestep), and Open Preperitoneal Mesh&#xD;
      Techniques (OPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of surgery and other variables at index surgery for each individual patient was&#xD;
      derived from the SHR through the PIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using data from SHR. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching will be used for&#xD;
      analysis. Adjustments is made for all known and possible confounders such as age (above or&#xD;
      below median age), gender, primary or recurrent hernia, emergent or electively operated, ASA&#xD;
      class (≤2/&gt;2),mesh weight (light (≤50g/m2) or heavy (&gt; 50g/m2)), resident or consultant&#xD;
      surgeon, annual surgeon volume (≤25/&gt;25), hernia anatomy (femoral/medial/lateral- combined&#xD;
      hernias considered as lateral), per or postoperative complication yes/no (hematoma, severe&#xD;
      pain, infection and other complications), handling of the hernia sac (divided excised or&#xD;
      invaginated) and type of hospital and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data on different variables is managed by exclusion or imputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events such as preoperative complication is reported by the surgeon, and&#xD;
      postoperative complications are detected by registry administrator at the surgical site by&#xD;
      chart review 30 days postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reliability test (test-retest) is made on a random sample of patients 30 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non responder analysis is conducted to asses wether patients not responding on the primary&#xD;
      questionnaire differs from the responders according to perceived pain. This is done by&#xD;
      randomly select patients to conduct a telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations is based on the assumption of 75% response rate (0.75x30.000)= 22.500. Of&#xD;
      these approximately 15% TEP=3375. Of TEP approximately 50% is done bilaterally, which is&#xD;
      excluded from this study. Assuming a difference in pain of 4% in favor of TEP, it is needed&#xD;
      more than 1200 patients in the TEP group to detect these differences, considered clinically&#xD;
      meaningful.&#xD;
