  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well tremelimumab and durvalumab work in&#xD;
      treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver and can be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as tremelimumab and durvalumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and feasibility of adding tremelimumab 75 mg intravenously (IV) plus&#xD;
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500 mg administered once pre-operatively and 4 cycles of durvalumab&#xD;
      1500 mg IV every 4 weeks for 4 cycles post-operatively in patients who are candidates for&#xD;
      resection for colorectal cancer liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore the changes in various immune parameters, including programmed cell death-1 ligand&#xD;
      1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death1 (PD-1) expression in the tumor, over treatment and&#xD;
      correlate with response and survival with goal of biomarker discovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the relapse-free survival (RFS) in all enrolled subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 4 hours during week 11.&#xD;
      Between weeks 15 and 17, patients undergo liver surgery. Patients then receive durvalumab IV&#xD;
      over 1 hour during weeks 21, 25, 29, and 33.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice a year for 5 years.&#xD;
