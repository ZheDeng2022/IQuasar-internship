  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly one in three adults has prediabetes, a condition that substantially increases the risk&#xD;
      of heart attacks and stroke. The increased cardiovascular risk associated with prediabetes&#xD;
      can be effectively managed by lifestyle changes or medication therapy, but recent data shows&#xD;
      few prediabetes patients are treated effectively. In this project, we will adapt, implement,&#xD;
      and evaluate a proven electronic health record-linked, web-based clinical decision support&#xD;
      system to identify patients with prediabetes and provide prioritized treatment&#xD;
      recommendations to patients and providers in a rural health system. The results of the&#xD;
      project will provide a template for implementation of more efficient and effective rural&#xD;
      healthcare and have the potential to substantially and improve cardiovascular quality of care&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes of millions of rural Americans with prediabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly one in three adults in rural communities has prediabetes, a condition that increases&#xD;
      the risk of heart attacks and stroke but can be managed by use of metformin, lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions, and control of major cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. However, current&#xD;
      prediabetes care is characterized by: (a) delayed recognition of prediabetes; (b) patient&#xD;
      unawareness of effective treatment options for prediabetes; (c) poor control of concomitant&#xD;
      major CV risk factors; (d) very low rates of metformin initiation; and (e) low rates of&#xD;
      follow up to assess ongoing effectiveness of prediabetes management.1-3 Increased use of&#xD;
      electronic health records (EHR) in rural communities now provides a new opportunity to&#xD;
      improve awareness and management of prediabetes and to reduce these patients' significant CV&#xD;
      risk burden. In this project, we implement and evaluate an EHR-linked, Web-based clinical&#xD;
      decision support (CDS) system that identifies patients with prediabetes and provides patients&#xD;
      and their primary care providers personalized, evidence-based CDS and follow up to reduce&#xD;
      risk of heart attacks or stroke. To accomplish this objective, we randomly allocate 30&#xD;
      primary care clinics with their 450 primary care providers and estimated 17,000 prediabetes&#xD;
      patients to one of two intervention arms: Usual Care; or else the prediabetes CDS to optimize&#xD;
      management and follow up of prediabetes patients with uncontrolled CV risk factors.&#xD;
      Random-effects models assess intervention impact on: (a) American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) pooled CV risk; (b) major CV risk factors&#xD;
      (blood pressure, lipids, HbA1c, smoking, and BMI); (c) use of evidence-based drugs, including&#xD;
      metformin, and lifestyle interventions to manage prediabetes; and (d) patient and provider&#xD;
      satisfaction with the intervention strategy. We also conduct a state-of-the-art cost and a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis of the interventions relative to usual care. The Reach,&#xD;
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, supplemented by&#xD;
      the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), is used to assess&#xD;
      implementation processes and outcomes in a rural/urban health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the project will provide a template for implementation of personalized CDS&#xD;
      tools in rural and urban health settings, resulting in more efficient and effective rural&#xD;
      healthcare that can be broadly applied across many clinical domains, incorporates patient&#xD;
      treatment preferences, and has the potential to substantially improve the quality of CV care&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes of millions of Americans with prediabetes residing in medically&#xD;
      underserved areas.&#xD;

    <measure>Predicted Annual Rate of Change in 10 Year Risk of Fatal or Nonfatal Heart Attack or Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>Index visit to 12 months post index visit</time_frame>
    <description>10-year cardiovascular risk was calculated at the index and all post-index patient encounters. A comparison of the difference in model-estimated annual rate of change in cardiovascular risk in Clinical Decision Support versus Usual Care clinics tested the primary efficacy hypothesis. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) pooled CV risk calculator provides sex- and race-specific 10-year risk estimates for the first ASCVD event for black &amp; white men &amp; women aged 40-79 years. Variables included in risk assessment equations: age, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP) diabetes mellitus (diabetes), and current smoking status. 10-year risk for ASCVD categorized as: Low (&lt;5%), Borderline (5% to 7.4%), Intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%), High (≥20%). Numerator: Rate of change in Clinical Decision Support. Denominator: Rate of change in Usual Care. Relative Risk &lt; 1 supports primary hypothesis.</description>

          <description>The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 10-year pooled atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk engine was used for 40-75 years olds, using the index visit values of systolic Blood Pressure, High Density Lipoproteins, total cholesterol, Body Mass Index, and smoking status. A lower result is better. Results range from Low-risk (&lt;5%), Borderline risk (5% to 7.4%), Intermediate risk (7.5% to 19.9%), and High risk (≥20%). Statistical modeling to create the risk assessment tool was developed using a variety of participants from several large, diverse NHLBI-sponsored studies</description>

        <description>10-year cardiovascular risk was calculated at the index and all post-index patient encounters. A comparison of the difference in model-estimated annual rate of change in cardiovascular risk in Clinical Decision Support versus Usual Care clinics tested the primary efficacy hypothesis. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) pooled CV risk calculator provides sex- and race-specific 10-year risk estimates for the first ASCVD event for black &amp; white men &amp; women aged 40-79 years. Variables included in risk assessment equations: age, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP) diabetes mellitus (diabetes), and current smoking status. 10-year risk for ASCVD categorized as: Low (&lt;5%), Borderline (5% to 7.4%), Intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%), High (≥20%). Numerator: Rate of change in Clinical Decision Support. Denominator: Rate of change in Usual Care. Relative Risk &lt; 1 supports primary hypothesis.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>CDS use was lower than the 80% target rate. Many patients had limited geographic or financial access to diabetes prevention programs. Due to differences in risk equations for patients age 40-75 (American College Cardiology/American Heart Association 10-year) and age 18-40 (Framingham 30 year), and missing lipid data in younger adults, the main analysis focused on age 40-75 years. Many with prediabetes had only modest potential for cardiovascular risk reductions clinicians may not prioritize.</limitations_and_caveats>
