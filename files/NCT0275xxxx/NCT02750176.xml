      A single arm design will be used to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      closed-chain rehabilitation protocol for patients with full thickness rotator cuff tears of&#xD;
      the shoulder. Full thickness rotator cuff tears will be documented using MRI or ultrasound&#xD;
      images. 30 participants will be recruited for this study. The rehabilitation protocol will&#xD;
      include two stages: stage 1, physical therapy, and stage 2, gym program. Stage I will include&#xD;
      a total number of session between 12 and 24. The number of session included in stage 2, will&#xD;
      depend on the total number of session completed during stage 1. The total duration of both&#xD;
      stages will 5 months.&#xD;

      Closed-chain exercises have been used extensively in rehabilitation approaches to treat a&#xD;
      diverse range of musculoskeletal diagnoses. The closed-chain approach theoretically&#xD;
      facilitates co-contraction to improve joint mobility, stability and motor control, as well as&#xD;
      decreasing potential compression of the RC tendons in the subacromial space. The closed-chain&#xD;
      exercises are performed with the hands in contact with the floor/table, while the shoulder&#xD;
      joint moves and gravity provides resistance. This approach may prevent tear progression and&#xD;
      improve joint mechanics, shoulder pain, and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 1 - Physical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided closed-chain exercises in the physical therapy treatment by a&#xD;
      licensed physical therapist. The length of each session will be 1 hour. Participants will&#xD;
      attend 2 sessions per week, for a minimum of 12 sessions. The maximum number of sessions to&#xD;
      complete Stage I of the protocol is 24. Each physical therapy session will consist of&#xD;
      closed-chain strengthening, along with stretching and aerobic exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the closed-chain strengthening portion, participants will be asked to perform 6&#xD;
      exercises focusing on the shoulder girdle. Closed-chain strengthening will be performed with&#xD;
      the shoulder moving over a fixed hand. Resistance will be provided by body weight against&#xD;
      gravity. To off-load and progress the amount of body-weight resistance, elastic bands will be&#xD;
      used to support body weight. The elastic bands will be attached to support frame used for the&#xD;
      exercises. As the patient improves, less elastic band support will be provided to allow&#xD;
      increased resistance via the patient's body weight. The criteria for determining if the&#xD;
      resistance is too high or the exercise is too difficult will be based on 2 criteria: 1.)&#xD;
      after the exercise is completed, the participant rates their shoulder pain &gt; 2/10 increase as&#xD;
      compared to baseline pain taken at the start of that day's treatment session, on the numeric&#xD;
      pain rating scale, and 2.) BORG scale &gt; 3 (moderate difficulty) and an inability of the&#xD;
      participant to maintain proper exercise form and full range of motion. If these criteria are&#xD;
      met then the physical therapist will modify the exercise so the subject can perform similar&#xD;
      movement pattern without pain. The goal will be for the participant to perform 2 sets of 20&#xD;
      repetitions, of each exercise. When the participant is able to perform 24 repetitions with&#xD;
      the given load, over 2 successive treatment sessions, then the resistance will be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recognize that there is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of closed-chain exercises in patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators are employing several steps to assure safety. At the beginning&#xD;
      of each session, each patient will fill out a questionnaire to assess for adverse effects of&#xD;
      exercises (such as severe joint pain). After each exercise, participants will rate their&#xD;
      shoulder pain level and their perceived difficulty with the exercise. This information will&#xD;
      be used to tailor the intervention according to the response to the intervention.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it will allow for monitoring for adverse outcomes of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform aerobic exercises of a stationary bike, elliptical, and treadmill.&#xD;
      Aerobic exercise will last about 10 to 15 minutes each session. Intensity of aerobic&#xD;
      exercises will be adjusted throughout stage I. The target is to exercise at least at a 4&#xD;
      level (somewhat hard) on the BORG scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 2 - Gym program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in a gym program following discharge from Stage 1. The Gym&#xD;
      Program will be provided by a health care professionals trained in the delivery of exercise.&#xD;
      Each session will be 1 hour. Participants will attend 2 sessions per week, for 8- 12 weeks&#xD;
      depending on when they are discharged from Stage I. Each session will consist of closed-chain&#xD;
      strengthening, stretching, and aerobic exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the closed-chain strengthening portion, participants will execute the same&#xD;
      six-strengthening exercises as stage I. The next phase involves progressing to a moderate&#xD;
      resistance load that will allow the participant to complete 2 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions of&#xD;
      a given exercise. When the participant is able to perform more than 12 repetitions with a&#xD;
      given load, over the course of 2 successive training sessions, then the resistance will be&#xD;
      incrementally increased. The maximum resistance will be against body weight (no support from&#xD;
      bands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform aerobic exercises alternating each session between a stationary&#xD;
      bike, elliptical, and treadmill. Aerobic exercise will last about 15 to 20 minutes each&#xD;
      session. Intensity of aerobic exercises will be adjusted throughout stage II. The target will&#xD;
      be to exercise at least at a 4 level (somewhat hard) on the BORG scale.&#xD;
