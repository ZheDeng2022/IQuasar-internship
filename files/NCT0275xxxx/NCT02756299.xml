  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with serious complications. Positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (PAP) is the first line treatment of OSA, which eliminates obstructive&#xD;
      events, reduces daytime sleepiness, and improves quality of life, especially in those with&#xD;
      excessive daytime sleepiness. However, despite the benefits of the PAP treatment, overall&#xD;
      acceptance and adherence rates are not fully promising. Less is known regarding the PAP&#xD;
      adherence rates in Turkey. In the current study, the researchers primarily addressed if an&#xD;
      intensified patient education strategy including the polysomnography (PSG) charts viewing&#xD;
      followed by frequent follow-ups would improve the compliance rates at long-term in patients&#xD;
      with OSA.&#xD;

      OSA is a common disorder with serious complications. PAP is the first line treatment of OSA,&#xD;
      but overall acceptance and adherence rates are not fully promising. In the current study, the&#xD;
      researchers primarily addressed if an intensified patient education strategy including the&#xD;
      PSG charts viewing followed by frequent follow-ups would improve the compliance rates at&#xD;
      long-term in patients with OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center, randomized, controlled study was conducted at the Süreyyapaşa Chest&#xD;
      Diseases and Thoracic Surgery Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul between June 2014&#xD;
      and April 2015. Eligible OSA patients were randomized to Standard Support (SS) group (general&#xD;
      information about OSA and PAP treatment at baseline), or to Educational Support (ES) group&#xD;
      (additional polysomnography chart viewing from both diagnostic and titration nights). All&#xD;
      patients were scheduled to five PAP control visits between 2 weeks and 6 months after the PAP&#xD;
      prescription. Primary outcome was the PAP compliance (4 h/night for 70% of all the nights) at&#xD;
      the last visit.&#xD;
