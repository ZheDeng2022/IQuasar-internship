  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will prospectively determine whether the relapse-free and overall survival&#xD;
      in patients who have cleared their leukemia-associated mutations treated with standard&#xD;
      consolidation chemotherapy is superior to what is expected based on historical controls. The&#xD;
      investigators will also prospectively determine the relapse-free and overall survival of&#xD;
      patients who have not cleared their mutations. Because the relapse rate of patients with&#xD;
      persistent mutations is expected to be high, treatment with either standard of care&#xD;
      consolidation therapy alone or alloSCT will be permitted, at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Considered to be suitable intensive (cytotoxic) induction candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has previously untreated, de novo, non-M3 AML with intermediate-risk disease&#xD;
             (Intermediate-I or Intermediate-II) as defined by ELN criteria OR normal cytogenetics&#xD;
             with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD. Monoallelic CEBPA mutations are not considered&#xD;
             favorable risk and are therefore eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has undergone cytotoxic induction therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In a morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, or&#xD;
             morphologic complete remission post-induction after no more than 2 induction cycles as&#xD;
             defined by revised IWG criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at Washington University must be enrolled in HRPO# 201011766 (&quot;Tissue&#xD;
             Acquisition for Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases&quot;).This&#xD;
             is not a requirement for secondary sites. However, secondary sites must provide&#xD;
             informed consent forms that document that permission for whole genome, whole exome,&#xD;
             and/or genome wide sequencing, and data sharing among institutions, was obtained.&#xD;
             Because we will be also be sequencing non-diseased (normal) tissue, the informed&#xD;
             consent forms must explicitly ask if patients wish to be informed, (or in the case of&#xD;
             their death, their next-of-kin) if a deleterious mutation is identified in their&#xD;
             non-diseased tissue, as this may be heritable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to comply with the treatment assignment:&#xD;

               -  Intent to proceed with HiDAC consolidation for LAM VAF &lt;2.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intent to proceed with either HiDAC consolidation or allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
                  transplantation, at the discretion of the treating physician, for LAM ≥2.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(15;17)(q22;q12); PML-RARA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapy-related AML (defined as occurrence of AML due to prior exposure to&#xD;
             chemotherapy or radiation for malignancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Secondary AML (defined as development of AML in patients with an antecedent&#xD;
             hematological malignancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a medical or psychosocial conditions that would prevent study compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known seropositivity for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients who are&#xD;
             seropositive because of hepatitis B vaccine are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition&#xD;
             to cytarabine.&#xD;

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 3 days of signing consent.&#xD;
