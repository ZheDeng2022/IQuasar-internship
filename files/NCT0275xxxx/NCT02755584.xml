      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular senescence is the aging of cells. It is a complex process that may be connected with&#xD;
      aging and age-related diseases. It is unknown if these cells appear around wound sites in&#xD;
      humans a few days after skin injury and if there are differences in young and old&#xD;
      individuals. This study is being done to look at how cells in your body respond to small skin&#xD;
      wounds. This information may help treat age-related diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how cells in the body respond to small skin wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 20-39 or 70+&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood sample. They&#xD;
      will fast before the screening visit. Women will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 study visits over about 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 1 and 2: Participants will fast before and have blood taken. Women will have a urine&#xD;
      test. All participants will have 2 skin biopsies. A spot on the upper arm will be numbed. Two&#xD;
      small pieces of skin will be removed. They will keep the area covered until the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Participants will have their vital signs taken. Their biopsy wounds will be measured&#xD;
      and photographed.&#xD;

      Objectives and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this proof-of-concept study is to understand the physiological role of&#xD;
      senescent cells in humans during the aging process using a model of wound healing. Cellular&#xD;
      senescence is the phenomenon by which normal cells cease to divide in response to a stress.&#xD;
      We aim to determine if in healthy humans: (1) senescent cells appear around wound sites a few&#xD;
      days after skin injury; (2) the number of senescent cells induced by skin injury increases&#xD;
      with age; (3) the wound healing process, as determined by the size of the healed wounds, is&#xD;
      altered with aging; (4) biomarkers of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)&#xD;
      increase significantly in the tissue around the wound a few days after skin injury, and the&#xD;
      magnitude of increase is higher in older compared to younger persons; (5) ethnic differences&#xD;
      in the dynamics of the appearance of senescent cells and whether such a difference is&#xD;
      associated with wound healing. We also want to describe changes that occur with aging in DNA&#xD;
      methylation and histone acetylation, gene expression, and protein expression within senescent&#xD;
      cells in comparison to normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and twenty-eight healthy participants, sixty-four between the ages of 20-39 years&#xD;
      and sixty-four 70 years old or older will be recruited for this pilot study. Of the&#xD;
      sixty-four participants in each age group, thirty-two will be men and thirty-two will be&#xD;
      women and sixteen&#xD;
&#xD;
      will be Caucasian and sixteen will be African American. Each participant will have two 3mm&#xD;
      skin biopsies on the inner upper arm during baseline visit (Visit 1) and two 6mm skin&#xD;
      biopsies concentric to the previous site during Visit 2. Visit 2 will be scheduled on 8&#xD;
      different days (day 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 21 and 30) after the baseline visit with two men and&#xD;
      two woman from each age/ethnic group for each of the days. A follow-up visit will be&#xD;
      scheduled at the discretion of the medical staff. Senescent cells will be visualized by&#xD;
      confocal microscopy based on a number of senescent markers described in the literature.&#xD;
      Senescent biomarkers will be measured in the tissue and systemically at baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular senescence is a complex process characterized by arrest in replication that is&#xD;
      thought to be intrinsically connected with aging and age-related diseases. Recently,&#xD;
      researchers have&#xD;
&#xD;
      suggested that senescent cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its&#xD;
      associated complications. Therefore, understanding the physiological role of senescent cells&#xD;
      is critically important for understanding aging and age-related diseases such as type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Preclinical data have shown that senescent cells were inducible during cutaneous&#xD;
      wound healing. Our preliminary results showed that there may be a difference in rate of&#xD;
      granulation tissue formation with ethnicity. Therefore, this method can be used to quantify&#xD;
&#xD;
      senescent cell response after a standard stimulus and to verify whether the magnitude of&#xD;
      senescence response correlate with aging and ethnicity. In the future this method could be&#xD;
      used to test interventions that can modify the senescence response, and may be an invaluable&#xD;
      method for assessing novel treatments of type 2 diabetes involving senescent cells.&#xD;
