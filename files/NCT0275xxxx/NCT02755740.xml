      This project aims to promote quitting, and reduction for those who do not want to quit, among&#xD;
      female smokers through training female youth as smoking cessation and reduction ambassadors&#xD;
      (SCRA). The objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Promote age and gender-specific smoking cessation and reduction to the female population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Deliver a smoking cessation and reduction ambassador training workshop to equip and&#xD;
           empower female youth with the knowledge on the adverse effects of smoking on female&#xD;
           smokers and the skills in smoking cessation and reduction and in raising public&#xD;
           awareness of the harmful effects of smoking on female smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Have the trained female youth to deliver a brief advice (AWARD) to female smokers to&#xD;
           help them to quit or reduce smoking and refer them to the female-specific smoking&#xD;
           cessation hotline or the Department of Health Quitline for further assistance if needed.&#xD;

      Phase I: Increase public awareness of the beneficial effects of smoking cessation on female&#xD;
      smokers Five thousand leaflets on woman smoking cessation will be distributed to the Girl&#xD;
      Guide, the University of Hong Kong and 40 secondary schools. For those who are not ready to&#xD;
      join the training, they will be encouraged to help to increase the awareness of the&#xD;
      importance of promoting smoking cessation by disseminating the leaflets to others, especially&#xD;
      female smokers in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Deliver a smoking cessation training curriculum for the female youth recruited&#xD;
      through the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association, the University of Hong Kong and 40 secondary&#xD;
      schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to train 120-150 female youth (with the priority given to the Hong Kong&#xD;
      Girl Guides Association) to be SCRA with better understanding on the needs and feelings of&#xD;
      female smokers.The investigators will deliver a half-day SCRA training workshop to the female&#xD;
      youth. In addition to the leaflets above, the investigators shall publicize the training&#xD;
      workshop and recruit participants via bulk emails, newsletters and the homepage of the Hong&#xD;
      Kong Girl Guides Association, the University of Hong Kong and 40 secondary schools. The&#xD;
      investigators will draw on our experience in conducting smoking cessation training programmes&#xD;
      for our existing projects such as Youth Quitline and Quit to Win Contests. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators shall train and empower participants how to deliver a brief smoking cessation&#xD;
      advice to female smokers. For those who do not want to quit, they will be advised to reduce&#xD;
      smoking as the first step towards quitting. Throughout the training, participants will be&#xD;
      taught to deliver the &quot;AWARD&quot; approach: 1) Ask about smoking, 2) Warn the smokers that at&#xD;
      least half will be killed by smoking, and the female specific harms due to smoking, 3) Advise&#xD;
      to quit (or reduce) as soon as possible, 4) Refer to a cessation clinic or hotline, and 5) Do&#xD;
      it again until they quit.7 At the end of the training workshop, participants should be&#xD;
      capable of delivering brief smoking cessation and reduction advice to female smokers, and a&#xD;
      referral system will be set up so that women who accept more intensive counselling can be&#xD;
      referred to our and other more specialised smoking cessation services. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      training, a certificate of attendance will be awarded to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the training will be evaluated before and immediately afterwards, and 3- and&#xD;
      6-month post training. A smoking-, tobacco control-, and smoking cessation and&#xD;
      reduction-related knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) survey, 15 using a modified version&#xD;
      of previous questionnaires which have been used to assess other smoking cessation training&#xD;
      workshop,16 will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there is increasing evidence that the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) is&#xD;
      helpful in explaining the psychological mechanisms in bridging the gap between intention and&#xD;
      actual change in health behaviour.17 According to HAPA model, an individual's intention&#xD;
      either to engage in a preventive measure or to modify risky behaviour in favour of a healthy&#xD;
      practice, action plans and action control help the individual to structure a strategy for&#xD;
      maintaining healthy practices and defeating other conflicting ideas.18 Adopting the HAPA&#xD;
      model,17 intention, self-efficacy, and planning to provide smoking cessation and reduction&#xD;
      advice will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Deliver a age and gender-specific smoking cessation advice&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trained female SCRA will be encouraged to deliver &quot;AWARD&quot; to at least 2 female smokers to&#xD;
      advise them to reduce and quit smoking. Self-help smoking cessation booklet designed by Hong&#xD;
      Kong Council on Smoking and Health, a partner of our smoking cessation research team, will be&#xD;
      provided. The trained youth ambassadors can identify and reach the target female smokers in&#xD;
      the following ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. from their family members, relatives, friends, peers, schoolmates, or colleagues in&#xD;
           workplaces;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the trained youth ambassadors cannot identify and reach target female smokers from&#xD;
           (1), the investigators can refer female smokers to them through our other smoking&#xD;
           cessation projects, such as Youth Quitline or Quit to Win project with the consensus&#xD;
           from the female smokers&#xD;

Female youth smokers will give consent and be referred to our Youth Quitline (5111 4333), a smoking cessation telephone counselling for young people aged 25 or below which has counselled 1257 smokers with a quit rate of 21.9% at 6 months. If necessary, the female smokers can be referred to other smoking cessation services (e.g., the integrated smoking cessation hotline by the Department of Health (1833-183).</description>
