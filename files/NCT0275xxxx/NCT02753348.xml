      Copenhagen Baby Heart is an observational, cohort study of &gt;30.000 children born in the&#xD;
      Copenhagen area 2016-2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborns are examined with echocardiography, electrocardiogram, measurements of oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and analyses of umbilical cord blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the baseline assessments in Copenhagen Baby Heart are to assess the&#xD;
      prevalence of congenital and inherited heart disease unrecognized prenatally, to assess the&#xD;
      yield of routine echocardiography shortly after birth and to establish reference values for&#xD;
      echocardiography in Danish neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective follow-up of the birth cohort is planned with the purpose to assess the life-long&#xD;
      development of cardiovascular disease as well as other conditions and to study associations&#xD;
      between both pre- and postnatal exposure and disease, including life style, environmental and&#xD;
      genetic factors.&#xD;

      Copenhagen Baby Heart is an observational, cohort study of &gt;30.000 children born in the&#xD;
      Copenhagen area 2016-2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the prevalence of congenital and inherited heart disease not detected&#xD;
           prenatally, e.g. bicuspid aortic valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the diagnostic and clinical yield of routine echocardiography in neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish reference values for echocardiography and ECG for Danish neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish reference values for routine biochemical analyses in umbilical cord blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia in Danish newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the life-long development of cardiovascular disease as well as other&#xD;
           conditions and to study associations between both pre- and postnatal exposure and&#xD;
           disease, including life style, environmental and genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Approximately 18.000 children are born yearly in the Copenhagen area. From 1. April&#xD;
      2016 - 1. April 2018 the parents of all newborns will be offered enrollment in the research&#xD;
      project when attending a routine prenatal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to enroll &gt;30.000 newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After birth, blood is drawn from the umbilical chord and immediately analyzed for routine&#xD;
      biochemical markers. Samples will also be stored for future biochemical analyses and DNA&#xD;
      sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the first 14 days of life the children are examined with standardized&#xD;
      echocardiography, electrocardiogram and measurements of oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about maternal and paternal health including inherited disorders within the&#xD;
      family as well as information about the pregnancy and birth are collected in a central&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up When indicated children will be followed clinically. For research-purposes,&#xD;
      prospective, register-based follow-up is planned for the entire birth cohort and with&#xD;
      clinical visits for sub-groups of the population.&#xD;
