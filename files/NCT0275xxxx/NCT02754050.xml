      The device is intended to endoscopically transect polyps in the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      (sessile or pedunculated) using electrocautery. During the same maneuver the polyp is&#xD;
      captured, retrieved and submitted for pathological analysis. The Tandem Snare is an&#xD;
      intervention tool inserted through the colonoscope for the resection and removal of polyps&#xD;
      sized 6 to 25 mm. The Tandem snare utilizes a technology that has the potential to hold the&#xD;
      polyp, lift it up, resect and remove it without losing it. This is a feasibility study aiming&#xD;
      to demonstrate the safety of the Tandem Snare used for 6-25mm polyps' polypectomy in&#xD;
      screening, diagnostic or surveillance colonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The colonoscopy procedure is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for detecting, diagnosing and&#xD;
      treating abnormalities in the colon. Detection and removal of colon polyps is the most&#xD;
      significant benefit colonoscopy provides toward the reduction of colorectal cancer mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity. The Tandem Snare is an intervention tool inserted through the colonoscope for&#xD;
      the resection and removal of polyps sized 6 to 25 mm. The Tandem snare utilizes a technology&#xD;
      that has the potential to hold the polyp, lift it up, resect and remove it without losing it.&#xD;
      The technology may eliminate the repeated bites with the intervention tool or the need to use&#xD;
      additional intervention tools such as the net. It may improve visual perception for resecting&#xD;
      the polyp without losing it while removing from the colon. Consequently it may increase the&#xD;
      potential for complete polypectomy and reduce intervention time and repetitions, polyp lost,&#xD;
      risks and cost. This is a feasibility study aiming to demonstrate the safety of the Tandem&#xD;
      Snare used for 6-25mm polyps' polypectomy in screening, diagnostic or surveillance&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
