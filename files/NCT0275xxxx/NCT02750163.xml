    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Acetaminophen on the main parameters of&#xD;
      microcirculation, on the plasmatic levels of free hemoglobin/oxidative stress markers and on&#xD;
      the expression of PD1/Pd-L1, in pyrexial septic patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been established that plasma levels of extra-cellular free hemoglobin increased&#xD;
      significantly in patients with certain disease, including sickle cellular disease, or&#xD;
      undergoing invasive treatments, like coronary bypass surgery, blood transfusions and&#xD;
      hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all these conditions, high levels of free hemoglobin were associated with poor outcome and&#xD;
      with serious complications such as acute renal failure and myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the animal model of sepsis, increased values of plasma free hemoglobin has been related to&#xD;
      increased mortality, especially if a concomitant lack of haptoglobin and hemopexin coexists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that the release of free hemoglobin in the blood of septic patient is&#xD;
      attributable to changes in the membrane of red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes have been recognized in humans as a source of damage of the vascular&#xD;
      endothelium and consumption of free radical scavenger systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been hypothesized that the extracellular hemoglobin, when the protective mechanism&#xD;
      have been saturated, causes - trough reaction with NO - the formation of nitrate and lipids&#xD;
      peroxidation and boosts the immune response mediated by the monocyte -macrophage system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also liable for a condition of endothelial dysfunction and NO resistance that could&#xD;
      impair the microcirculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous work showed that higher levels of free hemoglobin resulted in a significant&#xD;
      reduction in the density of the microcirculation in septic patients undergoing blood&#xD;
      transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On animal model Paracetamol (or acetaminophen), drug commonly used for its analgesic and&#xD;
      antipyretic effects, demonstrated strong efficacy in preventing oxidative damage and&#xD;
      protection of renal damage in the context of increased levels of plasma free hemoglobin (as&#xD;
      in Rhabdomyolysis and myoglobulinemie).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This effect is attributed to the ability of the Paracetamol to cross react with either nitric&#xD;
      oxide synthase (NOS) by increasing the synthesis of NO, and with cyclooxygenase (COX), by&#xD;
      inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2-antiplatelet and vasodilator effect)&#xD;
      without interfering with the production of Thromboxane A2 (TXA2-powerful vasoconstrictor and&#xD;
      pro-thrombogenic) causing an imbalance of endovascular homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased oxidative stress produced by sepsis is also responsible of glycocalix damage,&#xD;
      the thin layer that lines the surface of endothelium in contact with the blood and increased&#xD;
      the free hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROS are also responsible to up-regulation of Programmed Death-1 related molecules&#xD;
      (PD-1/PD-L1) that render T cells susceptible to inhibitory modulation, inability to&#xD;
      proliferate and reduced capacity to clear bacteria, inducing &quot;immunosuppression&quot; and more&#xD;
      difficult recovery from septic shock. PD-1/PD-L1 system has been recently studied as&#xD;
      potential predictor of mortality and active player in resolution of sepsis-induced Acute Lung&#xD;
      Injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a recent study on septic patient showed an increased mortality in people with&#xD;
      elevated values of free hemoglobin versus patients without this increase, and the efficacy of&#xD;
      of Paracetamol to reduce the concentration of F2- isoprostane (marker of oxidative stress),&#xD;
      associated with lower risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This effect was lost in the cohort of septic patients without free hemoglobin registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of paracetamol administration on the&#xD;
      microcirculation, on the plasmatic levels of free hemoglobin/oxidative stress markers and on&#xD;
      the expression of PD1/Pd-L1, in pyrexial septic patient. Paracetamol is given only on the&#xD;
      basis of a clinical indication, not because of the study and in our institution paracetamol&#xD;
      is the drug of choice to treat fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there are inclusion criteria (febrile septic patient) and no exclusion criteria, and&#xD;
      patient is going to receive paracetamol, informed consent will be taken. When the&#xD;
      neurological conditions do not permit, relatives will be informed and the patients will still&#xD;
      included in the protocol. The informed consent will be taken when the patient clinical&#xD;
      condition permits it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the administration of the drug, at the end of infusion and after 30 minutes after&#xD;
      infusion, the main parameters of the sublingual microcirculation will be monitored, using the&#xD;
      the incident dark field imaging technique (IDF), including an assessment of glycocalyx, Near&#xD;
      InfraRed (NIRS) parameters with the vascular occlusion test (VOT), vital signs and the dosage&#xD;
      of any infusion of vasoactive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical records will be collected at T0 and T1. Acute lung injury will be&#xD;
      investigated through gas analytical and laboratory data at the same timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood samples will be collected at T0 and 2 hours after the infusion of&#xD;
      Acetaminophen (that will represent T2). Blood will be immediately centrifuged and plasma and&#xD;
      serum samples will be stored at -70°C for subsequent analysis. We will measure: fHb levels,&#xD;
      markers of oxidative damage (F2-isoprastane and F2-isoflurane), of endothelial cell injury&#xD;
      (endothelin-1) and glycocalyx damage (sindecan-1, heparasulfate), PD-1/PD-L1.&#xD;
