      Post meno-pausal women with T1 Breast cancers will be randomized to receive either 600&#xD;
      centiGray (cGy) X 5 over five consecutive days (arm 1) versus 800 cGy X 3 fractions given&#xD;
      every other day (arm 2). Patients will complete treatment in one week. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed a month after the completion of treatment then q6 months for the first year, then&#xD;
      yearly for the next 10 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Partial breast irradiation (PBI) is becoming a new paradigm for breast cancer radiation. No&#xD;
      type I or II evidence is currently available to demonstrate equivalence to standard whole&#xD;
      breast radiotherapy, and a prospective randomized trial jointly sponsored by NSABP and&#xD;
      Radiation therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) (NSABP B-39 and RTOG 0413) has completed accruing&#xD;
      patients, comparing whole breast radiotherapy to PBI, either by brachytherapy or external&#xD;
      beam techniques (EB): results of this trial are pending. Until results of this or similar&#xD;
      trials are available, PBI remains a research domain, and it should be offered to patients&#xD;
      only in the context of a clinical experimental protocol. Despite the fact that less extensive&#xD;
      experience than that of brachytherapy is available, PBI delivery through an external-beam has&#xD;
      many advantages. First of all, it is likely to be more acceptable to the patient since it is&#xD;
      non-invasive and it does not require a surgical procedure or anesthesia. Moreover, since it&#xD;
      is delivered after surgery, the pathological analysis of the segmental mastectomy specimen is&#xD;
      available to inform the selection of the best candidates. In addition, EB-PBI is likely to&#xD;
      become more widely reproducible, since it does not rely on the experience and skills of the&#xD;
      radiation oncologist performing the brachytherapy implant. Besides, once the technique is&#xD;
      established, it can be widely applied at any facility provided with a linear accelerator,&#xD;
      without the risk presented by some brachytherapy approaches that cannot be completed because&#xD;
      of the unfavorable interplay of patient's anatomy with the technical limitations of the&#xD;
      applicator. Finally, in terms of health care economics, an external beam approach spares the&#xD;
      costs of an extra surgical procedure and several days as inpatient (in the case of Low dose&#xD;
      Rate (LDR) brachytherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prone approach for partial breast radiation has been tested at NYU in a clinical trial&#xD;
      sponsored by an IDEA grant of the Department of Defense (NYU 00-23). Results of the first 47&#xD;
      patient accrued originally demonstrated feasibility. Eligibility to this study was limited to&#xD;
      post-menopausal women with non-palpable, mammographically detected tumors. In addition, the&#xD;
      protocol required patients to have first refused to undergo standard six-week radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Five fractions of 6 Gy were delivered to the Planning Target Volume (PTV) over ten days&#xD;
      (Monday-Wednesday-Friday, Monday-Wednesday). The dose and fractionation was based on&#xD;
      radiobiological modeling, aimed at determining a dose to deliver in five fractions that would&#xD;
      achieve equivalence to the tumor control estimates of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, while&#xD;
      maintaining a risk of fibrosis at the tumor bed comparable to that of a standard regimen of&#xD;
      60 Gy in 30 fractions. An α/β = 4 for tumor control was used, and its validity has been&#xD;
      recently confirmed by the results of a prospective randomized trial comparing accelerated to&#xD;
      standard whole breast radiotherapy.&#xD;
