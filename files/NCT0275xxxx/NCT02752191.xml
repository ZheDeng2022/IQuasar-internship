  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard clinical cardiovascular MRI practice for children with CHD frequently involves&#xD;
      the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) to enhance tissue contrast. Most GBCAs are&#xD;
      small molecules that quickly cross the capillary wall and access the interstitial space, a&#xD;
      process which diminishes the signal contrast between blood vessels and surrounding tissue.&#xD;
      Therefore, these types of GBCA are most useful for first-pass MR angiography, wherein the&#xD;
      images are acquired quickly during the initial 15-30 seconds post-injection when the GBCA&#xD;
      concentration is much higher in the arteries than in the interstitial space. For young&#xD;
      children with complex CHD, the stringent requirements for high spatial resolution, and the&#xD;
      need for cardiac gating and good blood-myocardium contrast in order to provide detailed&#xD;
      evaluation of intracardiac structures are not compatible with conventional GBCA-based&#xD;
      first-pass MR angiography. Even with Ablavar® (gadofosveset trisodium), an FDA approved GBCA&#xD;
      with longer intravascular half-life than other GBCAs, cardiac-gated Ablavar®-enhanced MRI may&#xD;
      be insufficient for young children with CHD based on our institutional experience and on data&#xD;
      from the literature; there remains diminished blood-tissue contrast during the&#xD;
      high-resolution cardiac-gated MRI. Furthermore, there have been safety concerns regarding&#xD;
      gadolinium deposition in brain tissues after repeated GBCA exposure as well as concerns of&#xD;
      nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with GBCA injection in young children &lt; 2&#xD;
      years old who may have immature renal function. The long-term health consequences of these&#xD;
      effects in the pediatric population are unclear. For the above reasons, we seek to study the&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging effectiveness of Feraheme (Feraheme®), an FDA-approved drug for parenteral&#xD;
      iron supplementation, as an MRI contrast agent in children with CHD. Although Feraheme® has&#xD;
      been approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia secondary to renal disease,&#xD;
      Feraheme® has been used as an off-label MRI contrast agent at select medical centers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female pediatric patients of all ethnicities (age newborn to 6 years) with&#xD;
             known or suspected CHD with inconclusive echocardiographic exams and are referred for&#xD;
             cardiovascular MRI for further evaluation of cardiac anatomy and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained from subject's legal representative/guardian(s) and&#xD;
             ability for subject to comply with the requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Standard clinical contraindications to MRI, including subjects with cochlear implants&#xD;
             and implanted cardiac devices&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with past or current diagnosis of iron overload due to hereditary&#xD;
             hemochromatosis or other causes (for subjects receiving Feraheme injection only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity or allergy to iron oxide particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with renal insufficiency defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are critically ill at the time of MRI and for whom the period of general&#xD;
             anesthesia and separation from the critical care nursery or intensive care unit poses&#xD;
             added risk as deemed by referring cardiologists, cardiac surgeons or the managing&#xD;
             radiologist (for Part II only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical conditions, in the judgment of the clinician investigator, that would&#xD;
