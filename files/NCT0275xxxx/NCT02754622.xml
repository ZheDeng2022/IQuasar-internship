      Many patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience muscle weakness.&#xD;
      This muscle weakness occurs whilst patients are unconscious, immobile in bed and on a&#xD;
      breathing machine (ventilator). It can develop very quickly, as soon as they become unwell.&#xD;
      The investigators know that this weakness can make it harder for patients to regain their&#xD;
      normal level of functional ability, such as standing and walking independently. Physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation, delivered by physiotherapists, is important for patients as they recover from&#xD;
      their critical illness to help them regain strength and to practice the ability to perform&#xD;
      physical activities. These activities include sitting on the edge of the bed, standing,&#xD;
      stepping on the spot and walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However it is difficult to know how hard it is for patients who are recovering from critical&#xD;
      illness to perform these types of activities - in other words, how much energy is required.&#xD;
      Some patients may find certain activities harder or easier than others. By knowing the energy&#xD;
      requirements of patients whilst they take part in different physical rehabilitation&#xD;
      activities, physiotherapists may be able to be more accurate with prescribing exercises and&#xD;
      designing rehabilitation sessions for patients to practice achieving those activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will measure the energy requirements of the patients when&#xD;
      they take part in physiotherapy-led physical rehabilitation they will have during their&#xD;
      admission. To do this, the investigators will use a different ventilator to the one normally&#xD;
      used to help their breathing. This ventilator works in exactly the same way, but has an extra&#xD;
      component built into it to measure energy requirements. After the rehabilitation session, the&#xD;
      patient will return to using their normal ventilator.&#xD;

      Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with critical illness is typically associated with&#xD;
      profound physical impairments including peripheral skeletal muscle wasting and dysfunction.&#xD;
      These effects demonstrate a rapid onset from the point of ICU admission, affect those with&#xD;
      higher illness acuity to greater levels, and contribute to the development of intensive care&#xD;
      unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) defined as severe upper and lower limb muscle weakness.&#xD;
      Clinically patients present with significant limitations in exercise capacity and performance&#xD;
      of physical functional activities, with deficits persisting for many years following&#xD;
      resolution of the original illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical rehabilitation is recommended to address the physical and functional deficits&#xD;
      associated with ICU-AW, and delivery is advocated across the continuum of the patient&#xD;
      recovery pathway, commencing whilst in the ICU, following transfer to the ward and beyond&#xD;
      hospital discharge. Physical rehabilitation within the ICU typically incorporates early&#xD;
      mobilisation (EM), characterised by a hierarchical progression of increasingly functional&#xD;
      activities such as active-assisted bed exercises, sitting-on-the-edge-of-the-bed (SOEOB),&#xD;
      standing, marching-on-the-spot and walking. These activities are summarised in the ICU&#xD;
      Mobility Scale. In recent years, adjunctive technologies including electrical muscle&#xD;
      stimulation, interactive video-games and passive cycle ergometry have also been utilised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of early mobilisation is feasible, safe and effective in improving both short and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes in critically ill patients even in the early stages of recovery whilst&#xD;
      patients remain ventilated and receiving other forms of organ support. However, the optimum&#xD;
      'dose' of physical rehabilitation to deliver to patients whilst in the ICU remains&#xD;
      undetermined. Early mobilisation reflects a clinically pragmatic approach to patient&#xD;
      management, but there are few data to support the intensity, frequency and timing of&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is little known of the acute physiological response to undertaking this&#xD;
      type of exercise in this patient population. Metabolic monitoring can provide information on&#xD;
      the energy expenditure of patients. However, direct methods of data acquisition such as use&#xD;
      of pulmonary artery catheters to measure whole-body oxygen consumption can be unreliable and&#xD;
      their use in clinical practice has diminished in recent years. The non-invasive technique of&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry (IC) has therefore emerged as a potential alternative that may be more&#xD;
      practically applicable in the clinical setting. Indirect calorimetry measures total gas&#xD;
      exchange, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production which can in turn determine energy&#xD;
      expenditure. However the widespread clinical utility of the IC technique, can be offset by&#xD;
      the number of clinical factors that may preclude its use across all patients e.g. those with&#xD;
      cardiovascular or ventilator instability, those with open chest drainage or receiving renal&#xD;
      haemofiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two studies to date have used IC to examine the response to physical rehabilitation&#xD;
      activities performed by patients in the ICU. Collings et al conducted a randomised cross-over&#xD;
      study in which 10 ICU patients completed either a passive chair transfer or an active&#xD;
      sit-over-the-edge-of-the-bed (SOEOB) on one day, followed by the alternative activity on the&#xD;
      consecutive day. The 'active' SOEOB activity elicited a significantly greater increase in&#xD;
      oxygen consumption than the passive activity (90.69 ml/min (95% CI 44.04 to 137.34) vs 14.43&#xD;
      ml/min (95% CI -27.28 to 56.14), p = 0.007). Hickmann et al examined active or passive&#xD;
      cycling in critically ill patients and healthy controls, demonstrating increased oxygen&#xD;
      consumption during the active exercise compared to passive in patients with differing energy&#xD;
      requirements compared to healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This limited existing evidence-base demonstrates the potential for use of IC to characterise&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation in critically ill patients, but is restricted to particular types of&#xD;
      activities and fails to capture sequential assessments of patients as their rehabilitation&#xD;
      progresses through increasingly functional levels. Acknowledging the potential clinical&#xD;
      limitations of applying the IC measurement technique to all critically ill patients, the aim&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the feasibility of measuring energy expenditure of critically ill&#xD;
      patients completing a range of physical rehabilitation activities (as characterised on the&#xD;
      ICU Mobility Scale) performed sequentially during their ICU or ventilator weaning unit (Lane&#xD;
      Fox Respiratory Unit, LFU) admission using indirect calorimetry.&#xD;
