      This study is intended to evaluate the effect of the dietary supplement NEM® brand eggshell&#xD;
      membrane versus placebo in reducing exercise-induced joint pain &amp; stiffness &amp; cartilage&#xD;
      turnover in healthy post-menopausal women. Half of the study participants will receive NEM,&#xD;
      once daily, orally while the other half of the study participants will receive placebo, once&#xD;
      daily, orally.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moderate exercise can induce discomfort in joints when done infrequently or when done too&#xD;
      intensely or for too long a period. This discomfort is often realized as either pain or&#xD;
      stiffness in the joint that was the focus of the exercise. For example, one's knees will hurt&#xD;
      after jogging for several miles, particularly if jogging for the first time. This study is&#xD;
      intended to evaluate whether NEM® brand eggshell membrane can alleviate joint pain or&#xD;
      stiffness, either directly following exercise or 12 hours post-exercise versus placebo. The&#xD;
      study will also evaluate NEM's effect, if any, on cartilage turnover via the cartilage&#xD;
      degradation biomarker c-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II).&#xD;
      Participants will perform a minimum of 50 steps per leg utilizing an aerobics step at the&#xD;
      clinical site. They will follow this exercise regimen on alternating days for 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Changes in pain &amp; stiffness (immediate &amp; 12-hour) will be compared to both baseline and to&#xD;
      the placebo group. Blood &amp; Urine samples will also be collected at baseline and at the end of&#xD;
      Week 1 &amp; Week 2. The change in CTX-II will be compared to baseline.&#xD;

             (i.e. osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, bursitis, gout,&#xD;
             systemic lupus erythematosus, fibromyalgia, etc.) affecting the hip, knee, or ankle by&#xD;
             a licensed physician prior to enrollment evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have a resting pain/discomfort score of ≤ 3 on the 10 point Likert scale&#xD;
             in the knee with the most severe pain/discomfort.&#xD;
