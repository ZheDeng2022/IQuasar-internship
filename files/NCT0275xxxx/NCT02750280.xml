      This ia a prospective controlled longitudinal study to evaluate the effects of MatriStem®&#xD;
      plus standard local wound care versus standard local wound care alone in the treatment of&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), as assessed by incidence of complete wound healing by 16 weeks&#xD;
      and ulcer recurrence with a 2 year follow-up.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female subjects 18-85 years of age with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject's foot ulcer is on the plantar surface of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. DFU has not healed after more than2 months of SOC treatment administered&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject's ulcer must be Wagner type 1 or 2 (uninfected, extending through the dermis&#xD;
             and into subcutaneous tissue or granulating but without exposure of tendon, bone, or&#xD;
             joint capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject's wound is free of necrotic debris (post debridement) and clinical infection,&#xD;
             should be comprised of healthy, vascular tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject's Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) by Doppler method is ≥ 0.7&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has adequate circulation to the foot to allow for healing. This must be&#xD;
             demonstrated by methods described in section 5.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject's diabetes is under control as determined by the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Study subject must be reliable, responsible and able to visit the clinic weekly for&#xD;
             the full 16 week period. The subject is willing and able to tolerate TCC. Subject is&#xD;
             willing to comply with the monthly follow-up regimen for 32 weeks (8 months) The&#xD;
             subject is able to return to the clinic if ulcer recurrence occurs&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review&#xD;
             Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent form before treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. No active malignancy except non-melanoma skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has clinical evidence of gangrene on any part of the affected foot&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a Wagner type 3 or greater ulceration&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject's ulcer is due to a non-diabetic etiology, Ulcers of arterial, venous&#xD;
             stasis, pressure, radiation, traumatic, rheumatoid, vasculitis, collagen vascular&#xD;
             disease, or other non-diabetic etiologies&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a known sensitivity to bovine or porcine derived devices&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has one or more medical condition(s) including renal, hepatic, hematological,&#xD;
             neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would make the&#xD;
             subject an inappropriate candidate for this wound healing study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has or has had a malignant disease (other than cutaneous epithelioma) not in&#xD;
             remission&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or&#xD;
             cytotoxic agents, or is anticipated to require such agents during the course of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has chronic osteomyelitis as determined by high resolution ultrasonography&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject's ulcer is infected or accompanied by active cellulitis as determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has any condition(s) that seriously compromises the subject's ability to&#xD;
             complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject is pregnant or lactating at the time of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has received growth factor therapy (e.g. autologous platelet-rich plasma gel,&#xD;
             bacaplermin, bilayered cell therapy, dermal substitute, extracellular matrix) within&#xD;
             two weeks of enrollment. If Santyl or any other collagenase is used, a subject must&#xD;
             have a washout period of 2 weeks before MatriStem® can be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject is currently receiving or has received radiation or chemotherapy within 3&#xD;
             months of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject allergic to a broad spectrum of primary &amp; secondary dressing materials,&#xD;
             including occlusive dressings and the adhesives on such dressings.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject is currently enrolled or participated within the previous 30 days of&#xD;
             enrollment in another device, drug or biological trial.&#xD;
