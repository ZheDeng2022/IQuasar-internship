  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to demonstrate a change in osmolarity over time when moderate&#xD;
      to severe dry eye subjects are treated with TheraTears lubricating drops.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic dry eye subjects exhibited a significantly higher tear osmolarity than observed&#xD;
      in normal subjects, this is thought to relate to the inherent tear film instability of dry&#xD;
      eye disease. Lubricating eye drops are frequently prescribed to relieve the symptoms of dry&#xD;
      eye.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Tear Osmolarity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Osmolarity measures will be evaluated using the eye with the highest osmolarity reading at the washout/baseline visit. These baseline values will be compared to subsequent follow-up visits, to determine change from baseline at each visit as well as cumulative change in osmolarity over time.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity measures will be evaluated using the eye with the highest osmolarity reading at the washout/baseline visit. These baseline values will be compared to subsequent follow-up visits, to determine change from baseline at each visit as well as cumulative change in visual acuity over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tear Film Breakup Time</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After instillation of fluorescein, the investigator will ask the participant blink three times and keep their eyes open for as long as they can while the investigator records the time at which the dark spots on the tear film begin to appear.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Corneal Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A fluorescein strip will be wetted with a few drops of saline, and applied to the inferior palpebral conjunctiva of both eyes. The eye will be illuminated by cobalt blue light, and viewed through a Wratten no. 12 barrier filter. Fluorescein staining will be assessed using the CCLRU8 scale (0 to 4).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Conjunctiva Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A lissamine green strip will be wetted and applied to the inferior palpebral conjunctiva of both eyes to assess conjunctival staining. Lissamine conjunctival staining will be assessed using the Oxford scale. If lissamine strip is not available, fluorescein maybe used instead to assess all conjunctival staining.</description>
