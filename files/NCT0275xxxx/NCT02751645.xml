      The investigators primary objective is to determine if acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH)&#xD;
      for pediatric cardiac surgical patients decreases the volume of blood products transfused&#xD;
      during surgery and the immediate post-operative period as compared to usual care. This study&#xD;
      will enroll 24 pediatric heart surgery patients, aged 6 months to 3 years old undergoing&#xD;
      either ANH prior to initiating cardiopulmonary bypass or the standard of care procedures for&#xD;
      the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusion has been associated with worse outcomes in pediatric cardiac surgical&#xD;
      patients. The major complications associated with it include increased blood loss during and&#xD;
      after surgery, kidney disease requiring dialysis, abnormal coagulation profile, increased&#xD;
      vasopressor use, and increased time spent on the ventilator and in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
      One strategy to minimize blood product administration is acute normovolemic hemodilution&#xD;
      (ANH). The investigators primary aim is to determine if ANH for pediatric cardiac surgical&#xD;
      patients decreases the volume of blood products transfused during surgery and the immediate&#xD;
      post-operative period, compared to usual care. The investigators designed a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, open label study that equally assigns 24 pediatric cardiac surgery patients aged&#xD;
      6 months to 3 years into two groups to receive either ANH prior to initiating cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass or usual standard of care. Participants in the ANH arm of the study will have 10 ml/kg&#xD;
      of blood removed following anesthetic induction. In order to maintain normal circulating&#xD;
      volume, the collected blood will be replaced with an equal volume of 5% albumin. All&#xD;
      participants will be treated with a standardized protocol aimed at blood conservation&#xD;
      including the use of retrograde arterial and antegrade venous perfusion, small circuit size,&#xD;
      intraoperative red blood cell salvage, and low hemoglobin targets to trigger transfusion.&#xD;
