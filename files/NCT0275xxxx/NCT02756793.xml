    <textblock>
      A multicenter randomized phase II trial of stereotactic body radiotherapy for&#xD;
      oligo-progressive metastatic cancers. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio&#xD;
      between receiving their standard of care therapy or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR)&#xD;
      to all sites of oligo-progressive lesions.Radiotherapy will be administered as soon as&#xD;
      possible following randomization, and subjects will be followed until next disease&#xD;
      progression. The primary outcome is progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with metastatic disease&#xD;
             detected on imaging. Biopsy of metastasis at some time point prior to enrollment is&#xD;
             preferred, but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received treatment with systemic therapy (either cytotoxic or targeted,&#xD;
             including maintenance therapies) during the past 6 weeks. This most recent systemic&#xD;
             therapy agent must have been delivered for a total of at least 3 months, with an&#xD;
             initial partial response (PR), complete response (CR) or stable disease (CR) prior to&#xD;
             the development of oligo-progressive lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oligoprogression, defined as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
             (RECIST)-documented progression in up to 5 individual lesions, with no previous&#xD;
             radiation or radiofrequency ablation to those sites. Oligoprogression may be defined&#xD;
             as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progression of an individual metastasis according to RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unambiguous development of a new metastatic lesion at least 5mm in size&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressive enlargement of a known metastasis on 2 consecutive imaging studies 2- 3&#xD;
             months apart with a minimum 5mm increase in size from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All sites of oligoprogression can be safely treated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maximum 3 progressing metastases in any single organ system (i.e. lung, liver, brain,&#xD;
             bone), and the total number of metastases must be 5 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note for Patients with Brain Metastases: For patients with brain metastases and&#xD;
        oligo-progression elsewhere where stereotactic radiation to the brain is deemed to be&#xD;
        warranted, this must be specified prior to randomization. If randomized to Standard Arm,&#xD;
        patient would receive stereotactic radiation to brain only. If randomized to Experimental&#xD;
        Arm, patient would receive stereotactic radiation to brain and to body lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical comorbidities precluding radiotherapy, such as ataxia-telangiectasia&#xD;
             or scleroderma. For patients with oligoprogressive lesions in the lung or thorax, this&#xD;
             includes interstitial lung disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy to a site requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignant pleural effusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to treat all sites of enlarging, oligoprogressive disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or radiological evidence of spinal cord compression or tumor within 3mm of&#xD;
             spinal cord on MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study&#xD;
