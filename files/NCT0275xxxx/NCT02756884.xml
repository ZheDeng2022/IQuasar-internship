  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, prospective, randomized, controlled study in patients&#xD;
      with non- revascularizable moderate or severe lower extremity Peripheral Arterial Disease&#xD;
      (PAD) receiving autologous stem cells therapy (minimally manipulated). This study will enroll&#xD;
      a maximum of 10 subjects in this study. The patients will be divided into two groups. One&#xD;
      group will receive Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) alone and the other group will receive&#xD;
      low frequency ultrasound before the addition of ADSCs. The randomization will be 1:1. If the&#xD;
      results of this pilot study are not clearly different, there will be a need for a phase II&#xD;
      study to support the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, 6 week, 3 month and 6 month assessments of 6 min walking distance (6MWT), Ankle&#xD;
      Brachial Indexes (ABIs)/Toe Brachial Indexes (TBIs), Transcutaneous Partial Oxygenation&#xD;
      (TcPO2) and Rutherford assessments will be performed for the study group. Prior to the stem&#xD;
      cell treatment, the ultrasound group patient will receive noninvasive transcutaneous pulsed&#xD;
      focused ultrasound around the involved vessel(s) in the affected extremity. All patients will&#xD;
      then receive 200 million autologous stromal vascular fraction cells containing adipose&#xD;
      derived stem cell therapy: 1/3 of the cells will be delivered intra-venous proximal to the&#xD;
      lesion (not retrograde), 1/3 of the cells will be delivered intra- adventitia proximal to the&#xD;
      lesion and 1/3 of the cells will be delivered by intra- muscular injection along the vessel&#xD;
      path (20-30 injections each separated by1.5 inch). Standard therapy for PAD patients will not&#xD;
      be interrupted for the duration of the study. Standard therapy for PAD is defined as&#xD;
      cardiovascular general measures like lifestyle changes, smoke cessation, exercise,&#xD;
      cardiovascular rehabilitation, etc. All participants have already received maximal&#xD;
      non-surgical therapy. Safety will be monitored on an ongoing basis.&#xD;

      an ongoing basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT PARTICIPATION A screening evaluation to determine if a potential subject is suitable&#xD;
      for participation in this trial will be conducted prior to enrollment and treatment by the&#xD;
      Investigator. This includes obtaining written informed consent, collection of a complete&#xD;
      medical history, including current and past medications, physical examination and clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, PAD related testing (ABI/TBI, 6MWT, TcPO2, QoL questionnaires, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized and treated at the Sponsor hospital as approved by the&#xD;
      sponsor. Study medical staff will evaluate the patients upon admission according to the&#xD;
      scheduled medical assessments to ensure eligibility of the subjects. Ultrasound group will&#xD;
      receive LFUS over the affected limb (see page XIV). Intra-venous, intra-adventitia and&#xD;
      intramuscular dosing of the autologous ADSC will occur on the morning of Day 0. Conscious&#xD;
      sedation (I.V.) may be used during the tissue harvesting and intra-adventitia administration&#xD;
      of the cells.. Subjects must remain in the clinic/hospital until they are clinically stable&#xD;
      for discharge; subjects that are clinically stable will be discharged into the care of a&#xD;
      responsible individual. Follow-up visits will occur at 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post-treatment, and may occur with the patient's personal physician who will be provided the&#xD;
      follow-up assessment forms. If this occurs, the Investigator and/or Sponsor or sponsor's&#xD;
      designee may also contact the patient by telephone to collect follow-up safety information.&#xD;
      Adverse events, concomitant medications, vital signs, clinical laboratory test results and&#xD;
      physical examinations will be collected or conducted at follow-up visits according to the&#xD;
      schedule of assessments (Appendix B). All previous medical care, including medications and&#xD;
      rehabilitation, for the patient's current medical conditions will be continued as prescribed&#xD;
      by the patient's personal physician(s). Use of other investigational agents or treatments is&#xD;
      not allowed during this study.&#xD;
