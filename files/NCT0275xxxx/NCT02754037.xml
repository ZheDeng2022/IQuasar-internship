  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate non-invasive imaging techniques for determining liver&#xD;
      steatosis (fat), inflammation (abnormal tissue swelling), and fibrosis (abnormal tissue&#xD;
      scarring).In addition, the study group will be using other test measures including personal&#xD;
      demographics, laboratory blood test results, and imaging measurements to determine the&#xD;
      severity of NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis),&#xD;
      inflammation, and fibrosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study group proposes to evaluate the role of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) in the determination of steatohepatitis and in combination with MRI for&#xD;
      detection, differentiation and quantitation of liver steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis&#xD;
      in correlation to liver biopsy. Patient enrolled in this will already have had their liver&#xD;
      biopsy or will be undergoing liver biopsy as a part of their clinical care as determined by&#xD;
      their provider and will not be getting biopsies solely to be enrolled in the study. Current&#xD;
      treatment options for patients that liver biopsy is being performed are limited to lifestyle&#xD;
      changes and vitamin E for patients without diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>FDG-PET has been utilized in multiple disease processes that have inflammation as the key driver of the disease and has found potentials to be used for imaging of steatohepatitis. Dynamic PET acquires images at multiple time points and enables parametric imaging of FDG kinetics, providing fundamental quantitative information about the kinetic process of glucose metabolism in the liver tissue. Our group at University of California Davis has developed a novel kernel-based dynamic (KBD) PET imaging method. The resulting KBD PET method has demonstrated a five-fold gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when tested on a small group of patients with breast cancer. With this substantial SNR gain, the study group believes the approach has great potential to allow accurate characterization of FDG kinetics in the liver.</description>

    <intervention_name>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</intervention_name>
    <description>Novel non-invasive MRI based tools to assess liver fat and fibrosis. Potential risks include a sensation of claustrophobia. No contrast dye is used and thus no risk of contrast allergy. Inflammation of the liver may be assessed by MRI software after processing of images and does not require additional patient involvement or change in MRI protocol.</description>

    <description>The pre-contrast and contrast-enhanced images of the entire liver will be performed using a General Electric (GE) 1.5-T MRI scanner system. Contrast injection will follow the standard clinical I.V. injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadoteridol. The temporal resolution will be ~5 seconds, and the whole dynamic scan lasts for about 5 minutes.</description>

      Blood plasma/serum will be banked at the University of California, Davis GI Biobank for&#xD;
      future liver-related study use in -80Â°C freezer. Samples will be used for liver related&#xD;
      studies. Potential future analyses of plasma samples could include fatty liver metabolomics&#xD;
      analyses. All future Sample specimens will be stored for as long as they are viable (for up&#xD;
      to 20 years). Dr. Sarkar and his study staff will maintain records of the storage location&#xD;
      and have access to them.&#xD;
