  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advantages of thoracoscopic surgery include smaller wounds, fewer postoperative&#xD;
      complications, and shortened hospital stay. However,complications such as pain, pulmonary&#xD;
      function insufficiency, pneumonia,postoperative pneumothorax, persistent air leakage,&#xD;
      subcutaneous emphysema, cough, and hemoptysis may occur in older patients after thoracoscopic&#xD;
      surgery. Pulmonary rehabilitation has been demonstrated by evidence-base medicine could&#xD;
      effectively reduce pulmonary complications and dyspnea as well as improve lung function,&#xD;
      quality of life, exercise ability, and functional status of patients after traditional heart&#xD;
      and thoracic surgery. Studies have suggested that pulmonary rehabilitation should be&#xD;
      performed for at least 4 weeks to optimize the training effect .However, most patients who&#xD;
      undergo thoracoscopic surgery were discharged within 3-5 days. Such a short hospital stay&#xD;
      impeded the delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation. Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      appeared to be an option for these patients The purpose of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation are effective on patients who had thoracic surgeries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary-related surgeries remain some potential risks according to the previous&#xD;
      evidence-based studies. Particularly, individuals who were over 65 years of age with smoking,&#xD;
      chronic pulmonary disease, wheezy, cardiovascular comorbidities, upper respiratory infection&#xD;
      were at the high risk of pulmonary complications after surgery,which accounted for&#xD;
      approximately 2% to 40% of occurrence rate. The average mortality rate due to surgery was&#xD;
      approximately 2%-8% in patients aged more than 65 years.Pulmonary rehabilitation could&#xD;
      effectively reduce pulmonary complications and dyspnea as well as improve lung function,&#xD;
      quality of life, exercise ability, and functional status of patients after traditional heart&#xD;
      and thoracic surgery.But efficacy of home-based pulmonary rehabilitation for older adults&#xD;
      following thoracoscopic surgery, it has not received much attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study employed a prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical design to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of home-based pulmonary rehabilitation in older adults after VATS. All&#xD;
      participants underwent preoperative and initial postoperative pulmonary rehabilitation during&#xD;
      their hospital stay and were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group at the&#xD;
      time of discharge. The control group received standard health education, whereas the&#xD;
      experimental group received home-based pulmonary rehabilitation in addition to standard&#xD;
      health education. Objective and personal subjective outcome measurements were performed&#xD;
      before hospital discharge and 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge The control group received&#xD;
      standard care. Considering the principle for exercise progression, we divided the home-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation program into two stages (0-2 weeks and 3-6 weeks).The exercise program was&#xD;
      adjusted in the second week when patients visited the outpatient department of the hospital&#xD;
      for follow-up. The home-based rehabilitation program included (1) breathing exercises&#xD;
      (pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing) and coughing exercises, (2) aerobic exercises (upper&#xD;
      and lower limb exercises and walking), (3) incentive spirometry training (Triflo-II), and (4)&#xD;
      threshold load training of the inspiratory muscle. In the first stage (0-2 weeks), the&#xD;
      aerobic exercise intensity was targeted to reach 10-11 points on the 20-point Borg rating of&#xD;
      perceived exercise (RPE) scale. Patients raised their upper limbs while simultaneously&#xD;
      performing lower-limb stepping at place for 20 min; in addition, they walked at a comfortable&#xD;
      speed for 15 min twice per day. Incentive spirometry training (Triflo-II) was performed 8-10&#xD;
      times per hour. We used a threshold load trainer for inspiratory muscle training (30 breaths&#xD;
      each time, twice per day) with the initial pressure set at 25%-30% of the maximum inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage (3-6 weeks), the aerobic exercise intensity was targeted to reach 12-15&#xD;
      points on the RPE scale. Patients performed upper-limb resistance exercise (raising of a&#xD;
      250-cc water bottle) and lower-limb stepping for 20 min per day as well as walking exercise&#xD;
      (slow walking for 5 min and fast walking for 2 min, followed by 5-min slow walking, for a&#xD;
      total of 30 min). Incentive spirometry training (Triflo-II) was performed 8-10 times per&#xD;
      hour, and a threshold load trainer was used to train the inspiratory muscle (30 breaths each&#xD;
      time, twice per day), with the pressure intensity adjusted to more than 5% of that in the&#xD;
      first stage.Researchers contacted patients at home every week through phone calls to monitor&#xD;
      the occurrence of any uncomfortable reaction and to encourage patients to continue their&#xD;
      rehabilitation program.&#xD;

    <description>(1) breathing exercises (pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing) and coughing exercises, (2) aerobic exercises (upper and lower limb exercises and walking), (3) incentive spirometry training (Triflo-II), and (4) threshold load training of the inspiratory muscle. In the first stage (0-2 weeks), the aerobic exercise intensity was targeted to reach 10-11 points on the 20-point Borg rating of perceived exercise (RPE) scale. Patients raised their upper limbs while simultaneously performing lower-limb stepping at place for 20 min; in addition, they walked at a comfortable speed for 15 min twice per day. Incentive spirometry training (Triflo-II) was performed 8-10 times per hour. We used a threshold load trainer for inspiratory muscle training (30 breaths each time, twice per day) with the initial pressure set at 25%-30% of the maximum inspiratory pressure.</description>

          <description>Measure Description: Student's t-test was used for FEV1/FVC(%).Data is presented as either n(%) or mean ± SD.The FEV1/FVC ratio is a calculated ratio used in the diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung disease. It represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) to the full, forced vital capacity (FVC) The result of this ratio is expressed as FEV1%.Normal values are approximately 75%.values less than 0.70 are suggestive of airflow limitation with an obstructive pattern</description>

          <description>The 6MWT is a useful measure of functional capacity targeted at people with at least moderately severe impairment. The test has been widely used for preoperative and postoperative evaluation and for measuring the response to therapeutic interventions for pulmonary and cardiac disease.In healthy subjects, the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) ranges from 400 to 700 m, the main predictor variables being gender, age and height.The longer distance was mean the better functional capacity ability,&lt;250 m does predict poorer outcome</description>

        <title>Discharge 2weeks Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second(FEV1,Liter(L)/Sec)</title>
        <description>The Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second parameter measures the volume of air that was exhaled into the mouthpiece in the first second after a full inhalation. The Measured column represents the total volume exhaled during the first second, in liters. Normal values in healthy males aged 20-60 range from 4.5 to 3.5 liters, and normal values for females aged 20-60 range from 3.25 to 2.5 liters. The Predicted column compares the actual volume breathed out during the first second of your test to an average of the normal volume breathed out in 1 second for a person of the same gender, height, and age. This value is expressed as a percentage, with normal test values being between 80% and 120% of the average (predicted) values.and whether higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Forced expiratory flow (FEF) is the flow (or speed) of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of a forced expiration. It can be given at discrete times, generally defined by what fraction of the forced vital capacity (FVC) has been exhaled. The usual discrete intervals are 25%, 50% and 75%, usually 25-75% (FEF25-75%).Predicted normal values for FEF depend on age, sex, height, mass and ethnicity as well as the research study that they are based on assessment by pulmonary function test and higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Dyspnea score as assessed by Modified Borg score, The literature review clearly showed that the Modified Borg score was a valid and reliable tool when used in pulmonary medicine and in exercise physiology studies.The scale used was perceived exertion adapted to be appropriate for measuring dyspnea. This consisted of a vertical scale labelled 0-10, with corresponding verbal expressions of progressively increasing perceived sensation intensity. It starts at number 0 that mean breathing is no difficulty at all and progresses through to number 10 that mean breathing difficulty is maximal.so higher scores mean a worse outcome</description>

        <description>The Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second parameter measures the volume of air that was exhaled into the mouthpiece in the first second after a full inhalation. The Measured column represents the total volume exhaled during the first second, in liters. Normal values in healthy males aged 20-60 range from 4.5 to 3.5 liters, and normal values for females aged 20-60 range from 3.25 to 2.5 liters. The Predicted column compares the actual volume breathed out during the first second of your test to an average of the normal volume breathed out in 1 second for a person of the same gender, height, and age. This value is expressed as a percentage, with normal test values being between 80% and 120% of the average (predicted) values.and whether higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

          <title>Discharge 6 Weeks Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1,Liter(L)/Sec)</title>
          <description>The Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second parameter measures the volume of air that was exhaled into the mouthpiece in the first second after a full inhalation. The Measured column represents the total volume exhaled during the first second, in liters. Normal values in healthy males aged 20-60 range from 4.5 to 3.5 liters, and normal values for females aged 20-60 range from 3.25 to 2.5 liters. The Predicted column compares the actual volume breathed out during the first second of your test to an average of the normal volume breathed out in 1 second for a person of the same gender, height, and age. This value is expressed as a percentage, with normal test values being between 80% and 120% of the average (predicted) values.and whether higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Forced expiratory flow (FEF) is the flow (or speed) of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of a forced expiration. It can be given at discrete times, generally defined by what fraction of the forced vital capacity (FVC) has been exhaled. The usual discrete intervals are 25%, 50% and 75%, usually 25-75% (FEF25-75%).Predicted normal values for FEF depend on age, sex, height, mass and ethnicity as well as the research study that they are based on assessment by pulmonary function test and higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second parameter(FEV1,liter(L)/sec) measures the volume of air that was exhaled into the mouthpiece in the first second after a full inhalation. The Measured column represents the total volume exhaled during the first second, in liters. Normal values in healthy males aged 20-60 range from 4.5 to 3.5 liters, and normal values for females aged 20-60 range from 3.25 to 2.5 liters. The Predicted column compares the actual volume breathed out during the first second of your test to an average of the normal volume breathed out in 1 second for a person of the same gender, height, and age. This value is expressed as a percentage, with normal test values being between 80% and 120% of the average (predicted) values.and whether higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Forced expiratory flow (FEF) is the flow (or speed) of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of a forced expiration. It can be given at discrete times, generally defined by what fraction of the forced vital capacity (FVC) has been exhaled. The usual discrete intervals are 25%, 50% and 75%, usually 25-75% (FEF25-75%).Predicted normal values for FEF depend on age, sex, height, mass and ethnicity as well as the research study that they are based on assessment by pulmonary function test and higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR in liter(L)/sec) assessment by pulmonary function test.It measures the airflow through the bronchi and thus the degree of obstruction in the airways. Peak expiratory flow is typically measured in units of liters per second (L/sec).when measured as part of spirometry.The normal range 500-700 L/sec In men, for women, the normal range is 380-500 L/sec.higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

This consisted of a vertical scale labelled 0-10, with corresponding verbal expressions of progressively increasing perceived sensation intensity. It starts at number 0 that mean breathing is no difficulty at all and progresses through to number 10 that mean breathing difficulty is maximal.so higher scores mean a worse outcome</description>
