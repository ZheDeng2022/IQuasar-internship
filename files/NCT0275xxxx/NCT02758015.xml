  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food will decrease stomach acidity due to its buffering effect.This has implications when&#xD;
      providing drugs that are dosed with food but require higher levels of stomach acid, such as&#xD;
      some medications commonly used for HIV patients. This study will attempt to determine the&#xD;
      dose of betaine hydrochloride (over the counter acid supplement) at which the effect of food&#xD;
      on stomach acid could be countered. Additionally, this study will evaluate the ability of a&#xD;
      natural supplement (betaine hydrochloride) to affect the gastric pH following a standardized&#xD;
      meal in healthy volunteers. The investigators predict that 4500mg of betaine hydrochloride&#xD;
      will have the greatest effect on gastric pH.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Gastric pH After Administration of Standardized Meal</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After Heidelberg capsule is placed and baseline gastric levels have been recorded using the Heidelberg Capsule (HC), which sends real-time signals to a computer system that visually plots intestinal pH on a minute-by-minute basis, a standardized meal is given. Gastric pH is measured for 15 minutes after the administration of the meal.</description>

    <measure>Change in Gastric pH After Administration of Standardized Meal and Betaine hydrochloride</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>After 15 minutes of gastric pH monitoring following the standardized meal, betaine hydrochloride will be administered and its effect on the ability to mitigate that rise in gastric pH will be determined using the Heidelberg capsule over the span of approximately 3 hours. This will be done three separate times with 3 doses (1500mg, 3000mg, and 4500mg) dosed orally with 90ml of water.</description>
