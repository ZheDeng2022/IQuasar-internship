      The Fr1dolin-Study will be presented to the parents of ca. 320,000 children living in Lower&#xD;
      Saxony, Germany. The recruitment of subjects, collection of written consent, the capillary&#xD;
      blood sample and the screening questionnaire will be done by the registered pediatricians in&#xD;
      their local medical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study enrolment 200 µl of capillary blood are be taken from the subject and are sent&#xD;
      pseudo-anonymized to the lab. LDL-C and the diabetes-associated antibodies are identified.&#xD;
      Based on the results a second blood sample will be required. In case of pre-type-1 diabetes&#xD;
      or signs for a familial hypercholesterolemia the pediatrician will be informed. He will&#xD;
      contact the parents and discuss the further procedure in cooperation with the study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a positive result by measuring diabetes-related antibodies and LDL-C the goal of&#xD;
      this trial is to advise and educate the families appropriate and to treat them if necessary.&#xD;
      In addition families should have the possibility to participate in prevention trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be registered in a study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up pre-type 1 diabetes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first year, follow-up will be performed after 6 and 12 months and thereafter&#xD;
      annually until the age of 12 years or up to 6 months after the clinical onset of type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up familial hypercholesterolemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first year, follow-up will be performed after 6 and 12 months and thereafter&#xD;
      annually until the age of 12 years.&#xD;

        According to the Federal Statistical Office (31.12.2014) 320.000 children in the age of 2&#xD;
        to 6 years are living in lower Saxony, Germany. Based on the Fr1da experience a&#xD;
        participation rate of 25-35 % is expected. The current estimated prevalence of FH und T1D&#xD;
        of 1:300 leads to the expected number of 450 newly identified cases of FH and T1D in each&#xD;
        case in the period of 18 months. Additional subjects with FH would be identified by cascade&#xD;
        screening.&#xD;
