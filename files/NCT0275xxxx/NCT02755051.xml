      Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and insomnia, and their parent(s) will undergo 8&#xD;
      sessions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy designed for Children with Chronic Insomnia and ASD&#xD;
      (CBT-CI-A). Treatment delivery will be assessed for each session. Treatment receipt will be&#xD;
      assessed at the end of session 3. Treatment enactment will be assessed throughout treatment,&#xD;
      post-treatment, and follow-up. Sleep and secondary outcomes (child daytime behavior, parent&#xD;
      sleep) will be collected at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up.&#xD;

      Children with ASD and insomnia, and their parent(s) will undergo 8 sessions of CBT-CI-A.&#xD;
      Treatment delivery will be assessed for each session. Treatment receipt will be assessed at&#xD;
      the end of session 3. Treatment enactment will be assessed throughout treatment,&#xD;
      post-treatment, and follow-up. Sleep and secondary outcomes (child daytime behavior, parent&#xD;
      sleep) will be collected at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children (6-12 yrs; n = 30) who meet full DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) criteria18&#xD;
      for ASD and insomnia will be recruited from an existing clinical registry database.&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria for initial recruitment will include IQ (intelligence quotient) of 75 or&#xD;
      above (to ensure ability to participate in cognitive components of treatment), previous DSM&#xD;
      diagnosis of ASD, and previous evaluation using gold standard diagnostic tools, including the&#xD;
      Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)27 and/or Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised&#xD;
      (ADI-R).28 The Thompson Center database currently includes 337 children with ASD ages 6-12&#xD;
      who have completed the ADOS and/or ADIR and have IQ&gt;75. Following initial recruitment,&#xD;
      eligibility for participation will include DSM diagnosis of insomnia. Insomnia will be&#xD;
      diagnosed by study staff using gold standard diagnostic tools, a brief (10 min.) structured&#xD;
      interview, Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire29, and sleep diaries.30 Child will report or&#xD;
      parent will observe sleep latency (time to fall asleep) or wake during the night &gt;30 minutes&#xD;
      that is confirmed by baseline sleep diaries. Dr. Sahota will provide referrals for children&#xD;
      with suspected sleep apnea. Additional criteria will include participation of the child's&#xD;
      parent or legal guardian living in the same home, and parental ability to read and understand&#xD;
      English at the 5th grade level. Given previous experience, size of the database and insomnia&#xD;
      prevalence in ASD, the investigators expect no difficulty recruiting our target sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be manualized and individually administered by graduate students trained by&#xD;
      Drs. McCrae and Mazurek. Parent and child will be actively involved in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT-CI-A will use established behavioral sleep strategies.5-7 Treatment will be adapted from&#xD;
      a manualized protocol developed and tested by Dr. McCrae in TD children. Adaptations for&#xD;
      children with ASD will be based on Dr. Mazurek's experience and expertise, practice pathway&#xD;
      recommendations of the ATN, and previously published CBT adaptations for treatment of anxiety&#xD;
      in children with ASD. Adaptations will include increased use of visual supports, greater&#xD;
      opportunities for repetition/practice, incorporation of special interests, and video&#xD;
      modeling.&#xD;
