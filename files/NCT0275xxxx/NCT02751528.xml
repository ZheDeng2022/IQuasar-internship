    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-low&#xD;
      expressing (IHC 1+ or 2+) breast cancer. The study will be conducted in two parts: the first&#xD;
      part will involve dose escalation using a 3 + 3 design, and the second part will involve the&#xD;
      expansion of the MTD or HTD to further evaluate safety, preliminary efficacy, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity. In the first part, 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled starting at&#xD;
      dose cohort 1. Subjects will be assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).&#xD;

             respectively, of the first planned dose of ETBX-021.&#xD;
