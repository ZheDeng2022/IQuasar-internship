    <textblock>
      This research protocol is studying the accuracy of the sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure&#xD;
      in breast cancer patients who have cancer cells in the lymph nodes in the armpit (axilla) who&#xD;
      have received chemotherapy or endocrine therapy prior to having surgery (neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      -  This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are&#xD;
           examining this study intervention locally; although this intervention has been studied&#xD;
           nationally in published clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this research study, the investigators are studying the accuracy of the sentinel&#xD;
           lymph node biopsy procedure in breast cancer patients who have cancer cells in the lymph&#xD;
           nodes in the armpit (axilla) who have received chemotherapy or endocrine therapy prior&#xD;
           to having surgery (neoadjuvant therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a surgical evaluation of the lymph nodes in the underarm&#xD;
           area in patients who have early breast cancer. Approximately, two-five nodes are removed&#xD;
           from the underarm area for evaluation. The sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed in&#xD;
           patients with breast cancer to determine if there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes in&#xD;
           the armpit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure is performed by injecting one or two dyes into&#xD;
           the breast, which then travel to the armpit region via small vessels in the immune&#xD;
           system. These nodes are called the sentinel lymph nodes. They represent the first nodes&#xD;
           that drain the breast tissue. They are closely evaluated by a Pathologist to determine&#xD;
           if cancer cells are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This information allows physicians to know how far the cancer may have spread and&#xD;
           recommend therapies accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If sentinel lymph node biopsy is determined to be accurate in patients who are known to&#xD;
           already have cancer cells in the axillary lymph nodes who receive neoadjuvant therapy,&#xD;
           then in the future, many of the patients in this population may be spared the procedure&#xD;
           of a full axillary lymph node dissection, which removes a larger number of lymph nodes&#xD;
           and thus has increased risks and side-effects.&#xD;

    <description>Axillary Lymph Node Biopsy&#xD;
-- Axillary lymph node sampling with clip placement into the sampled lymph node. After the tissue sampling of any suspicious nodes, a marker clip will be placed to allow for intra-operative identification of the biopsied nodes.&#xD;
Neoadjuvant therapy at the discretion of the treating Medical Oncologist. Once Neoadjuvant therapy is completed, surgery in the form of either Lumpectomy or Mastectomy is performed.&#xD;
Wire-localization of the clipped node on the day of surgery.&#xD;
Lymphatic mapping performed with either radiocolloid and/or blue dye.&#xD;
Sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed on the day of surgery.&#xD;
--- If the clipped node which contains the wire is not part of this sentinel lymph node specimen, then it will be removed separately and be sent to Pathology as a separate specimen.&#xD;
Axillary lymph node dissection as is the standard of care.</description>
