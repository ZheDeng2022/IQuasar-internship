      The study will aim at investigating novel plasma or imaging biomarkers in patients with acute&#xD;
      pericarditis. All participants will be treated according to established clinical&#xD;
      recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of acute pericarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will undergo blood sampling for measurements of plasma biomarkers&#xD;
      potentially involved in the pathogenesis of acute pericarditis. Imaging datasets from&#xD;
      available imaging tests will be used to quantify imaging biomarkers. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up prospectively for up to 18 months. The prognostic value of plasma and/or imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers for development of complications such as atrial fibrillation, pericarditis&#xD;
      recurrences, constrictive pericarditis and/or the need to switch to 2nd line treatment will&#xD;
      be sought.&#xD;

      Background: Acute pericarditis is a relatively common disorder with a reported incidence&#xD;
      ranging from 3.32 to 27.7 cases per 100,000 persons per year in the Western word.Potential&#xD;
      complications of acute pericarditis include pericarditis recurrence, cardiac tamponade and&#xD;
      constrictive pericarditis.To date there is limited clinical evidence on prognostic factors of&#xD;
      outcome in acute pericarditis; use of steroids/colchicine, the kinetics of C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP) in the acute phase and the underlying aetiology have been previously associated with&#xD;
      recurrence of acute pericarditis. Nevertheless there are currently no established biomarkers&#xD;
      to risk stratify patients with acute pericarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective observational study in three hundred (n=300) patients with a first&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute pericarditis to explore the value of plasma or imaging biomarkers in&#xD;
      predicting clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained obtained from all patients. The protocol has been&#xD;
      approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (ref. number 14167/20/08/2009) and will be&#xD;
      carried out in accordance with the principles of the declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of acute pericarditis and choice of treatment Acute pericarditis was diagnosed&#xD;
      based on clinical recommendations. Baseline clinical and demographic data were recorded in&#xD;
      all cases. In line with the current guidelines, diagnostic work-up included clinical history&#xD;
      and examination, ECG, chest x-ray, echocardiography and routine blood tests including among&#xD;
      others high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and CRP.12 In patients with high risk features for&#xD;
      secondary forms or complicated course13 additional tests will be performed at the discretion&#xD;
      of the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ibuprofen 600mg tid or aspirin 1gr tid will be given as first line therapy for at least 7-10&#xD;
      days provided that CRP is normalized within the same time interval, and subsequent tapering&#xD;
      in the following 3-4 weeks. Steroids will be given at a dose of 0.2-0.5mg/kg of prednisolone&#xD;
      or equivalent dose of another steroid until CRP normalization and symptoms resolution&#xD;
      followed by tapering according to recommendations. Indications for steroids administration as&#xD;
      a first line treatment included secondary cause of pericarditis and contraindications or poor&#xD;
      response to NSAIDs treatment (persisting symptoms and/or CRP elevation beyond 10 days of&#xD;
      treatment). Colchicine will be given in all cases at a dose of 0.5mg bid (unless&#xD;
      contraindicated) and halved in patients aged &gt;70 years old or body weight &lt;70kg.Treatment&#xD;
      failure with first line medication and/or switch to steroids for any reason was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up All patients included will be followed-up at outpatients' clinic at 2&#xD;
      weeks, 1 month, 2 months post-hospital discharge and every 3 months thereafter (or earlier if&#xD;
      symptomatic) up to a total of 18 months, given that the majority of clinical complications&#xD;
      appear within this time frame.The composite clinical end-point will be poor response to&#xD;
      NSAIDs treatment (defined by the need to switch to 2nd line therapy) and development of&#xD;
      either recurrent, incessant or constrictive pericarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pericarditis will be diagnosed as incessant if lasting more than 4-6 weeks but less than 3&#xD;
      months and recurrent in the presence of 4-6 weeks symptom-free interval of 4-6 weeks between&#xD;
      2 consecutive episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of plasma biomarkers The prognostic value of plasma biomarkers such as CRP,&#xD;
      troponin I, proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL18 and others) in patients with acute&#xD;
      pericarditis will be investigated. The value of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) as candidate biomarkers&#xD;
      involved in the pathogenesis of acute pericarditis will be also sought in gene expression&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Imaging biomarkers Stored imaging datasets (e.g.cardiac ultrasound images,&#xD;
      cardiac computed tomography data etc) will be used to explore the value of imaging biomarkers&#xD;
      (e.g epicardial fat volume by computed tomography, speckle-tracking analysis of cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound) in predicting clinical outcome of patients with acute pericarditis.&#xD;
