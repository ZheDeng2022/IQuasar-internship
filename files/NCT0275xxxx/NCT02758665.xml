      A prospective, open-label, multicentre phase-II trial of ibrutinib plus venetoclax plus&#xD;
      obinutuzumab in physically fit (CIRS ≤ 6 &amp; normal creatinine clearance) and unfit (CIRS &gt; 6 &amp;&#xD;
      creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min) patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL) with TP53 deletion (17p-) and/or mutation&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with TP53 deletion (17p-) and/or mutation has a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Different therapeutic strategies have been tested over the last decade such as&#xD;
      fludarabine-based regimens, alemtuzumab, bendamustine alone or with rituximab, lenalidomide,&#xD;
      or ofatumumab, but all without compelling evidence for success. For example, with the FCR&#xD;
      regimen as the standard 1st line treatment for fit CLL patients, only 5% (1 of 22) of&#xD;
      patients with 17p deletion had a complete response (CR) and 40% of patients were free of&#xD;
      disease progression at 12 months in the CLL8 Trial. New agents like Bruton's Tyrosin Kinase&#xD;
      (BTK) inhibitors such as ibrutinib have shown promising results in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory CLL, however, outcome of CLL patients with 17p deletion is inferior to other&#xD;
      subgroups. The CLL11 trial revealed an impressive improvement in efficacy with GA-101&#xD;
      (obinutuzumab) as compared to rituximab when combined with Chlorambucil. Moreover, the BCL2&#xD;
      antagonist venetoclax (previously GDC-0199/ABT-199), tested as a single agent in relapsed /&#xD;
      refractory CLL patients, showed striking activity with tumor lysis syndrome as dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity. Consequently, the current trial will test a combination regimen consisting of&#xD;
      obinutuzumab, ibrutinib and venetoclax (the &quot;GIVe&quot; regimen) as first line treatment in CLL&#xD;
      patients with TP53 deletion (17p-) and/or mutation with the aim to demonstrate efficacy in&#xD;
      this population at highest unmet medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the GIVe regimen in&#xD;
      patients with TP53 deletion (17p-) and/or mutation and previously untreated CLL requiring&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, the CR rate at cycle 15 (d1; final restaging) will be used as primary parameter for&#xD;
      efficacy. The CR rate is defined as the proportion of patients having achieved a CR or a CR&#xD;
      with incomplete recovery of the bone marrow (CRi) as best response (according to iwCLL&#xD;
      criteria) until cycle 15 (d1; final restaging) from start of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of the regimen will be further assessed by evaluation of the proportion of patients&#xD;
      free of disease progression (PD-free rate) after 12 cycles of therapy, overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR), minimal residual disease (MRD) and overall survival as well as other time to event&#xD;
      endpoints as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of ibrutinib, venetoclax&#xD;
      and obinutuzumab.&#xD;
