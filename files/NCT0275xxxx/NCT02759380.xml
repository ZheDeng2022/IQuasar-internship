  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a diet with a high content of phytoestrogens can&#xD;
      slow down the prostate tumor proliferation. Phytoestrogens are found in food items such as&#xD;
      soy, rye, and seeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred thirty men with prostate cancer will be included in the study and followed until&#xD;
      surgery (at least 6 weeks). Half of the study participants will receive general information&#xD;
      about healthy food choices and a package of foods with high content of phytoestrogens to add&#xD;
      to their food. The other half will get the same information but not receive the food-package.&#xD;

      Data from ecologic and experimental studies clearly show a protective effect of dietary&#xD;
      phytoestrogens against prostate cancer. Genetic factors are also of etiologic importance in&#xD;
      prostate cancer and there is growing evidence for the importance of a gene-diet interaction&#xD;
      in prostate cancer progression. The investigators have recently found a putative genetic&#xD;
      interaction for this protective role of phytoestrogens. The overall decreased risk of&#xD;
      prostate cancer in men with a high intake of phytoestrogens was strongly modified by a&#xD;
      nucleotide sequence variant in the estrogen receptor-beta (ERß) gene. An American study found&#xD;
      a similar interactive effect between intake of phytoestrogens, as well as body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), and another nucleotide sequence variant in ERß.The phytoestrogens isoflavonoids and&#xD;
      coumestans bind tightly to the estrogen receptor-beta (ERß) and are mainly found in soy and&#xD;
      other beans. ERß expression has been found to be involved in progression of prostate cancer,&#xD;
      suggesting that phytoestrogens may interact with ERß in the development of prostate cancer.&#xD;
      With regard to potential carcinogenic mechanisms, phytoestrogens may be involved in the&#xD;
      endocrine control of prostate cell growth by influencing the balance between AR and&#xD;
      ERß.Testosterone and its metabolite 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) cause proliferation of&#xD;
      prostate epithelial cells through binding to the AR. In contrast, by binding to ERß, 5α&#xD;
      androstane-3ß,17ß-diol (3ßAdiol), a metabolite of DHT, represses the expression of AR and&#xD;
      thereby inhibits androgen-driven proliferation while promoting cell differentiation. In terms&#xD;
      of proliferation, current data suggests a combined stimulatory role of ERα and AR in the&#xD;
      prostate whereas ERß inhibits proliferation and stimulates differentiation. Both estrogen ERα&#xD;
      and ß have affinity for estradiol whereas phytoestrogens and 3ßAdiol selectively activate&#xD;
      ERß. Phytoestrogens should, as a result, be able to restrict cancer growth by acting as a&#xD;
      substitute for 3ßAdiol. This is confirmed by experimental studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from previous intervention studies have given promising results indicating that&#xD;
      certain dietary or lifestyle modifications can influence the progression of prostate cancer,&#xD;
      although most of these studies have been of fairly short of duration and based on relatively&#xD;
      small numbers of patients. For example, a randomised study showed that men who were given a&#xD;
      dietary addition of flaxseeds had a lower percentage of positive cells containing the&#xD;
      proliferation marker Ki-67 than men who had not received this addition to their diet. Taken&#xD;
      together, the present evidence points towards the possibility for prostate cancer patients to&#xD;
      complement with lifestyle-related treatment alternatives to prevent or delay tumor&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim: To perform a controlled randomized dietary intervention study in men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The investigators will pursue the following specific aims/hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;Among men with prostate cancer of intermediate risk-level, a diet high in&#xD;
           phytoestrogens will reduce tumor progression compared to men with a diet low in&#xD;
           phytoestrogens&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;The effects of a diet high in phytoestrogens on prostate cancer tumor progression&#xD;
           differ between men with different genotypes of polymorphisms in the ERß gene&quot;. The men&#xD;
           will be divided into two subgroups, those bearing TT or TC/CC alleles, of the&#xD;
           single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2987983-13950 T/C in the ERß-gene, in which the&#xD;
           hypothesis will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether RNA expression of the AR, ERα and ERβ in prostate tumor tissue, as&#xD;
           well as levels of steroid hormones, differs between men with a diet high and low in&#xD;
           phytoestrogens, respectively, or between different genotypes of the ERβ gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) gene expression in prostate&#xD;
           tumor tissue differs between men with a diet high and low in phytoestrogens,&#xD;
           respectively, or between different genotypes of the ERβ gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: Trough treating physicians, the investigators will identify 240 men in the&#xD;
      Västra Götaland healthcare region who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer of&#xD;
      intermediate risk-level (T1-T2, Gleason score &lt;8, PSA&lt;20)scheduled for radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
      The clinic will be informed of which patients have been enrolled in the study, and the&#xD;
      surgery for these patients will be scheduled six weeks ahead of time from the date of&#xD;
      inclusion. Once a patient has agreed to participate, he will be randomized to one of the two&#xD;
      intervention arms. The patient will then receive additional information depending on which&#xD;
      group he belongs to and will be asked to donate a blood sample. Under normal clinical&#xD;
      routine, data on all prostate cancer cases is collected in the National Prostate Cancer&#xD;
      Register (NPCR), for example information on Gleason score, tumor volume, Prostate-specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA) levels. The investigators will collect information from the registry in&#xD;
      connection with the analysis of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be introduced to the intervention diet by a dietitian and will&#xD;
      receive general information about healthy food choices (according to recommendations for the&#xD;
      general public) and not to eat any dietary supplements, no other dietary restrictions will be&#xD;
      given. The patients will be given a package containing food with a high amount of&#xD;
      phytoestrogens (≥100 mg isoflavonoids and ≥100 mg lignans) that are to be consumed daily. The&#xD;
      intervention continues until the day before the surgery (at least 6 weeks). The patients in&#xD;
      the control group will be informed in the same way as the intervention group except that they&#xD;
      will not receive any food-package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: The effect of the diet on tumor proliferation rate will be measured by making&#xD;
      comparisons of 1) percentage of positive cells containing the marker Ki-67, 2) PSA-levels, 3)&#xD;
      CCP-score in the two groups. Tumor tissue from prostate biopsies taken during surgery (the&#xD;
      end of the study) and the most recent biopsy taken before the beginning of the study will be&#xD;
      collected. Blood samples will be taken at the beginning of the study, at the day before the&#xD;
      surgery, and 3 months after surgery, and send to analysis of PSA (free and total). The&#xD;
      absolute differences in PSA levels and the PSA doubling time will be calculated. In addition&#xD;
      the investigators will measure the expression of AR, ERα and ERß in tumor tissue and the&#xD;
      blood levels of hormones, testosterone, DHT, estradiol and 3ß-Adiol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire: All patients will answer a password-protected questionnaire at baseline,&#xD;
      surgery, and after 3 months, weight and height will be measured. Once during the 6-weeks&#xD;
      period a 24-h recall interview will be performed, in which participants food intake during&#xD;
      the preceding 24 h will be registered. The individual intake of energy and specific nutrients&#xD;
      will be estimated by linking information from the questionnaire and diet record to the&#xD;
      National Food Agency's nutritional database and our previously developed phytoestrogen&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of polymorphs:SNP in the ERß-gene will be analysed in blood samples, using the&#xD;
      PCR-based method competitive allele specific PCR (KASP™). The allele-constitution will be&#xD;
      identified and participants will be assigned to group TT, TC or CC. Analysis of Ki-67: The&#xD;
      biopsy sample is fixed by immersion with 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0,1 M phosphate buffer&#xD;
      during 24hours at +4°C. Then it is dehydrated with graded ethanol followed by xylene and&#xD;
      paraffin embedding. Paraffin sections are heated for 30 minutes at 60ºC, pre-treated with&#xD;
      citric acid buffer. Unspecific binding is blocked by donkey serum in phosphate buffered&#xD;
      saline (PBS) containing Triton X-100 for 30 minutes. Incubating with Ki-67 antibody over&#xD;
      night (4ºC) followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary biotinylated antibody. To&#xD;
      enhance the signal, the sections are treated with avidin-biotin-complex solution, and to&#xD;
      visualize the immunoreactivity Diaminobenzidine (DAB) is used. Stained tumor cells (Ki-67&#xD;
      positivity) will be counted and the result will be reported as the ratio of positive nuclei&#xD;
      divided by the total number evaluated × 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of receptor-expression, CCP score, hormone levels and PSA: Tissue samples taken at&#xD;
      surgery is placed in RNA-later before being frozen. The samples will be analysed using RNeasy&#xD;
      plus Universal Mini Kits (QIAGEN), and Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ERα, ERβ&#xD;
      and AR mRNA expression will be determined using TaqMan assay. For analysis of CCP score, the&#xD;
      pathologist select regions of carcinoma and RNA will be extracted as above; thereafter gene&#xD;
      expression will be assessed according to the manufactures (Prolaris®) instruction. PSA-blood&#xD;
      levels will be analysed according to standard clinical protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: In the Västra Götaland healthcare region in 2012, 321 men had intermediate&#xD;
      risk-level prostate cancer for which they received curative treatment. Calculation using the&#xD;
      primary outcome (Ki-67) gives for a study group consisting of 118 patients an 80 % power for&#xD;
      a two-sided test with a level of significance at 0,05 and effect size of 0,5. The&#xD;
      investigators found in earlier studies that approximately 42 % of the male population are&#xD;
      heterozygous or homozygous for the variant allele (TC/CC) of the ERβ promoter region SNP&#xD;
      (rs2987983-13950 T/C) and 58 % homozygous for the wild type allele (TT). Since the&#xD;
      investigators expect the effect of the intervention to be greater among subjects with the&#xD;
      variant allele, while smaller among subjects with the wild type allele, this latter group&#xD;
      ought to be large enough to be able to find a difference if one exists. Thus a total sample&#xD;
      size of 118/58%=203 patients is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations: The investigators will utilize the intention-to-treat method. In&#xD;
      the design and data collection testing of drugs as the template have been made&#xD;
      (randomization, placebo, blinding, no attrition, no differential measuring errors, correct&#xD;
      analysis); for the deviations from the perfect situation the investigators use&#xD;
      epidemiological theory for guiding the analyses and interpreting the results. Preliminary&#xD;
      analyses, based on means, medians, standard deviations and interquantile range will be&#xD;
      provided to properly describe the outcomes of interest and stratification will be performed&#xD;
      to assess the performance of the randomization of the assigned diet. Box-plots will therefore&#xD;
      be produced to graphically evaluate the temporal trends in the response. The distribution of&#xD;
      the outcomes will be studied and appropriate transformations will be applied, if needed, to&#xD;
      improve symmetry and normality. Due to the longitudinal structure of the data, correlation&#xD;
      among observations will be incorporated and linear mixed effects models will be carried out&#xD;
      to study if (i) there is a temporal trend (ii) if the linear trend differs between treated&#xD;
      and untreated individuals (iii) if the treatment effect between the intervention group and&#xD;
      the control group is modified according to ERß genotypes, both for the common and the&#xD;
      variant. A key step in analysis of longitudinal data is to identify the appropriate&#xD;
      covariance structure that describes the correlations among the data points: independent&#xD;
      covariance (no correlation), exchangeable covariance (equal correlation) or autoregressive&#xD;
      covariance with correlation between responses decreasing with time between measurements. The&#xD;
      investigators will identify the most appropriate structure, verified empirically with help of&#xD;
      an information theoretic approach. Both statistical tests and confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      produced to assess the significance of the effects, partial F test procedures will therefore&#xD;
      be used to study the joined effect of main and interaction variables and appropriate&#xD;
      statistical methods will be applied to study model fitting.&#xD;
