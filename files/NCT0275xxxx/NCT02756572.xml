      This clinical trial studies how well early stem cell transplantation works in treating&#xD;
      patients with high-grade myeloid neoplasms that has come back after a period of improvement&#xD;
      or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as filgrastim, cladribine,&#xD;
      cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before a donor peripheral blood cell transplant&#xD;
      helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem&#xD;
      cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the&#xD;
      patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood&#xD;
      cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and&#xD;
      help destroy any remaining cancer cells. Early stem cell transplantation may result in more&#xD;
      successful treatment for patients with high-grade myeloid neoplasms.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RE-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5,&#xD;
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1-3, cladribine IV over&#xD;
      2 hours on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Beginning 14-60 days after re-induction chemotherapy, patients receive&#xD;
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2, melphalan IV on days -3 to -2,&#xD;
      cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) starting on day -3. Sirolimus PO BID starting on&#xD;
      day -3 will be given to patients who have matched unrelated donors or mismatched unrelated&#xD;
      donors. Patients &gt;55 years or with significant co-morbidities will only receive melphalan IV&#xD;
      on day -2 and will also receive total body irradiation (TBI) on day -1 or day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EARLY TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic HCT after conditioning regimen on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients with matched donors will receive mycophenolate mofetil PO three&#xD;
      times daily (TID) on days 0-30, then twice a day (BID) until day 40; and cyclosporine PO BID&#xD;
      on days -3 to 96, with a taper until day 150. Patients with matched unrelated donors also&#xD;
      receive sirolimus PO BID on days -3 to 150, with a taper until day 180. Patients with&#xD;
      mismatched unrelated donors will receive mycophenolate mofetil PO TID on days 0-30, then BID&#xD;
      until day 100, with a taper until day 150; cyclosporine PO BID on days -3 to 150, then taper&#xD;
      until day 180; and sirolimus BID PO days -3 to 180, then a taper until day 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who receive early transplant will be compared to those that don't using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for the quantitative variable of treatment-related mortality (TRM). This outcome measure is intended to report a predicted TRM score assessed at the time of feasibility evaluation. The TRM score is used to measure &quot;treatment-related mortality,&quot; or likelihood of death within 28 days of initiation of induction chemotherapy for patients with AML. The score is normalized from 0 to 100, so that a score of 0 demonstrates the patient has a very low likelihood of TRM and a score of 100 a very high likelihood of death. A calculation is used to predict TRM using age, performance status, if they have secondary AML, albumin, creatinine, platelet count, white blood cell count, and peripheral blood blast percentage. The higher the TRM score, the higher the risk of TRM. Calculator and table of relationship between TRM score and TRM probability found here: https://trmcalculator.fredhutch.org/.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA (ENROLLMENT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed or refractory high-grade myeloid neoplasms, defined as having a blast count&#xD;
             of &gt;= 10% blasts at initial diagnosis; examples include excess blasts (EB)-2, with &gt;=&#xD;
             10% blasts at initial diagnosis, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic&#xD;
             myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML-2); standard definitions of relapse will apply (i.e.,&#xD;
             characterized by &gt;= 5% abnormal blasts or blast equivalents as assessed by&#xD;
             multiparameter flow cytometry or morphologic examination; peripheral blood blasts or&#xD;
             blast equivalents; or extramedullary granulocytic sarcoma, per European LeukemiaNet&#xD;
             [ELN] 2017 guidelines); bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be accepted if performed&#xD;
             outside University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (UW/FHCRC);&#xD;
             determination of disease status should occur within 30 days of signing informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  R/R high-grade myeloid neoplasm following intensive induction chemotherapy;&#xD;
                  relapsed high-grade myeloid neoplasm: patients will be classified as relapsed if&#xD;
                  they have &gt;= 5% blasts after being in a complete remission (CR) following&#xD;
                  treatment for high-grade myeloid neoplasm; refractory high-grade myeloid&#xD;
                  neoplasm: patients may be classified as refractory if they have received at least&#xD;
                  one prior cycle of induction chemotherapy, whether with cladribine cytarabine&#xD;
                  mitoxantrone (GCLAM) or another regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ** Patients may have received up to two courses of intensive induction&#xD;
                  chemotherapy during initial treatment prior to enrollment on this protocol; for&#xD;
                  example, patients who have received two courses of granulocyte colony stimulating&#xD;
                  factor (G-CSF) GCLAM (or similar) chemotherapy, with most recent high-dose&#xD;
                  cytarabine-containing chemotherapy &gt; 6 months ago and CR lasting &gt; 6 months, will&#xD;
                  be eligible for this protocol; regimens &quot;similar to GCLAM&quot; would include&#xD;
                  cytarabine at doses of 1g/m^2 for at least 5 doses; examples of regimens &quot;similar&#xD;
                  to GCLAM&quot; would be GCLA, fludarabine cytarabine granulocyte (FLAG), and&#xD;
                  FLAG-idarubicin (ida); however, patients who received more than two courses of&#xD;
                  GCLAM (or similar) chemotherapy, or patients who received two courses of GCLAM&#xD;
                  and had CR lasting &lt; 6 months, would not be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  R/R high-grade myeloid neoplasm following less intensive induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
                  Patients who have received at least three cycles of treatment with a&#xD;
                  hypomethylating agent (HMA; such as azacitidine or decitabine) and still have &gt;=&#xD;
                  10% blasts will be eligible for the study (they will be considered refractory);&#xD;
                  similarly, patients who have received three or more cycles of HMA therapy who&#xD;
                  have had a response (e.g., achieving CR with &lt; 5% blasts), but who then progress&#xD;
                  using standard definitions of relapse, will also be eligible (they will be&#xD;
                  considered relapsed)&#xD;

        DONOR SELECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Identification of an appropriate donor will follow the general guidelines listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-matched related or unrelated donor. Donors must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Matched for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high resolution typing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as defined by&#xD;
                  high resolution typing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-mismatched unrelated donor. Unrelated volunteer donors who are mismatched with the&#xD;
             recipient within one of the following limitations will be permitted:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mismatch for one HLA class I antigen with or without an additional mismatch for&#xD;
                  one HLA-class I allele, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mismatched for two HLA class I alleles, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HLA class I HLA-A, -B, -C allele matched donors allowing for any one or two DRB1&#xD;
                  and/or DQB1 antigen/allele mismatch&#xD;
&#xD;
        HLA-matching must be based on results of high resolution typing at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1,&#xD;
        and -DQ. If the patient is homozygous at the mismatch HLA class I locus or II locus, the&#xD;
        donor must be heterozygous at that locus and one allele must match the patient (i.e.,&#xD;
        patient is homozygous A*01:01 and donor is heterozygous A*01:01, A*02:01)&#xD;

          <title>Treatment Related Mortality Score</title>
          <description>Our institution defines TRM as death within 28 days from initiation of chemotherapy based on the observation that the risk of death declines once 4 weeks has elapsed from treatment start. A calculation is used to predict TRM using patient's age, performance status, if they have secondary AML, albumin, creatinine, platelet count, white blood cell count, and peripheral blood blast percentage. The higher the TRM score, the higher the risk of TRM. Calculator and table of relationship between TRM score and TRM probability found here: https://cstaging.fhcrc-research.org/TRM/Default.aspx</description>

        <title>Factors That Distinguish Patients Who Received Early Transplant From Those Who Did Not - TREATMENT RELATED MORTALITY</title>
        <description>Patients who receive early transplant will be compared to those that don't using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for the quantitative variable of treatment-related mortality (TRM). This outcome measure is intended to report a predicted TRM score assessed at the time of feasibility evaluation. The TRM score is used to measure &quot;treatment-related mortality,&quot; or likelihood of death within 28 days of initiation of induction chemotherapy for patients with AML. The score is normalized from 0 to 100, so that a score of 0 demonstrates the patient has a very low likelihood of TRM and a score of 100 a very high likelihood of death. A calculation is used to predict TRM using age, performance status, if they have secondary AML, albumin, creatinine, platelet count, white blood cell count, and peripheral blood blast percentage. The higher the TRM score, the higher the risk of TRM. Calculator and table of relationship between TRM score and TRM probability found here: https://trmcalculator.fredhutch.org/.</description>

            <description>All patients enrolled received bridge chemotherapy prior to anticipated allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Patients received G-CLAM chemotherapy (consisting of G-CSF, mitoxantrone, cladribine, and cytarabine). HCT conditioning consisted of fludarabine and melphalan, with total body irradiation for patients over age 55 or with significant co-morbidities. HCT was to be received within 60 days of starting G-CLAM chemotherapy.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Some patients did not move on with transplant on study within 60 days of chemotherapy due to issues with scheduling pre-transplant evaluations, donor searches, and donor availability which caused delays. Some patients were also taken off this study to enroll onto other, more appropriate transplant clinical trials.</limitations_and_caveats>
