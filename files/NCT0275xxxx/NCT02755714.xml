  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise Induced Laryngeal Obstruction (EILO) is a condition not uncommon in otherwise&#xD;
      healthy young people. EILO is caused by posteromedial collapse of supraglottic structures or&#xD;
      medialization of the vocal folds, or both, during high intensity exercise. There are&#xD;
      currently no treatments available that is properly evidence based. However, case reports&#xD;
      suggest a possible effect from the &quot;asthma drug&quot; Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent®). The current&#xD;
      project is an open label pilot study, aiming to test if Atrovent can influence the occurence&#xD;
      of EILO, either postponing the onset during exercise or fully prevent the condition to occur.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise induced inspiratory symptoms (EIIS) is increasingly recognized as an important&#xD;
      differential diagnosis to exercise induced asthma (EIA) in otherwise healthy adolescents.&#xD;
      EIIS is most often linked to laryngeal abnormalities and if so, often labelled exercise&#xD;
      induced laryngeal obstruction (E-ILO). In unselected populations, E-ILO has been found in&#xD;
      7.5% and 5.7% of adolescents. Causal mechanisms remain unclear, and a variety of structural&#xD;
      and/or functional pathways have been proposed, such as abnormalities related to the&#xD;
      epiglottis, the laryngeal cartilage-skeleton or its support, mucosal structures as well as&#xD;
      the laryngeal muscular system or its nerve supply. All these abnormalities might conceivably&#xD;
      disturb the airflow on its way through the laryngeal inlet, increase the turbulence and the&#xD;
      airflow resistance, and thereby set up a sense of dyspnea and trigger the symptoms that are&#xD;
      characteristic of EIIS. Additionally, various psychological characteristics have been&#xD;
      proposed to be implicated in this causal cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the causal mechanisms of E-ILO have not been clarified, all attempts on treatment of this&#xD;
      condition have been empirical and there is currently no properly evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      available. Speech therapy, often in combination with some kind of psychotherapy, have been&#xD;
      viewed as mainstay therapy by most authors, whereas other psychological measures such as&#xD;
      relaxation therapy, hypnosis and biofeedback have been advocated by others. Anticholinergic&#xD;
      aerosols applied before exercise has been suggested and there are reports of successful&#xD;
      surgical treatment using laser supraglottoplasty. The common goal of these treatment&#xD;
      initiatives has been to increase the size of the laryngeal inlet during the increasing&#xD;
      airflow velocity that is induced by increasing exercise intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inducible laryngeal obstructions were previously often labeled vocal cord dysfunction (VCD),&#xD;
      and Ayres et al. proposed in 2002 in an article in Thorax that VCD could be a function of an&#xD;
      altered autonomic balance. This view opened for a theoretical framework for treatment of VCD&#xD;
      using inhaled anticholinergic agents such as Ipratropium bromide (Atrovent®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, positive effects from inhaled anticholinergic agents in VCD have so far&#xD;
      only been published as case reports, and systematic studies have not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to address potential effects from Atrovent in patients with E-ILO verified&#xD;
      during a continuous laryngoscopy exercise (CLE) test. The study will primarily include 20&#xD;
      patients consecutively referred to our clinic for EIIS and diagnosed with E-ILO during a&#xD;
      routine CLE test. Requirement for inclusion will be a CLE score ≥ 3. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      will be the laryngeal response to maximal exercise, described quantitatively by a blinded&#xD;
      observer using the CLE score system. Two CLE tests will be performed in each subject, one&#xD;
      with - and one without - prior treatment with Atrovent. The patient will thus serve as&#xD;
      her/his own control. Half the patients will receive Atrovent before the first study test (at&#xD;
      T1), the other half before the second (at T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLE-test&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLE-test was described in detail by the authors Heimdal et al. in the &quot;Laryngoscope&quot; in&#xD;
      2006 and the scoring system by Maat et al. in the &quot;European Archives of Otorhinolaryngology&quot;&#xD;
      in 2009. In short, the test combines a full cardio-pulmonary treadmill exercise set-up with&#xD;
      continuous real-time transnasal video-laryngoscopy applied from rest to peak exercise to&#xD;
      rest. A camera and a microphone placed in front of the subject enable recording of&#xD;
      simultaneous video images of the external upper part of the body as well as recordings of the&#xD;
      respiratory sounds. The subjects run on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol,&#xD;
      incrementing speed and/or grade every minute with the aim to obtain peak oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (peakVO2) after 6-12 min of exercise. The test is considered successful if the patient&#xD;
      experience respiratory complaints, or indicate exhaustion, preferably supported by a plateau&#xD;
      in oxygen consumption and/or the heart rate. All recordings continue until normal breathing&#xD;
      is regained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLE-test scoring system was established based on evaluations of video recordings from&#xD;
      both patients and symptom-negative controls who were examined with the CLE-test. The CLE-test&#xD;
      scoring system encompasses separate assessments of the extent of medial rotation of the&#xD;
      aryepiglottic folds and adduction of the vocal folds scored in representative respiratory&#xD;
      cycles at two different points in time during the exercise session; i.e. at a moderate effort&#xD;
      (when changing from walking to running on the treadmill) and at maximal effort (shortly&#xD;
      before exhaustion). Adduction is graded from 0 (neutral position or abduction) to a maximum&#xD;
      score of 3. This set-up establishes four sub-scores ranging from 0 to 3, i.e. glottic and&#xD;
      supraglottic adduction at moderate (A and B), and maximal exercise (C and D). The sum score&#xD;
      (E) may finally be categorized into three clusters: 0-2 (normal) and 3-4 (moderate) and 5 or&#xD;
      more (severe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the Western Norway Regional Committee for Medical and Health&#xD;
      Research Ethics (REKVEST 2014/1885) and by the Norwegian Medicines Agency; European Union&#xD;
      Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EUDRACT) No. 2014-000302-34 (enclosed). The&#xD;
      study will be performed under the guidance of the Paediatric Clinical Trial Unit at Haukeland&#xD;
      University Hospital, a unit that has extensive experience in running clinical trials in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
