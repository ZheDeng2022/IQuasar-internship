      Low bone mass and osteoporosis are underdiagnosed in childhood in our environment and its&#xD;
      prevalence is unknown. In most cases they are secondary to chronic diseases that conduct to a&#xD;
      poor bone health condition and thereby a risk of fracture increased. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to identify patients with risk factors for low bone mass and determine their Bone Mineral&#xD;
      Density (amount of bone) by performing bone densitometry and compared with healthy population&#xD;
      of the same characteristics. Also the investigators want to evaluate bone quality by&#xD;
      application of Trabecular Bone Score to images obtained by densitometry. As secondary&#xD;
      objectives the investigators intend to correlate the data with with clinical variables to&#xD;
      identify the most important in bone health clinical factors. In addition to measuring bone&#xD;
      quality and quantity demographic and clinical process related to bone quality base and&#xD;
      variables will be collected.&#xD;

      Osteoporosis (OP) in children is a rare disease whose incidence is unknown, partly due to&#xD;
      lack of diagnosis associated with the absence of specific clinical symptoms in the early&#xD;
      stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is why the active recognition of this disease by the pediatrician and the pediatrician&#xD;
      rheumatologist is essential to prevent future complications: fractures and comorbidity&#xD;
      associated with them, including possible deformities and the need for surgical correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of OP in children and adolescents requires the combination of densitometric&#xD;
      criteria (low bone mass or deficits in mineralization) and the clinical judgment of&#xD;
      clinically significant fracture. Any of the following fractures are considered clinically&#xD;
      significant fractures: Long bone fracture of the lower limbs, vertebral compression fracture,&#xD;
      or two or more long bone fractures of upper extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low bone mass for age is considered when the Z-score of the measurement of bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD) is less than or equal to -2, adjusted for age, sex and body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Z-score is a value that is calculated by subtracting the average patient BMD BMD their&#xD;
      age group and gender and this value by dividing the standard deviation of their age group and&#xD;
      gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA (dual-energy X ray absortiometry) lumbar and whole body (excluding the head) is the&#xD;
      method of choice for measuring bone mineral density (BMD), since it is the most accurate&#xD;
      skeletal location and reproducible for measuring BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juvenile Idiopathic Osteoporosis is a very rare entity, with less than 200 cases described in&#xD;
      the literature, and whose diagnosis requires the exclusion of secondary forms of&#xD;
      osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the causes of osteoporosis (low bone mass or) secondary in child population the&#xD;
      investigators have: kidney diseases, metabolic diseases, hematological, endocrinological,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and rheumatological, including chronic systemic disorders. The transplant&#xD;
      and cancer patients have generally a multifactorial risk of osteoporosis (immobilization,&#xD;
      medical treatment, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, nutritional causes are another large block of secondary forms of child and / juvenile&#xD;
      (or low bone mass for age) osteoporosis. Typical examples of malabsorptive disease are celiac&#xD;
      disease, cystic fibrosis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease and anorexia nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special attention should pediatric patients treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      methotrexate and, of course, glucocorticoids, potent inducers and inhibitors of&#xD;
      osteoclastogenesis osteoblastogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other medications that affect a greater risk of developing osteoporosis are: some&#xD;
      anticonvulsants, anticoagulants and chemotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the ISCD (International Society for Clinical Densitometry) should be performed&#xD;
      by DXA bone densitometry as a measure of bone health assessment of all children with&#xD;
      increased risk of fracture. They are therefore candidates for a bone densitometry pediatric&#xD;
      patients with primary bone diseases or potential secondary bone diseases (eg, pre-transplant&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory diseases, endocrine disorders, cancer or history).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While DXA is the only validated technique today for indirect measurement of fracture risk in&#xD;
      itself is only able to analyze changes in bone mineral content, so recently they have&#xD;
      intensified efforts to validate other techniques possible to assess not only the quantity but&#xD;
      also the quality of the bone. Among the highlights is the TBS (Trabecular Bone Score) which&#xD;
      is software that applied directly to the information obtained through the spinal DXA can&#xD;
      analyze the trabecular number, thickness and connectivity, providing extra information about&#xD;
      the strength or weakness of the vertebra. Its use is spreading in routine clinical practice&#xD;
      in the adult population as it is safe and does not increase the time required exploration,&#xD;
      however in the pediatric population is not included in routine practice even though its&#xD;
      application could provide additional information to the DMO on which to base treatment&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;
