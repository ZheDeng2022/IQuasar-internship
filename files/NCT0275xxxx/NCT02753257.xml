  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valtari Bio has early proof of concept clinical data of a multi-omic peripheral blood&#xD;
      biomarker profile that can be used to determine stroke from no stroke in the emergency&#xD;
      setting. The objective of this observational cohort clinical study is to determine the&#xD;
      clinical utility of this multi-omic biomarker profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The diagnostic tests characteristics of a multi-omic biomarker diagnostic for stroke&#xD;
           (ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and hemorrhagic stroke) versus no&#xD;
           stroke (stroke mimic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The ability of a multi-omic biomarker profile to differentiate ischemic stroke from&#xD;
           hemorrhagic stroke and TIA.&#xD;

      At the completion of this project the investigators will have evaluated a peripheral blood&#xD;
      test that determines the expression of a multi-omic biomarker profile to differentiate stroke&#xD;
      from no-stroke in the emergency setting. Five hundred patients aged 18 years or older who&#xD;
      present to the hospital with stroke-like symptoms will be recruited within 24 hours of&#xD;
      symptom onset at participating clinical sites. Data will be obtained from the medical&#xD;
      records. Blood for research purposes will be obtained. Research evaluations for stroke&#xD;
      severity, symptoms and outcome will be performed by trained personnel. All clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and management will be per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the criterion standard stroke diagnosis. This will be&#xD;
      used to estimate the diagnostic test characteristics of a multi-omic biomarker profile in the&#xD;
      peripheral whole blood for distinguishing stroke (IS, TIA, SAH, ICH) versus non-stroke in ED&#xD;
      patients with acute neurologic symptoms. Secondly, the investigators will estimate the&#xD;
      ability of the multi-omic biomarker profile to differentiate between stroke subtypes. A&#xD;
      diagnosis of stroke will be defined as clinical syndromes consistent with stroke (i.e.,&#xD;
      sudden onset neurological deficit) plus imaging confirmation (or symptom resolution and lack&#xD;
      of imaging findings in TIA). Finally, the investigators will explore the relationship between&#xD;
      the multi-omic profile and time from symptom onset in ischemic stroke patients. Descriptive&#xD;
      and inferential statistics will be used to address the aims of the study. Pattern recognition&#xD;
      analysis and machine learning will be employed as a systems level approach to determine&#xD;
      relevant pathophysiologic pathways associated with diagnosis and symptom onset time.&#xD;

      Venous blood samples will be collected from all patients at baseline resulting in two 2.5 ml&#xD;
      Paxgene RNA tubes, two 8 ml EDTA tube, and one 7 ml serum tube. Approximately 28 ml of blood&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;

        A prospective consecutive sample of possible stroke cases will be recruited within 12 hours&#xD;
        of symptom onset. Final diagnoses may include: ischemic stroke (IS), TIA, aneurysmal&#xD;
        subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with or without&#xD;
        intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (or primary IVH), and stroke mimic (all other patients&#xD;
        presenting with acute onset stroke-like symptoms who do not have ischemic or hemorrhagic&#xD;
        stroke).&#xD;
