    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, multiple dose, varied administration regimen study&#xD;
      with 2 parts (Parts A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will utilize an ascending dose cohort design with sequential cohorts. Each cohort will&#xD;
      be evaluated by the DSMB for safety. Additional cohorts may be added by the DSMB to determine&#xD;
      doses of SB 9200 that exhibit significant antiviral response and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 80 subjects will be assigned sequentially to 1 of the following dosing cohorts&#xD;
      (20 subjects per cohort) and randomized in a 4:1 ratio (active:placebo) within each cohort.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified so that no more than 2 HBeAg positive subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SB 9200 25 mg or matching placebo administered qd&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SB 9200 50 mg or matching placebo administered qd&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SB 9200 100 mg or matching placebo administered qd&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SB 9200 200 mg or matching placebo administered qd&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, subjects will enter a Screening period, which will last&#xD;
      up to 28 days. Once all eligibility criteria are confirmed and the subject is randomized,&#xD;
      subjects will receive the IP or placebo as a 2-week supply of capsules/tablets. All&#xD;
      randomized subjects will receive the IP or matching placebo for a total of 12 weeks. All&#xD;
      subjects will then receive tenofovir 300 mg qd for an additional 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will start the treatment period on Day 1. The PK samples will be collected on Day 1&#xD;
      at predose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours (predose the following day). At Week 6, the&#xD;
      same sampling times will be used to collect PK samples from the subjects to collect steady&#xD;
      state PK data. Subjects will return biweekly for the entire 12-week IP treatment period,&#xD;
      except when beginning IP administration when subjects will be seen weekly, for safety&#xD;
      assessments including physical examination and laboratory sample analysis of chemistry,&#xD;
      hematology, and urine. Sample collection for efficacy (HBV DNA, HBsAg, HBeAg, hepatitis B&#xD;
      envelope antibody [HBeAb], HBV RNA, and HBV resistance) will be collected as indicated in the&#xD;
      Schedule of Events. A sample for genotyping will be collected at Day 1. Samples for Locarnini&#xD;
      biomarkers and other biomarkers will also occur at Day 1; Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 14; and at&#xD;
      the End of Study Visit. Samples for cytokine levels will be collected at Day 1, Week 6, and&#xD;
      Week 12. At Week 12, the end of IP administration, all subjects will return to the clinic and&#xD;
      be administered IP and 300 mg tenofovir. Samples will be collected to explore the potential&#xD;
      of a drug-drug interaction between SB 9200 and tenofovir. All subjects will have a predose PK&#xD;
      sample then take the last dose of IP/placebo together with their first dose of tenofovir. The&#xD;
      PK samples will then be collected for SB 9200 and tenofovir at 30 minutes,and 1, 2, 4, 6, and&#xD;
      24 hours. Thereafter, the subjects will receive only tenofovir 300 mg qd for an additional 12&#xD;
      weeks as 4-week supplies. All subjects will return to the clinic at Weeks 13, 14, 16, 20, and&#xD;
      24. Subjects will have safety assessments including symptom-directed physical examinations&#xD;
      and safety hematology, biochemistry, and virological studies performed at these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 24, all subjects will have completed the study Part A (or Part B, as applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will be an open-label, randomized, combination therapy design consisting of multiple&#xD;
      cohorts. The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral response&#xD;
      in subjects treated for 12 weeks with a dose of SB 9200 selected from Part A that exhibits&#xD;
      significant antiviral response and safety when administered in combination with tenofovir 300&#xD;
      mg qd (Cohort 1) or with tenofovir 300 mg qd monotherapy alone (Cohort 2). All subjects will&#xD;
      then continue in the study for an additional 12 weeks with tenofovir alone. Randomization&#xD;
      between the 2 initial cohorts will be conducted using a 3:1 ratio resulting in 30 subjects&#xD;
      being allocated to SB 9200 in combination with tenofovir (Cohort 1) and 10 subjects being&#xD;
      allocated to tenofovir monotherapy (Cohort 2). No cohort can enroll more than 60% of either&#xD;
      hepatitis e antigen negative or hepatitis e antigen positive subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will utilize an adaptive design. The first 2 cohorts of Part B may start concurrently&#xD;
      to Part A at any time after a dose has been selected from Part A. SB 9200 doses for which all&#xD;
      subjects have not completed the initial 12 weeks monotherapy of SB 9200 from Part A and&#xD;
      demonstrated safety of IP will not be selected to be administered in combination with&#xD;
      tenofovir during Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 2 cohorts will randomize concurrently using a 3:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 30 subjects will receive SB 9200 selected dose #1 from Part A administered in&#xD;
           combination with tenofovir 300 mg qd.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 10 subjects will receive tenofovir 300 mg qd monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of Part A completed and ongoing cohorts and Part B first cohort, up to 2&#xD;
      additional cohorts for which the dose of SB 9200 will be either escalated or de-escalated may&#xD;
      be opened to enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 30 subjects will receive SB 9200 selected dose #2 from Part A administered in&#xD;
           combination with tenofovir 300 mg qd.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: 30 subjects will receive SB 9200 selected dose #3 from Part A administered in&#xD;
           combination with tenofovir 300 mg qd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled into the Screening period, which will last up to 28 days. Once all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria are confirmed, subjects will receive the IP as a 2-week supply of&#xD;
      capsules/tablets and tenofovir as a 4-week supply. Subjects will be required to take the IP&#xD;
      per protocol for 12 weeks. Subjects will return biweekly for the entire 12-week IP treatment&#xD;
      period, except when beginning IP administration when subjects will be seen weekly, for safety&#xD;
      assessments including physical examination and laboratory sample analysis of chemistry,&#xD;
      hematology, and urine. Samples for Locarnini biomarkers will also occur at Day 1; Weeks 2, 4,&#xD;
      6, 12, and 14; and at the End of Study Visit. Sample collection for cytokine levels and other&#xD;
      biomarkers of immune response and plasma samples will also occur at predose on Day 1 and at&#xD;
      Weeks 6,12 and 24. The PK samples will be collected on Day 1 at predose, 30 minutes, and 1,&#xD;
      2, 4, 6, and 24 hours (predose the following day). At Week 12, the same sampling times will&#xD;
      be used to collect PK samples from the subjects to collect steady state PK data. Sample&#xD;
      collection for population PK analysis will also be collected before IP administration at&#xD;
      Weeks 4 and 8. Urinary PK will be collected on Day 1 and Week 12 predose, 6 hours, and 24&#xD;
      hours (predose the following day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 12, all subjects will be administered tenofovir 300 mg qd for an additional 12 weeks&#xD;
      as 4-week supplies. All subjects will return to the clinic at Weeks 13, 14, 16, 20, and 24.&#xD;
      Subjects will have safety assessments including symptom-directed physical examinations and&#xD;
      safety hematology, biochemistry, and virological studies performed at these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety reporting for each subject in each cohort will continue after the subject first&#xD;
      consents to participate in the study through the 24 week duration of the study or through the&#xD;
      Extension Period until 30 days after the last dose is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 24, all subjects will have completed the study Part A (or Part B, as applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any subject who completes Part A or Part B may be eligible to take part in a 12-month&#xD;
      Extension Period. Before any study-related procedures are performed, the subjects will have&#xD;
      all study procedures explained to them, including information regarding the nature of the&#xD;
      study, and subjects must sign an informed consent/assent form. During the Extension Period,&#xD;
      subjects will receive tenofovir and return for visits every 3 months with laboratory tests of&#xD;
      liver function and virological efficacy including HBsAg, HBeAg, HBeAb, and HBV DNA. No&#xD;
      further study-related testing will be performed. Subjects who undergo full termination from&#xD;
      the study during Part A or Part B will not be eligible to enroll into the extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety reporting for each subject in each cohort will continue after the subject first&#xD;
      consents to participate in the study through the 24-week duration of the study or through the&#xD;
      Extension Period until 30 days after the last dose is administered.&#xD;

             evaluation for possible malignancy are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or neurological disease&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Received within 3 months of Screening or expected to receive prolonged therapy with&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Any medical condition, in the opinion of the Investigator, that could interfere with&#xD;
             evaluation of the study objectives or safety of the subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for Extension Period Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion&#xD;
        criteria are not to be enrolled into the Extension Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any condition, comorbidity, or laboratory abnormality that, based on the package&#xD;
             insert of tenofovir or in the opinion of the Investigator, excludes the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who were withdrawn from Part A or Part B due to an AE or serious adverse&#xD;
