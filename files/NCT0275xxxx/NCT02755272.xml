  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy&#xD;
      (carboplatin and gemcitabine) is safe and effective in treating patients with metastatic&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a drug which may help the immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma and&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, it has not been approved as a treatment for&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
