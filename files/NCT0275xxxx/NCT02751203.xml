      Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death for young children in the United States&#xD;
      (U.S.) and is responsible for more child deaths than they next three causes combined, that&#xD;
      is, homicide, suicide, and cancer. Each year approximately 9,000 children die, 250,000 are&#xD;
      hospitalized and more than 9,000,000 children are treated in emergency departments for&#xD;
      preventable injuries. Child and adolescent unintentional injury deaths have not declined to&#xD;
      the same extent that other diseases have, and resources directed at reducing child injury are&#xD;
      not commensurate with the burden it poses. More than 50% of these injuries occur in and&#xD;
      around the home, where young children spend most of their time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike diseases such as cancer, there is no need to wait on a cure...there already is one.&#xD;
      Many of these injuries can be prevented through the use of safety equipment and by following&#xD;
      safety recommendations. Using known, effective countermeasures can prevent or reduce the&#xD;
      consequences of a child being injured yet these devices are not routinely utilized. Barriers&#xD;
      related to identifying hazards, finding credible information and recommendations, and&#xD;
      obtaining the safety products best-suited to the features of your home make creating a safe&#xD;
      home challenging for caregivers. Interventions for increasing home safety behaviors have&#xD;
      ranged from educational materials, health care provider counseling, safety product&#xD;
      distribution, hands-on experiential learning in a safety resource center--these have all been&#xD;
      evaluated with varying degrees of effectiveness, however, wide-reaching interventions to&#xD;
      reach large/substantial caregiver audiences, are needed. Offering tailored safety information&#xD;
      on multiple topics via a single platform, combined with the ability to acquire safety&#xD;
      devices, is a more efficient means to reach a large segment of the population and may help&#xD;
      reduce the aforementioned barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there is an urgent need for mobile technologies to reduce barriers by helping parents&#xD;
      identify injury hazards in their homes, consolidate credible injury prevention&#xD;
      recommendations, organize information by room or feature, tailor by child age, facilitate the&#xD;
      acquisition and installation of safety products, encourage and track progress, thereby&#xD;
      increasing the likelihood that parents accomplish these important life-saving safety tasks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death for young children in the United States&#xD;
      (U.S.) and is responsible for more child deaths than the next three causes combined, that is,&#xD;
      homicide, suicide and cancer. Each year approximately 9,000 children die, 250,000 are&#xD;
      hospitalized and more than 9,000,000 children are treated in emergency departments for&#xD;
      preventable injuries (at a cost of around $87 billion in medical and societal costs). Child&#xD;
      and adolescent unintentional injury deaths have not declined to the same extent as other&#xD;
      diseases have, and resources directed at reducing child injury are not commensurate with the&#xD;
      burden it poses. More than 50% of these injuries occur in and around the home, where young&#xD;
      children spend most of their time. Common causes of fatal and non-fatal unintentional&#xD;
      childhood injuries include: fires and burns, falls, drowning, poisoning, and suffocation. For&#xD;
      example, residential fires account for nearly 90 percent of all fire-related deaths. Almost&#xD;
      13,000 children are injured by TV tip-overs each year. Medications are the leading causes of&#xD;
      child poisoning. Finally, other home hazards include bunk beds, high chairs, windows, stoves&#xD;
      and ovens, button batteries, laundry packets, and toys-ubiquitous products and home features&#xD;
      present in nearly every U.S. home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike diseases such as cancer, there is no need to wait on a cure...there already is one.&#xD;
      Many of the injuries can be prevented through the use of safety equipment and by following&#xD;
      safety recommendations. Using known, effective countermeasures, namely, smoke alarms, carbon&#xD;
      monoxide detectors, stair gates, cabinet locks and latches, and anchoring TV and furniture&#xD;
      can prevent or reduce the consequences of a child being injured. Unfortunately, overall the&#xD;
      rates for these safety behaviors vary/are low (add a citation). Barriers related to&#xD;
      identifying hazards, finding credible information and recommendations, and obtaining the&#xD;
      safety products best-suited to the features of a home make creating a safe home difficult for&#xD;
      parents and caregivers. Interventions for increasing home safety behaviors have ranged from&#xD;
      the provision of educational materials, to health care provider counseling, safety product&#xD;
      distribution, hands-on experiential learning provided in safety resource centers have been&#xD;
      evaluated (with varying degrees of effectiveness), however, wide-reaching interventions, to&#xD;
      reach large/substantial parent and caregiver audiences, are needed. Offering tailored safety&#xD;
      information on multiple topics via a single platform, combined with the ability to acquire&#xD;
      safety devices, is a more efficient means to reach a large segment of the population and may&#xD;
      help reduce the aforementioned barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus there is an urgent need for mobile technologies-that is, programs using mobile phone or&#xD;
      tablet, including apps and text messaging, or portable devices to deliver an intervention-to&#xD;
      reduce barriers by helping parents identify injury hazards in their homes, consolidate&#xD;
      credible injury prevention recommendations, organize information by room or feature, tailor&#xD;
      by child age, facilitate the acquisition and installation of safety products, encourage and&#xD;
      track progress, thereby increasing the likelihood that parents accomplish these important and&#xD;
      life-saving safety tasks. Our long-term goal is to prevent or reduce the consequences of&#xD;
      home-related child injuries. The overall objective of this proposed research, which is the&#xD;
      next step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to preliminarily evaluate a mobile&#xD;
      technology-based health behavior change intervention, the Make Safe Happen® app, for&#xD;
      improving knowledge and behavior for the prevention of unintentional child injuries. Our&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that parents will have increased safety knowledge and more safety&#xD;
      behaviors (self-reported and observed), and higher behavioral intention to make their homes&#xD;
      safer after utilizing the Make Safe Happen® app compared to a control group. The rationale&#xD;
      that underlies the proposed research is derived from the Health Belief Model (HBM) which&#xD;
      explains that an individual's perceptions of a threat posed by a health problem&#xD;
      (susceptibility, severity), the benefits of avoiding the threat (perceived benefits), and&#xD;
      factors influencing the decision to act (barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy) effect&#xD;
      their decision about whether to take action to avoid injury or illness (National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute 2005). The investigators plan to objectively test our central hypothesis and,&#xD;
      thereby, attain the objective of this application by pursuing the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Determine whether a mobile technology-based health behavior change&#xD;
      intervention, the Make Safe Happen® app is effective in improving safety knowledge for the&#xD;
      prevention of unintentional child home-related injuries, compared with no intervention. Our&#xD;
      working hypothesis is that parents and caregivers receiving the intervention will have&#xD;
      greater safety knowledge than parents and caregivers in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Determine whether a mobile technology-based health behavior change&#xD;
      intervention, the Make Safe Happen® app is effective in increasing behavioral intention for&#xD;
      the prevention of unintentional child home-related injuries, compared with no intervention or&#xD;
      alternate interventions. Our working hypothesis is that parents and caregivers reporting&#xD;
      higher behavioral intention will be more likely to complete tasks related to &quot;childproofing&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;safety proofing&quot; their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3. Preliminarily investigate whether a mobile technology-based health behavior&#xD;
      change intervention, the Make Safe Happen® app is effective in improving safety behaviors,&#xD;
      acquisition and use of safety devices for the prevention of unintentional child home-related&#xD;
      injuries, compared with no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Exploratory Sub-Aims Sub-aim #1. Evaluate race and ethnicity as a potentially&#xD;
      important modifier of the impact of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-aim #2: Evaluate household income as a potentially important modifier of the impact of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-aim #3: notifications [NOTE: if app use period is only 1 week long, they will not&#xD;
      naturally receive notifications as they are currently proposed] Sub-aim #4: e-health literacy&#xD;
      (defined as the ability to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from&#xD;
      electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health&#xD;
      problem)(Norman and Skinner 2006)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that these aims will yield the following expected outcomes. First, the&#xD;
      investigators expect to determine the effect of the intervention on parents' safety&#xD;
      knowledge, thereby demonstrating the utility of a mobile app for future unintentional child&#xD;
      home-related injury prevention. Second, the investigators expect to learn whether the&#xD;
      intervention increases behavioral intention to complete home safety behaviors and safety&#xD;
      device acquisition. Third, the investigators will explore whether the intervention increases&#xD;
      safety behaviors, acquisition and use of safety devices. In an exploratory aim the&#xD;
      investigators will begin to assess whether the intervention is adopted differently among&#xD;
      parents of varying races/ethnicities, which will suggest opportunities for tailoring the&#xD;
      intervention to maximize its impact. Next, the investigators will have established a link&#xD;
      between parents' behavioral intention related to home injury prevention behaviors and device&#xD;
      use, which will inform future prevention efforts and expansion of the Make Safe Happen®&#xD;
      program and app. Finally, the investigators will provide new insights into the synergism&#xD;
      between caring for young children and providing them a safe home environment free of hazards.&#xD;
      These outcomes are expected to have an important positive impact because providing a safe&#xD;
      home environment has the potential to prevent or reduce unintentional child injuries and&#xD;
      deaths, as will now be detailed in the next section.&#xD;
