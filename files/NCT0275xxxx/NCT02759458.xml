  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate a new anchor for rotator cuff repair, the&#xD;
      Smith &amp; Nephew Healicoil anchor. This anchor utilizes a small open-construct design to&#xD;
      promote bone-in growth and potentially allow for the release of bone marrow factors into the&#xD;
      repair site. In vivo ovine studies comparing the Arthrex BioComposite Corkscrew FT rotator&#xD;
      cuff anchor to the Arthrex SwivelLock anchor have shown superior bone in-growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study consists of three separate aims in order to clinically and biochemically&#xD;
      investigate the capabilities of the Healicoil anchor and its efficacy in rotator cuff repair.&#xD;
      One, evaluate the bone in growth of the anchor compared to a standard poly-ether ether ketone&#xD;
      (PEEK) anchor. Two, analyze the marrow elements that are released into the repair site&#xD;
      through the open construct. Three, compare the functional outcomes of patients with rotator&#xD;
      cuff repairs using the Healicoil anchor compared to a traditional Twinfix PEEK anchor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A great deal of research has been devoted to determining optimal techniques for rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair, a common orthopedic procedure. Current repair techniques involve the use of suture&#xD;
      anchors or transosseous tunnels, with the goal of reattaching the torn tendon to the anatomic&#xD;
      insertion of the rotator cuff. There are a multitude of different repair constructs and&#xD;
      anchor designs available. For example, some surgeons utilize a single row of suture anchors&#xD;
      for repair, whereas others will use two rows of anchors in a &quot;double row&quot; construct. A&#xD;
      variety of anchors are also available; some are loaded with suture and require knot tying,&#xD;
      and others can be used in a &quot;knotless&quot; technique. Regardless, time zero stability of the&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair is essential, but ideal anchor or construct has yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time zero stability immediately after the rotator cuff repair is important, however,&#xD;
      contemporary research has also focused on the cascade that influences biologic healing of&#xD;
      these rotator cuff repairs and if augmentation can improve functional results. Specifically,&#xD;
      various authors have looked at the cytokines, growth factors and stem cells involved in the&#xD;
      process. The question remains of what role these factors play and whether there are&#xD;
      techniques that can facilitate their use and improve healing of rotator cuff repairs. Data&#xD;
      exists in a animal models that does show that some of these growth factors can improve tendon&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a prospective randomized trial of 40 patients undergoing&#xD;
      arthroscopic repair of full thickness rotator cuff tears. Patients will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of two groups; the Healicoil anchor vs standard 5.5 PEEK anchor. Follow-up will take place at&#xD;
      6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after rotator cuff repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the operative procedure bone marrow aspirate from the drill hole used for the&#xD;
      anchors will be sent for analysis. At the 6 month mark patients will get a computer&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan in order to determine the amount of ingrowth within the anchor. Finally,&#xD;
      the outcome scores within the first year will be recorded. This data will result in the&#xD;
      publication of three separate studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Growth factor and stem cell analysis at the time of the operative procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT ingrowth of the Healicoil anchor at 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical outcomes of patients with rotator cuff repair using the Healicoil anchor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are determined clinically to have a full thickness rotator cuff tear and who&#xD;
      elect to have surgery will be invited to participate in this study. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained pre-operatively in the office setting. A physical examination of both shoulders will&#xD;
      be conducted, and all patients will complete a shoulder survey in order to determine baseline&#xD;
      values for the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder&#xD;
      Score (ASES), University California, Los Angeles activity score (UCLA), and Constant scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized into one of two study groups at the time of surgery.&#xD;
      Enrollment will continue until 20 patients are in each group. Participants in the control&#xD;
      group will undergo rotator cuff repair utilizing 5.5mm full thread Twinfix PK anchors for&#xD;
      tendon fixation. Those in the experimental group will undergo the same procedure, but with&#xD;
      the use of Smith &amp; Nephew Healicoil anchors. Participants will be blinded as to the&#xD;
      anchor-type received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard rotator cuff repair will be completed utilizing a medial row Healicoil and a&#xD;
      lateral row PEEK anchor. At the time of drilling for the anchors, bone marrow aspirate will&#xD;
      be collected by turning off the water and using a large gauge biopsy needle to aspirate the&#xD;
      contents of the drill hole. The anchors will then be placed. The aspiration process is then&#xD;
      repeated and a smaller gauge needle will be used to aspirate within the open construct of the&#xD;
      Healicoil anchor. All material will be sent to the laboratory of Dr. Chubinskaya for&#xD;
      immediate analysis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IGF-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FGF-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMP-7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMP-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PDGF-CHAIN A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PDGF-CHAIN B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VEGF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgical rotator cuff repair, all patients will return for routine post-operative&#xD;
      follow-up at 6 weeks, 6 months, and one year. The 6 week visit will involve a clinical exam&#xD;
      and assessment of shoulder range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6 month and 1 year visits, patients will complete the subjective and objective outcome&#xD;
      measures and have a physical examination of both shoulders by a member of the research team.&#xD;
      Subject participation will last approximately 30 minutes. Subjective and objective measures&#xD;
      will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shoulder Survey - including SANE, VAS, ASES, Constant score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shoulder physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shoulder Survey may be collected by paper or electronically using OBERD (Rush approved&#xD;
      repository - ORA #12042506). The shoulder Survey data which was collected up to 30 days&#xD;
      before the time of surgery will be sued as baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Scanning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6 month follow up visit patients will undergo a directed CT scan of the affected&#xD;
      humeral head only. The scan will provide 1 mm cuts through the humeral head greater&#xD;
      tuberosity (site of anchor) only. This will limit the amount of radiation exposure to the&#xD;
      patient and will provide the necessary data. Previous authors have shown that this technique&#xD;
      can make the radiation exposure to the patient roughly equivalent to a standard chest xray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These CT scans will be evaluated for the presence of bone within the confines of the anchor.&#xD;
      One mm scanning will allow for quantitative volume analysis of the bone present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be obtained for the age at time of surgery, physical examination&#xD;
      findings, range of motion, standardized scores, bone marrow growth factor analysis, and bone&#xD;
      in-growth as evaluated by CT scan. The statistical analysis will be conducted at a p level of&#xD;
      &lt; .05. Statistical tests that will be used to obtain inferential statistics of findings&#xD;
      include paired t-tests and ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geoffrey S. Van Thiel, MD, MBA and Scott W. Trenhaile, MD are collaborating investigators at&#xD;
      Rockford Orthopedics in Rockford, Illinois, Rush will subcontract with Rockford Orthopedics&#xD;
      to enroll subjects, treat per study protocol and do follow-up visits. The bone marrow&#xD;
      analysis of Rockford subjects will be done here at Rush. Rockford Orthopedics will use their&#xD;
      local IRB for the study.&#xD;
