    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well venetoclax and ibrutinib work in treating patients with&#xD;
      chronic or small lymphocytic leukemia. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving venetoclax and&#xD;
      ibrutinib may help control chronic or small lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate therapeutic activity (best response [complete response (CR)/complete response&#xD;
      with incomplete recovery (CRi)]) of combined ibrutinib and venetoclax in patients with&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of this combination strategy. II. To estimate the time to best&#xD;
      response with this combination. III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To test pharmacodynamic endpoints and molecular interactions between these two drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the therapeutic activity (best response [CR/CRi]) in subgroups of patients&#xD;
      defined by immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) mutation or fluorescence in situ&#xD;
      hybridization (FISH) subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study immunological and molecular changes in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow&#xD;
      in response to ibrutinib and venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Beginning on day 1 of&#xD;
      cycle 4, patients also receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 27 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      with residual disease or who are positive for minimal residual disease (MRD) after cycle 27&#xD;
      may continue treatment with ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.&#xD;
