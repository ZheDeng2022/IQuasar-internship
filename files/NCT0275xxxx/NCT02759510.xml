      Since 2011, phenylephrine was recommended as the preferred drug to maintain blood pressure in&#xD;
      obstetric anesthesia.Phenylephrine, an α adrenoceptor agonist, can induce peripheral&#xD;
      vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure, while reflexly decrease heart rate and result in&#xD;
      cardiac output (CO) reduction.Norepinephrine acts not only as an α adrenoceptor receptor&#xD;
      agonist, but also as a weaker β adrenergic receptor agonist. It can elevate blood pressure&#xD;
      the same asphenylephrine, meanwhile produce positive inotropic effect including increasing&#xD;
      heart rate.Thus, the administration of norepinephrine can maintain blood pressue and avoid&#xD;
      the decline of CO. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of norepinephrine and&#xD;
      phenylephrine on maternal CO in cesarean section by transesophageal echocardiography.&#xD;

      Combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) is a commonly used anesthetic methods in cesarean&#xD;
      section. The main problem of CSEA is hypotension, which will cause maternal nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, reduced uteroplacental blood flow and fetal acidosis. One of the important methods&#xD;
      for prevention and treatment of hypotension after CSEA is to give vasoactive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2011, phenylephrine was recommended as the preferred drug to maintain blood pressure in&#xD;
      obstetric anesthesia.Phenylephrine, an α adrenoceptor agonist, can induce peripheral&#xD;
      vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure, while reflexly decrease heart rate and result in&#xD;
      cardiac output (CO) reduction.Dyer et al. used bioimpedance technique to analyze the&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes in normal pregnant women. A bolus of 80 ug phenylephrine was&#xD;
      administrated when maternal mean arterial pressure decreased 20% after CSEA. It was found&#xD;
      that cardiac output (CO) decreased significantly (14%) after phenylephrine&#xD;
      administrationcompared with the baseline.And the decrease of CO induced by phenylephrine was&#xD;
      in a dose dependent.All the studies referred above recruitednormal pregnant women, and the&#xD;
      decreased CO did not have an adverse effect on neonatal birth. However, as we all know, the&#xD;
      decrease of CO will influence uteroplacental blood, which may lead to adverse results in&#xD;
      existed intrauterine distress fetal. All authors of those studies stressed that the decrease&#xD;
      of CO induced by phenylephrine may increase the risks of fetal distress or other adverse&#xD;
      consequences. So, it is crucial for obstetric anesthesiologist to choose a suitable&#xD;
      vasoactive drugs, which can maintain both maternal blood pressure and uteroplacental&#xD;
      perfusion in order to keep intrauterine environment steady.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Norepinephrine acts not only as an α adrenoceptor receptor agonist, but also as a weaker β&#xD;
      adrenergic receptor agonist. It can elevate blood pressure the same asphenylephrine,&#xD;
      meanwhile produce positive inotropic effect including increasing heart rate.Thus, the&#xD;
      administration of norepinephrine can maintain blood pressue and avoid the decline of CO. And&#xD;
      norepinephrine is superior to phenylephrine in the respect of organ perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little research about the administration of norepinephrine in obstetric&#xD;
      anesthesia.Ngan Kee et al.compared phenylephrine (0.57μg/kg/min) with norepinephrine&#xD;
      (0.035μg/kg/min) in the treatment of hypotension in obstetric anesthesia. CO monitored by a&#xD;
      suprasternal Doppler ultrasound every 5 minutes. CO and heart rate was significantly higher&#xD;
      in norepinephrine group than that in phenylephrine group, while peripheral vascular&#xD;
      resistance was significantly lower in norepinephrine group than that in phenylephrine group.&#xD;
      And the oxygen content in umbilical venous was significantly higher in norepinephrine group,&#xD;
      which may be related to the norepinephrine induced lower peripheral vascular resistance and&#xD;
      high cardiac output.Monitoring of CO can give a comprehensive understanding of hemodynamics&#xD;
      in the pregnant. It enables obstetric anesthesiologist to use liquid expansion rationally and&#xD;
      administrate vasoactive agents properly.Although the accuracy of suprasternal Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound was high in that study, the interval of 5min to monitor CO may miss the rapid&#xD;
      changes in hemodynamics of pregnant women.In the present study, we will monitor CO&#xD;
      continuously by a small diameter (6 mm) transesophageal echocardiography, which can be&#xD;
      retained in the patient's esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of norepinephrine and phenylephrine on&#xD;
      maternal CO in cesarean section by transesophageal echocardiography.Fetal umbilical cord&#xD;
      blood, neonatal 1min Apgar score, 5 min Apgar scores and neonatal plasma catecholamine&#xD;
      concentrations will be collected to understand the effects of norepinephrine and&#xD;
      phenylephrine on fetal.&#xD;
