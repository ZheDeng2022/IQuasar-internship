  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide evidence of efficacy, generalization of&#xD;
      these results to patients in the real-world setting is challenging, given RCTs are conducted&#xD;
      in highly selected patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An understanding of the effectiveness of approved cancer therapies in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice is essential in order to optimize the management of these patients and to identify&#xD;
      treatment and monitoring gaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first Canadian study to describe real-world treatment patterns/sequencing,&#xD;
      effectiveness and monitoring for men and pre/postmenopausal HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. This registry incorporates an observational prospective cohort design and will&#xD;
      enroll 500 men and pre/postmenopausal HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer women that have been&#xD;
      exposed to endocrine therapy (ET) or ET in combination with targeted therapy (TT) including&#xD;
      patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy combinations..&#xD;

        tamoxifen or toremifene and age &lt; 60, then FSH and plasma estradiol levels should be in&#xD;
        postmenopausal range per local normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        6. Patient having received maximum one prior chemotherapy line for advanced/metastatic&#xD;

&#xD;
        Note: A chemotherapy line in advanced disease is an anticancer regimen(s) that contains at&#xD;
        least 1 cytotoxic chemotherapy agent and given for 21 days or longer. If a cytotoxic&#xD;
        chemotherapy regimen was discontinued for a reason other than disease progression and&#xD;
        lasted less than 21 days, then this regimen does not count as a &quot;prior line of&#xD;
        chemotherapy&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patient receiving targeted therapy plus endocrine therapy (ET+TT) in either the 1st, 2nd&#xD;

        metastatic setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. as per approved Health Canada indication OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. as per available expanded treatment protocol(s) only if efficacy assessments in these&#xD;
             protocols are considered routine standard of care OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. as per available compassionate / expanded access program&#xD;
&#xD;
             Notes: 1. Date of initiation of treatment should be a maximum of 12 months prior to&#xD;
             the date of enrollment in this study for patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy&#xD;
             based combinations. Date of initiation of treatment should be a maximum of 1 month&#xD;
             prior to the date of enrollment in this study for patients receiving all other&#xD;
             endocrine monotherapies or combination therapies. 2. 1st, 2nd and 3rd line therapy in&#xD;
             the advanced setting is defined as the first, second and third treatment received&#xD;
             respectively in the metastatic setting (which could include endocrine monotherapy,&#xD;
             targeted therapy combination with endocrine therapy or chemotherapy). 3. 3. Patients&#xD;
             enrolled in the ET cohort must have received a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor for&#xD;
             advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Patients who have received two subsequent lines of&#xD;

                  (however patient could have received up to one line of chemotherapy in the&#xD;
                  metastatic setting prior to study entry or as a subsequent therapy after&#xD;
                  completion of ET or ET+TT treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient having received more than 3 lines of therapy in the metastatic setting.&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. Patient is undergoing any treatment that is not considered standard of care as&#xD;
                  per regional policies and guidelines with the exception of treatments accessed&#xD;
