  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) is a rare genetic disorder, which affects&#xD;
      boys. It is a primary immunodeficiency disorder which results from an inability of the white&#xD;
      blood cells called phagocytic cells (or phagocytes) to kill invading bacteria and fungi.&#xD;
      These cells have difficulty forming the free radicals (most importantly the superoxide&#xD;
      radical due to defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex) which are important in the killing&#xD;
      of ingested pathogens. In X-CGD (which accounts for two thirds of CGD patients), the defect&#xD;
      lies in a gene which makes up a critical part of the NADPH-oxidase complex (the catalytic&#xD;
      subunit; gp91-phox protein). Therefore they kill bacteria and fungi poorly, and the patients&#xD;
      suffer from severe and recurrent infections. This also results in inflammation which can&#xD;
      damage parts of the body such as the lung and gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many cases, patients can be adequately protected from infection by constant intake of&#xD;
      antibiotics. However, in others, severe life-threatening infections break through. In some&#xD;
      cases, inflammation in the bowel or urinary systems results in blockages which cannot be&#xD;
      treated with antibiotics, and which may require the use of other drugs such as steroids.&#xD;
      Development of curative treatments for CGD is therefore of great importance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male X-CGD patients &gt;23 months of age. Youngest patients (&gt;1 month and ≤ 23 months)&#xD;
             may be enrolled at physician's appreciation; in this case mobilization of peripheral&#xD;
             HSC may be replaced by two bone marrow harvests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Molecular diagnosis confirmed by DNA sequencing and supported by laboratory evidence&#xD;
             for absent or reduction &gt; 70% of the biochemical activity of the NAHPD-oxidase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one ongoing or resistant or at high risk of relapse severe infection and/or&#xD;
             inflammatory complications requiring hospitalisation despite conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No HLA-matched donor available after 3 months search, unless the risk of waiting for a&#xD;
