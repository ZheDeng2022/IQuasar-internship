      In this study the investigators will advance research on the development of easy to use&#xD;
      technologies to empower patients. This is a scalable approach that has a significant&#xD;
      potential to reduce suffering for palliative care patients and their caregivers. The&#xD;
      investigators will adapt existing tested empathic conversational agents (ECA) for home-based&#xD;
      cancer care management and inpatient bedside counseling to provide the following functions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. medication counseling;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. physical activity promotion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. symptom management and continual screening for adverse events; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. alleviation of stress and anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. spiritual needs assessment; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. advanced care planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the system will be monitored by a health professional, who communicates with&#xD;
      members of the patient's care team. In this project, this activity will include facilitating&#xD;
      referral for palliative care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct pilot studies both at Boston Medical Center and at&#xD;
      Northeastern University that will test system usability (Northeastern University and BMC) as&#xD;
      well as interview burden (BMC only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) to evaluate the agent&#xD;
      technology, comparing usual care (UC) versus usual care plus the agent (UC+ECA) for patients&#xD;
      21 or older, with a life expectancy of &lt; 1 year, from outpatient clinics at Boston Medical&#xD;
      Center (BMC). Each subject will be enrolled along with a caregiver surrogate subject. In&#xD;
      addition to baseline data collection, there will be monthly phone surveys for six months;&#xD;
      intervention subjects will use the system for a six-month period of time. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a randomized trial within the intervention group to compare&#xD;
      subjects getting functions 1-4 (above) versus subjects getting the augmented intervention&#xD;
      with all six functions. The intervention will include a nurse management interface to monitor&#xD;
      clinical alerts generated by the system to stimulate interventions by the clinical staff.&#xD;

      Pilot Study The pilot study will determine usability of the ECA tablet system. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be recruited at Northeastern University, where the system is being developed.&#xD;
      Subjects will spend approximately 60 minutes with the tablet system and provide usability&#xD;
      feedback. Twelve healthy patient volunteers will be recruited to review the system as well as&#xD;
      provide feedback on the relative interview burden (was the interview too long, too invasive,&#xD;
      etc). No identifiable data will be collected from pilot study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study The study will consist of adults with advanced illness (health care provider&#xD;
      endorses the existence of a potentially life-limiting condition and endorses that &quot;it would&#xD;
      not be a surprise if the patient died within 12 months&quot;) who will be randomized to&#xD;
      intervention or usual care control groups. Each person with an advanced illness will be&#xD;
      enrolled along with a caregiver (i.e., family, friend) who will serve as a surrogate subject.&#xD;
      The caregiver will be consented at baseline and interviewed at that point and at the final,&#xD;
      6-month study visit. In addition, if, at any point during their enrollment in the study, the&#xD;
      patient-subject becomes unable, or decisionally impaired, to answer interview questions, the&#xD;
      caregiver will be asked to answer on behalf of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient can be found to be decisionally impaired in any of 3 ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the patient declares themselves to be unable to answer questions appropriately&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the patient is unable to pass a brief cognitive assessment that will be administered at&#xD;
           the beginning of each telephone follow-up (per the Brief Screen for Cognitive&#xD;
           Impairment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the patient is physically unable to answer questions on the phone (due to, for example,&#xD;
           serious health decline or death)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected after enrollment and before randomization. Baseline data&#xD;
      includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. sociodemographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality of life as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of&#xD;
           Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Palliative Care&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Mental Health&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Social Health&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient Activation Measure (PAM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire (PMAQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Spiritual Needs Assessment for Patients (SNAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Community Healthy Activity Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. a survey of Advance Care Planning (ACP) communication and preferences&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. BSCI (This cognitive assessment is non-exclusionary, but, if the patient scores &quot;0&quot; on&#xD;
           the word recall, the designated caregiver/surrogate will be asked to act as the research&#xD;
           proxy and answer questions for the patient-subject.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also interview the surrogate subject at baseline regarding their level&#xD;
      of caregiver stress with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the CarerQol-7D&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the caregiver's level of happiness (CarerQol-VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. self-rated burden (SRB) of care giving After the initial visit, study staff will&#xD;
           administer 5 monthly phone surveys (months 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), where the EORTC&#xD;
           QLQ-C15-PAL will be collected. At the beginning of each data collection point study&#xD;
           staff will administer the Brief Survey of Cognitive Impairment (BSCI) to determine if&#xD;
           the patient is cognitively able to answer questions, and also inquire about unplanned&#xD;
           health care utilization (i.e., urgent care, emergency room, hospital observation visits,&#xD;
           and hospital admissions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final, 6-month visit, the patient-subject will be interviewed in person, with the&#xD;
      surrogate, and the full list of instruments will be administered. In addition, study staff&#xD;
      will prepare a summary data report for the patient's clinical team. The report will include&#xD;
      obtaining information from the Palliative Care service. The research staff will ask the&#xD;
      subject which clinicians of theirs they would like to have receive this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to the intervention will be given a mini-tablet computer configured for&#xD;
      the purposes of this study. A research assistant will set up the tablet, enroll subjects into&#xD;
      the study database, and train these subjects in the use of the system. Subjects who do not&#xD;
      have existing WiFi at home will be provided with a cellular-based router. In such cases,&#xD;
      study staff will arrange the WiFi service plan, install the router in the home, and confirm&#xD;
      connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimate that in many instances, when a clinician endorses that they would&#xD;
      not be surprised if their patient died within 12 months, that this would be the first time&#xD;
      they solidified a prognostic outlook in their minds for that patient. Stimulating clinicians&#xD;
      to consider their patient's life-expectancy is itself a form of intervention, as this may&#xD;
      instigate communication about prognosis with the patient, a re-evaluation of the treatment&#xD;
      course, assessment of goals of care, and an improved level of attention to symptoms. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct informational sessions about the study and provide material about&#xD;
      palliative care services in each outpatient clinical environment from which subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Information will be provided on how clinicians can contact the Palliative Care&#xD;
      service to obtain consultation. Clinicians will be encouraged to call for assistance on&#xD;
      palliative care needs for intervention subjects, usual care subjects, and non-subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same measures collected at baseline will also be collected at the final 6-month&#xD;
      interview. At the end of study participation the investigators will also prepare a summary&#xD;
      data report for the patient's clinical team. The report will include information on obtaining&#xD;
      consultation from the Palliative Care service. The research nurse will ask the subject which&#xD;
      clinicians of theirs they would like to have receive this information.&#xD;
