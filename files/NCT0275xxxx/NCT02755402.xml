  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are overrepresented among hepatitis C infected patients, but&#xD;
      underrepresented among those who are treated, despite many studies showing that treatment is&#xD;
      feasible and effective in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hepatitis C diagnosis and pre-treatment evaluation are multistep processes. Every step is&#xD;
      a potential occasion for disengagement and loss to follow-up. This is especially true with&#xD;
      hard-to-reach populations such as PWID in whom competing needs are numerous and psychosocial&#xD;
      situation can change rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using new technologies that can quickly provide clinical results, like Xpert HCV Viral&#xD;
      Load (Cepheid) and transient elastography (fibroscan), a provider could determine if a&#xD;
      patient needs treatment rapidly or not on the day of the initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore whether an accelerated pre-treatment evaluation can&#xD;
      result in an improved linkage-to-care (defined as linkage to health care, addiction or social&#xD;
      services) and, eventually, linkage-to-treatment among PWID.&#xD;

      This is a non-randomized, open-label study that aims to include HCV-infected patients who&#xD;
      inject drugs and who do not know their treatment eligibility status. A total of 200 patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated using our rapid evaluation protocol, which will include basic blood tests,&#xD;
      viral load measurement using Cepheid's Xpert® HCV Viral Load technique (which will be&#xD;
      controlled at the same time by COBAS® AmpliPrep/ COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Quantitative Test,&#xD;
      version 2.0 (Roche), available at the CHUM and approved by Health Canada), a liver fibrosis&#xD;
      assessment and HCV genotyping. The results of the basic tests, viral load tests and&#xD;
      FibroScan® test will be available on the same day as the patient's visit and will allow the&#xD;
      investigator to determine straightaway whether or not the patient is treatable based on the&#xD;
      RAMQ's reimbursement criteria at the time of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is treatable, once the genotype result has been obtained, the most appropriate&#xD;
      treatment for their medical condition, degree of liver fibrosis and genotype will be&#xD;
      prescribed. There will be no other visits between the initial visit and the treatment&#xD;
      initiation visit. The patient will be given an appointment for the treatment initiation visit&#xD;
      once the medication has been approved by the RAMQ or the patient's private insurer. The&#xD;
      patient will be seen again at weeks 2 and 4 of treatment, at the end of treatment (usually&#xD;
      week 12), then 12, 24 and 36 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is not treatable, he/she will be referred to the CHUM Addiction Medicine&#xD;
      Clinic or the UHRESS (if HIV-coinfected status) for management, which will include&#xD;
      longitudinal follow-up of his HCV and substance abuse. The patient will be seen again at 6&#xD;
      months and 1 year to determine whether or not there has been linkage-to-care, initiation of&#xD;
      opioid substitution therapy if indicated and if the patient has reduced his injection drug&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an untreatable patient becomes treatable during follow-up, treatment will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, we will review the records of patients seen at the CHUM Addiction Medicine&#xD;
      Clinic between October 2014 and June 2016 who meet the inclusion criteria for the study&#xD;
      cohort and the RAMQ's treatment eligibility criteria. This cohort will be used as an&#xD;
      historical cohort to determine the rate of linkage to treatment with the standard&#xD;
      pre-treatment evaluation protocol.&#xD;
