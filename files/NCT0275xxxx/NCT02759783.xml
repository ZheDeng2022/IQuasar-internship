  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic spread of cancer from its primary site to distant organs is the commonest cause of&#xD;
      death from cancer. The term oligometastases describes an intermediate metastatic state, in&#xD;
      which cancer exists as a limited number of metastases at first, before cells acquire the&#xD;
      ability to metastasise more widely. For the large majority of solid cancers, once metastatic&#xD;
      disease has been diagnosed the chances of cure are small. There are several situations where&#xD;
      this is not the case, but it is not known if stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for&#xD;
      oligometastatic disease will alter outcomes or whether the toxicity burden of this treatment&#xD;
      is justified. SBRT is targeted radiotherapy which destroys cancer cells in the area of the&#xD;
      body it is aimed at however low dose radiation may be received by surrounding tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is difficult to quantify incidence of patients with multiple primary cancers developing at&#xD;
      intervals that are representative of oligometastatic stage IV disease, (defined for the&#xD;
      purposes of this trial as ≤ 3 metastatic sites). However an increase in the use of&#xD;
      surveillance imaging, together with improved diagnostic sensitivity has led to the diagnosis&#xD;
      of patients with asymptomatic oligometastatic relapse becoming a more common clinical&#xD;
      occurrence. The CORE study is a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in&#xD;
      patients with cancer in one of three primary sites where oligometastatic disease relapse is a&#xD;
      common clinical scenario: breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study&#xD;
      will evaluate the use of SBRT in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients who consent to participate in this clinical trial will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive standard care or standard care plus SBRT we hope to recruit approximately 206&#xD;
      patients to the study and the primary outcome measure is progression free survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CORE is a phase II/III, multi-centre, non-blinded, parallel group randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      in patients with breast, prostate or NSCLC primary cancer comparing standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      with or without SBRT for extra-cranial metastases. The aim of the phase II study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate 1) feasibility of recruitment, 2) deliverability of the study in a multi-centre&#xD;
      setting and 3) activity of SBRT, based on progression free survival, across the three tumour&#xD;
      types. If all three aims are achieved the trial will be amended to roll into parallel&#xD;
      tumour-site specific phase III trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are those with either primary breast, prostate or NSCLC who have presented&#xD;
      with ≤3 extra-cranial, metachronous, oligometastases, all suitable for SBRT. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either SOC or SOC with the addition of SBRT. Choice of SOC&#xD;
      treatment is at the discretion of the local oncologist and defined per patient prior to&#xD;
      randomisation (see section 8). Patients randomised to SBRT+SOC will receive a dose and&#xD;
      fractionation regimen dependent on the metastatic site and proximity to dose limiting organs&#xD;
      and normal tissues. Treatment will take place within 6 weeks of randomisation. The average&#xD;
      scheme would be 3 treatments over 5 days but the maximum period of SBRT duration could be 8&#xD;
      treatments over 19 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be reviewed every 3 months with a clinical examination and tumour markers&#xD;
      (where applicable) during years 1 and 2, and 6 monthly thereafter to 5 years. Staging and&#xD;
      follow up imaging protocols will be tumour type dependent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast: 3 monthly CT scans for years 1 and 2, and 6 monthly thereafter to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NSCLC: 3 monthly CT scans for years 1 and 2, 6 monthly to year 3, then annually to 5&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate: CT scans will be performed at 6, 12 and 24 months with imaging triggered by&#xD;
           appropriate PSA rises. A rising PSA defined as 2 successive PSA rises from nadir,&#xD;
           measured a minimum of 4 weeks apart. If the overall PSA rise has a doubling time of ≥ 3&#xD;
           months or the PSA level has doubled the original PSA value at trial entry or if&#xD;
           clinically indicated, then restaging should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a toxicity assessment at each clinic visit and patient reported&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. WHO performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histological confirmation of primary malignancy (histological confirmation of&#xD;
             metastasis is not mandatory but should be performed in any situation where there is&#xD;
             diagnostic uncertainty). Patients with breast, NSCLC or prostate primary malignancies&#xD;
             are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Predicted life expectancy &gt; 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ≤ 3 metastatic lesions (total). A maximum of 2 different organ systems (e.g. liver,&#xD;
             lung, bone, nodal) may contain metastases but the total number of lesions must not&#xD;
             exceed 3. For example, a patient with 3 liver metastases or 1 liver metastasis and 2&#xD;
             lung metastases would be eligible. A patient with 1 lung metastasis, 1 liver&#xD;
             metastasis and an adrenal metastasis is ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All metastases must be visible, imaging defined targets and be suitable for treatment&#xD;
             with SBRT in accordance with the dose fractionation options specified in the protocol.&#xD;
             (See the associated CORE trial radiotherapy delivery guidelines for detailed SBRT&#xD;
             guidance by metastatic site)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have received prior ablative therapy (e.g. surgery, RFA or SBRT) for&#xD;
             metastatic disease are eligible, as long as this site is controlled on imaging at the&#xD;
             point of trial entry and the total number of metastases over time since diagnosis of&#xD;
             metastatic disease does not exceed 3. Patients with 2 or 3 metastases in which&#xD;
             ablative therapy (e.g. surgery/RFA) to 1 site is deemed appropriate as part of&#xD;
             standard therapy may be entered into the trial following successful delivery of the&#xD;
             ablative treatment. Ablative therapy (e.g. surgery, RFA, cryoablation, SBRT) is not&#xD;
             permissible as a standard of care option following randomisation for patients as part&#xD;
             of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Only patients with metachronous metastatic disease presentation are eligible. Primary&#xD;
             site must be controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NSCLC patients with synchronous presentation of a single brain metastasis with the&#xD;
             primary lung malignancy are eligible as long as both sites of disease have received&#xD;
             radical treatment. Both primary lung site and solitary synchronous brain metastasis&#xD;
             must be controlled at trial entry, and the total number of metastases over time&#xD;
             including the brain metastasis must not exceed 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Permissible disease-free intervals are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Breast: ≥ 6 months from completion of radical treatment including any adjuvant therapy&#xD;
             to diagnosis of metastases. Patients who have relapsed whilst on adjuvant endocrine&#xD;
             therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NSCLC: ≥ 4 months from completion of radical treatment (not including any adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy) to diagnosis of metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prostate: ≥ 6 months from completion of radical treatment including any adjuvant&#xD;
             therapy to diagnosis of metastases. Patients who have relapsed whilst on adjuvant&#xD;
             endocrine therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Only patients who are systemic therapy naïve in the metastatic setting are eligible.&#xD;
             Prior systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting is permitted. Patients who have had a&#xD;
             change in endocrine therapy due to the diagnosis of oligometastatic disease can be&#xD;
             entered into the CORE trial as long as entry is within 8 weeks of this change in&#xD;
             therapy for prostate cancer patients and within 10 weeks of this change in therapy for&#xD;
             breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate baseline organ function to allow SBRT to all relevant targets dependent on&#xD;

             required to facilitate SBRT&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Loco-regional nodal relapse where surgery is considered the standard of care and is&#xD;
             technically feasible. Patients with internal mammary chain or supraclavicular fossa&#xD;
             lymph node relapses of breast cancer are eligible if SBRT dose constraints can be met.&#xD;
             Patients with axillary nodal relapse from breast cancer are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Spinal cord compression, or impingement of the cord or any other situation whereby the&#xD;
             clinician feels that urgent radiotherapy to the spine is required (within 24 hours)&#xD;

             cell carcinoma of the skin), or if previous malignancy is expected to significantly&#xD;
             compromise 5 year survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients whose entry to the trial will cause unacceptable clinical delays to their&#xD;
             planned management.&#xD;
