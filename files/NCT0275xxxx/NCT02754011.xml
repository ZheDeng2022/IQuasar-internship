  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a multicenter, open-label phase I trial, conducted in locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic breast cancer HER2 negative patients and divided into 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STEP 1: a dose escalation part (n= up to 30) to evaluate the safety profile and&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics and to define the MTD and RP2D to recommend in a phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STEP 2: an expansion cohort part to confirm the safety and tolerability of ribociclib&#xD;
           and capecitabine association on a longer follow-up, and to obtain preliminary evidence&#xD;
           of anti-tumor activity on two expanded cohorts of HR positive and HR negative patients.&#xD;
           Up to 14 patients in each cohort, taking into account patients already included in step&#xD;
           one at this DL, may be enrolled, for a total of 28 at the RP2D.&#xD;
