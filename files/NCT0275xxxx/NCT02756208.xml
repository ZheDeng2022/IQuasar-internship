      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of the FLSC vaccine and will be a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, modified double-blinded dose escalation study in 60 healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 uninfected).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, modified double-blinded dose escalation&#xD;
      study in 60 healthy adult volunteers who are Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1)&#xD;
      uninfected. Participants in the study will receive 4 injections at 0, 4, 8 and 24 weeks and&#xD;
      will be followed for an additional 24 weeks. The total study duration will be 48 weeks. As&#xD;
      this is a Phase 1 trial, the primary objective is to document safety of the Full Length&#xD;
      Single Chain (FLSC) gp120-CD4 complex vaccine with a secondary objective to evaluate immune&#xD;
      responses induced by the vaccine. This vaccine is being evaluated as it is constructed so&#xD;
      that the gp120 and CD4 moieties form a stable intra-chain binding interaction that forms a&#xD;
      transition state structure that presents conserved, conformational domains involved in the&#xD;
      early HIV replication process. It is hypothesized that antibodies directed to these epitopes&#xD;
      would be highly cross-reactive and potentially useful for HIV vaccine development.&#xD;
