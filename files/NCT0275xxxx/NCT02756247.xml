  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of buparlisib and ibrutinib will&#xD;
      lead to better treatment results in patients with relapsed or refractory Follicular lymphoma,&#xD;
      (FL) Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The investigators&#xD;
      are using buparlisib and ibrutinib because both drugs seem to block different proteins that&#xD;
      allow cancer cells to keep growing. Blocking these proteins may help by making the cancer&#xD;
      cells undergo cell death, which will stop uncontrolled tumor growth.&#xD;

    <description>In the Phase I part the standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme will be used and all disease subtypes will be combined. If none of the initial cohort of 3 has a DLT the dose level will be escalated. If one has a DLT that dose level will be expanded with 3 more patients. Dose escalation will stop if 2 or more DLTs are seen at a dose level. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which at most 1 of the 6 patients treated at that level has a DLT. Three dose levels plus a &quot;-1&quot; dose level are planned for this study.</description>

    <description>This is a two stage protocol comprised of a single institution phase Ib dose escalation trial. The first stage is a standard 3+3 phase I dose escalation trial to assess the safety of buparlisib and ibrutinib. The second stage is a single center expansion cohort in MCL, FL and DLBCL respectively evaluating the efficacy of buparlisib and ibrutinib combination.&#xD;
Treatment will be with ibrutinib orally daily and buparlisib orally daily. A cycle is defined as 4 weeks of therapy. Therapy will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicities or death with a maximum duration for 36 cycles, not exceeding 36 months on therapy.</description>
