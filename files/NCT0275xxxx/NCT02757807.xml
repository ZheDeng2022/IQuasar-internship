      The aim of this study is to determine if patients with ED taking PDE5 inhibitors (e.g.&#xD;
      Viagra, CIalis, Levitra, Stendra) and experiencing performance anxiety will benefit using a&#xD;
      user-friendly stress reducing phone app, Serenita. The study is internet based with no office&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been investigated in many studies. Most often,&#xD;
      ED is proposed to have a multifactorial etiology, with organic and/or psychogenic causal&#xD;
      factors hypothesized to affect erectile function. Numerous studies show that Deep and Slow&#xD;
      Breathing (DSB) reduces stress and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since ED is multifactorial, many physicians rely solely on phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5)&#xD;
      inhibitors to increase blood flow to the arteries to maintain an erection. Although it works&#xD;
      in many patients, some patients can get overly anxious prior to sexual intercourse and not be&#xD;
      able to produce or maintain an erection. While some patients may realize that DSB may improve&#xD;
      their anxiety they don't know how to perform DSB properly. We hypothesize that by providing&#xD;
      software interactivity on deep and slow breathing to this group of ED patients, may in turn&#xD;
      help reduce their anxiety, thus, maximize the effect of PDE5 inhibitors. The app called&#xD;
      &quot;Serenita&quot; for mobile phones, designed by Eco-Fusion will be utilized in this study. The app&#xD;
      performs two functions: it detects stress and focus level and It guides the user through a&#xD;
      personalized breathing exercise designed to reduce stress and increase focus. Breathing as a&#xD;
      method to treat stress has three scientifically validated variations, the deep diaphragmatic&#xD;
      breathing, used for centuries as part of Yoga which often refers as Yogic breathing,&#xD;
      biofeedback breathing, a method in which the user sees in real-time how his breathing affects&#xD;
      his stress level, and coherence breathing, a method that synchronizes breathing pace with&#xD;
      heart rhythms. The technology embedded in Serenita app combines all three methods into a&#xD;
      personalized guided breathing regimen. The app acquires data by turning the mobile phone's&#xD;
      camera into a biomedical sensor which peers into a person's blood stream, obtaining heart&#xD;
      rate, heart rate variability and breathing pace. Then the app processes the data obtained to&#xD;
      assess user's stress and focus level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilize 6 standardized questionnaires to assess changes in patients'&#xD;
      responses while using the app:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Erectile Performance Anxiety Index (EPAI), which will ask questions that assess anxiety&#xD;
           about being able to achieve or maintain an erection during sexual activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), which will ask questions about sexual&#xD;
           encounters for the past four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (PAIRS), which will ask questions&#xD;
           about sexual self-confidence, time concerns and spontaneity with sexual encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-Esteem and Relationship (SEAR), which will ask questions about sexual relationship,&#xD;
           confidence, stress ad perceived stress and overall sexual relationship for the past four&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP), which will ask question about each sexual attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global Assessment Question, which will ask question at end of study if this app has&#xD;
           improved erectile function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questionnaires are conducted online for easy access and completion. There are no office&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
