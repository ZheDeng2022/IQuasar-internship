  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism (PE), is the third most common cardiovascular disorder after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and stroke. VTE occurs in about 1 person per 1,000 per year, increasing&#xD;
      dramatically in patients with cancer to about 25 per 1,000 per year. Among the known risk&#xD;
      factors of VTE, cancer is one of the most potent. Patients with cancer have a 7- to 28-fold&#xD;
      higher risk for VTE than non-cancer patients. VTE has important implications for the care of&#xD;
      cancer patients, including reduced life expectancy, high rates of VTE recurrence both while&#xD;
      on and after stopping anticoagulation, the need for chronic anticoagulation with related&#xD;
      adverse drug reactions, and delays in cancer therapies. Clinical dilemma: Current clinical&#xD;
      guidelines recommend a minimum of 3-6 months of anticoagulation with weight-adjusted low&#xD;
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in cancer patients with VTE. However, there are no&#xD;
      recommendations beyond the initial 6 months of therapy due to the lack of data on extended&#xD;
      duration therapy for cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT). This leads to variability in&#xD;
      physician practices, with some continuing weight-adjusted LMWH therapy beyond 6 months. This&#xD;
      poses concern because, while the goal is to prevent recurrence of VTE, the risk of major&#xD;
      bleeding with prolonged weight-adjusted LMWH therapy is significant. Potential solutions:&#xD;
      There is a lack of data to inform on VTE treatment in cancer patients beyond the initial 3-6&#xD;
      months of anticoagulation. We propose that after a minimum of 3-6 months of therapeutic dose&#xD;
      anticoagulation, the use of prophylactic doses of LMWH will have an acceptable and adherence&#xD;
      profile in cancer patients with VTE. The data obtained from this study will help inform&#xD;
      physician practices. Design: This is a multicentre, open-label study of enoxaparin (40 mg&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection, once daily) for additional 6 months after an initial minimum&#xD;
      3-6-month course of therapeutic dose anticoagulant therapy. Patients: 150 patients with VTE&#xD;
      secondary to cancer will take part in this multicentre study conducted in 8 Canadian centres&#xD;
      within Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia. Study Outcomes: The primary objective of the study is&#xD;
      to determine the rate of recurrent VTE in patients receiving prophylactic dose enoxaparin for&#xD;
      secondary VTE prophylaxis after an initial minimum 3-6 months of anticoagulation. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to determine the safety profile of prophylaxis dose enoxaparin for&#xD;
      secondary VTE prophylaxis after an initial 3-6 months of anticoagulation. This includes&#xD;
      determining for all subjects: 1) cumulative incidence of major bleeding events; 2) cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding events; 3) cumulative incidence of minor&#xD;
      bleeding event, and 4) overall survival during follow-up.&#xD;

        Subjects will have an active malignancy defined as any of: a) diagnosis of cancer&#xD;
        (excluding basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma) within 18 months of study enrolment; or&#xD;
