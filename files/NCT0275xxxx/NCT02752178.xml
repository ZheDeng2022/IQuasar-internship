    <textblock>
      This is a study to characterise the role of inflammatory processes in depression. There is&#xD;
      compelling evidence that inflammation is often associated with, and can cause, depression. It&#xD;
      is currently less clear that antiinflammatory drugs have meaningful antidepressant effect.&#xD;
      One of the goals is to identify the subset of depressed patients that is most likely to&#xD;
      respond better to an antiinflammatory drug than to a conventional antidepressant. The&#xD;
      investigators will therefore undertake a study of patients with a diagnosis of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder including four groups: i) incompletely responsive patients who have&#xD;
      demonstrated failure to respond consistently or completely to standard treatment, ii) those&#xD;
      who have responded well to treatment and are not currently depressed, iii) untreated patients&#xD;
      who are currently depressed, iv) healthy volunteers with no history of depression.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a clinical assessment, an interview with a trained member of the&#xD;
      research team and will complete self-rated questionnaires. Investigators will collect blood&#xD;
      and saliva samples to measure certain immune markers. They will also perform magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for MRI markers in the brain and investigate brain&#xD;
      inflammation in a subsample of these patients using positron emission topography (PET) and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling (also called lumbar puncture).&#xD;

      The hypotheses are (i) that therapeutic resistance to monoaminergic (MA) antidepressant drugs&#xD;
      is associated with peripheral biomarkers indicating abnormal activation of the innate immune&#xD;
      system; and (ii) that peripheral inflammation, defined by blood levels of C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP), is associated with central nervous system inflammation and abnormal brain structure&#xD;
      and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to test these two hypotheses by collecting clinical, immunological and&#xD;
      neuroimaging data on patients with depression (DEP+) recruited from a network of clinical&#xD;
      research sites in the United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure peripheral immunophenotypes in healthy volunteers (at least N=50) and 3 groups of&#xD;
      depressed patients, categorised by their exposure and therapeutic response to monoaminergic&#xD;
      antidepressants (up to N=200):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incompletely responsive patients (approximately N ~100) who are currently depressed&#xD;
           after greater than 6 weeks of treatment with one or more monoaminergic antidepressants&#xD;
           (DEP+MA+);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Responsive patients (approximately N~50) who are not currently depressed after greater&#xD;
           than 6 weeks of treatment with a monoaminergic antidepressant (DEP-MA+);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Untreated patients (approximately N~50) who are currently depressed but have not been&#xD;
           treated with monoaminergic antidepressants in the previous 6 weeks (DEP+MA-);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers (approximately N~50) who have no personal history of depression&#xD;
           requiring treatment with either monoaminergic antidepressants or other clinical&#xD;
           interventions including psychotherapy (DEP-MA-).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure brain and cognitive phenotypes in a subsample of up to N=100 depressed patients&#xD;
      recruited, preferably from the primary cohort, on the basis of their CRP levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low CRP patients (N~45) will have CRP &lt;= 3 mg/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High CRP patients (N~45) will have CRP &gt; 3 mg/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers (at least N=45).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in this sample will be assessed using structural and functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) and subjects providing additional specific consents will also be&#xD;
      assessed using positron emission tomography (PET-MR), and/or lumbar puncture (LP) for&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling.&#xD;
