      Background: Few studies showed that early rehabilitation on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)&#xD;
      results in a better functional outcome at hospital discharge and reduced hospital stay.&#xD;
      Effects of early rehabilitation at the general ward directly after transfer from the ICU on&#xD;
      the length of stay (LOS) in hospital and on the functional outcome are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) 53 consecutive&#xD;
      critical-illness-survivors were enrolled at nine ICUs. Early rehabilitation program&#xD;
      (protocol) consisted of exercise therapy, active breathing techniques and electrical&#xD;
      stimulation after discharge from the ICU to ward-based care. The usual care group received&#xD;
      physical therapy as ordered by the primary care team after discharge from the ICU. LOS at the&#xD;
      general ward after transfer from the ICU was recorded. Furthermore,&#xD;
      Early-Rehabilitation-Barthel-Index (ERBI), Visual-Analogue-Scale for pain (VAS),&#xD;
      3-Minute-walk-test (3min), Beck-Depression-Inventory (BDI), State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory&#xD;
      (STAI), and Medical-Research-Council-scale (MRCS) were assessed.&#xD;

      Methods Patients All the procedures described in this study were approved by the local Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (No. 375/2007), and informed consent was obtained from all patients or by proxy.&#xD;
      The study was conducted prospectively between 2008 and 2011 in nine ICUs (three medical, six&#xD;
      surgical; all together 72 beds) located in the General Hospital of Vienna/Medical University&#xD;
      of Vienna according to the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures ICU patients were recruited as soon as they were suitable for early ICU&#xD;
      rehabilitation (see inclusion criteria). After baseline measurements patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the early rehabilitation group. A computer-generated, permuted block&#xD;
      randomization scheme was used considering sex, age, LOS at the ICU and diagnostic category to&#xD;
      allocate patients to the early rehabilitation group or usual care group. Each assignment was&#xD;
      operated through a web-based randomization system (https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/randomizer)&#xD;
      by an investigator with no further involvement. All included patients received the same usual&#xD;
      care physical therapy, as ordered by the primary care team, during their stay at the ICUs.&#xD;
      Unresponsive patients underwent passive range of motion exercise for all limbs. Once patient&#xD;
      interaction was achieved, no matter if the patient was mechanically ventilated, a progressive&#xD;
      early rehabilitation program was initiated starting with active assisted or active range of&#xD;
      motion exercises and breathing techniques. If these exercises were tolerated, treatment was&#xD;
      advanced to bed mobility exercises, transferring to upright sitting and sitting balance&#xD;
      activities. The early rehabilitation program progressed to participation in activities of&#xD;
      daily living, sit-to-stand transferring, pre-gait exercise and finally up to walking.&#xD;
      Progression of activities was dependent on patient tolerance and stability (systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure between 65 and 200 mm HG, heart rate between 40 and 130 beats per minute,&#xD;
      respiratory rate between 5 and 40 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry above 88%). Patients&#xD;
      were discharged to a general ward as soon as their medical condition was sufficiently stable,&#xD;
      regardless of their functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directly after transfer to a general ward the early rehabilitation group started with an&#xD;
      early rehabilitation program, as ordered by an experienced physiatrist. The early&#xD;
      rehabilitation program consisted of a coordinated exercise therapy and neuromuscular&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, for two hours and five days a week until discharge from the acute&#xD;
      hospital. Exercise therapy included strength training (three days/week, one to three sets of&#xD;
      12-15 repetitions, 8-10 exercises involving the major muscle groups: thighs, calves,&#xD;
      buttocks, trunk, shoulder girdle), aerobic exercise (large muscle activities five days/week,&#xD;
      10-30 min/session, 50-80% maximal heart rate) and active breathing techniques. Exercise&#xD;
      equipment being used: Resistance bands, free weights, weight machines, shoulder pulleys,&#xD;
      stationary and bedside cycle ergometers, and wobble boards. Progression of activities was&#xD;
      dependent on patient tolerance and stability. For neuromuscular electrical stimulation we&#xD;
      applied Compex-PÂ© devices producing biphasic symmetric impulses with a frequency of 50 Hz and&#xD;
      a pulse width of 0.35 ms (stimulus regime: 8 s on/24 s off) five days/week, 30 min/session&#xD;
      involving the anterior thighs and buttocks. The usual care group received single physical&#xD;
      therapy sessions as ordered by the primary care team after transfer from the ICU to the&#xD;
      general ward (exercise therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were assessed by two medical students who were unaware of randomization assignment.&#xD;
      The medical students were trained by an experienced senior physician to perform the&#xD;
      functional measures and questionnaires. To maintain blinding, the patients and any visitors&#xD;
      were instructed not to discuss previous interventions with the assessors or the primary care&#xD;
      team. Furthermore, assessments occurred after 4 pm at a time distant from the therapy&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics On the basis of ten pilot critical-illness-survivors who were admitted to&#xD;
      intensive care, we noted a mean difference of seven days after transfer to a general ward&#xD;
      between the early rehabilitation protocol and usual care revealing an effect size of 0.58&#xD;
      (G*power 3.1.3) [39]. We calculated that a total sample size of 40 critical-illness-survivors&#xD;
      per group (for a total of 80) would be needed to reach a power of 80% using a one sided&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test at a significance level of 0.05. However the inclusion time period&#xD;
      for new patients was limited to two and half years and only 53 patients met the inclusions&#xD;
      criteria and were willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint, days in hospital after transfer from the ICU to a general ward, was&#xD;
      analyzed by intention to treat and per protocol analyses. The intention to treat sample&#xD;
      included all patients, who could be transferred to a general ward in the General Hospital&#xD;
      Vienna (early rehabilitation group: n = 23, usual care group: n = 27), whereby all patients&#xD;
      were randomized at the ICU before transfer. Three patients already randomized had to be&#xD;
      excluded as they were either unpredictable directly transferred to another hospital from the&#xD;
      ICU (early rehabilitation group: n = 1, usual care group: n = 1), or died (usual care group:&#xD;
      n = 1) at the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The per protocol sample included all patients who were randomized at the ICU, transferred to&#xD;
      a general ward in the General Hospital Vienna, and for who the treatment was really started&#xD;
      (early rehabilitation group: n = 19, usual care group: n = 27). For the per protocol&#xD;
      analysis, in addition to the intention to treat sample, four patients had to be excluded in&#xD;
      the early rehabilitation group because they did not receive additional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between treatment and usual care group was analyzed univariately by log rank&#xD;
      tests, and Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted. A Cox proportional hazard model was applied to&#xD;
      analyze the difference between groups, also accounting for age, sex, diagnostic category at&#xD;
      admission, and days at the ICU. We took the time at the general ward for patients who were&#xD;
      treated at the General Hospital Vienna until discharge, and the total time at the general&#xD;
      ward (days at the General Hospital Vienna + other hospital) for patients who were treated at&#xD;
      the General Hospital Vienna and then transferred to another hospital. For some patients, the&#xD;
      event (discharge from the general ward) did not occur within the observation period, as they&#xD;
      were either lost to follow up (that means they were transferred to another hospital with&#xD;
      unknown LOS) or died. For these patients we took the time at the general ward of the General&#xD;
      Hospital Vienna until transfer or until death, respectively, and censored them. In the&#xD;
      statistical analyses, the censoring considered that these patients did not experience the&#xD;
      event (discharge from the general ward) until the time of censoring. No assumption was made&#xD;
      when it may have happened afterwards. The intention to treat sample included five censored&#xD;
      patients (3 early rehabilitation group, 2 usual care group) and the per protocol sample three&#xD;
      censored patients (1 early rehabilitation group, 2 usual care group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analyses of the secondary endpoints ERBI, VAS, 3min, BDI, STAI, and MRCS, descriptive&#xD;
      statistics (median, first quartile, third quartile, and range) were carried out at baseline&#xD;
      and discharge from hospital as well as for the difference between discharge and baseline for&#xD;
      each treatment group separately including data of all patients randomized in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the hospital costs after transfer from the ICU to the general ward between early&#xD;
      rehabilitation and usual care group, descriptive statistics were assessed for the intention&#xD;
      to treat sample as well as for the per protocol sample. All analyses were calculated with the&#xD;
      statistics program SAS 9.2 and R 3.0.1. For the primary analysis, a p-value &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
