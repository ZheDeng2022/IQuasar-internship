  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) can affect people who had a hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant using donor cells. It is often fatal. It is usually treated with high doses of&#xD;
      steroids. But that helps only about half the people in the long term. Researchers want to see&#xD;
      if a drug called baricitinib can help people with cGVHD that has not responded to therapy.&#xD;
      The drug inhibits the proteins involved in communication in the immune system. These proteins&#xD;
      may play a role in cGVHD and other inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety and effectiveness of baricitinib in people with cGVHD that has not&#xD;
      responded to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older with cGVHD that has not responded to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. They will have lung and heart tests and chest scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit: Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests for infectious diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin, eye, and teeth evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation and occupational medicine evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photos of any lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gynecology evaluation (females)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will occur in 28-day cycles. Participants will take the study drug by mouth every&#xD;
      day for 3 cycles. Some will take it for 3 or 6 more cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a few visits during each cycle. They will repeat some previous tests.&#xD;
      They may also have scans and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit when they stop taking the drug and another 3 months later.&#xD;
      They will repeat a few study tests. They will have follow-up calls for 2 years.&#xD;

      -  Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of non-relapse&#xD;
                morbidity and mortality in persons after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
                transplantation (SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Approximately 50% of patients with cGVHD have disease refractory to systemic&#xD;
                corticosteroids; currently, there is no standard second-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The JAK-STAT pathway relays the signaling function of several inflammatory&#xD;
                cytokines that have a role in GVHD (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Murine models have demonstrated activity of JAK inhibitors in graft-versus-host&#xD;
                disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baricitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that has&#xD;
                demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects and a good safety profile in patients with&#xD;
                rheumatoid arthritis, but has not been evaluated in GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the safety and tolerability of baricitinib in patients with cGVHD that&#xD;
                is refractory to steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the efficacy of baricitinib in patients with cGVHD that is refractory&#xD;
                to steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Moderate or severe cGVHD per NIH consensus criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  cGVHD that did not respond to high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone at 1.0&#xD;
                     mg/kg/day for at least 1 week or prednisone at 0.5 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg every&#xD;
                     other day for at least 4 weeks), or second-line therapy (any)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Receiving stable or tapering doses of systemic therapy in the preceding 4&#xD;
                     weeks if taking systemic therapy for cGVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Neutrophils &lt;1.0x10^9/L, platelets &lt;50X10^9/L, creatinine greater than or&#xD;
                     equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal or estimated creatinine clearance&#xD;
                     &lt;50mL/min/1.73m^2 (Cockroft-Gault formula), serum aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
                     or alanine aminotransferase concentration &gt;3x ULN or total bilirubin greater&#xD;
                     than or equal to 1.5x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Progressive malignancy, uncontrolled infection or any major organ dysfunction&#xD;
                     as defined by the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This is a Phase 1/2 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of baricitinib in&#xD;
                patients with cGVHD that is refractory to steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will initially be treated with baricitinib at 2mg daily for 12 weeks. If&#xD;
                the response at 12 weeks is a CR and there has not been a DLT, the dose will be&#xD;
                remain at 2mg daily for an additional 12 weeks, with the primary response&#xD;
                assessment at 24 weeks of total treatment. If the response is a PR or stable&#xD;
                disease, the dose will be increased to 4mg daily for an additional 12 weeks, with&#xD;
                the primary response assessment at 24 weeks of total treatment. If there is&#xD;
                progression of disease at any time within the first 12 weeks, the dose can be&#xD;
                increased to 4mg daily at that time, and patients will continue for a total of 24&#xD;
                weeks of treatment. Patients will have the option to continue baricitinib for an&#xD;
                additional 6 months as tolerated if they have stable or responding disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The co-primary endpoint of safety will be determined by rate, severity, and&#xD;
                duration of adverse events based on CTCAE v4 criteria. Assessment for DLTs will&#xD;
                occur every 2 weeks during the first 4 weeks of each dose level. Safety monitoring&#xD;
                will occur every 4 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The co-primary endpoint of efficacy will be defined as rate of overall response at&#xD;
                24 weeks per NIH consensus criteria (CR or PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Peripheral blood samples will be collected prior to treatment, at 2 weeks, at 12&#xD;
                weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter to evaluate cytokine and cellular profiles,&#xD;
                STAT phosphorylation, candidate chronic GVHD biomarkers. Pharmacokinetic studies&#xD;
                will also be performed at each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In an initial futility analysis, if 0 of the first 7 patients enrolled in cohort 1&#xD;
                have responded at 12 weeks, then a 2nd cohort of patients will be accrued to start&#xD;
                treatment at the higher dose (4mg daily). Otherwise, if 1 or more of the first 7&#xD;
                patients respond in cohort 1, then 21 evaluable patients will be treated in cohort&#xD;
                1. Similarly, if the second cohort is used, and if 0 of the 7 patients enrolled in&#xD;
                this second cohort have responded at 12 weeks, then no further patients will be&#xD;
                accrued. Otherwise, if 1 or more of the first 7 patients respond in cohort 2, then&#xD;
                21 evaluable patients will be treated in cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A total of 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled in either cohort 1 or 2 as&#xD;
                appropriate, in order to have 80% power to detect a response rate consistent with&#xD;
                30% and ruling out 10%, with a one-sided significance level of 0.10 for the cohort.&#xD;
                As an early stopping rule for safety, if 2/3 or greater patients at any given dose&#xD;
                level experiences a dose limiting toxicity requiring dose reduction or&#xD;
                discontinuation, that dose will not be subsequently used and no further dose&#xD;
                escalation will take place.&#xD;

             diagnosed and staged per NIH criteria. Responses to JAK inhibitors have not been&#xD;
             restricted to specific organs, so any organ involvement is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Because inadequate dosing or adverse&#xD;
             event data are currently available on the use of baricitinib in patients &lt;18 years of&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Any serious medical condition within the previous 4 weeks which places the subject at&#xD;
             an unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study or confounds the&#xD;
             ability to interpret data from the study, including, but not limited to, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias,&#xD;
             acute kidney injury, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled infection, including active HIV-1, Hepatitis B (HBV) and/or Hepatitis C&#xD;
             (HCV) infection (positive HBV or HCV viral load in the setting of positive HBV core&#xD;
             antibody or surface antibody or HCV antibody). History of HBV or HCV is allowed if&#xD;
             there is no uncontrolled viral infection. Because the study agent may impact response&#xD;
             to infections, patients with any active viral infection are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Recurrent or progressive malignancy requiring anticancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Other cancer except that for which the transplant was done &lt;2 years before study&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. NIH lung score 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the teratogenic effects of&#xD;
             baricitinib are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with baricitinib,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with this agent.&#xD;
