      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in U.S. men. Treatments for early or less&#xD;
      aggressive disease are limited. Researchers want to test a device that destroys cancerous&#xD;
      tissue with laser energy. They want to see if using it with ultrasound is more comfortable&#xD;
      than using it with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a cooled laser applicator system to treat prostate cancer lesions. To see if&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging is a practical and feasible treatment with laser ablation for focal&#xD;
      prostate cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men at least 18 years old with prostate cancer seen on MRI that has not spread in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with standard cancer care tests. These can include physical&#xD;
      exam, lab tests, and MRI. For the MRI, they lie in a machine that takes pictures.&#xD;
      Participants will have a prostate biopsy. Needle samples will be taken from 12 places in the&#xD;
      prostate. This will be guided by MRI and ultrasound, which is obtained through a coil in the&#xD;
      rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at the clinic for 1 2 days. A cooling catheter (plastic tube) will be&#xD;
      put in the bladder. Ultrasound will guide the laser applicator directly to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cooling catheter will be removed. A different catheter will be put in the urethra to keep&#xD;
      the bladder emptied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next day, participants will have a physical exam and a PSA blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 6 follow-up visits over 3 years. At each visit, they will have a&#xD;
      physical exam and lab tests. At some visits, they will also have an MRI or other scans and a&#xD;
      prostate biopsy.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of real time ultrasound imaging to guide focal&#xD;
           thermal ablation of low risk focal prostate tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate cancer is relatively slow growing, with doubling times for local tumors&#xD;
           estimated at 2 to 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent patient series suggest that 20% to 30% of men undergoing radical prostatectomy&#xD;
           have pathologic features in the radical prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      specimen consistent with an insignificant or &quot;indolent&quot; cancer that poses little threat to&#xD;
      life or health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An NIH/NCI protocol #11-C-0158 titled MR Image guided focal laser ablation therapy of&#xD;
           prostate cancer has treated 15 patients without major complication over the past 5&#xD;
           years. Out of 15 patients, 3 have had evidence of disease recurrence. This data is being&#xD;
           prepared for publication (verbal communication with Peter Pinto, MD, principal&#xD;
           investigator); however, it requires a very long and resource-intensive MRI imaging,&#xD;
           which may be a barrier to broad translation to the community setting. Specialized custom&#xD;
           and expensive MRI-compatible equipment is also required. Focal laser ablation for&#xD;
           prostate cancer using the Medtronic-Visualase laser is FDA cleared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focal thermal ablation such as laser ablation or cryosurgery are standard of care&#xD;
           therapies for prostate cancer, with cancer control comparable to that of external beam&#xD;
           radiotherapy and brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIH / NCI clinical trials have performed MRI + ultrasound (US) fusion biopsy in nearly&#xD;
           1500 patients, greater than 30,000 biopsies over the past 12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose to perform ultrasound (US) guided focal thermal ablation with fusion&#xD;
           visualization and co-display of pre-acquired MRI during the treatment of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the feasibility of treating biopsy-confirmed US-targetable and/or&#xD;
      MR-visible,low to intermediate grade prostate tumor(s) using ultrasound (US) image-guided&#xD;
      focal interstitial thermal ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have organ confined, biopsy-confirmed, low or intermediate risk prostate&#xD;
           cancer that is either US-targetable or MR visible or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pilot study, testing feasibility of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation of focal prostate&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 30 patients will be enrolled to yield 20 evaluable patients.&#xD;
