  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Problem: Obesity is one of the leading causes of chronic disease and death. The efficacy&#xD;
      of diet and exercise to sustain weight loss over the long term is weak. While pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      is more effective than behavior intervention in maintaining weight loss the effects are often&#xD;
      not sufficient to achieve optimal health benefits. Current drug treatments may be sub-optimal&#xD;
      because they do not directly target the rewarding value of food, drive to eat, food liking,&#xD;
      and impulsivity for eating energy dense snack foods, all of which influences both quantity&#xD;
      and quality of food intake and impacts adherence needed to maintain weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Solution: The limitations in current anti-obesity agents are potentially addressed by&#xD;
      Methylphenidate (MPH). We showed that MPH reduces food intake, dietary fat intake, hunger and&#xD;
      food reward, as increase resting energy expenditure in obese and non-obese adults;however, no&#xD;
      controlled field trials have been conducted in obese individuals without ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/Hypotheses: Primary: To test the effects of MPH on energy intake in obese men and&#xD;
      women. Secondary: to examine the effects of MPH on energy expenditure, body weight,&#xD;
      impulsivity, food reward, and olfaction. The investigators predict that compared to placebo,&#xD;
      MPH will show reduced appetite, along with reduced impulsivity, food reward, and smell&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverable: This study may be the first to establish the short-term efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      using MPH for weight loss, and if successful, data will inform a larger trial that can&#xD;
      potentially identify MPH as a novel therapeutic agent for treating obesity and related&#xD;
      chronic diseases in a predisposed population.&#xD;

      Research Objectives and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: The primary objective of this study is to examine whether Methylphenidate (MPH) at&#xD;
      dose of 0.50 mg/kg (not exceeding 100 mg/day) can lead to a sustained reduction in energy&#xD;
      intake in obese adolescents and adults. Based on the investigators' pilot data in adults, it&#xD;
      is predicted that daily administration of MPH for 60 consecutive days will produce reductions&#xD;
      in food intake (both in lab and free-living) compared to placebo, extending our previous&#xD;
      findings to a longer period of time and to obese adolescents. Prior to beginning the&#xD;
      intervention, both MPH and placebo treatment groups will receive lifestyle advice (eating and&#xD;
      exercise guidelines for healthy living). The primary outcome measures will rely on the&#xD;
      validated measurements of energy intake (in lab lunch buffet and out of lab 3 day food menu).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives/hypotheses: The effects of MPH on all components of energy expenditure&#xD;
      will be investigated. Based on the investigators' pilot data, it is predicted that from&#xD;
      Baseline to 60 days, MPH will increase total energy expenditure (TEE) when compared with&#xD;
      placebo, mostly through greater resting energy expenditure (REE) and thermic effects of food&#xD;
      (TEF). It is hypothesized that after the 60-day intervention the MPH group will experience a&#xD;
      significantly attenuated reduction in REE compared to placebo. We predict that the MPH group&#xD;
      will lose body weight at 2 months, whereas, it is predicted that there will be no change in&#xD;
      body weight for the placebo. The investigators will also explore the effects of MPH on&#xD;
      macronutrient preference and consumption, and on the rewarding value of energy dense snack&#xD;
      foods. Based on previous findings, the investigators predict that MPH will reduce consumption&#xD;
      of energy dense, high fat/sugar foods but have little effect on consumption of foods low in&#xD;
      calories, fats or sugars. In addition, it is predicted that the reduction in intake of energy&#xD;
      dense, high fat/sugar foods will be mediated by reductions in the rewarding value of food and&#xD;
      impulsivity as measured by well validated computerized simulations. Also explored will be the&#xD;
      effects of MPH on olfaction and it is predicted that compared to placebo, individuals taking&#xD;
      MPH will have reduced smell function. It is also predicted the MPH group will show reduced&#xD;
      appetite sensations, reduced rewarding value of food, reduced impulsivity for snack food, and&#xD;
      reduced palatability ratings of food compared to placebo at 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial design will consist of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled 2 parallel&#xD;
      arm study. The two randomly assigned treatment groups will consist of administrating a&#xD;
      placebo or short-acting MPH two-times daily 1 hour before meals for a period of 2 months (60&#xD;
      consecutive days). Prior to being randomized into either the placebo group or the&#xD;
      experimental (MPH) group, subjects will first have had to respond to a recruitment poster,&#xD;
      newspaper advertisement. Once it is determined with that initial screening that the&#xD;
      participant still meets inclusion criteria, they will be invited to come to the laboratory&#xD;
      for a screening visit to determine whether they meet eligibility criteria, to sign informed&#xD;
      consent, and to take a test dose of MPH in order for a nurse to closely monitor any potential&#xD;
      side-effects prior to starting the 2-times daily dosing of MPH or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will consist of six visits to the laboratory for a total of twenty-four&#xD;
      hours, as follows: there will be an initial clinical screening visit (4 hrs), three repeated&#xD;
      measures test days (6hrs each; two at baseline and one at 60 days), a mid-point visit (1hr),&#xD;
      and a Lunch Box visit (10 minutes to obtain out of laboratory food). School-aged participants&#xD;
      will not have to miss school to participate; if necessary, testing will be able to be&#xD;
      performed over the course of the weekend. After the initial laboratory visit and informed&#xD;
      consent (i.e. clinical screening visit), participants will be randomized at the Baseline 1&#xD;
      visit to one of two treatment groups to either receive placebo or MPH two times daily for a 2&#xD;
      month intervention period that starts at the Baseline 2 visit. In order to track physical&#xD;
      activity energy expenditure, participants will be instructed to wear accelerometers for 1&#xD;
      week between the in lab screening visit and the Baseline 1 visit, and then again while under&#xD;
      MPH or placebo for 1 week between the mid-point visit and the Final repeated measures test&#xD;
      day. Upon leaving the Baseline 1 test day (i.e. no drug or placebo) participants will receive&#xD;
      a 3 day supply of food from which they will exclusively eat from until they return to the lab&#xD;
      4 days later for the Baseline 2 repeated measures test day (i.e. under drug or placebo).&#xD;
      Similarly, 4 days prior to the Final repeated measures test day, participants will again have&#xD;
      to visit the laboratory for their &quot;Lunch Box&quot; visit to obtain their three days' supply of&#xD;
      food from which they will eat exclusively from. Participants will return to the laboratory to&#xD;
      complete the study at the Final (day 60) repeated measures test day after 3 days of eating&#xD;
      from the &quot;Lunch Boxes&quot;. For the 1 hour mid-point visit (at day 30) participants will be&#xD;
      weighed and will report any perceived side-effects from the MPH or placebo. At this mid-point&#xD;
      visit participants will bring in their pill container to verify compliance and to receive&#xD;
      final 30 day supply of drug or placebo. At this time participants will be asked if they have&#xD;
      begun any new medication or have started any over-the-counter medication as part of the&#xD;
      study's safety monitoring protocol. A side-effects check list will also be provided to the&#xD;
      participants upon leaving the Baseline 2 testing session; participants will be informed to&#xD;
      note any perceived side-effects nightly for the first 14 days being on the study medication&#xD;
      and will be instructed to notify the study coordinator as soon as specific side-effects are&#xD;
      noted as being Major.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent and Clinical Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Screening Visit (4 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning the study, a meeting between the study coordinator and the participant will&#xD;
      occur in order to get consent and in order for the participant to ingest a test dose of MPH&#xD;
      under the supervision of a nurse. The study coordinator will contact the participant in order&#xD;
      to arrange a time for the approximately 4 hour meeting. The weight and height (thus BMI) will&#xD;
      be measured upon arrival. The participant will then have to respond to questionnaires, e.g.&#xD;
      the Wender-Utah Rating Scale (to assess traits compatible with ADHD), the Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory (to assess depressive symptoms), the &quot;Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire&quot; (to assess&#xD;
      eating style) and the Drug Abuse Screening Test (to ensure no underlying drug problem). If&#xD;
      the participant is a female they cannot be pregnant to be included in the study; thus a&#xD;
      pregnancy test will be administered and if it is determined that they are pregnant they will&#xD;
      be referred to visit their family physician and excluded from the study. If eligible, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to read and sign the consent form. Eligible participants will then&#xD;
      see a nurse who will administer the all of the measures outlined in the Case Report Form,&#xD;
      e.g., a physical exam, medical history assessment, baseline vital signs, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), etc. The nurse will then administer a test dose of 0.5mg/kg of MPH and for a period of&#xD;
      three hours after the ingestion of MPH the nurse will closely monitor any potential&#xD;
      side-effects of the drug by measuring heart rate, blood pressure, and by following a detailed&#xD;
      side-effects check-list. If at any point the participant rates and of the side effects as&#xD;
      &quot;Prohibitive&quot;, then he/she will be excluded from the study. The participant will also be&#xD;
      excluded from entering the study if they demonstrate an abnormal ECG systolic or if blood&#xD;
      pressure exceeds the baseline reading by 20mmHg or if diastolic blood pressure exceeds the&#xD;
      baseline reading by 10mmHg, BP &gt; 160/100, or resting pulse increased by 20 beats/minute from&#xD;
      the baseline. As part of the comprehensive safety assessment to determine eligibility, the&#xD;
      ECG data file that is collected will be stored via a USB external hard drive and then sent to&#xD;
      CHEO cardiology to be read by a cardiologist. Once it is determined by the cardiologist that&#xD;
      the ECG rhythm is normal, both the cardiologist and the QI will sign off on the Case Report&#xD;
      form, indicating that the participant is eligible for enrollment. If it is determined by the&#xD;
      ECG reading that the participant is not eligible, they will be called up by the study&#xD;
      coordinator and told of the incidental findings and subsequently informed to visit their&#xD;
      family physician to follow-up. The participant may bring the consent form home to further&#xD;
      study its content before signing it. Prior to leaving the initial screening visit&#xD;
      participants will be instructed on how to strap on an omni-directional accelerometer and&#xD;
      instructed on how to fill out the log sheet which gathers information on when the monitors&#xD;
      are worn and when they are taken off, which is needed to evaluate wear time for a seven day&#xD;
      period. Participants will be instructed to return the accelerometers at their next visit,&#xD;
      Baseline 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free and informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial screening visit, if a candidate meets the inclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      coordinator will explain the research protocol to the subject. This will be done in order to&#xD;
      explain in detail the requirements of the protocol and to answer all the questions from&#xD;
      potential participants. If potential participants are still interested to participate in the&#xD;
      study, the coordinator will then distribute, explain and answer questions regarding the&#xD;
      consent form to the participant. The participant will then be asked to sign the informed&#xD;
      consent letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Investigational Product Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      pms-METHYLPHENIDATE (methylphenidate hydrochloride) is a racemate consisting of a 1:1 mixture&#xD;
      of d-methylphenidate (d-MPH) and l-methylphenidate (l-MPH). pms-METHYLPHENIDATE is a mild&#xD;
      central nervous system stimulant with more prominent effects on mental than motor activities.&#xD;
      The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but its stimulant effects are thought&#xD;
      to be due to cortical stimulation and possibly to stimulation of the reticular activating&#xD;
      system. There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby&#xD;
      methylphenidate produces its mental and behavioural effects in children, nor conclusive&#xD;
      evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS). Methylphenidate hydrochloride is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the tablets&#xD;
      following oral administration; however, owing to extensive first-pass metabolism,&#xD;
      bioavailability is low (approx. 30%) and large individual differences exist (11-52%). Peak&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of 10.8 and 7.8 ng/mL were observed, on average, 2 hours after&#xD;
      administration of 0.30 mg/kg in children and adults, respectively. Methylphenidate is&#xD;
      eliminated from the plasma with a mean half-life of 2.4 hours in children and 2.1 hours in&#xD;
      adults. The apparent mean systemic clearance after an oral dose is 10.2 and 10.5 L/h/kg in&#xD;
      children and adults, respectively for a 0.3 mg/kg dose, and 0.565 L/h/kg after an intravenous&#xD;
      dose of the racemate in healthy adult volunteers. These data indicate that the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate in hyperactive children is similar to that in healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers. The apparent distribution volume of methylphenidate in children was&#xD;
      approximately 20 L/kg, with substantial variability (11-33 L/kg). The volume of distribution&#xD;
      after an intravenous dose (Vss) is 2.23 L/kg for the racemate in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following oral administration of methylphenidate, 78-97% of the dose is excreted in the urine&#xD;
      and 1-3% in the feces in the form of metabolites within 48-96 hours. The main urinary&#xD;
      metabolite is ritalinic acid (a-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid, PPAA); unchanged&#xD;
      methylphenidate is excreted in the urine in small quantities (&lt;1%). Peak PPAA plasma&#xD;
      concentrations occurred at approximately the same time as peak methylphenidate&#xD;
      concentrations, however, levels were several-fold greater than those of the unchanged drug.&#xD;
      The half-life of PPAA was approximately twice that of methylphenidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of CHEO Pharmacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Section C.05.010 of the Division 5 Regulations pertains to the sponsor's (i.e. Children's&#xD;
      Hospital of Eastern Ontario) obligations in regards to Good Clinical Practice. The CHEO&#xD;
      pharmacy will have the following obligations-compliant with said Regulations-with respect to&#xD;
      the drug/placebo management: drug acquisition and dispensing, maintenance of inventory and&#xD;
      accountability and reconciliation of records, labelling of study medication, storage of&#xD;
      inventory, and general records such as patient information forms and creating patient&#xD;
      binders. Note that in Division 5, Health Canada mandates that records must be maintained for&#xD;
      a period of 25 years, and the CHEO pharmacy will ensure the maintenance of such record&#xD;
      keeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments and Trial Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Safety Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be performed to determine the safety of MPH Hydrochloride:&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure and pulse); monitoring effects/symptoms (side effects checklist).&#xD;
      Those who report or show heightened blood pressure or heart rate side effects from the test&#xD;
      doss of MPH at the clinical screening visit, e.g., systolic blood pressure exceeding baseline&#xD;
      reading by 20mmHg, diastolic blood pressure exceeding the baseline reading by 10mmHg, BP &gt;&#xD;
      160/100, or resting pulse increased by 20 beats/minute from the baseline reading will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Subjective side effects will be measured for 21 potential side&#xD;
      effects (e.g., headache, nausea, nervousness, etc.) by having subjects rate the intensity of&#xD;
      their symptoms using the following scale : 1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe. A&#xD;
      qualified registered nurse is present throughout the entire session. Furthermore, thorough&#xD;
      emergency plans have been implemented in conjunction with the Children's Hospital of Eastern&#xD;
      Ontario (e.g. code blue) and the University of Ottawa should a crisis arise. In addition, the&#xD;
      research unit has been equipped with a complete first aid unit cart along with an automated&#xD;
      external defibrillator in which all the employees have been trained to operate. All employees&#xD;
      are also required to maintain a valid CPR-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be supplied with a &quot;study enrollment card&quot; that will have the study&#xD;
      title, along with the emergency contact information for the CHEO pharmacy technician (in&#xD;
      control of study blinding) and for the Qualified Investigator (Principal Investigator-PI ).&#xD;
      This card will act as a safeguard if the participant seeks emergency medical help where it is&#xD;
      required to know whether they have been taking drug or placebo, thereby acting as an aid in&#xD;
      the clinical judgment to stop the treatment. The enrollment card will also act to tract&#xD;
      if/when a participant needs to be unblinded to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Management and Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Clinical Research Unit (CHEO-CRU) will be the&#xD;
      coordinating center for this study and the University of Ottawa will the other testing site.&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator and the study coordinator, along with CHEO pharmacy, will be&#xD;
      responsible for the day-to-day operations of the trial. CHEO-CRU will provide the CHEO&#xD;
      pharmacy with the randomization table and will resultantly be the only persons who are&#xD;
      unblinded. The randomization will take place once the Initial Screening Visit is completed&#xD;
      and it is determined that the participant is eligible to participate. Therefore, each&#xD;
      participant will have an equal chance of being randomized to drug or placebo using a computer&#xD;
      generated random number program by a member of the CRU before entering into the Baseline 1&#xD;
      test day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the subject is withdrawn from the study due to an AE, the AE will be&#xD;
      recorded and reported, and the subject will be followed and treated until the abnormal&#xD;
      parameter or symptom has resolved or stabilized. It is up to the clinician and the Data &amp;&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board to determine that the AE is either resolved or that it has reached a&#xD;
      stable state, after which no further follow-up is necessary. Support for this determination&#xD;
      will be documented. The reason for withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the&#xD;
      appropriate case report form (CRF). If a subject is removed from the study, we will continue&#xD;
      the scheduled follow-up with the subject's permission. There will be no changes to the&#xD;
      follow-up schedule, except no study treatment/intervention will be administered. If at any&#xD;
      point a subject no longer wishes to participate in follow-up, or after the three month&#xD;
      follow-up telephone call, participation in the study will be complete. If new evidence&#xD;
      emerges in the literature to indicate that our study dosage is unsafe, the study will be&#xD;
      discontinued and all further qualifying patients will be offered the more effective/safer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety and Monitoring Board&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is an independent group of experts who will&#xD;
      function independently and at arm's length from the Study Investigators and the Steering&#xD;
      Committee of the Study. The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review and evaluate the accumulated study data for participant safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Make recommendations to the Steering Committee based on these reviews regarding the&#xD;
           continuation, modification or termination of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. DSMB members must maintain strict confidentiality concerning all privileged trial&#xD;
           results, and during all phases of DSMB review and deliberations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. No member of the DSMB should have a direct involvement with the conduct of the study. No&#xD;
           member should have financial, proprietary, professional or other interests that may&#xD;
           affect impartial, independent decision-making by the DSMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The DSMB will be notified of all serious unexpected adverse drug reactions and all&#xD;
           deaths within 5 working days of knowledge of the SAE. It is the Qualified Investigator's&#xD;
           responsibility to ensure that the DSMB is apprised of all new safety information&#xD;
           relevant to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The DSMB will be scheduled on a regular basis and as often as necessary. Regular reviews&#xD;
           will be conducted yearly and focused primarily on safety issues. A designated third&#xD;
           party analysis (prepared by a study statistician) will be delivered to the DSMB two&#xD;
           weeks prior to any scheduled review. Prior to study initiation, DSMB members will review&#xD;
           study protocols, informed consents, Data and Safety Monitoring Plans and other relevant&#xD;
           documents as needed (case report forms, manual of procedures, etc.). During the study,&#xD;
           DSMB members will review all study protocol amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Events (AE's) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE's)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any symptom, sign, illness or experience that occurs&#xD;
           while participating in the study, including both during admission and as an outpatient.&#xD;
           Abnormal clinical results will be considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  results in study withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  is associated with clinical signs or symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  is considered by the investigator or Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board to be of&#xD;
                clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious Adverse Event (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
           A SAE is any adverse event that at any dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  is life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  other serious (important event)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  prolonged hospitalization, significantly beyond the expected length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  important medical events&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious Unexpected Adverse drug Reactions are SAEs that are likely to be related to the&#xD;
           study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited&#xD;
           reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may&#xD;
           not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may&#xD;
           jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the events listed&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious Adverse Event Reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
           What to Report&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any SAE that meets the definition of a Reportable Serious Adverse Event&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All life-threatening or fatal adverse events with an attribution of possible,&#xD;
                probable, or definite&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Sponsor Investigator will notify Health Canada (Office of Clinical Trials) for those&#xD;
           events which meet regulatory requirements for expedited reporting, (i.e. events which&#xD;
           are BOTH serious AND unexpected), AND which are thought to be related to protocol&#xD;
           treatment (or for which a causal relationship with protocol treatment cannot be ruled&#xD;
           out).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) report must be filed in the cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  where the ADR is neither fatal nor life-threatening, within 15 days after becoming&#xD;
                aware of the information&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  where it is fatal or life-threatening, immediately where possible and, in any&#xD;
                event, within 7 days after becoming aware of the information&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  within 8 days after having informed Health Canada of the ADR, submit as complete as&#xD;
                possible, a report which an assessment of the importance and implication of any&#xD;
                findings&#xD;
&#xD;
           This includes all serious events that are unexpected and related (i.e. possibly,&#xD;
           probably, or definitely) to protocol therapy. Investigators must notify their Research&#xD;
           Ethics Boards (REBs) and documents related to submission must be retained in the study&#xD;
           binder on site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The submission of these events to the local ethics board should be done as soon as&#xD;
           possible (within 30 days) or per local REB requirements. REB submissions greater than 90&#xD;
           days from the date of notification will be regarded as delinquent and a major deficiency&#xD;
           will be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are&#xD;
           clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require&#xD;
           intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring of AE's/SAE's:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any AE that occurs between the time a study participant/parent signs the informed&#xD;
           consent form and the time he/she completes the telephone follow-up (or at the time of&#xD;
           early discontinuation of the subject from the study for any reason) will be captured and&#xD;
           recorded. At each contact with the subject, the investigator (or designate) will seek&#xD;
           information on adverse events by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intensity of an AE is assessed as mild (usually transient in nature and generally&#xD;
           not interfering with normal activities), moderate (sufficiently discomforting to&#xD;
           interfere with normal activities), and severe (prevents normal activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The maximum clinical intensity of all adverse events will be classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mild: Signs and symptoms that can easily be tolerated or ignored.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Moderate: Symptoms that cause discomfort but are tolerable; they cannot be ignored&#xD;
                and affect concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe: Symptoms that affect usual daily activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The attribution of all adverse events will be classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unrelated to investigational agent/intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Not related The AE is clearly not related to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Doubtful The AE is not likely to be related to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Related to investigational agent/intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Possible The AE may be related to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Probable The AE is likely related to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Definite The AE is clearly related to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is any untoward medical occurrence that the PI determines&#xD;
           is likely related to the study drug (attribution of possible, probably, or definite).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are no field studies looking at the effects of MPH on food intake (neither as a&#xD;
           main outcome nor secondary outcome). Therefore, our only way of estimating effects sizes&#xD;
           is extrapolating from our previous laboratory studies. In a laboratory study by the&#xD;
           investigators, an effect size of .93 was attained in 9 obese adult males for the primary&#xD;
           outcome of food intake with mean energy intake in kilocalories for MPH (0.5 mg/kg) and&#xD;
           placebo of 843.5 + 393.4 and 1095.9 + 271.1, respectively. In a second study in 14&#xD;
           normal weight adult males and females, an effect size of .69 was attained, favouring MPH&#xD;
           (0.5 mg/kg) for food intake in an ad libitum buffet meal with mean difference in kcals&#xD;
           of -133 (1099 for MPH minus 1232 for placebo), with a standard deviation of 192.0 kcals&#xD;
           for the paired differences based on t-tests. Based on the more conservative effect size&#xD;
           of .69, it would be possible to detect a significant difference in kcals consumed over a&#xD;
           60-day period between MPH and placebo using a paired t-test with an alpha of 0.05, power&#xD;
           of 0.80, with 18 participants per group. Thus, the plan to include 40 participants per&#xD;
           group should enable the investigators to look at trends on other energy balance&#xD;
           (secondary outcome) variables, accounting for an expected drop-out of 5-10%. The plan is&#xD;
           to run 3 new participants/month, thus the experimental part of the study should last&#xD;
           approximately 14 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Role of Investigators/Staff&#xD;
&#xD;
           Philippe Robaey, as Principal Investigator, is a physician and child Psychiatrist and&#xD;
           Director of the ADHD clinic at CHEO. He has many years of clinical and research&#xD;
           experience with MPH. Dr. Robaey will be responsible for the medical aspects of the study&#xD;
           such as prescribing the study medication under double blind conditions, as well as&#xD;
           overseeing the evaluation of vital sign and side effects of MPH. Dr. Eric Doucet, as&#xD;
           Co-Principal Investigator (C0-PI) is a Full Professor of Human Kinetics at University of&#xD;
           Ottawa, Faculty of Health Sciences. Dr. Doucet is an expert in the measurement of energy&#xD;
           balance measures using the proposed methods. The study of the adult population will be&#xD;
           conducted in Dr. Doucet's Behavioural Metabolic Research Unit, where our previous MPH&#xD;
           cross-over trial was done, and he will oversee the coordination and supervision of the&#xD;
           experimental testing procedures. Dr. Gary Goldfield, as Co-Principal Investigator&#xD;
           (CO-PI), is a clinical psychologist and Investigator with the Healthy Active Living and&#xD;
           Obesity Research Group at the CHEO Research Institute. He will oversee the assessment of&#xD;
           psychiatric inclusion criteria evaluated by questionnaire and structured clinical&#xD;
           interview, as well as the measurement of the reinforcing (rewarding) value of food. Dr.&#xD;
           Jameason Cameron, as co-Principal investigator, is a postdoc and a research coordinator&#xD;
           at CHEO. He has extensive experience with feeding studies and weight loss trials, and&#xD;
           measures of food reward and smell function. Dr. Cameron will be responsible for the&#xD;
           day-to-day testing and to supervise the PhD student who will be co-coordinating the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Differences between groups (MPH vs. placebo) in energy intake and energy expenditure&#xD;
           variables, as well as body weight, impulsivity, olfaction, hunger, satiety, and the&#xD;
           reinforcing value of food will be evaluated by paired t-tests and repeated measures&#xD;
           analyses of variance (ANOVA). Hypotheses of mechanisms linking MPH and reduced food&#xD;
           intake and weight loss via reduced food reward will be explored using multiple&#xD;
           regression mediational analyses as described by Baron and Kenny.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
           All &quot;source document&quot; data collected from the study visits, except data that would&#xD;
           indicate randomization assignment, will be maintained in a secure location within the&#xD;
           Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. The investigator will verify that all data&#xD;
           entries in the CRF are accurate and correct. Data collection is the responsibility of&#xD;
           the research staff at the site under the supervision of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
           During the study the investigator will maintain complete and accurate documentation for&#xD;
           the study and keep all original source documents. All adverse events will be graded,&#xD;
           assessed by severity and causality and reviewed by the site investigator. Original&#xD;
           subject records (source documents) will be reviewed during the course of the monitoring&#xD;
           to verify the accuracy of the CRF's. This review will be conducted according to the peer&#xD;
           monitoring plan. The Investigator(s) institutions(s) will permit trial-related&#xD;
           monitoring, audits, REB(s) review and regulatory inspections(s) by providing direct&#xD;
           access to source data and documentation. The medical (hospital/practice) records for&#xD;
           each patient should contain information to provide a means by which study data can be&#xD;
           verified. Patient information collected electronically will be available for review when&#xD;
           the study site is monitored or audited. Entry of these data in SPSS will be performed&#xD;
           primarily by the PhD student, but partly by the co-Principal investigators. Subjects&#xD;
           will be assigned a code number to maintain blinding to data management staff, with the&#xD;
           corresponding list of names associated with subject codes kept by the pharmacist in a&#xD;
           secure filing cabinet. Databases will be stored on a secure server, with nightly backup.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Publication Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           By the end of the second year of the study the investigators plan on publishing 2&#xD;
           peer-review articles, one at the international journal Physiology and Behavior&#xD;
           highlighting the secondary metabolic outcomes, and the other at the American Journal of&#xD;
           Clinical Nutrition, highlighting the main outcome of the influence of MPH on appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will be conducted according to Canadian and international standards of Good&#xD;
           Clinical Practice and the Health Canada, Food and Drug Act, Part C, Division 5, Drugs&#xD;
           for clinical Trials Involving Human Subjects, and in full conformance with principles of&#xD;
           the &quot;Declaration of Helsinki&quot;. The CHEO research institute policies and standard&#xD;
           operating procedures will also be followed. This protocol and any amendments will be&#xD;
           submitted to the CHEO REB for formal approval to conduct the study. The decision of the&#xD;
           REB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator. All&#xD;
           participants for this study will be provided a consent form and assent form if&#xD;
           applicable, describing this study and providing sufficient information for participants&#xD;
           to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. The consent form&#xD;
           will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the REB. The formal&#xD;
           consent of a participant, using the REB-approved consent form, will be obtained before&#xD;
           that participant is submitted to any study procedure. The consent form must be signed by&#xD;
           the participant or legally acceptable surrogate, and the investigator-designated&#xD;
           research professional obtaining the consent.&#xD;
