    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the reliability of measurements of arterial stiffness (pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity (PWV), pulse wave contour analysis (PWA), central augmentation index (AIx) and pulse&#xD;
      pressure (PP)) in atrial fibrillation (AF). For this purpose 30 AF patients scheduled for&#xD;
      electrical cardioversion will be included. PWV and PWA measurements will be carried out&#xD;
      before and after cardioversion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In recent years the role of arterial stiffness in the development of cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      has garnered attention. Indeed, arterial stiffness is now well accepted as one of the most&#xD;
      important determinants of increasing systolic and pulse pressure thus playing a germane role&#xD;
      in the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. Longitudinal epidemiological studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the independent predictive value of arterial stiffness for cardiovascular events&#xD;
      after adjustment for classical cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial stiffness is now a&#xD;
      recognized intermediate endpoint for cardiovascular events. The pressure wave speed in large&#xD;
      arteries is directly related to square root of the elastic modulus of the arterial wall&#xD;
      (Moens-Korteweg Equation). Carotid-femoral PWV is considered the gold standard method for&#xD;
      assessing aortic stiffness. The stiffness gradient along the aorta and central arteries,&#xD;
      local arterial branchings and narrowing of the arterial lumen cause partial reflections of&#xD;
      forward pressure waves traveling back to the central aorta. Forward and reflected pressure&#xD;
      waves overlap, and the final amplitude and shape of the pulse pressure wave are determined by&#xD;
      the phase timing of these component waves. In the aorta, forward and reflected waves are not&#xD;
      in phase. In subjects with low PWV, reflected waves reach the central arteries during&#xD;
      late-systole and diastole, increasing the aortic pressure in early diastole, which is&#xD;
      physiologically advantageous. With increasing PWV, the reflected waves return earlier and&#xD;
      impact on the central arteries during systole, thereby augmenting systolic and left&#xD;
      ventricular pressure. This is why increasing PWV is accompanied by increasing AIx (defined as&#xD;
      the difference between the second and first systolic pressure peak) and central PP. AIx and&#xD;
      central PP depend on the speed of wave travel, the amplitude of reflected wave and the&#xD;
      duration and pattern of ventricular ejection, especially with respect to change in heart rate&#xD;
      and ventricular contractility. Where PWV is considered a direct measure of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness, central PP and AIx are only indirect, surrogate measures. However, they provide&#xD;
      additional information concerning wave reflections. Whether PWV, AIx and central PP&#xD;
      measurements are influenced by the presence of AF is unknown. Studying AF patients before and&#xD;
      after elective electrical cardioversion offers an appropriate setting to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of heart rate and rhytm on PWV, AIx and central PP. Patient specific confounding factors are&#xD;
      minimized because each patient serves as its own control.&#xD;
