      compared to placebo, administered with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS), in adult&#xD;
      patients with severe AD who are not adequately controlled with, or are intolerant to, oral&#xD;
      Cyclosporine A (CSA), or when this treatment is currently not medically advisable.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score is used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD) and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. EASI-75 responders were the participants who achieved ≥75% overall improvement in EASI score from baseline to Week 16. The analysis population for efficacy analyses is the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated (as randomized).</description>

    <description>The Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]).

    <description>IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5 point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Participants with IGA score of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 16 were reported. The analysis population for efficacy analyses is the FAS.

    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QOL). The 10 questions assessed QOL over the past week, with an overall scoring of 0 (absent disease) to 30 (severe disease); a high score is indicative of a poor QOL.

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The type, amount, frequency, and potency of topical products used during the study were recorded at home by participants in a medication diary. Participants returned TCS tubes at each clinic visit up until week 16, and these tubes were weighed by the site staff to determine the actual amount of TCS used. During the 16-week placebo-controlled study treatment period, medium-potency TCS dosing frequency was symptom-based (IGA score) adjusted every 4 weeks per the protocol-specified tapering algorithm. The analysis population for efficacy analyses is the FAS. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated (as randomized).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item scale, with 7 items relating to anxiety and 7 relating to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3, for possible scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 21 (severe symptoms) for each of the anxiety and depression subscales. Recommended cut-off scores for both subscales to identify psychiatric distress are: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression. Scores less than 7 do not indicate psychiatric distress. Total score is the sum of the two sub-scores.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 73 sites in Europe. A total of 390 participants were screened between 28 Jan 2016 and 14 Sep 2016. Of those, 325 participants were enrolled into the study and randomized. Sixty participants were considered screen failures, mostly due to unmet eligibility criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After providing informed consent, participants were assessed for study eligibility. Screening assessments were performed between day -28 &amp; day -15, prior to randomization. Participants who met eligibility criteria at baseline (day 1) were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab (weekly [QW] or every 2 weeks [Q2W]) or placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received one subcutaneous (SC) injection of matching placebo once per week (QW) (following two SC injections on day 1) from Week 1 to Week 15. All participants required to undergo treatment with topical corticosteroids (TCS) using standardized regimen that continued through the end of treatment period (Week 16). At week 16, participants could roll over into an open-label extension (OLE) study (R668-AD-1225), if considered eligible. Participants who did not enter the OLE study were followed for up to an additional 12 weeks for safety ([Week 28, end of study (EOS) period]).</description>

          <description>Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool used to report intensity of participant's pruritus (itch), both average &amp; maximum intensity, during 24-hr recall period. Participants were asked two questions: 1) For average itch intensity: how would you rate your itch overall (on average) during the previous 24 hrs; &amp; 2) For maximum itch intensity: How would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hrs? Both questions were rated on a scale: 0-10 with 0=no itch &amp; 10=worst itch imaginable.</description>

          <description>The HADS is a 14-item scale, with 7 items relating to anxiety and 7 relating to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3, for possible scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 21 (severe symptoms) for each of the anxiety and depression subscales. Recommended cut-off scores for both subscales to identify psychiatric distress are: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression. Scores less than 7 do not indicate psychiatric distress. Total score is the sum of the two sub-scores.</description>

          <title>Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score</title>
          <description>IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1= almost clear; 2= mild; 3= moderate; 4= severe) based on erythema and papulation/ infiltration. Therapeutic response is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).</description>

          <description>The Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). The analysis population for efficacy analyses is the FAS. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated (as randomized).

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Weekly Dose of Topical Corticosteroid (TCS) Use During Treatment Period</title>
          <description>The type, amount, frequency, and potency of topical products used during the study were recorded at home by participants in a medication diary. Participants returned TCS tubes at each clinic visit up until week 16, and these tubes were weighed by the site staff to determine the actual amount of TCS used. During the 16-week placebo-controlled study treatment period, medium-potency TCS dosing frequency was symptom-based (IGA score) adjusted every 4 weeks per the protocol-specified tapering algorithm. The analysis population for efficacy analyses is the FAS. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated (as randomized). Here &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; = Participants who were evaluable for this endpoint.</description>

        <description>The HADS is a 14-item scale, with 7 items relating to anxiety and 7 relating to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3, for possible scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 21 (severe symptoms) for each of the anxiety and depression subscales. Recommended cut-off scores for both subscales to identify psychiatric distress are: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression. Scores less than 7 do not indicate psychiatric distress. Total score is the sum of the two sub-scores.</description>
