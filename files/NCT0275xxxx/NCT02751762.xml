      The purpose of this study is to quantify the serious risks of misuse, abuse, and addiction&#xD;
      associated with long-term use of opioid analgesics for management of chronic pain, among&#xD;
      patients prescribed opioid products.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked the companies that are New Drug Application&#xD;
      (NDA) holders of extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids to conduct one or more studies&#xD;
      to provide quantitative estimates of the serious risks of misuse, abuse, and addiction&#xD;
      associated with long-term use of opioid analgesics for management of chronic pain, among&#xD;
      patients prescribed opioid products. Although abuse and misuse of prescription opioids have&#xD;
      increased over the past decade, there is debate about the magnitude of misuse, abuse, and&#xD;
      addiction among patients who are treated with opioids for chronic pain. Further, although&#xD;
      there appears to be comorbidity of opioid use disorders with other substance use and&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders, there is insufficient data to estimate how the risk of these outcomes&#xD;
      varies by the presence of risk factors among patients treated with opioids long-term. This&#xD;
      study seeks to fill that gap. The primary objective is to quantify the serious risks of&#xD;
      misuse, abuse, and addiction associated with long-term use of opioid analgesics for&#xD;
      management of chronic pain among patients prescribed opioid products. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from seven Health Care System Research Network (HCSRN) sites; one U.S. Department&#xD;
      of Veterans Affairs (VA) site; and clinics participating in two Primary Care Practice-Based&#xD;
      Research Network sites. The data sources for the proposed study will be: 1) patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes through in-person interviews (or phone if unavailable to participate in-person), 2)&#xD;
      web-based assessments (or phone if unable to complete via web), and 3) electronic medical&#xD;
      record and claims data. The study design includes two components: 1) a prospective&#xD;
      longitudinal study of patients who have recently initiated long-term opioid therapy or&#xD;
      initiated ER/LA opioid therapy, and 2) a cross-sectional study of patients who have been&#xD;
      treated with opioids (including at least one ER/LA opioid) for at least one year.&#xD;
