      The main purpose is to develop and test an IT-infrastructure to provide more individualized&#xD;
      ways of inviting and reaching women who have not participated, despite having been invited&#xD;
      with annual reminders, in cervix cancer screening program during a ten year period.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Non-participation in the screening program is the main risk factor for cervical&#xD;
      cancer (Andrae et al JNCI, 2008). Therefore it is important to reduce barriers to screening&#xD;
      and facilitate participation in the screening program for cervical cancer. Offering&#xD;
      self-sampling kits for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been examined in several&#xD;
      research studies as a way to reach women who have not responded to screening invitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from a population-based, randomized study in western Sweden concluded that by&#xD;
      offering HPV self-sampling kits to screening non-attendees, 17% of cervical cancer cases&#xD;
      could be avoided. Offering self-sampling kits to women who have not attended screening in the&#xD;
      organized program, can lead to greater participation without substantial increases in the&#xD;
      overall health care costs. While there is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of&#xD;
      self-sampling, it is unclear how this strategy can be implemented effectively in the context&#xD;
      of an organized screening program. An alternative is to offer women the chance to speak with&#xD;
      a coordinating midwife who can answer questions and address concerns regarding screening. It&#xD;
      is unclear how the results of different research studies should be put into practical use&#xD;
      within an organized screening program. Currently, women who have not attended screening are&#xD;
      sent an annual reminder invitation. We want to examine whether these alternative strategies&#xD;
      (self-sampling and contact with a midwife) may work as well, or better, than current strategy&#xD;
      of reminder invitations to non-attenders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM The aim of this randomized health services study is therefore both to test the&#xD;
      feasibility of providing alternative strategies instead of the customary reminder invitations&#xD;
      to women in Stockholm (so-called feasibility study, primary aim), and whether such strategies&#xD;
      will increase overall participation in screening (secondary aim).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY A new IT infrastructure for ordering a self-sampling kit has&#xD;
      been developed by LabMed, KI. This in conjunction with the screening database, will be used&#xD;
      to identify and invite women who are long-term non-participants in cervical screening. Women&#xD;
      who have not participated for ten years, despite annual reminder invitations, will be&#xD;
      identified and randomized to one of four strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A validated HPV self-sampling kit will be sent directly to women with a study invitation&#xD;
           letter and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An invitation to order an HPV self-sampling kit through an online application will be&#xD;
           sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An invitation to call the coordinating midwife with questions and concerns regarding&#xD;
           screening will be sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The standard annual reminder invitation will be sent (control, routine practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who choose to participate will be sampled and monitored according to the standards of&#xD;
      care in the regional cancer screening program. HPV-positive women will be followed by&#xD;
      colposcopy and biopsy according to standard clinical guidelines. Women will be invited over&#xD;
      the course of 3 months. All letters will be printed in advance with pre-marked dates. Batches&#xD;
      will be sent out weekly and checked against changes in the population registry data (for&#xD;
      individuals that have moved, taken a smear, died, or unregistered, invitation letters will be&#xD;
      sorted out and those individuals marked in the database).&#xD;

      2 Notation and abbreviations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PNR = person nummer, personal ID number 3 Study population 3.1 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who have lived in Stockholm for the past 10 years and have been sent annual&#xD;
           reminder at least once per year for 10 years without attending screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific selection process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Include women without an &quot;H-prov&quot; on record for the past 10 years Include women have actively&#xD;
      been sent a reminder invitation (invitation type=1) during 10 years time. In other words,&#xD;
      resident in Stockholm for the past 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Include women over the age of 33 3.2 Exclusion criteria Women who have opted out of the&#xD;
      screening program Hysterectomized Return to sender Changed PNR Women who are marked as&#xD;
      Expired=1. Women who have reason marked for being unregistered but are not marked as is&#xD;
      unregistered=1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are due to receive their reminder invitation in the next 3 months 4 Statistical&#xD;
      analyses Selection of the study population Randomization A random selection of 8000 women&#xD;
      will be chosen from all women meeting the study inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These 8000 women will be randomized to the 4 study arms (age-stratified 30-50 and 51-60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of the study population and the randomization to study arms will be carried out&#xD;
      by Anna Stoltenberg, Statistician at RCC and outside of the study group 1.&#xD;
