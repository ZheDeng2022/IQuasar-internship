  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how biochemical markers in blood, balance&#xD;
      disturbances, and cognitive performance are related to brain blood flow changes after a&#xD;
      concussion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparisons will be made between control data and data following a concussion collected from&#xD;
      athletes participating in contact-collision sports. For those suffering a concussion,&#xD;
      comparisons will be made between day 3 (acute phase), day 21 (recovery phase), and 3 months&#xD;
      post-concussion.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change in Control, 3 days post concussion, 21 days post concussion, and 3 months post concussion</time_frame>
    <description>Subject's cerebral blood flow regulation (cm/sec) at rest, during a cognitive test, and during a breathing test will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>Control, 3 days post concussion, 21 days post concussion, 3 months post concussion</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will have their blood drawn so investigators can look at biomarkers in their blood. The biomarkers will be Tau, a-Spectrin N-Terminal Fragment, Neuron-specific enolase, Ubiquitin C-Terminal hydrolase L1, S100B, and Glial fibrillary acidic protein.</description>

    <measure>Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Control, 3 days post concussion, 21 days post concussion, 3 months post concussion</time_frame>
