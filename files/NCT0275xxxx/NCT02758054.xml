  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to evaluate a patient navigation intervention among a sample of 446&#xD;
      individuals referred for CT-based lung cancer screening in an urban safety-net setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Widespread implementation of CT-based lung cancer screening is underway, but its impact on&#xD;
      cancer morbidity and mortality can only be achieved IF people are screened at appropriate&#xD;
      intervals and abnormal findings are appropriately assessed. The degree to which individuals,&#xD;
      especially those from medically underserved populations with highest lung cancer risks, will&#xD;
      adhere to the complex, multi-step process of CT-based lung cancer screening has emerged as a&#xD;
      key question with immediate need for solution. Specific aims of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: Compare rates of completion for clinically recommended steps in the lung cancer&#xD;
           screening process between patients referred for CT-based lung cancer screening who are&#xD;
           randomized to the navigation intervention versus patients who receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: Compare changes in patient-reported outcomes, including satisfaction with care,&#xD;
           psychosocial distress, and tobacco use between patients in the navigation intervention&#xD;
           versus those who receive usual care for the CT-based lung cancer screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3 (Exploratory): Explore whether differences seen in Aims 1 and 2 are moderated&#xD;
           theory-based patient attitudes and beliefs (perceived susceptibility, severity of lung&#xD;
           cancer, perceived benefits/barriers to screening, self-efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will offer unprecedented insight into implementation of lung cancer screening for&#xD;
      high-risk individuals in underserved settings. Findings will show whether navigation&#xD;
      interventions increase adherence to the screening process and affect patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes among underserved populations. The proposed program aims to address these issues for&#xD;
      lung cancer screening at its inception, rather than after disparities in screening uptake&#xD;
      have already emerged.&#xD;
