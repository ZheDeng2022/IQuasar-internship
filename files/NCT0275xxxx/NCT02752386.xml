  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a novel form of biofeedback training can help&#xD;
      individuals regulate their pain more effectively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relaxation is a low-cost treatment for managing pain with little or no side effects. The&#xD;
      proposed study will use a novel biofeedback procedure to try to enhance the ability of&#xD;
      relaxation to engage pain inhibition. Specifically, a biofeedback system will be used to&#xD;
      provide training in conditioned pain regulation. The biofeedback system will monitor the&#xD;
      trainee's level of sympathetic arousal and use it to control the intensity of painful&#xD;
      stimulations delivered to the trainee during biofeedback. So when the trainee successfully&#xD;
      relaxes (and reduced arousal), the intensity is lowered and produces pain relief. Efficacy of&#xD;
      the training will be tested in a randomized controlled trial in which healthy, pain-free&#xD;
      trainees are assigned to receive 3 training sessions or 3 sessions of a control procedure (2&#xD;
      other procedures will serve as controls; 3 groups total). The aim will be to assess whether&#xD;
      the training results in inhibition of experimental pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex&#xD;
      (NFR, a physiological marker of spinal pain signaling) to determine whether brain-to-spinal&#xD;
      cord inhibitory circuits are engaged.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive brief training in relaxation and biofeedback to develop basic skills in relaxation/arousal reduction. Then they will receive instructions to relax and reduce arousal as they view graphical arousal feedback. Electric stimulations will be delivered throughout the biofeedback to provide pain relief when relaxation is achieved.</description>
