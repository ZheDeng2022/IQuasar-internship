      To date, the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rule for identifying&#xD;
      children who are at very low risk of clinically-important traumatic brain injuries after&#xD;
      minor head trauma has not been validated prospectively in an independent population. Our goal&#xD;
      was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the PECARN clinical decision rule in a French&#xD;
      pediatric population in multiple clinical settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head injury is a frequent reason for consultation with pediatric emergencies, over 95% are&#xD;
      mild head injury defined by a Glasgow score greater than or equal to 13. In October 2009, the&#xD;
      Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network has published a rule clinical decision&#xD;
      support of mild head injury of the child with the aim to identify children at very low risk&#xD;
      for clinically severe intracranial lesions in order to avoid the use of CT and unnecessary&#xD;
      exposure to radiation ionizing. This clinical decision rule constructed from a multicenter&#xD;
      prospective cohort 42,412 American children allows on anamnestic and clinical elements to&#xD;
      guide medical decision for conducting brain imaging, hospital monitoring or discharge home&#xD;
      placing the child in three levels of risk of clinically severe intracranial lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since March 2012, the French Emergency Medicine Society recommends for the treatment of mild&#xD;
      head trauma the child's use of the clinical decision rule provided that it is the subject of&#xD;
      a validation study externally. Indeed, after the construction phase and before its daily&#xD;
      application, a clinical decision rule must be subject to an broad validation process so that&#xD;
      its predictive performance can be definitively established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' work aims to conduct this broad validation study prospective multicenter&#xD;
      way in a French pediatric population, as recommended by the French Emergency Medicine&#xD;
      Society, in order to confirm or deny its predictive performance and allow its application and&#xD;
      generalization. The investigators will check and if the clinical decision rule is adapted or&#xD;
      not to the management of mild head injuries in the French pediatric population.&#xD;
