    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a wide-spread disease accompanied by strongly increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality due to micro- and macrovascular complications. However, in studies with patients&#xD;
      suffering from diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2), early changes and impairments in large and&#xD;
      small blood vessels as well as organ damage (e. g. to the kidneys) have been only&#xD;
      insufficiently investigated (1). The newest substance class in oral antidiabetics, i. e.&#xD;
      SGLT-2-inhibitors (such as empagliflozin) cause an increased renal excretion of glucose. In&#xD;
      addition, the concurrent increased sodium excretion brings about an improvement of vascular&#xD;
      function and thus a decrease in blood pressure. In the EMP-REG-OUTCOME study (2), the&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality rate was significantly lower in the empagliflozin group (3.7% versus&#xD;
      5.9%; 38% relative RR) compared to placebo.For another new substance class, the&#xD;
      dipeptidylpeptidase-4-inhibitors, a number of pleiotropic effects have been described (3). In&#xD;
      one of our recently conducted trials, we could demonstrate a positive effect of linagliptin&#xD;
      on renal an inflammatory parameters compared to placebo (4). Thus, the combination of both&#xD;
      substance classes with regard to positive effects on micro- and macrocirculation, even though&#xD;
      not sufficiently proven as yet, suggests itself. The therapy with metformin and long-acting&#xD;
      insulin (BOT), as well as a twofold oral medication is possible according to the&#xD;
      recommendations of the &quot;Deutsche Diabetes Gesellschaft (DDG)&quot; and the positional paper of the&#xD;
      &quot;American Diabetes Association (ADA)&quot;. Accordingly, the aim of the present paper is the&#xD;
      analysis of the effects of a combined therapy with empagliflozin plus linagliptin compared to&#xD;
      metformin plus insulin glargine on renal and vascular changes in type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

      Diabetes mellitus, considered at the beginning as a metabolic disorder, mutates into a&#xD;
      predominantly vascular disease, once its duration extends over several years or/and when&#xD;
      additional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors coexist, in particular arterial hypertension. As&#xD;
      a consequence, treatment of type 2 diabetes should focus not only on metabolic control but&#xD;
      also on improving the vascular structure and function in the micro- and macrocirculation (1).&#xD;
      Glomerular hyperfiltration and hyperperfusion pointing to altered intraglomerular&#xD;
      hemodynamics, e.g. reduced preglomerular (i.e. resistance of the afferent arteriole [Ra])&#xD;
      resistance and increased postglomerular (i.e. resistance of the efferent arteriole [Re])&#xD;
      resistance (resulting in an increased intraglomerular pressure [Pglom]) are considered to be&#xD;
      pivotal hemodynamic hallmarks of renal impairment in early diabetes (2). Endothelium&#xD;
      dysfunction is a key pathogenetic process leading to increased leakage of albumin through the&#xD;
      glomerular barrier and represents a pivotal determinant of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)&#xD;
      (3; 4). Poor glycemic control is related to hyperperfusion and increased basal nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO) activity secondary to increased oxidative stress that leads to impaired endothelial&#xD;
      function in early diabetes (5). Indeed, endothelial function increased after reducing&#xD;
      oxidative stress as evidenced by the results with the infusion of vitamin C (6). The&#xD;
      assessment of pulse wave velocity (PWV), pulse wave analysis (PWA), central (aortic) systolic&#xD;
      pressure and pulse pressure, forward and backward wave amplitude are tools to detect early&#xD;
      vascular changes related to a faster wave reflection in the arterial tree and are considered&#xD;
      valid intermediate (surrogate) endpoints of vascular damage (7; 8). These parameters are only&#xD;
      infrequently measured in studies with type 2 diabetes (9), mainly due to lack of expertise&#xD;
      required to assess these vascular and renal markers, and lack of awareness that vascular&#xD;
      changes are the key prognostic factor in type 2 diabetes. Empagliflozin is a novel selective&#xD;
      inhibitor of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) that has been shown to improve&#xD;
      glycemic control after 12, and 24 weeks as well as after 1 year (10). Empagliflozin produced&#xD;
      dose dependent increases in glucosuria and clinically meaningful changes of glycemic&#xD;
      parameters in type 2 diabetes (e.g. Glycosylated Hemoglobin [HbA1c]), in addition to weight&#xD;
      loss and blood pressure reduction. In parallel to glucosuria, sodium is excreted in the urine&#xD;
      and loss of sodium leads to a less reactive contraction of the small arteries in response to&#xD;
      sympathetic activity, angiotensin II and catecholamines. The reduction in blood pressure&#xD;
      might be related to weight loss and loss of intravascular volume and sodium content as well&#xD;
      as to improved vascular function. In the EMPA-REG-OUTCOME trial (11) the empagliflozin group&#xD;
      had significantly lower rates of death from CV causes (3.7%, vs. 5.9% in the placebo group;&#xD;
      38% relative risk reduction), hospitalization for heart failure (2.7% and 4.1%, respectively;&#xD;
      35% relative risk reduction), and death from any cause (5.7% and 8.3%, respectively; 32%&#xD;
      relative risk reduction). These beneficial effects on hard outcome parameters might be&#xD;
      related to the effects of empagliflozin described above. Furthermore, among patients&#xD;
      receiving empagliflozin, there was admittedly an increased rate of genital infection but no&#xD;
      increased incidence in other adverse events or any other safety parameter was observed.&#xD;
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, the other new drug class of antidiabetic agents,&#xD;
      are also attractive agents to treat type 2 diabetes. So far, the predominant focus was on its&#xD;
      antidiabetic efficacy, but several pleiotropic effects of DPP-4 inhibitors have been&#xD;
      described (12). Indeed, we observed beneficial renal effects with linagliptin, e.g. preserved&#xD;
      preglomerular resistance and NO activity in the renal vascular bed, compared to placebo, as&#xD;
      well as reduced inflammatory markers (13). Thus, to combine empagliflozin with linagliptin is&#xD;
      obvious and the antiglycemic potency and safety have been and still are examined in a large&#xD;
      phase 3 program (14). Moreover, due to the pleiotropic effects of these 2 compounds&#xD;
      (described above), synergistic beneficial effects on the micro- and macrocirculation&#xD;
      (vascular and renal effects) can be expected (though not yet proven) and may explain to great&#xD;
      extent the observed beneficial effects of empagliflozin on CV death and total mortality (11).&#xD;
      According to the guidelines the combination of insulin and metformin is still, however,&#xD;
      considered a valid and well established combination to control hyperglycemia. However,&#xD;
      according to the update of the Position Statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)&#xD;
      and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) advancing to dual oral combination,&#xD;
      and even triple oral antiglycemic therapy is a recommended alternative (15). Hence, at least&#xD;
      when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, the combination of DPP-4 inhibitors and&#xD;
      SGLT-2 inhibitors may be a preferably choice. The goal of the current proposal is to prove&#xD;
      the hypothesis that at similar levels of glycemic control the combination empagliflozin and&#xD;
      linagliptin exert beneficial effects on the renal and vascular endothelium and on vascular&#xD;
      surrogate endpoints in patients with type 2 diabetes as opposed to the combination of&#xD;
      metformin and insulin.&#xD;
