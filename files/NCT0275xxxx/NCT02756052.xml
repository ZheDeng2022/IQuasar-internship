  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent changes in medical training environments and restrictive work-hour regulations have&#xD;
      greatly impacted trainees, limiting the number of opportunities to gain proficiency in&#xD;
      procedural skills. Reports suggest that medical residents lack confidence in their ability to&#xD;
      perform certain medical procedures, and program directors often do not believe their&#xD;
      residents can operate independently in major procedures. Simulator based task training (SBTT)&#xD;
      has provided a safe and ethically appropriate method of skill acquisition but training&#xD;
      opportunities remain limited. Methods to enhance motor learning during these training&#xD;
      opportunities have not been described. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is an&#xD;
      emerging form of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been shown to improve motor&#xD;
      learning. tDCS has been shown to enhance increasingly complex skill acquisition. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to examine if tDCS can improve the acquisition and retention of&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgical skill. The investigators propose a double blind, sham-controlled&#xD;
      randomized trial applying tDCS during evidence-based SBTT of medical students and surgical&#xD;
      residents, to determine if brain stimulation can enhance training effects and long-term skill&#xD;
      acquisition. Even a modest enhancement carries the potential to transform medicosurgical&#xD;
      skills training.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Recent changes in medical training environments have resulted in many trainees&#xD;
      lacking sufficient opportunity to acquire specific skills necessary for their specialty. New&#xD;
      methods to enhance the acquisition and retention of medical and surgical skills are required&#xD;
      to ensure the quality of the future physician workforce. Transcranial direct-current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging method of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been show&#xD;
      to safely enhance motor learning in adults and children. Even a modest enhancement of&#xD;
      acquisition and retention of medical-surgical skill with tDCS carries the potential to&#xD;
      accelerate skill training for health care providers, thereby contributing to greater training&#xD;
      efficiency and improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess whether tDCS can enhance the acquisition&#xD;
      and retention of laparoscopic surgical ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:This study has been approval by the University of Calgary Research Ethics Board&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, double blind, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the ability of tDCS to&#xD;
      enhance learning and retention of laparoscopic skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation: The tDCS methods used are based on best-available&#xD;
      evidence and practices, and will be applied in a standardized fashion by experienced&#xD;
      investigators. Anodal tDCS will be delivered through saline-soaked sponge electrodes using a&#xD;
      NeuroConn Direct-Current Stimulator (NeuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany). The anode will be centered&#xD;
      2cm posterior to the left primary motor cortex (localized using the 10-20 EEG System), with&#xD;
      the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital area. Both anodal and sham tDCS groups will&#xD;
      have the current ramped up to 1milliamp over 30 seconds. In the anodal tDCS group, the&#xD;
      current will be held for 20 minutes. In the sham tDCS condition, the current will be held for&#xD;
      only 60 seconds (no changes in cortical excitability) followed by a 30 second ramp-down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Medical students (years 1-3) and general surgery residents (Post-Graduate Year&#xD;
      1-5) from the Cumming School of Medicine (University of Calgary) will be recruited. To ensure&#xD;
      comparable baseline skills, trainees will be excluded if they have undergone formal&#xD;
      laparoscopic training in the past 3 months (medical students only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations are based on the performance measures for the pattern cutting score,&#xD;
      determined through pilot studies (discussed below). Based on a two-fold greater improvement&#xD;
      in score at post-training, power of 90% and type-1 error of 0.05, the investigators estimate&#xD;
      a sample size of a minimum of 48 participants (n=24 per stimulation condition, with an equal&#xD;
      number of residents and medical students per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A short questionnaire will be completed to determine demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, including: gender, age, level of training, date of last completed&#xD;
      Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery course (if applicable), how many times participants have&#xD;
      performed laparoscopic surgery on a patient, how many times participants have performed&#xD;
      laparoscopic tasks on a laparoscopic simulator, how often participants play video games, and&#xD;
      how often participants play a musical instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited at the Advanced Technical Skills and Simulation Laboratory&#xD;
      (University of Calgary) and be oriented to the workspace. Participants will complete&#xD;
      laparoscopic task training on a laparoscopic box trainer (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic&#xD;
      Surgery Trainer System, Limbs &amp; Things Inc, Georgia, USA) consisting of an optic camera,&#xD;
      laparoscopic instruments, and a monitor that displays the field of view. The optic camera&#xD;
      view will be recorded for retroactive scoring. Participants will view a standardized&#xD;
      laparoscopic training video, created by an expert in laparoscopic surgery, demonstrating two&#xD;
      Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) tasks that will be performed using the simulator:&#xD;
      a peg-transfer (A) and pattern cutting task (B). The peg-transfer task requires the use of&#xD;
      two dissectors to transfer six rings to pegs on the opposite end of the pegboard, and back to&#xD;
      the original location. The pattern-cutting task involves a 10x10cm piece of gauze with a&#xD;
      4cm-diameter circle pre-drawn in the middle that is placed at the center of the work-board.&#xD;
      Participants are required to use a dissector and endoscopic scissors to cut the marked&#xD;
      circle, freeing it from the surrounding unmarked gauze. A time score will be calculated by&#xD;
      subtracting the completion time in seconds from the task cut-off time of 300 seconds. An&#xD;
      error score will be calculated for each tasks as either: the percentage of pegs that could&#xD;
      not be transferred due to being dropped outside of the field of view (i.e. 1 of 6 pegs lost =&#xD;
      17 second penalty), or the percentage area deviation of cutting a perfect circle. A total&#xD;
      score is calculated by subtracting the error score from the time score. These two FLS tasks&#xD;
      represent skills that require bimanual (peg-transfer) or unimanual (pattern cutting)&#xD;
      abilities. Furthermore, these two tasks were chosen as scores correlate with training level,&#xD;
      and are predictive of intraoperative performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete task A followed by task B, establishing baseline skill. Tasks will&#xD;
      be recorded and scored retroactively, blinded to group allocation, to quantify time and error&#xD;
      scores. Participants will be computer randomized to receive sham or active tDCS. Participants&#xD;
      will perform the two FLS tasks in an interleaved manner (ABAB), a paradigm suggested to&#xD;
      enhance laparoscopic skill acquisition, with eight training repetitions of each task.&#xD;
      Following the final training block, the tDCS electrodes will be removed, and a final task&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed for both task A and B. The Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and post-training to examine unilateral hand function, serving as a&#xD;
      safety measure. Six weeks following the training the participants will return to assess&#xD;
      retention of laparoscopic skill, with a single repetition of task A and B. Emerging evidence&#xD;
      suggests that a significant decay in laparoscopic skill is present six weeks following&#xD;
      training. The amount of laparoscopic practice between the training day and follow-up will be&#xD;
      factored for residents, to ensure that standard training remains uninterrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Mean change in each outcome from baseline to post-training to follow-up will&#xD;
      be compared between tDCS and sham (two-way repeated-measure ANOVA for factors &quot;stimulation&#xD;
      type&quot; and &quot;evaluation time point&quot;). Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA for factors &quot;stimulation&#xD;
      type&quot; and &quot;training block&quot; will explore the interaction between tDCS and training with or&#xD;
      without feedback for each outcome. Any decay in PPT score in either sham or anodal tDCS&#xD;
      groups will be evaluated using a paired-tDCS. Medical students and specialty residents will&#xD;
      be evaluated independently. Level of training of residents will be factored retroactively&#xD;
      into our analysis.&#xD;
