      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of As2O3 and ibrutinib is&#xD;
      synergistic in chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common adult leukemia characterized by the extensive&#xD;
      accumulation of monoclonal, relatively mature , positives of cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      antigen 5 and cluster of differentiation antigen 23 B lymphocytes in lymphoid organs, bone&#xD;
      marrow, and peripheral blood. CLL cells accumulate because of defective apoptosis, which&#xD;
      extends survival. CLL is a heterogeneous disease. Chemoimmunotherapy is the standard&#xD;
      front-line approach for patients younger than 65 years with CLL, with the combination of&#xD;
      fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab used most commonly. Some CLL patients do not&#xD;
      respond well to routine chemoimmunotherapy. Despite recent advances in the treatment of CLL&#xD;
      by use of modern chemoimmunotherapy, the disease remains incurable for most patients with the&#xD;
      exception of those who have the option of an allogeneic transplantation. However, treatments&#xD;
      with chemoimmunotherapy are associated with significant toxicities and sustained&#xD;
      immunosuppression, and the rates of myelosuppression and infection are high. Such&#xD;
      complications are more frequent and more severe in patients older than 65 years because of&#xD;
      reduced marrow reserve, and presence of comorbidities. Because CLL is a disease of the&#xD;
      elderly, identifying effective therapies with better toxicity profiles is thus a high&#xD;
      priority, and targeted therapies may allow attainment of this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ibrutinib is an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) that binds covalently&#xD;
      to the cysteine residue (C481) in the kinase domain. This inhibition has been shown in vitro&#xD;
      to induce modest CLL cell apoptosis and to abolish proliferation and B-cell receptor (BCR)&#xD;
      signaling. Clinical trial results with this agent have been outstanding, including an&#xD;
      estimated 26-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 75% for patients with relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory disease. Although PFS with ibrutinib is excellent, the overall response rate for&#xD;
      this group of relapsed patients is only 71%, lagging behind the clinical benefit seen in 88%&#xD;
      of patients because of lymphocytosis induced by this agent and all agents targeting the BCR&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the long-term safety for ibrutinib has not been established. Caution must be&#xD;
      exercised for the development of resistant clones due to the persistence of the disease,&#xD;
      because most patients treated with ibrutinib often have prolonged partial remissions.&#xD;
      Moreover, about 2-5% of CLL patients will develop Richter's syndrome or transformation during&#xD;
      the disease course and treatment. The rate of serious adverse events in patients who&#xD;
      continued treatment for 1 year or longer was 43% in the first year of treatment and 32% after&#xD;
      the first year. Within the first year of treatment, 8% patients discontinued therapy, while&#xD;
      6% discontinued therapy after the first year. Besides, considering that genetic mutations&#xD;
      cause resistance to ibrutinib in CLL patients and altered signaling pathways are common&#xD;
      mechanisms of resistance to single agents. It's expected to combine other agent with&#xD;
      ibrutinib to obtain higher response in those CLL patients who have not obtained perfect&#xD;
      effect and to relieve the toxicity from treatment of ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has attracted worldwide interest in the field of oncology&#xD;
      because of its substantial anticancer activity in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia&#xD;
      (APL). Interestingly, a number of studies have revealed that As2O3 can induce apoptosis, not&#xD;
      only in APL, but also in a wide variety of hematologic malignancies, including CLL, either as&#xD;
      monotherapy or combined therapy. Investigators previous study has also suggested that As2O3&#xD;
      could induce CLL cells apoptosis, and could be an efficient therapeutic agent for CLL.&#xD;
