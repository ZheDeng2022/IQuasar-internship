    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this double-blind study is to compare the frequency of primary&#xD;
      patency at 6 months in patients with stenosis of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) treated either&#xD;
      by conventional angioplasty + angioplasty with balloon impregnated with paclitaxel or by&#xD;
      conventional angioplasty + angioplasty with placebo balloon (balloon not impregnated with&#xD;
      paclitaxel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the frequency of primary patency at 3 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the rate of restenosis &gt; 50% at the site of angioplasty at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare, at 3, 6 and 12 months, the proportion of patients with arteriovenous fistula&#xD;
           deteriorating back to preoperative flow rate (within 20% of preoperative flow rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare, at 3, 6 and 12 months, the proportion of AVF with a flow rate &lt; 500 ml /&#xD;
           min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare, at 3, 6 and 12 months, the cumulative rate of thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare, at 3, 6 and 12 months, the medical costs related to direct medical care,&#xD;
           initial treatments, monitoring, diagnosis and treatments of complications.&#xD;

      Experimental design: prospective randomized, double blind, multicenter controlled study, with&#xD;
      2 experimental arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 centers will participate in France, targeting to enrol 150 patients in total. Each patient&#xD;
      will undergo angiography at the beginning of the intervention in order to confirm the&#xD;
      presence of only one stenosis, to assess the degree of stenosis and to evaluate the vascular&#xD;
      diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will first undergo angioplasty using standard balloons. thereafter, depending on&#xD;
      randomization arm, an additional angioplasty will be performed during 1 minute with a&#xD;
      paclitaxel impregnated balloon (active arm) or with a placebo balloon (placebo arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of inclusion is planned for 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will have a 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
