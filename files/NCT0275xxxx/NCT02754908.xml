  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effects of musical training on improving the neurocognitive&#xD;
      function and psychological well-being of children surviving brain tumours. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will receive weekly 45-minute lessons on musical training for one year (52&#xD;
      weeks) while the other half are the placebo controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children surviving brain tumours have the highest risk of suffering neurocognitive late&#xD;
      effects, such as impairment of intellectual development and deficits in attention and&#xD;
      concentration, working memory, processing speed and executive function. Such effects severely&#xD;
      affect their levels of academic achievement, psychosocial function and quality of life.&#xD;
      Musical training is considered to have potential for treating neurocognitive&#xD;
      impairment,mostly because the extensive brain networks engaged in musical training can induce&#xD;
      substantial neuroplasticity changes in cortical and subcortical regions of motor, auditory&#xD;
      and speech processing networks. A review of musical training for neuro-rehabilitation&#xD;
      revealed that it can enhance motor recovery and neuroplasticity after stroke and improve&#xD;
      motor deficits observed in Parkinson's disease. A growing body of evidence points to the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of musical training on the cognitive development of children. The results&#xD;
      of a longitudinal study on the effects of musical training on children's brain and cognitive&#xD;
      development demonstrated that such training results in long-term enhancement of&#xD;
      visualspatial, verbal and mathematical performance. Moreover, engaging in musical practice in&#xD;
      childhood predicts academic performance and IQ at the university level. Thus, there appears&#xD;
      to be some support for the effects of music lessons on intellectual development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, although musical training is popular and is considered to be a beneficial&#xD;
      intervention in the treatment of neurocognitive impairment, longitudinal studies that examine&#xD;
      the efficacy of music-making in clinical settings are limited. Importantly, there is to date&#xD;
      no study that examines the effects of musical training on induction of neuroplasticity in&#xD;
      childhood cancer survivors with neurocognitive impairment. There is an imperative need for&#xD;
      rigorous empirical scrutiny of the ability of musical training, in particular, to achieve&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and thus promote the cognitive function and psychological well-being of&#xD;
      children surviving brain tumours.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects' IQ scores will be obtained at 12 months after starting the intervention using the Hong Kong Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (HK-WISC) for subjects younger than 16 years of age and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised (WAIS-R) for those aged 16 years and older.&#xD;
In addition, the neuropsychological profile of each subject will also be examined at 12 months after starting the intervention. A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment is usually conducted on a one on-one basis with standardised procedures.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects' self-esteem will be assessed at baseline, using the Chinese version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES).&#xD;
The RSES is designed to measure the global self-esteem of children and adolescents. The scale comprises 10 items, rated using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), with total possible scores ranging from 10 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of self-esteem. Participants will be asked to respond to the Chinese version of the RSES at baseline.</description>

    <description>The subjects' quality of life will be assessed at baseline, using the Chinese version of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scale (PedsQL 4.0). The PedsQL is designed to measure children's healthrelated quality of life. It comprises 23 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. These items are categorised into four domains: physical functioning (eight items), emotional functioning (five items), social functioning (five items) and school functioning (five items). The total possible range of scores is from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.Participants will be asked to respond to the Chinese version of the PedsQL 4.0 at baseline.</description>

    <description>In addition to medical follow-up, the subjects in the experimental group will receive weekly 45-minute lessons on musical training for one year (52 weeks), conducted by the Music Children Foundation. Qualified orchestral performers will provide the musical training. Training will start at the lowest level (hitting simple notes) and end at the highest level (able to play an entire song). The subjects will continue on to the next level if they successfully pass the relevant test; those who do not will be encouraged to repeat test.</description>
