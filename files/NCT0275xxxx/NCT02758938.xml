    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the usability of updated biofeedback game software&#xD;
      developed to help train the muscles involved in lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD)&#xD;
      through electromyography (EMG) controlled video games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Windows-DOS based biofeedback game system is currently used at the investigator's&#xD;
      institution to help treat LUTD in pediatric patients. This system, however, is outdated and&#xD;
      needs to be replaced with updated hardware and software. A new updated system was recently&#xD;
      created by University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) Biomedical Engineering students. This system&#xD;
      utilizes a FDA approved EMG device (SRS Medical Awareâ„¢ EMG Dual Muscle Monitor) paired with&#xD;
      biofeedback game software that was developed by the students. The investigators wish to test&#xD;
      the usability of the new software to identify areas that need improvement to make the&#xD;
      software more user-friendly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the end users' (i.e., physician, biofeedback nurses, patients)&#xD;
      perception of the updated software. In determining usability, we hope to 1) decrease risk of&#xD;
      end user error; 2) make the software intuitive (easier to use); 3) decrease reliance on the&#xD;
      user manual; 4) decrease need for training; and 5) increase understanding of software&#xD;
      operation. This will be an ongoing study in which we continuously monitor the usability of&#xD;
      the software as it is updated based on end-user feedback. The investigators plan to do all&#xD;
      usability testing under the same IRB protocol. If further testing involves items not&#xD;
      discussed here, a &quot;new change&quot; will be made to the IRB application.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and Biological:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LUTD is a common problem in children that can result in wetting during the day and night,&#xD;
      frequent and urgent urination and urinary tract infections. In a subset of children, LUTD is&#xD;
      the result of dis-coordination between pelvic floor and abdominal muscles. These children&#xD;
      tend to contract their pelvic muscles rather than relax them during voiding. This abnormal&#xD;
      contraction results in bladder changes that can result in incontinence. In most cases,&#xD;
      understanding how to contract and relax the pelvic floor and abdominal muscles can help&#xD;
      reduce LUTD symptoms. Identifying and learning how to utilize the pelvic floor without&#xD;
      abdominal muscle activation is one of the most powerful effectors of bladder function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current LUTD Program at the investigator's institution includes a full history and&#xD;
      physical exam followed by extensive education. If the patients do not improve they undergo&#xD;
      additional evaluation with a renal pelvic ultrasound and simultaneous uroflowmetry and&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) study. Based on that evaluation a percentage of patients go on to&#xD;
      receive biofeedback treatment. Biofeedback is typically recommended to patients who do not&#xD;
      use the pelvic floor and abdominal muscles appropriately while voiding. The biofeedback&#xD;
      treatment involves further education, standard biofeedback, and biofeedback computer games.&#xD;
      In standard biofeedback, patients are made aware of their abdominal and pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      activity by a display that shows the abdominal and pelvic floor muscles' EMG activity. In the&#xD;
      biofeedback computer games, patients control a variety of games with their pelvic floor and&#xD;
      abdominal muscles. Both methods teach the patient how to locate the pelvic floor muscles and&#xD;
      to isolate them while voiding. Biofeedback represents only one possible treatment plan for&#xD;
      children with LUTD. Patients are analyzed prior to entering the biofeedback portion of the&#xD;
      LUTD Program for compatibility with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies were conducted by McKenna and colleagues to assess the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      biofeedback games on treating LUTD symptoms.The trials involved 41 and 160 children of&#xD;
      varying ages that averaged out to be 7.2 and 8.5 years respectively. The games worked by&#xD;
      acquiring feedback that represented a flexion of the pelvic floor and relaxation of the&#xD;
      abdominal muscle. All of the children in the trials participated in approximately an hour of&#xD;
      treatment per session that involved around 20 minutes of supervised gaming time. The 84% and&#xD;
      87% success rate in each trial showed that the method of using biofeedback paired with the&#xD;
      video games is a viable option for the treatment of LUTD in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's institution has found success with using biofeedback games to train&#xD;
      patients how to properly use their pelvic floor and abdominal muscles. Biofeedback is less&#xD;
      invasive than traditional treatment methods and creates no potential harm to the patients.&#xD;
      The DOS based biofeedback game system currently utilized at our institution is unique in that&#xD;
      it involves the interaction of pelvic floor AND abdominal muscle to control video games&#xD;
      through EMG signals. The system was created specifically for our LUTD Program and is not&#xD;
      available on the market. The current biofeedback game system, however, has not been updated&#xD;
      for almost 20 years and has become outdated. It requires a controller that is no longer&#xD;
      available on the market, does not start reliably and overheats easily. Updated software and&#xD;
      hardware are essential in order to keep this method of treatment available to the children at&#xD;
      our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students from the UW Biomedical Engineering program created an updated biofeedback system to&#xD;
      replace the current system. The system utilizes EMG hardware that has already been FDA&#xD;
      approved paired with updated software created by the students. The device is still in the&#xD;
      testing phase, but early consultation with the user population is necessary for assessing&#xD;
      needs and developing requirements. Users also are critical for analytical work and testing&#xD;
      throughout product development. The investigators plan to eventually market the software and&#xD;
      field testing and feedback to manufacturers are highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS/STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate physician's ability to read EMG values recorded throughout patient interaction&#xD;
           with the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the nurse reception of the new software, including usability of operation and&#xD;
           setup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the patient's reception/satisfaction of the new video games that are part of&#xD;
           the software package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three metrics will be used to determine the usability of the video game software: 1) medical&#xD;
      value to physician, 2) nurse ease of use, and 3) patient reception/satisfaction. Each of&#xD;
      these metrics will be measured using evaluation forms specific to the role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is for the physicians and patients to rate usability at 50% or higher and for nurses&#xD;
      to rate usability at 85 or higher (System Usability Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because biofeedback uses well understood EMG technology, much of the system's success is&#xD;
      related to patient satisfaction. Therefore, the first two aims seek to show usability in&#xD;
      system setup and data presentation and our final aim will show usability according to patient&#xD;
      engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: A Focus Group session will involve the physician involved in this study, an&#xD;
      advisor on the project and staff involved in the project as well as three random individuals&#xD;
      outside of the project (7 total). These individuals will provide feedback on the software&#xD;
      that will be used to improve the software. This study will also involve patients who are&#xD;
      currently being treated in the UW LUTD Program under the supervision of Dr. Patrick McKenna.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit 30 of these patients who will complete the Patient Feedback&#xD;
      Form. Additionally, the nurses (3 total) involved with biofeedback will provide qualitative&#xD;
      and quantitative data in addition to completing the Nurse Feedback Form and the physician (1&#xD;
      total) involved with biofeedback will fill out the Physician Feedback Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Group (Cognitive-Walk Through): To aid in the development of the final software to be&#xD;
      used in the formal training below a set of informal peer focus group sessions will be held.&#xD;
      These sessions will consist of Dr. Patrick McKenna, Christian Sauder, Joyce Jackson, Amit J.&#xD;
      Nimunkar and three random individuals exterior to the project. During the session each&#xD;
      participant will be asked to freely navigate through the training suite and game environment.&#xD;
      During this activity they will be allowed to comment on the software and respond to follow up&#xD;
      questions by the investigator. These questions and/or comments will be recorded by one of the&#xD;
      investigators and used to guide the development process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurse Training Session: After the Focus Group session, nurses will undergo a training session&#xD;
      where qualitative and quantitative data on the software will be collected. The nurse will be&#xD;
      asked to &quot;think aloud&quot; while completing an outlined scenario. Evaluators will be encouraged&#xD;
      to vocalize their difficulties with the system and recommend changes to the interface design&#xD;
      and functionalities. At the end of the think aloud session, an unstructured interview will be&#xD;
      conducted during which user will be asked about their overall impression of the software and&#xD;
      their suggestions for improving it. The think aloud session and unstructured interview will&#xD;
      be recorded and transcribed by members of the study team. Each nurse will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete the System Usability Scale (SUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofeedback: Upon delivering appropriate consent/assent forms, patients may begin biofeedback&#xD;
      sessions with the new system. The patients will undergo 3 weekly sessions each lasting 1&#xD;
      hour. At each session, patients will have EMG-surface electrode patches (Kendall, 1050NPSM&#xD;
      Neonatal Electrodes-Prewired, Small Cloth) placed at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions on the&#xD;
      perineum to measure electrical activity of the pelvic floor muscle group. An additional&#xD;
      surface electrode patch will be placed on the rectus abdominus to measure abdominal muscle&#xD;
      activity. All interactive biofeedback testing will be conducted by American Family Children's&#xD;
      Hospital nurses that are experienced in standard biofeedback techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End User Assessment Forms: After the patient has completed all of the biofeedback sessions,&#xD;
      he/she will complete a feedback form about their satisfaction with the games. The physician&#xD;
      will complete a feedback form that assesses the medical value of the device and the nurses&#xD;
      will complete a feedback form that assesses the ease of use of the device.&#xD;
