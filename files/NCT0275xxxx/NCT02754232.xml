      Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training is an important part of the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) because training can increase the patient's muscle mass,&#xD;
      lead to higher physical performance, reduce difficulties in breathing and hereby increase the&#xD;
      patients' capacity to make use of the medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation is provided by hospitals training centres/outpatient clinics. However, the&#xD;
      transport is too tiring for the patients, which is why they decline taking part in it. This&#xD;
      can mean a worsening of their condition and an increase in readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solution:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a better treatment for patients with severe COPD: Telemedical training of&#xD;
           patients with COPD in teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a cross-sectoral practice for the telemedical training patients will use,&#xD;
           thus decreasing the readmissions of OUH's patients with severe COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To optimize the patient's journey in and across sector borders by using Lean methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to contribute to improving treatment of severely ill patients with COPD&#xD;
      cross-sectorally. The results are expected to contribute to reducing readmissions and raising&#xD;
      the level of evidence in telemedical research on training patients with severe COPD. The&#xD;
      study's findings may be of use in relation to other patient groups who have difficulties&#xD;
      coming to training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project has its starting point in a pilot project. Its goal was to determine&#xD;
      whether severely ill COPD patients could train at home and earlier than normal. Evaluation&#xD;
      showed patients found it reassuring to train with the help of the COPD briefcase. They found&#xD;
      it increased their physical and mental well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain knowledge of the effect of telemedical training. The patient's strength, daily&#xD;
      activity level and quality of life will be measured by conducting a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial including 125 patients - 62 in the intervention group and 62 in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative research methods will be used to explore the user perspective concerning&#xD;
      patients, family and health professionals. The method is critical psychological practice&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Lean method consultant from University Hospital Odense (OUH) will be involved in developing&#xD;
      the best clinical pathway for the patients and the professionals.&#xD;

           thus decreasing the readmissions of OUH's patients with severe COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To optimize the patients' journey in and across sector borders by using Lean methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The projects relevance for the clinic and target group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to contribute to improving the treatment of severely ill patients with&#xD;
      COPD cross-sectorally by generating knowledge for the physical and occupational therapists'&#xD;
      practice. The results are expected to contribute to reducing readmissions and raising the&#xD;
      level of evidence in telemedical research on training patients with severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes patients with severe COPD in Odense and Svendborg. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      similar patient groups with similar difficulties, nationally as well as internationally, will&#xD;
      benefit from the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 430.000 people in Denmark have Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (Hansen&#xD;
      et al., 2008). Characteristic for COPD is respiratory tract obstruction, which is not&#xD;
      completely reversible and worsens as time passes. Complications of COPD are: loss of muscle&#xD;
      mass, weight loss and an increasing social isolation (The National Board of Health, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well documented that a systematic individually composed rehabilitation program,&#xD;
      including training, has an effect on patients' functional level and quality of life (National&#xD;
      board of Health, 2007). Early rehabilitation after hospitalization may break the vicious&#xD;
      circle, which can arise for patients with COPD. In this cycle, hospitalization can entail&#xD;
      inactivity and loss of muscular strength, thus increasing the risk of new aggravations with&#xD;
      re-admittance to hospital as a result (National board of Health, 2014). In addition, at this&#xD;
      time no studies examine the effect of training on daily activities (ibid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To offer these severely ill patients rehabilitation is a regional task. However, the patients&#xD;
      with severe COPD often decline training, as the transport to and from hospital is too&#xD;
      exhausting for them. The result is no training for this group. The same dilemma exists in&#xD;
      other countries (Burkow et al., 2013). Inactivity can mean stagnation in daily life, which&#xD;
      affects functioning (Williams et al., 2011) for both patients and their families (Wong et&#xD;
      al., 2005) Patients with COPD, who cannot take part in the usual rehabilitation program due&#xD;
      to the degree of their illness, are now recommended to take part in strength training as a&#xD;
      replacement. The recommendation is based solely on consensus of good clinical practice.&#xD;
      Research is lacking (National Board of Health, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies examine telemedicine, COPD and supervised training. Two studies with supervised&#xD;
      team training for, among others, patients with COPD showed great patient satisfaction and an&#xD;
      increased experience of social support (Nield and Hoo, 2012, Burkow et al., 2013). One of the&#xD;
      studies showed a significantly decreased occurrence of dyspnoea in the intervention group&#xD;
      (Nield and Hoo, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010-2012 OUH did a feasibility study in an attempt to develop a training program for&#xD;
      patients with severe or very severe COPD who reject the established rehabilitation program at&#xD;
      the hospital. The study, which encompassed 50 patients in a year, tested and developed an&#xD;
      early effort using an individually tailored home-training program based on telemedical&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results showed potential in relation to previous telemedical training of patients with&#xD;
      COPD. Considering the scanty knowledge in the field, a contribution to produce knowledge of&#xD;
      greater variation is relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project type:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An randomised controlled Study (RCT) is needed to reveal the effect of telemedical training&#xD;
      and muscle strength related to doing every day chores and to see how this affects their daily&#xD;
      activities and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to study the effect of telemedical training on activities of daily living, quality&#xD;
      of life and physical performance in patients with severe or very severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to assess the hypothesis that patients with severe or very severe&#xD;
      COPD, who have thanked no to training at the hospital, receiving telemedical training will&#xD;
      experience greater satisfaction doing daily activities, increase their quality of life and&#xD;
      increase their physical performance than patients who do not receive telemedical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place and project participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who take part in the study have been admitted to OUH because of a worsening of their&#xD;
      COPD. The criteria for inclusion and exclusion criteria will be submitted elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project participants are included consecutively in the intervention group or the control&#xD;
      group for two years. A power calculation shows the study can, with a random sampling size of&#xD;
      100 patients, 50 in each group, show a difference of 2,7 seconds in FTSST(Stand up - sit down&#xD;
      five times). The strength is set to 80 %. The calculation is based on a standard deviation of&#xD;
      4,8 for FTSST and a 5 % to-sided significance level. If a dropout rate of 20 % is allowed&#xD;
      for, it will mean that 128 persons must be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are randomized to the intervention group or the control group by baseline after&#xD;
      an informed consent. Measurements are made at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up,&#xD;
      which are 3 and 6 months after post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will receive telemedical training in teams of up to 4, 21&#xD;
      times, three times weekly for seven weeks. During the first three weeks the regional&#xD;
      physiotherapists will be responsible for the training. Municipal occupational -and&#xD;
      physiotherapists will manage the last four weeks' training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control-group will receive no training as they have refused the offer. They&#xD;
      will be discharged to the municipal sphere with a rehabilitation plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data generation method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Function tests and questionnaires will be included in the quantitative study of the&#xD;
      telemedicial training's importance for physical ability, daily activities and health related&#xD;
      quality of life for patients with severe or very severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be submitted elsewhere. The following parameters describe the&#xD;
      participating patient group: Sex, age, civil status, socio - economic status, Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI), forced expiratory volume in one 1 second (FEV1) of expected value, FEV1 / forced vital&#xD;
      capacity (FVC), Medical Research Council Breathlessness Scale (MRC- dyspnea score), oxygen&#xD;
      treatment in the home, treatment with atomizer, the usual inhaled COPD treatment (grouped),&#xD;
      oral prednisolone treatment, home care, use of tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether telemedical training has an effect on readmissions for patients with COPD will be&#xD;
      examined by comparing the number of admissions for the intervention group and the control&#xD;
      group. Data will be requisitioned from the Region's IT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be continuously keyed into an Access database. Calculation of the analysis will&#xD;
      be done using the software program STATA (abbreviation of Statistic and Data). The data will&#xD;
      be analyzed according to the principle 'intention to treat'. The level of significance α will&#xD;
      be placed at 0,05 and power β = 0,8. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be informed of the project's goal, form and content both orally and in&#xD;
      written form and that participation is voluntary. Written consent must be had before&#xD;
      inclusion. Participants will be informed that they can leave the study at any time. The&#xD;
      project leader will file inclusion numbers and corresponding personal data securely according&#xD;
      to the applicable rules. The project is registered and approved of by The Danish Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency and the Danish Council of Ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of results, knowledge sharing and distribution:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three articles will be published in relevant international peer-reviewed journals. The Danish&#xD;
      Lung Association will be continuously informed of the study's status. The results will be&#xD;
      distributed to national and international conferences, and studies abroad. These include&#xD;
      health professional forums during the Ph.D. study - depending on the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the project will be stored via Odense Patient Explorative Network (OPEN)- more&#xD;
      specifically Redcap as the data management system. Redcap is approved of by God Clinical&#xD;
      practice (GCP).&#xD;
