  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of drug coated balloon (DCB) in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and tissue&#xD;
      loss has recently raised some concerns after the IN.PACT deep trial using paclitaxel coated&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty in the tibial arteries was terminated. The investigators objective is to&#xD;
      establish the safety and efficacy of drug coated balloon (DCB) for femoropopliteal occlusive&#xD;
      disease in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and tissue loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators objective is to establish the safety and efficacy of drug coated balloon&#xD;
      (DCB) for femoropopliteal occlusive disease in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and&#xD;
      tissue loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the association between the drug coated balloon (DCB) therapy and limb outcomes&#xD;
      could not be clearly linked to the use of antiproliferative agents, the findings of&#xD;
      paclitaxel crystals downstream of the treated lesions, although in small amounts, has raised&#xD;
      concerns about the safety of such therapy in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and&#xD;
      tissue loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These concerns, however, may not translate to patients with femoropopliteal occlusive disease&#xD;
      as the amount of paclitaxel reaching the foot may be even smaller after being filtered by the&#xD;
      calf musculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the use of DCB angioplasty in the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and popliteal has&#xD;
      been shown to deliver significantly more durable outcomes compared to standard angioplasty&#xD;
      alone, with reported primary patency rates of almost 90% at one year, this therapy may even&#xD;
      be more needed in patients with tissue loss where prolonged patency is essential for wound&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
