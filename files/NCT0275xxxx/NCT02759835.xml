  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have a mutation in a gene that makes a protein&#xD;
      called EGFR. This particular cancer can be treated with certain drugs such as Erlotinib&#xD;
      (Tarceva), Gefitinib (Iressa) and Osimertinib (Tagrisso). But many tumors become resistant to&#xD;
      these drugs because of a second mutation. Researchers want to test if adding local ablative&#xD;
      therapy (LAT) extends the benefits of the drug, Osimertinib. LAT can include techniques such&#xD;
      as surgery, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if re-taking osimertinib after LAT is safe, tolerable, and effective for people whose&#xD;
      NSCLC has progressed after initial treatment with osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with certain types of NSCLC. Participants will be divided into&#xD;
      various groups as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of tumor sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drug by mouth once a day. They will continue until they can&#xD;
      no longer tolerate it or their disease worsens. They will keep a dosage diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will start each 21-day course with physical exam; blood, urine, and saliva&#xD;
      tests; and electrocardiogram. They will have scans every 6 weeks and echocardiogram every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 2 will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start osimertinib right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have LAT if their disease gets worse and is suitable for LAT. If LAT cannot be performed or&#xD;
      LAT consists of a procedure other than surgery, a tumor biopsy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-start osimertinib after LAT, or other treatments if not suitable for LAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have LAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If LAT consists of a procedure other than surgery, a tumor biopsy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start osimertinib after LAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants stop taking the drugs, they will have a final visit. This will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart and blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called every year for follow-up.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have significantly improved the response rate (RR)&#xD;
           and survival in patients with tumors harboring EGFR-sensitizing mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An invariable consequence of treatment with EGFR-TKIs is the development of acquired&#xD;
           resistance. The most common mechanism of resistance observed in approximately 50% of all&#xD;
           cases is the emergence of a secondary mutation (T790M) in exon 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI designed to target the T790M mutation, which&#xD;
           has shown impressive responses in both first- and second-line settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite these developments, it is almost certain that selection pressure will lead to&#xD;
           the emergence of newer clones that are resistant to treatment with osimertinib. In fact,&#xD;
           a newly identified EGFR mutation (C797S) that results in acquired resistance to&#xD;
           osimertinib has been reported recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of local ablative therapies for patients who develop limited metastatic disease&#xD;
           oligoprogressive disease) on EGFR-TKI therapy is promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that following local ablative therapy to treat oligoprogressive disease&#xD;
           after emergence of resistance to AZD9291, osimertinib can be resumed safely and&#xD;
           reinitiation of osimertinib results in additional progression-free survival benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy (as assessed by PFS) of re-initiation&#xD;
           of osimertinib following local ablative therapy (LAT) for patients with oligoprogressive&#xD;
           disease after treatment with osimertinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR-sensitizing somatic&#xD;
           mutations or a germline T790M mutation and no prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)&#xD;
           therapy (Cohort 1); OR progressive disease after 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKI therapy&#xD;
           harboring somatic T790M mutation (Cohort 2); or patients with progressive disease after&#xD;
           treatment with osimertinib who are eligible for local ablative therapy (Cohort 3). If&#xD;
           biopsy for EGFR mutation status confirmation is not clinically feasible, EGFR mutations&#xD;
           may be confirmed by ctDNA analysis using a CLIA certified assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate end organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patients are not eligible for LAT, they will be referred for standard of care&#xD;
           chemotherapy as per treating physicians discretion. These patients may also be&#xD;
           considered for other clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single-institution, open-label phase II trial of osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients not previously treated with osimertinib will be treated with&#xD;
           osimertinib daily until disease progression. At the time of progression, patients with&#xD;
           oligoprogressive disease (no more than 5 sites of progressive disease) will be assessed&#xD;
           for LAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patients are eligible for LAT, osimertinib will be resumed after LAT and they will be&#xD;
           followed for second progression on osimertinib (PFS2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patients progress at the same site where LAT has been performed before, the&#xD;
           progression will be considered to be a result of inadequate ablation and they will be&#xD;
           considered for repeat LAT and again re-challenged with osimertinib if clinically&#xD;
           feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor samples will be obtained at baseline by a mandatory biopsy. At the time of first&#xD;
           progression on osimertinib if a patient is eligible for surgery as a form of LAT, then a&#xD;
           tissue sample will be obtained for genomic and proteomic studies to identify mechanisms&#xD;
           of acquired resistance. For patients who are not eligible for LAT or a form of LAT that&#xD;
           is not surgery (radiation, radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation), then a mandatory&#xD;
           biopsy will be performed, if clinically safe, to obtain tissue for above studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-treatment will be allowed for a small number of subjects.&#xD;

                  tubal ligation, hormonal contraceptives that are not prone to drug-drug&#xD;
                  interactions (IUS Levonorgestrel Intra Uterine System (Mirena),&#xD;
