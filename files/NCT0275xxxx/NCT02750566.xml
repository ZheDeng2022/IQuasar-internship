    <textblock>
      Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a challenging injury for physicians to&#xD;
      manage and is among the most serious disabling neurological disorders. Physician awareness&#xD;
      regarding manifestations of TBI and subsequent treatment are paramount to reduce the burden&#xD;
      of disease. Advancements in treatment of mild TBI have been slow with a lack of consensus on&#xD;
      treatment methods that show universal success. This gap in treatment choices provides an&#xD;
      opportunity for osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to fill. OMT is a hands-on manual&#xD;
      therapy that can be integrated to help treat post-concussive symptoms. Previous studies have&#xD;
      shown that OMT can help resolve imbalance and tinnitus in elderly populations and case&#xD;
      studies have shown that this manual therapy may assist in patient recovery. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that OMT will decrease return to play/work time, will show an improvement in&#xD;
      balance, and will decrease concussion symptoms as compared to counseling.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative&#xD;
      treatment (OMT) in improving concussion-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies and case reports have found a positive effect of OMT on resolving&#xD;
      concussion-like symptoms such as vertigo, imbalance, and tinnitus. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      OMT improves proprioceptive input from the cervical spine and joints and sensory input from&#xD;
      the internal auditory meatus. The investigators propose to further investigate this&#xD;
      relationship in order to quantify the effect of OMT through the SMART Balance Master and&#xD;
      return to play/work time. As this is a pilot study, the investigators intend to determine if&#xD;
      a correlation exists between OMT and return to work/play and SMART Balance Master scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators have three main aims for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: OMT will show a statistically significant improvement balance as measured by&#xD;
      the SMART Balance Master scores pre- and post-OMT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: OMT will decrease concussion symptom as measured by surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: OMT will decrease return to play/work time in concussed subjects compared to&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a challenging injury for physicians to&#xD;
      manage. It is undetectable by traditional imaging techniques, and there are limited treatment&#xD;
      options. A concussion results from a biomechanical force directed towards the head that&#xD;
      precedes and contributes to neurologic dysfunction, including impairment in the level of&#xD;
      consciousness. However, a loss of consciousness is not a requirement for the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDC estimates the annual burden of concussion in the United States to be roughly 1.4-3.8&#xD;
      million. Over the past decade, the CDC also reports a 70% increase in TBI emergency&#xD;
      department visits, as well as an increase in TBI-related hospitalizations. Other studies have&#xD;
      determined the prevalence of individuals with chronic concussion problems in the US is 5.3&#xD;
      million. Importantly, these figures should be considered an underestimate as patients with&#xD;
      milder injuries often do not seek treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of concussion involves a primary and secondary phase of tissue injury. A&#xD;
      primary injury is immediate and irreversible, resulting from acceleration/deceleration&#xD;
      mechanical damage. Secondary injuries result from non-mechanical damage derived from neuronal&#xD;
      cell membrane disruption and axonal stretch. The membrane defects result from secondary&#xD;
      injury and lead to ionic influx and accumulation of toxic substances such as glutamate within&#xD;
      the nervous system. Individuals with mild concussion recover within a few days; however, 15%&#xD;
      of patients with mild concussion suffer from long-term complications largely due to the&#xD;
      secondary phase of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent literature has studied the role of restricted cerebral blood flow and inflammation on&#xD;
      perpetuating the symptoms of a concussion. Meier et al. discovered an inverse relationship&#xD;
      between cerebral blood flow in the dorsal midinsular cortex and the time to return to play.&#xD;
      Other studies have investigated the role of inflammation, through the production of reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species, that not only contribute to the initial injury but also potentiate its own&#xD;
      pathological course. These studies highlight potential mechanisms that could be targeted to&#xD;
      decrease symptoms and improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for mild concussion in the past has been limited to bed rest. Previous studies have&#xD;
      noted that bed rest following a concussion does not improve recovery time and, if continued&#xD;
      for too long, can negatively impact recovery. Some pilot projects have reported promising&#xD;
      findings such as decreased 30-day mortality with progesterone. Through a meta-analysis of&#xD;
      non-surgical interventions following a mild TBI, Nygren-de Boussard et al. found that there&#xD;
      are poor randomized controlled trials or comparison groups to indicate any intervention can&#xD;
      provide therapeutic benefit. Furthermore, evidence supports a more individualized approach&#xD;
      when treating post-concussive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative or complementary treatments encompass a variety of individual approaches for&#xD;
      different patients including herbal supplements, homeopathy, hyperbaric oxygen, arts and&#xD;
      recreational therapies, meditation practice, and Tai Chi Chuan. Empirical literature on&#xD;
      alternative treatments for mild concussion is sparse, with many studies either insufficiently&#xD;
      powered or poorly controlled. The widespread use and popularity of these treatment options&#xD;
      and their potential to help treat concussions demands further scientific investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is defined in the Glossary of Osteopathic&#xD;
      Terminology as &quot;the therapeutic application of manually guided forces by an osteopathic&#xD;
      physician to improve physiologic function and/or support homeostasis that has been altered by&#xD;
      somatic dysfunction.&quot; Somatic dysfunctions, or restrictions of skeletal or myofascial&#xD;
      structures, disrupt the normal function of vascular, lymphatic and neural components related&#xD;
      to or that pass through these structures. By treating somatic dysfunctions, OMT aims to&#xD;
      remove musculoskeletal (MSK) restrictions which allow for increased blood flow and lymphatic&#xD;
      drainage and decreased nerve impingements. Somatic dysfunctions in the cranium and spine can&#xD;
      contribute to patient's concussion symptoms including dizziness and tinnitus. Treatment of&#xD;
      somatic dysfunctions with OMT, targeting structures involved with concussion-related&#xD;
      symptoms, may be another treatment option that can be offered to these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence has supported the use of the SMART Balance Master as a validated tool to measure&#xD;
      balance. Fraix et al. used the SMART Balance Master by NeuroCom® to quantify the beneficial&#xD;
      effect of OMT on improving patients' balance and dizziness. The SMART Balance Master® can be&#xD;
      used to quantify changes in balance before and after OMT. The Sensory Organization Test (SOT)&#xD;
      is one assessment tool that can measure three different aspects of balance and posture:&#xD;
      somatosensory, visual, and vestibular. The complete protocol for SOT can be found on the&#xD;
      NeuroCom® website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ImPACT test is a widely used tool to help detect and assess the severity of concussion in&#xD;
      athletes. This computerized test is administered to athletes routinely to establish a&#xD;
      baseline of memory and cognitive function, and administered again in the suspicion of a&#xD;
      concussion in order to evaluate the difference in cognitive function. The test is widely used&#xD;
      and has been shown to be an effect adjunct test for evaluation of concussion as part of a&#xD;
      comprehensive medical diagnosis involving other testing methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCAT-3 (sport concussion assessment tool - 3rd edition) is an improved version of a&#xD;
      widely used aid for physicians for evaluating concussion severity and progress. The test is a&#xD;
      combination of patient-reported symptom evaluation as well as an objective cognitive and&#xD;
      physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The King-Devick Test objectively measures visual tracking and saccadic eye movements (rapid&#xD;
      movement of the eye between fixation points). The test was originally developed in 1976 by&#xD;
      eye care specialists to help evaluate reading disabilities as they related to oculomotor&#xD;
      movement. Since 2011, the test has been used as a rapid sideline screening tool for&#xD;
      concussion in a variety of sports, based on the findings that concussion is associated with&#xD;
      many neuro-ophthalmologic signs. Many studies have shown the King-Devick Test to be a valid&#xD;
      aid in detecting and evaluating concussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is with these tools, the investigators aim to measure the effects of OMT on&#xD;
      post-concussion symptoms.&#xD;
