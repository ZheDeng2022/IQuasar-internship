    <textblock>
      Patients of acute &amp; chronic liver failure have long been assumed to have coagulopathy &amp; are&#xD;
      given blood products prophylactically as well as during various interventions. But these&#xD;
      patients rarely have spontaneous bleed except variceal bleed. Conventional coagulation&#xD;
      parameters are insufficient to assess coagulation status of these patients because they&#xD;
      reflect only a certain element of coagulation cascade while thromboelastography (TEG) gives a&#xD;
      comprehensive report of hemostatic profile including platelet function. Studies using TEG&#xD;
      have suggested that defects in prohemostatic drivers are counterbalanced by changes in&#xD;
      antihemostatic drivers creating a rebalance in these patients. Acute on chronic failure is a&#xD;
      entity with acute decompensation on underlying chronic liver failure. Since there is paucity&#xD;
      of data regarding coagulation abnormalities in these patient, study is needed to assess&#xD;
      predictability power of TEG in these patients with respect to coagulation abnormalities in&#xD;
      patient with ALF and CLD ( cirrhosis) and healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since early times coagulopathy is considered to be an integral part of liver failure. Whether&#xD;
      it is acute liver failure (ALF) or acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF), patients usually&#xD;
      have deranged coagulation parameters (platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated&#xD;
      partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and international normalized ratio (INR). Based on these&#xD;
      deranged parameters, initially it was assumed that patients of liver failure have increased&#xD;
      risk of bleeding &amp; usually were given blood products prophylactically during surgical&#xD;
      interventions. But these patients of liver failure (acute or chronic) seldom develop&#xD;
      spontaneous bleeding, apart from variceal bleeding in chronic liver failure which generally&#xD;
      occurs because of portal hypertension. Moreover during invasive procedures also they do not&#xD;
      have significant bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concept of rebalanced hemostasis has been proposed to explain discrepancy between results of&#xD;
      these coagulation parameters &amp; clinical scenario of patients. Normal hemostasis consists of 3&#xD;
      steps: platelet endothelial interaction, coagulation &amp; fibrinolysis. First step is considered&#xD;
      to be defective in liver failure because of thrombocytopenia &amp; qualitative platelet&#xD;
      dysfunction. However because of decreased plasma concentration of ADAMTS 13, plasma levels of&#xD;
      vwF are increased thus increasing stickiness of platelets &amp; rebalancing the primary&#xD;
      hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of deranged INR, it is thought that coagulation cascade is deranged but Tripodi et al&#xD;
      have shown that cirrhotics also can generate same amount of thrombin as healthy subjects. All&#xD;
      procoagulants (factor II, V, VII, IX, X, XI) &amp; anticoagulant factors (protein C, protein S &amp;&#xD;
      antithrombin) except factor VIII are synthesized in liver. Decreased procoagulant activity&#xD;
      has been found to be counterbalanced by decreased anticoagulant proteins, thus rebalancing&#xD;
      the whole coagulation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, there is increased fibrinolytic activity and clot instability because of increased&#xD;
      tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with low levels of alpha 2 antiplasmin, factor XIII and&#xD;
      reduced thrombin activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). However, this is balanced by&#xD;
      increased levels of acute phase reactant plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional parameters like INR although can predict mortality in these cases but don't&#xD;
      predict risk of bleeding in these patients because they monitor only a part of coagulation&#xD;
      cascade. These parameters assess clot formation in plasma environment while in&#xD;
      Thromboelastography (TEG) whole blood i.e. both plasma &amp; cellular components including&#xD;
      platelets are assessed &amp; a collective report of hemostatic profile of patient is available.&#xD;
      Graph obtained using TEG gives 5 values including r time, k time, Î± angle, maximum amplitude&#xD;
      &amp; lysis at 30 min assessing different aspects. It has been widely used prior to cardiac&#xD;
      surgery and liver transplant surgery to assess for coagulation defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with stable cirrhosis, the TEG parameters are reported to lie within normal&#xD;
      limits. TEG measurements done serially have been shown to be better than routine coagulation&#xD;
      tests in measuring hypocoagulability in cirrhotics with early rebleeding. In decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients, bacterial infections are common and impair hemostasis. The TEG parameters&#xD;
      are impaired on the day of infection and recover to normal values in 5 days in cases showing&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of TEG in ALF have been contrasting in the two studies which included&#xD;
      predominantly paracetamol induced ALF. Stravitz et al in a study of 51 ALF patients reported&#xD;
      normal TEG in 63%, 1 abnormality in 16%, 2 abnormalities in 10%, 3 abnormalities in 8% of&#xD;
      patients and 4 abnormalities in 4% whereas 8% patients had TEG parameters in a&#xD;
      hypercoagulable range though the mean of parameters were within normal limits in all&#xD;
      patients. In another study of 20 ALF patients, TEG findings were consistent with a&#xD;
      hypocoagulable state in 20%, normal in 45%, and hypercoagulable in 35% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute on chronic liver failure is a recently defined entity with prolonged INR being a&#xD;
      component of definition. The exact nature of coagulopathy in this disease has not yet been&#xD;
      studied. In this prospective study, we propose to study the role of TEG in assessing the&#xD;
      coagulation state in patients with ACLF and comparing the TEG parameters with respect to&#xD;
      patients with ALF, CLD and healthy controls.&#xD;
