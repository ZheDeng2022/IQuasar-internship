      This study will enroll 252 men who have sex with men (MSM) and 252 men who have sex with&#xD;
      women (MSW) in a double-blind, three-way randomized crossover trial with conditions of&#xD;
      fitted, thin, and standard condoms. The study will provide fitted condoms in 56 sizes based&#xD;
      on combinations of length (approximately 10 mm increments) and circumference (approximately 2&#xD;
      mm increments), with user-determined size based on a paper template measurement instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to the sequence in which the crossover intervention&#xD;
      conditions (fitted, thin, and standard condoms) occur, with five study condoms provided for&#xD;
      each condition. Participants will attend at least four, and up to seven, biweekly study&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study objectives are to establish label indications for pleasure and patient preference for&#xD;
      fitted condoms, establish label indication for anal sex for fitted, thin, and standard&#xD;
      condoms, and establish a label indication for decreased clinical failure of fitted condoms&#xD;
      for anal sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 252 MSM and 252 men who sex with women (MSW) into a double-blind,&#xD;
      three-way randomized crossover trial with conditions of fitted, thin, and standard condoms.&#xD;
      For MSM enrolled in the trial we will assess outcomes based on anal sex, and for MSW we will&#xD;
      assess outcomes based on vaginal sex. The study will provide fitted condoms in 56 sizes based&#xD;
      on combinations of length (approximately 10 mm increments) and circumference (approximately 2&#xD;
      mm increments), with user-determined size based on a paper template measurement instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For purposes of this study, a &quot;standard&quot; condom is defined by dimensions commonly sourced by&#xD;
      the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and United States Agency for International&#xD;
      Development (USAID), which procures the majority of the world's condoms. These dimensions are&#xD;
      185mm ± 10mm length, 53mm ± 2mm width, and 70 microns ± 10 microns thick. &quot;Thin&quot; condoms for&#xD;
      this study will be of identical width and length to &quot;standard&quot;, but 50 microns ± 5 microns&#xD;
      thick. Fitted condoms will be produced in a range of sizes with thickness of 70 microns ± 10&#xD;
      microns, with a participant's fitted size as determined by their use of a fitting system&#xD;
      consisting of a paper template graduated with non-sequential numbering and lettering. Condoms&#xD;
      will be manufactured using the same latex formulation and silicone lubricants (approximately&#xD;
      400mg per condom), and with similar parallel wall designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant in the trial will receive a set of five fitted condoms (fitted condition),&#xD;
      a set of five thin condoms (thin condition), and a set of five standard condoms (standard&#xD;
      condition) over a series of study visits. Event-level data based on a home coital log will be&#xD;
      collected regarding pleasure and total clinical failure, and data regarding overall condom&#xD;
      preference will be collected at the final study visit. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the sequence in which the crossover intervention conditions (fitted, thin, and standard)&#xD;
      occur. Each participant will attend at least four, and up to seven, biweekly study visits.&#xD;
      Participants will be given up to four weeks to use each study condom set; after 4 weeks with&#xD;
      a set of condoms, participants will be automatically crossed over into the next study&#xD;
      condition. If all condoms are used within the first two weeks, participants will crossover to&#xD;
      the next randomized condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be blinded, with all condoms produced in plain foils with two-digit&#xD;
      identifying codes, and role-based blinding will be conducted for study staff with the&#xD;
      statistician and PI blinded. Participants will be trained in appropriate condom use, fitted&#xD;
      condom sizing, study instructions such as only using study lubricant, and daily coital log&#xD;
      completion. Participants will complete mobile-optimized, web-based home coital logs as soon&#xD;
      as possible following any vaginal or anal sex acts. To assist participants in timely&#xD;
      completion, there will be a daily check-in through Short Message Service (SMS) (via text&#xD;
      message) with a reminder initiated if no sexual event has been recently reported. The coital&#xD;
      log will include outcome measures for pleasure and for condom failure. The final visit survey&#xD;
      will measure overall condom preference.&#xD;

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>In this closed label trial, study condoms were manufactured in plain foil packaging with identifying 2-digit random codes printed on each foil. Blinding of study staff was role-based; the study statistician and the principal investigator were blinded. To allow for blinded participants to identify preferred condoms, we provided condom sets in color-coded bags. We selected colors that could accommodate common forms of color vision deficiency.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Pleasure Scale Score for Fitted Versus Standard Condoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Our aim was to compare fitted condoms with standard condoms regarding levels of reported pleasure, as determined by rating per condom use event. The sexual pleasure scale for this study was developed and validated by the study team (Siegler et. al., Arch Sex Behav. 2018 Aug; 47(6): 1745-1754), and is titled event-level, male sexual pleasure scale (EMSEXpleasure). The scale comprises 11 items with sliding scale response scores. Pleasure scale measurement was assessed with a mobile-optimized, web-based home daily coital log, completed following each coital event. The minimum scale score was zero, the maximum was 100. Higher values indicate greater pleasure.&#xD;
We assessed the difference in mean scores of pleasure for fitted condoms versus standard condoms.</description>

    <measure>Percent of Participants Preferring Fitted Condoms to Standard Condoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Our aim was to compare fitted condoms with standard condoms regarding preference, as determined by ranking of the two conditions at the study conclusion.&#xD;
Condom preference was determined by participants selecting a preference for fitted or standard condoms at the study conclusion. The measure used assessed a blinded preference, referring to the color assigned to the condom type rather than the type of condom by name.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Condom Failure for Anal Sex</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Our aim was to assess for fitted, thin, and standard condoms the total clinical failure rate of each type of condom for anal sex among MSM relative to the 5% failure cut-point previously used by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Clinical condom failure (condom breakage and slippage) was assessed by questions from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with a mobile-optimized, web-based home daily coital log completed following each coital event. Clinical failure was calculated according to ISO guidance.</description>

        <title>Sexual Pleasure Scale Score for Fitted Versus Standard Condoms</title>
        <description>Our aim was to compare fitted condoms with standard condoms regarding levels of reported pleasure, as determined by rating per condom use event. The sexual pleasure scale for this study was developed and validated by the study team (Siegler et. al., Arch Sex Behav. 2018 Aug; 47(6): 1745-1754), and is titled event-level, male sexual pleasure scale (EMSEXpleasure). The scale comprises 11 items with sliding scale response scores. Pleasure scale measurement was assessed with a mobile-optimized, web-based home daily coital log, completed following each coital event. The minimum scale score was zero, the maximum was 100. Higher values indicate greater pleasure.&#xD;
We assessed the difference in mean scores of pleasure for fitted condoms versus standard condoms.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis is comprised of pleasure scale scores completed after each sex act, when a study condom was used.</population>

        <title>Sexual Pleasure Scale Score for Thin Versus Standard Condoms</title>
        <description>This secondary outcome sought to compare thin condoms with standard condoms regarding levels of reported pleasure, as determined by rating per condom use event. The sexual pleasure scale for this study was developed and validated by the study team (Siegler et. al., Arch Sex Behav. 2018 Aug; 47(6): 1745-1754), and is titled event-level, male sexual pleasure scale (EMSEXpleasure). The scale comprises 11 items with sliding scale response scores. Pleasure scale measurement was assessed with a mobile-optimized, web-based home daily coital log, completed following each coital event. The minimum scale score was zero, the maximum was 100. Higher values indicate greater pleasure.&#xD;
We assessed the difference in mean scores of pleasure for thin condoms versus standard condoms.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis is comprised of pleasure scale scores completed after each sex act, when a study condom was used.</population>
