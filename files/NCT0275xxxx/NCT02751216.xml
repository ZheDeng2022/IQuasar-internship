  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an interventional, observatory single center trial investigating the functional&#xD;
      connectivity of the electrical brain activity in high frequency/high density spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation in failed back surgery syndrome patients with back and leg pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the reimbursement rules in Belgium, a trial implantation of 4 weeks is necessary&#xD;
      before implanting the definitive neurostimulator. The definitive neurostimulator will be&#xD;
      implanted minimum 4 weeks after the trial implantation, when the patient reports more than&#xD;
      50% pain reduction and/or more than 50% reduction in pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are included in this study will have four extra study visits at the University&#xD;
      Hospital Brussels. The first assessment will take place during the week prior to surgery, the&#xD;
      second minimal one month after definitive implantation of the stimulator. The assessments&#xD;
      consist of filling in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Pain Catastrophizing&#xD;
      Scale (PCS) and recording brain activity before and during the pain protocol. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients will wear an Actiwatch for measuring sleep patterns and fill in a VAS diary (back&#xD;
      and leg pain separately), one month before the baseline assessment and one month before the&#xD;
      second assessment.&#xD;
