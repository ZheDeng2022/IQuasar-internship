  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a growing burden in an aging society. There are few proven treatments&#xD;
      and hence disability contributes to poor quality of life and direct/indirect costs to&#xD;
      society. OA symptoms include both increased pain and reduced mobility. Strength training and&#xD;
      aerobic exercise has been shown to improve symptoms in OA; however, the impact of targeted&#xD;
      mobility and balance training in patients with osteoarthritis is unclear. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a novel, low-impact exercise modality that improves balance and gait. The results of&#xD;
      this research project should improve patient options and improve knowledge in OA management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with OA have increased fall risk, which can lead to reduced mobility and curtailment&#xD;
      of daily activities. Patients with OA also show varied and altered mobility in a sit-to-stand&#xD;
      test, suggesting that both poor lower limb strength and flexibility need to be addressed with&#xD;
      targeted interventions in this population. Altered mobility is also associated with pain in&#xD;
      patients with OA. The cause of decreased mobility and increased pain is often a result of&#xD;
      body weight. In a 5-year follow-up study, classes of knee OA were identified as being&#xD;
      associated with good, moderate or poor outcomes; characteristics of the poor outcomes class&#xD;
      included high BMI, worse pain, &gt;2 co-morbidities and avoidance of activities. Avoidance of&#xD;
      activities is a particularly important outcome since this could lead to a downward spiral of&#xD;
      decreased physical functioning, falls and further avoidance of activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have shown that increasing weight from normal to overweight or obese&#xD;
      decreases mobility and increases pain in individuals with OA. This is a potential target for&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapies. For example, Messier et al., showed that a diet and exercise&#xD;
      intervention designed to promote weight loss in overweight individuals with knee OA, improved&#xD;
      knee compressive forces and function, reduced inflammatory marker IL-6, decreased pain and&#xD;
      improved physical health-related quality of life over an 18-month period. This study&#xD;
      demonstrated the important effects of weight loss and exercise on knee OA for overall health.&#xD;
      In a recent review, the evidence was overwhelming regarding the use of exercise as a&#xD;
      treatment of knee OA. Specifically, the literature demonstrates that strength training and&#xD;
      aerobic exercise can improve outcomes, such as pain reduction and increased function, in&#xD;
      patients with OA. Lifestyle interventions should be utilized in OA populations to help reduce&#xD;
      pain, improve mobility and reduce fall risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Square-Stepping Exercise (SSE) was developed is a low-tech, low-intensity, novel form of&#xD;
      exercise developed in Japan. SSE was originally designed to reduce fall risk in older adults.&#xD;
      Participants watch, recognize, memorize and follow increasingly more difficult step patterns,&#xD;
      which an instructor demonstrates on a 4 by 10 square-patterned mat. In older adult&#xD;
      populations, Shigematsu and colleagues have found that SSE improves overall fitness and lower&#xD;
      extremity functioning, as well as reduces fall risk, when compared to walking programs or&#xD;
      strength and balance training. In combination with Shigematsu's research in Japan in healthy&#xD;
      older adults, the investigators are aiming to provide a significant evidence base for SSE&#xD;
      internationally and within varied populations, including older adults with osteoarthritis. In&#xD;
      collaboration with Dr. Shigematsu, the investigators have executed SSE studies at the&#xD;
      Canadian Centre for Activity and Aging in London, ON and most recently in Woodstock, ON.&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence from our study at the Canadian Centre for Activity and Aging showed that&#xD;
      over a 3-month training period, participants in our Exercise-Intervention (E-I) group&#xD;
      (involving mind-motor exercise) improved their total balance scores, compared to an&#xD;
      Exercise-Control (E-C) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSE has not been tested in the OA population. This pilot study will add to the literature to&#xD;
      determine whether it reduces pain and improves mobility as an additional non-pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment for this population.&#xD;
