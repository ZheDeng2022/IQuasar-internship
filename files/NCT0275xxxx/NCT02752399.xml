      The purpose of this study is to verify the applicability Six minutes walk test and Shuttle&#xD;
      walk test in assessing functional capacity in patients with Eisenmenger Syndrome. Patients&#xD;
      will undergo three functional tests, being the six-minute walk test, shuttle walk test and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycle ergometer, associated with evaluation of metabolic&#xD;
      and ventilatory variables and cardiac monitoring throughout the test.&#xD;

      It has seen an increasing number of individuals with congenital heart diseases mainly due to&#xD;
      the development of new diagnostic techniques, assessment and treatment, thereby contributing&#xD;
      to longer survival. These individuals that survive to adulthood, many sometimes develop other&#xD;
      secondary problems to the underlying pathology, one of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. The&#xD;
      Syndrome Eisenmenger is the most advanced form of pulmonary hypertension secondary to&#xD;
      congenital heart defects. It is known that patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary&#xD;
      congenital heart disease have marked functional limitation and high risk of death. Among the&#xD;
      various forms of assess exercise capacity, Walk Test Six Minutes (6MWT), Shuttle walking test&#xD;
      and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test are among the most applicable. Little has been studied&#xD;
      about the patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to congenital heart disease and&#xD;
      Eisenmenger Syndrome. The characterization of this profile of patients against the effort&#xD;
      becomes necessary and useful in determining strategies and identification of factors that may&#xD;
      be limited to functional capacity and quality of life. Objectives: To verify the&#xD;
      applicability Six minutes walk test and Shuttle walk test in assessing functional capacity in&#xD;
      patients with Eisenmenger Syndrome. Methods: Cross-sectional study with patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with Eisenmenger Syndrome, of both sexes, without changing pace or lower limbs, who have&#xD;
      performed echocardiography in the last 6 months and clinical stability. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      three functional tests, being the six-minute walk test, shuttle walk test and cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test on a cycle ergometer, associated with evaluation of metabolic and ventilatory&#xD;
      variables and cardiac monitoring throughout the test. Also will be held assess respiratory&#xD;
      endurance and strength, peripheral muscle strength and manual pinch, Heart rate variability,&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators and blood lactate, besides questionnaires about quality of life,&#xD;
      quality of sleep and daytime drowsiness.&#xD;
