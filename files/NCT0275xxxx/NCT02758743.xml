      The purpose of this study is to validate the novel hypothesis that regular use of Acetium&#xD;
      Lozenge is promising novel method to assist in smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this confirmatory study is to affirm the promising results obtained in a previous&#xD;
      smoking intervention trial with Acetium lozenge. If successful, the trial gives adequate&#xD;
      power to confirm, that the Acetium lozenge represents a breakthrough in the development of&#xD;
      smoking intervention methods.&#xD;

      Background: Smoking dependence has been traditionally ascribed to nicotine, the major&#xD;
      psychoactive component of tobacco (nicotine addiction). Dependence on smoking, however, is a&#xD;
      much more complex issue than just nicotine addiction, and during the past several decades, a&#xD;
      wide variety of approaches have been used in intervention for smoking cessation, with&#xD;
      variable success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tobacco smoke contains several classes of carcinogens, including acetaldehyde in high&#xD;
      concentrations. Acetaldehyde from the tobacco smoke is easily dissolved into the saliva&#xD;
      during smoking, and thus, toxic aldehydes could mediate the carcinogenic effect of tobacco&#xD;
      smoke through the saliva. In 2009, IARC proclaimed acetaldehyde as Group I carcinogen,&#xD;
      equivalent to asbestos, formaldehyde and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on observations that in rodents, acetaldehyde induces reinforcing effects acting in&#xD;
      concert with nicotine, Talhout et al (2007) hypothesized that harmans (condensation products&#xD;
      of acetaldehyde and biogenic amines) may be responsible for these nicotine-reinforcing&#xD;
      effects of acetaldehyde. Harmans are formed in cigarette smoke, and blood harman levels among&#xD;
      smokers appear to be 2-10 times higher than in non-smokers. Harmans inhibit monoamine oxidase&#xD;
      (MAO), and like other MAO-inhibitors, these might help maintaining the behavioral&#xD;
      sensitization to nicotine. This led these authors to speculate that acetaldehyde may increase&#xD;
      the addictive potential of tobacco products via formation of harmans in cigarette smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been known for several decades that L-cysteine (a nonessential amino acid) is able to&#xD;
      eliminate the toxicity of acetaldehyde by reacting covalently with acetaldehyde to form a&#xD;
      stable 2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (MTCA). This simple principle was used in the&#xD;
      recent innovation of Biohit HealthCare's Acetium™ capsule containing 100mg L-cysteine. Oral&#xD;
      administration of Acetium was confirmed to effectively bind acetaldehyde originated from&#xD;
      ethanol metabolism in the stomach, raising the idea that L-cysteine could also be used to&#xD;
      eliminate acetaldehyde dissolved into the saliva during smoking. Indeed, Salaspuro et al.&#xD;
      (2006) confirmed that orally administered L-cysteine (5mg)-containing sucking tablet&#xD;
      (lozenge) totally inactivated acetaldehyde in the saliva during smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the above, it is tempting to speculate that elimination of acetaldehyde in the saliva&#xD;
      during cigarette smoking by L-cysteine sucking tablets, might effectively block (or reduce)&#xD;
      the formation of harmans, reduce their high blood levels, and thus alleviate the&#xD;
      acetaldehyde-enhanced nicotine addiction (by reducing MAO-inhibition) among smokers. The&#xD;
      present study is designed to validate the novel hypothesis that regular use of Acetium&#xD;
      lozenges in context with smoking is an effective intervention for cessation of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To test the efficacy of Acetium lozenges (used simultaneously with smoking) to&#xD;
      trigger the quit from cigarette smoking as compared with similarly administered placebo&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing Acetium lozenges&#xD;
      and placebo as triggers of cigarette smoking cessation during one-year intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A cohort of 1.800 current cigarette smokers will be enrolled by public invitation.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects must be current cigarette smokers (no limitation as to pack years), who are&#xD;
      well motivated to refrain from smoking, and who give a written consent to participate. The&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly allocated to two groups (n=900 in each), receiving either Acetium&#xD;
      lozenges or placebo, in a double-blind setting, where both the examiners and the test&#xD;
      subjects are blinded to the test substance. All subjects must consent for not using any other&#xD;
      measures of smoking cessation intervention. All subjects are requested to fill in a&#xD;
      structured questionnaire recoding their detailed smoking history and assessing their nicotine&#xD;
      dependence by FTND (Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence) and breath CO-monitoring. The&#xD;
      subjects will be administered a smoking diary, to be filled on daily basis, recording the&#xD;
      daily numbers of cigarettes, test lozenges and subjective sensations of smoking. These&#xD;
      diaries are returned to study monitors on three-monthly FU visits, when also subjected to new&#xD;
      FTND and CO-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoints include PPA (point prevalence of abstinent rate) and PA&#xD;
      (prolonged abstinence), used for calculating OR (95%CI) between the two study arms by&#xD;
      logistic regression. Changes in FTND score and CO-levels represent intermediate surrogate&#xD;
      endpoints of PP and PA. In addition, time to quit (TTQ) and duration of quit (QT=quit time)&#xD;
      can be used as dependent variables in univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate (Cox)&#xD;
      survival analyses. GEE and Poisson models are used to estimate the covariates&#xD;
      (Acetium/Placebo) of i) persistence of abstinence, and ii) quit events (events/person time at&#xD;
      risk), respectively, based on multiple records (panel data) in a longitudinal setting.&#xD;
      Finally, the predictors of the multiple outcomes in this intervention trial can be estimated&#xD;
      using the novel competing-risks regression model, where i) no effect, ii) permanent quit,&#xD;
      iii) temporary quit with relapse, and iv) smoking reduction, represent the competing-risks&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power of the study can be calculated specifically for each of these statistical&#xD;
      techniques, most simply by the two-sample proportion test for PP and PA. This study (n=900 in&#xD;
      both arms) is adequately powered (Type II error 0.80, type I error 0.05) to detect a true&#xD;
      difference (in PP or PA) of 5% between the two arms, within the range of 10% vs. 20% quit&#xD;
      rate in the two arms. Within this (10-20%) range, the study power is sensitive to any&#xD;
      decrease in this difference, but allows less difference (7.5%) if the quit rate falls between&#xD;
      5% and 15% in the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: The null hypothesis of the study implicates that Acetium lozenges are not&#xD;
      superior to placebo in the intervention for smoking quit during the 1-year intervention.&#xD;
      Rejection or not of the null hypothesis is based on comparison of the two arms by the&#xD;
      different statistical approaches listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of the study: This double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial will test the&#xD;
      new hypothesis whether or not Acetium lozenges are superior to placebo as triggers of smoking&#xD;
      quit when regularly used in context of smoking for a prolonged period. If this concept proves&#xD;
      to be correct, the results will have a major clinical impact while providing an entirely&#xD;
      novel approach to support regular smokers to withdraw this unhealthy habit.&#xD;
