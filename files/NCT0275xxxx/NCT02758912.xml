    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term plasma and urine pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters of Cardionat®, capsules 250 mg, when used in healthy athlete volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of four steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 1. Screening - selecting healthy volunteers for inclusion in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 2. Assignment in one of the study group, prescription of the study drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 3. Samples collections for pharmacokinetic analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 4. Evaluation of pharmacokinetic data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardionat is a structural analogue of gamma-butyrobetaine - a substance that is in every cell&#xD;
      of the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under extra strain conditions cardionat restores the balance between oxygen delivery to the&#xD;
      cell and cellular oxygen demand. Cardionat clears the intracellular accumulation of toxic&#xD;
      metabolic products, protecting them from damage; also it has a general tonic effect. As a&#xD;
      result of its use of the body acquires the ability to withstand stress and to quickly restore&#xD;
      energy reserves. Because of these properties cardionat used to treat a variety of disorders&#xD;
      of the cardiovascular system, disorders of blood supply to the brain, as well as to improve&#xD;
      physical and mental performance. Synthesis of gamma-butyrobetaine, which has vasodilating&#xD;
      properties, is highly increased as a result of reducing the concentration of carnitine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of acute ischemic myocardial injury cardionat slows the formation of necrotic&#xD;
      areas, shortens the rehabilitation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In heart failure it increases myocardial contractility, increases exercise tolerance, reduces&#xD;
      the frequency of angina attacks. In acute and chronic ischemic cerebrovascular disorders it&#xD;
      improves blood circulation in the ischemic areas; it promotes blood redistribution increasing&#xD;
      supply of the ischemic areas. It is effective in the case of vascular and dystrophic&#xD;
      pathology of the ocular fundus. The drug eliminates functional disturbances of the nervous&#xD;
      system in patients with chronic alcoholism during abstinence syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics After oral administration, the drug is rapidly absorbed. Bioavailability is&#xD;
      78%. The maximum plasma concentration is reached 1-2 hours after oral ingestion. The drug is&#xD;
      metabolized in the body with the formation of two major metabolites, which are excreted by&#xD;
      the kidneys. The half-life after oral intake is dose-dependent, and is usually 3 to 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for use:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of combination treatment of coronary heart disease (angina, myocardial infarction),&#xD;
      congestive heart failure and dyshormonal cardiomyopathy, as well as part of combination&#xD;
      treatment of acute and chronic cerebrovascular disorders (stroke and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      insufficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced working capacity; physical stress, including physical stress in athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstinence syndrome in chronic alcohol abusers (in combination with specific alcohol abuse&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, volunteers will receive study medication in the form of oral capsules 250 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug will be applied as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: intake of study medication capsules orally at a dose of 1 g per day for 3 weeks&#xD;
           - 14 volunteers (7 males and 7 females);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: intake of study medication capsules at a dose of 2 g per day for 3 weeks - 14&#xD;
           volunteers (7 males and 7 females).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results will be published in &quot;Drug Testing and Analysis&quot; journal&#xD;

    <description>Time of onset of aerobic threshold (tat) is a time-point of exercise load test where energy supplied primarily by aerobic glycolysis. It corresponds to a level of homeostasis, in which an increase in lactate occurs in the blood, exceeding a certain baseline level (up to this point lactate appearing in the muscles was completely neutralized by buffer systems). It is determined during the test at a value of the respiratory quotient of R ~ 0,85, corresponding to the appearance of the first bend on oxygen consumption-time curve (pulmonary ventilation).</description>

    <description>Time of onset of the anaerobic threshold (tant) is a time-point of exercise load test where anaerobic glycolysis becomes the leading mechanism of energy supply, and persistent accumulation of lactate with increase of lactate / pyruvate ration in muscle and arterial blood are observed. It is determined during the test at a value of the respiratory quotient of R ~ 1,01, corresponding to the appearance of the second bend on oxygen consumption-time curve (pulmonary ventilation).</description>

    <description>Respiratory quotient (R) is a ratio of carbon dioxide volume emitted from the body to the volume of the absorbed oxygen during that time.
