    <textblock>
      Biological markers of depressive states have been studied, but their usefulness to predict&#xD;
      the therapeutic response is unknown. This issue is major in all depressive states which have&#xD;
      not remitted after several lines of treatment. rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation) is a non-pharmacological alternative in the treatment of depression, but its&#xD;
      effects on cerebral functioning are not known in episodes which have resist to conventional&#xD;
      treatments. The investigators will include 50 depressive patients who have failed to respond&#xD;
      to two successive antidepressant medication, and propose them a treatment with low frequency&#xD;
      rTMS during 3 to 6 weeks. Cerebral functional imaging with 18FDG-PET (positon emission&#xD;
      tomography) with be assessed at the beginning and at the end of rTMS acute treatment, in&#xD;
      order to measure induced metabolic changes and their correlation with clinical states.&#xD;
      Patients who have responded to rTMS acute treatment may continue this therapeutic for six&#xD;
      months, and the investigators will assess if efficacy maintenance is related with cerebral&#xD;
      metabolic variations&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, lifetime prevalence of depression is 21 %, with major consequences: handicap, loss&#xD;
      of productivity, reduction in quality of life, increased mortality. The efficient and&#xD;
      long-lasting care of depression is consequently a priority of public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite well-conducted conventional therapeutic strategies, it is estimated that about 30 %&#xD;
      of the depressed patients do not respond at all to an antidepressant, that 30 % will present&#xD;
      a partial response, and that 40 % only patients will have a complete remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological alternative treatments have been promoted, particularly with repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). A recent meta-analysis with 29 randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials versus placebo reports a 29.3 % response rate and a 18.6 % remission rate&#xD;
      after active stimulation vs respectively, 10.4 % and 5 % after placebo stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, predictive biomarkers of response are unknown, and cerebral metabolism may be a good&#xD;
      candidate. It is admitted that the depressive state is correlated with specific modifications&#xD;
      of glucose metabolism in circuits which are involved in the neurobiology of depression. The&#xD;
      amplitude of these changes may correlate with clinical severity or may differ with treatment&#xD;
      type, and cerebral metabolic changes might be an additional guide to treatment. Finally, the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect might normalize cerebral functional activity and this might be an early&#xD;
      correlate of clinical response. However the studies using functional imaging in a therapeutic&#xD;
      approach or in the understanding of the physiopathology of the depression are not usable in a&#xD;
      clinical practice of routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suggest using a well-known analysis software (Scenium software, Siemens&#xD;
      GmbH) who allows an automated analysis by the distribution of the cerebral metabolism by&#xD;
      means of the F18-FDG TEP-TDM and a quantitative measure, expressed in regional consumption of&#xD;
      glucose expressed by g / 100 g / min for every 18F-FDG TEP-TDM and for every region of&#xD;
      interest. Image registering by the camera, remote of the injection of the tracer, lasts less&#xD;
      than 10 minutes.The software also allows to compare the data acquired for a patient with a&#xD;
      standardized database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a opened study in two centers (Monaco Hospital/Nice CHU) on 50&#xD;
      depressed patients aged from 40 to 65 years old, not having answered 2 lines of well led&#xD;
      antidepressants. Low-frequency rTMS will be proposed in acute cure (3 in 6 weeks) in&#xD;
      monotherapy followed by 6 months of rTMS for patients who have responded to acute treatment&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral metabolic modifications (location and intensity) will be calculated after two&#xD;
      PET-TDM in every patient, realized before and after the acute treatment by rTMS. We shall use&#xD;
      the SCENIUM software which allows to compare each patient's data with a standardized&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the acute period of treatment, it will be proposed to patients who have&#xD;
      responded to pursue rTMS treatment in a consolidation phase for 6 months. All patients will&#xD;
      be longitudinally assessed during this consolidation period. One objective is to assess if&#xD;
      initial TEP-TDM data and/or the amplitude of the induced metabolic variation is associated&#xD;
      with the stability of the clinical answer in respondent patients&#xD;
