  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying capmatinib as a treatment for advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer with MET exon 14 skipping, where the participant has already received prior therapy&#xD;
      with a MET inhibitor.&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Capmatinib as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are using the study drug called Capmatinib.&#xD;
      Capmatinib is a specific blocker of the cMET protein. This protein acts as a trigger to start&#xD;
      a series of events in your cells in what is known as the C-Met pathway. Patients with MET&#xD;
      exon 14 skipping have activation of the MET pathway. By blocking MET, Capmatinib may slow or&#xD;
      stop the growth and/or survival of cancer cells. Capmatinib is not yet FDA approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of people with this type of cancer. It is not known if capmatinib will be effective&#xD;
      in people who have previously had other drugs that block the cMET pathway. This study will&#xD;
      help us understand how capmatinib works in the body and what capmatinib does to cancer. Any&#xD;
      potential harmful effects of capmatinib will also be studied.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance&#xD;
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,&#xD;

             methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In&#xD;

             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug&#xD;
             and for 7 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period.&#xD;
             A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery&#xD;
             of the drug via seminal fluid&#xD;
