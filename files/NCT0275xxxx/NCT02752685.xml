  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open-label multi-cohort Phase II study evaluating the&#xD;
      safety/tolerability and clinical activity of the combination of nab-paclitaxel and the&#xD;
      antibody against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), pembrolizumab, in patients with human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) negative metastatic breast cancer (n=50). There will&#xD;
      be two cohorts of patients consisting of a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cohort with&#xD;
      30 subjects and a hormone receptor (HR)-positive cohort with 20 subjects. There will be an&#xD;
      initial safety run-in with 12 subjects from the TNBC and HR-positive cohort (~ 6 patients&#xD;
      from each cohort). If no unexpected toxicity is observed (as defined in the study protocol),&#xD;
      then enrollment will continue to complete both cohorts (30 total TNBC, 20 total in HR&#xD;
      positive cohort). The subjects from the run in safety part will be included in the Phase II&#xD;
      analysis. Tumor expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is not required for&#xD;
      enrollment in the study, but will be assessed as possible predictive marker.&#xD;

             following last dose of study therapy, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
