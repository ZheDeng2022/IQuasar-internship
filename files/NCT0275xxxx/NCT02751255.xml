  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) patients who develop bortezomib and lenalidomide-resistant disease have&#xD;
      a very poor survival of only a median of 9 months, indicating that new agents are urgently&#xD;
      needed. Recent studies have shown that daratumumab as a single agent is effective and well&#xD;
      tolerated in these heavily pretreated MM patients. However, approximately 60% of patients do&#xD;
      not achieve a partial response, and ultimately all patients will develop progressive disease&#xD;
      during daratumumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have demonstrated that levels of the target antigen CD38, and expression&#xD;
      levels of the complement inhibitory proteins CD55 and CD59 determine the susceptibility of&#xD;
      the MM cells towards daratumumab. In addition, MM cells have lower CD38 expression levels and&#xD;
      higher levels of CD55/CD59 at the time of progression. Importantly, all-trans retinoic acid&#xD;
      (ATRA) upregulates CD38 levels and downregulates CD55/CD59 levels on MM cells, both in&#xD;
      daratumumab naïve cells and in cells that are resistant to daratumumab because of previous&#xD;
      exposure to this drug. These alterations in expression explain the strong synergy between&#xD;
      ATRA and daratumumab, both in MM cells derived from daratumumab naïve patients and from&#xD;
      patients with daratumumab-refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data form the preclinical rationale for clinical evaluation of ATRA and daratumumab in&#xD;
      MM patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) patients that develop bortezomib and lenalidomide-resistant disease&#xD;
      have a very poor survival of only a median of 9 months. This clearly illustrates that new&#xD;
      anti-MM agents are needed with different mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, daratumumab monotherapy is effective and well tolerated in heavily pre-treated&#xD;
      lenalidomide and bortezomib-refractory myeloma patients. However, approximately 60% of&#xD;
      patients do not achieve a partial response, and ultimately all patients, also those achieving&#xD;
      complete response, will develop progressive disease during daratumumab therapy. Factors that&#xD;
      determine the susceptibility of MM cells to daratumumab include levels of the target antigen&#xD;
      CD38, and expression levels of the complement inhibitory proteins CD55 and CD59. At the time&#xD;
      of progression, there is a reduced level of CD38 on the MM cells, whereas CD55 and CD59&#xD;
      levels are increased. This indicates that these factors are also involved in the development&#xD;
      of daratumumab-resistant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, ATRA upregulates CD38 levels and downregulates CD55/CD59 levels on MM cells,&#xD;
      both in daratumumab naïve cells and in cells that are resistant to daratumumab because of&#xD;
      previous exposure to this drug. These alterations in expression explain the strong synergy&#xD;
      between ATRA and daratumumab, both in MM cells derived from daratumumab naïve patients and&#xD;
      from patients with daratumumab-refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data form the preclinical rationale for clinical evaluation of ATRA and daratumumab in&#xD;
      MM patients. The investigators will treat relapsed/refractory MM patients in two stages. The&#xD;
      first stage (part A) consists of treatment with daratumumab monotherapy. In case these&#xD;
      patients have progressive disease after cycle 1, less than minimal response after cycle 2, or&#xD;
      less than partial response after cycle 3 (unless ongoing response) to single agent&#xD;
      daratumumab, or in case these patients progress during daratumumab therapy after previous&#xD;
      response, then ATRA will be added to daratumumab (part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to develop a safe ATRA and daratumumab combination suitable for&#xD;
      clinical use and evaluation in subsequent randomized clinical trials. To this end, the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ATRA and daratumumab will be determined for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory disease, who were treated with daratumumab but failed to achieve a&#xD;
      partial response, or developed progressive disease during daratumumab treatment. This will be&#xD;
      followed by a second part in which the investigators will examine the effectivity and&#xD;
      toxicity profile of the combination at the MTD.&#xD;
