      Bone disorder is a significant problem in chronic kidney disease (CKD), becoming almost&#xD;
      universal in stage 5 CKD patients. Besides the healthcare costs, bone disorder is associated&#xD;
      with life-threatening complications, including fractures and cardiovascular (CV) events.&#xD;
      Kidney transplantation provides circa 68% decrease in mortality and improves co-morbidity.&#xD;
      Still, bone disease persists after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that bone-derived hormones can induce CV events in kidney&#xD;
      transplanted patients. Therefore, early evaluation of the bone health is recommended, and&#xD;
      prevention of its complications is required. Bone biopsy, an invasive and expensive method,&#xD;
      is the gold standard for bone disorders diagnosis. Therefore, non-invasive predictors for&#xD;
      bone disease are necessary. Classical biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption&#xD;
      have shown a low sensitivity and low specificity. New markers, as fibroblast growth factor 23&#xD;
      (FGF23), and its cofactor klotho, and sclerostin are promising new markers for predicting&#xD;
      CKD-associated bone and CV disease after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assesses the phenotype of bone disease after transplantation (given by bone&#xD;
      histology) and its correlation with serum FGF23, klotho and sclerostin, in order to evaluate&#xD;
      its performance predicting CKD-associated bone and CV disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide. Cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) events cause more than 50% of the mortality risk in CKD patients, and the relative&#xD;
      excess mortality is observed in younger patients, below 45 years of age. Decreased renal&#xD;
      function led to changes in biochemical parameters (calcium, phosphorus, PTH and vitamin D&#xD;
      levels) and disturbed mineral metabolism, which translates into different bone disorders&#xD;
      (related to bone turnover, mineralization, and volume) and all these are associated with&#xD;
      extra-skeletal calcifications. Bone disease at any stage of CKD is associated with CV&#xD;
      morbidity. This cross-talk between bone and vessels constitute a systemic syndrome known as&#xD;
      CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), that is thought to be one of the major&#xD;
      non-traditional risk factors for the extremely high rate mortality observed in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD-MBD is classified into four major histological groups (in terms of turnover,&#xD;
      mineralization and volume): hyperparathyroid bone disease (high turnover disease, with normal&#xD;
      mineralization and variable volume); adynamic bone disease (low turnover disease, with normal&#xD;
      mineralization and decreased bone volume); osteomalacia (low turnover disease, with reduced&#xD;
      mineralization and with normal or high bone volume); and mixed renal osteodystrophy (reduced&#xD;
      mineralization with or without increased bone formation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for established stage 5 CKD. Even with&#xD;
      correction of uremia, post-transplant MBD is frequent and reflects the pre-existing CKD-MBD,&#xD;
      the effects of renal dysfunction after transplantation, and the effects and consequences of&#xD;
      immunosuppression. Transplanted patients with CKD-MBD have reduced quality of life and&#xD;
      require medical assistance for bone pain, fractures and CV events. Indeed, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease remains the leading cause of death after renal transplantation, still doubling risk&#xD;
      of the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for the diagnosis of CKD-associated bone disease is bone biopsy, an&#xD;
      expensive and invasive procedure. Non-invasive markers of bone disease presently lack&#xD;
      sufficient specificity and sensitivity to allow the differential diagnosis of renal&#xD;
      osteodystrophy. New biomarkers are needed and, osteocyte-derived factors, as FGF23 and&#xD;
      sclerostin, are promising answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FGF23 acts as a phosphaturic hormone, a suppressor of vitamin D and has some non-consensual&#xD;
      effect on parathyroid hormone (PTH). FGF23 has a specific receptor but needs a co-factor,&#xD;
      klotho protein, to perform the majority of its functions. Serum klotho levels in CKD are low,&#xD;
      influencing the resistance to FGF23 activity. What happens in transplanted patients is not&#xD;
      yet totally understood; some studies pointed out for endothelial dysfunction and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease mediated by these factors in the transplant setting. Besides, graft&#xD;
      loss and mortality were related with high serum levels of FGF23 and with bone mineral density&#xD;
      loss but their relation with histological bone disease is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sclerostin is a glycoprotein product of the SOST gene in osteocytes and acts as a negative&#xD;
      regulator of bone metabolism. Various observations have shown that CKD patients have high&#xD;
      sclerostin serum levels, thus its potential role in renal osteodystrophy. The correlation&#xD;
      between serum levels of sclerostin and histomorphometric parameters of bone turnover,&#xD;
      osteoblast number and function in renal transplanted patients is not yet known. The impact of&#xD;
      high sclerostin levels on CV disease and mortality is yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies relating sclerostin levels with CV mortality in dialysis patients are inconsistent.&#xD;
      Studies in renal transplanted patients are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS. The investigators will study the relationship of the new osteocyte-derived biomarkers&#xD;
      of bone disease, FGF23 (and klotho) and sclerostin, with bone histologic changes and CV&#xD;
      events at baseline and one year after transplantation. If an association is to be found, the&#xD;
      performance of the biomarkers as predictors of CKD-MBD will be determined. Non-contrast CT&#xD;
      will allow us to validate Adragão score in a population of renal transplants, as this score&#xD;
      is only validated for dialysis patients. We will study possible correlations between coronary&#xD;
      artery calcification score and demographic characteristics of patients; laboratorial levels&#xD;
      of FGF23, klotho, esclerostin, PTH, calcium, phosphorus, calcium x phosphorus, magnesium,&#xD;
      LDL-colestherol, and albumin (both at T0 and T1), bone turnover, mineralization and volume&#xD;
      (both at T0 and T1), and DXA results at 1 year. From these findings, we will try to discover&#xD;
      potential new risk factors for vascular calcifications in renal transplant patients and&#xD;
      potential pathophysiological mechanisms for this phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS. Prospective cohort study of a convenience, consecutive sample of de novo renal&#xD;
      transplanted patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At recruitment, data will be collected on aetiology of CKD, presence of diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, hyperparathyroidism, hepatitis virus, ovulation status for woman (menopause or&#xD;
      not), active pre-transplant medication (with emphasis in vitamin D analogues, calcimimetics,&#xD;
      and phosphate binders), echocardiography (M mode and 2D), Teresa Adragão score of vascular&#xD;
      calcifications (hands and pelvis x-rays), HLA phenotype and mismatches, donor data (age,&#xD;
      gender, cause of death), cold ischemia time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up for 1 year, during which data will be recorded on&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimens (cumulative doses), CV events (myocardial infarction, congestive&#xD;
      heart failure, arrhythmia), fractures, rejection episodes, graft loss (and its cause), and&#xD;
      death (CV [fatal myocardial infarction, sudden death and fatal congestive heart failure],&#xD;
      infection, malignancy or other). At the end of follow-up, echocardiogram (M mode and 2D) and&#xD;
      scoring of vascular calcifications will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine, urea, ionogram, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and bone&#xD;
      alcaline phosphatase will be assessed using standard methods. PTH will be measured by&#xD;
      immuno-chemiluminescence using a second-generation assay (Immulite 2000; Siemens Medical&#xD;
      Solutions Diagnostics, Los Angels, CA). Vitamin D [25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D] will be measured&#xD;
      with radioimmunoassay provided by IDS (Boldon, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two bone biopsies are proposed to each patient (just before the renal transplantation&#xD;
      procedure, already on general anaesthesia, and circa 12 months after transplantation, with&#xD;
      local anaesthesia). Bone biopsies will be made using a 7G trocar (Osteobell T), by manual&#xD;
      puncture. After processing the bone fragment (fixation, dehydration and methylmethacrylate&#xD;
      impregnation), routine staining will be used: von Kossa, Goldner trichrome, acid phosphatase&#xD;
      (selective staining of osteoclasts), and Perls. Cortical bone will be evaluated separately&#xD;
      from trabecular bone. Cortical bone volume and cortical thickness will be measured. Bone&#xD;
      biopsies will be described for: bone remodelling and degree of cellular activation (specific&#xD;
      score); efficacy of mineralization; quantification of possible metal deposits. In order to&#xD;
      evaluate the rate of bone formation and rate of mineral deposition, the patient will be&#xD;
      prescribed tetracycline hydrochloride, 500mg, 12/12 hours for three days, one month and one&#xD;
      week before the 2nd bone biopsy or, in the case of live donor transplantation, before the 1st&#xD;
      and 2nd bone biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time point of the bone biopsies [at day 0 (pre-transplant) and nearly at month&#xD;
      12] serum levels of FGF23, and its cofactor Klotho, and sclerostin will be measured in the&#xD;
      immunology lab of our hospital, according to the manufacturer's instructions. C-terminal&#xD;
      FGF23 will be measured by sandwich ELISA (Immunotopics, San Clement, CA). Alfa-klotho will be&#xD;
      measured by ELISA (IBL America, MN, USA). Sclerostin will be assessed by TECO Sclerostin EIA&#xD;
      kit, which is a 96-well immune-capture ELISA (Sissach, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between bone biopsies before and after transplantation will be assessed by paired&#xD;
      t-test (if comparing scores) or by paired McNemar's test (after switching scores into&#xD;
      categorical variables). Multivariable analysis adjusted for age, gender, diabetes,&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regiments and/or its cumulative doses, and renal function will be performed&#xD;
      to identify independent risk factors for the disease type and severity. In females, menopause&#xD;
      will be considered as an effect modifier of bone volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between FGF23, Klotho and sclerostin pre and post-transplant will be made by&#xD;
      paired t-test, assuming normal distribution. Associations between FGF23, Klotho and&#xD;
      sclerostin levels with demographic data and biochemical parameters in the two time-points&#xD;
      will also be accessed with t-test, with Pearson test and linear regression, whenever&#xD;
      applicable. A multivariable analysis will be executed to control for confounders (age,&#xD;
      gender, diabetes, PTH, renal function, immunosuppressive regiments). Associations between&#xD;
      FGF23, Klotho and sclerostin with bone turnover, mineralization and volume will be explored&#xD;
      with regression models. The potential effects of FGF23 or sclerostin with CV health will be&#xD;
      explored using regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      we are proposing to study as well vascular calcifications in post-transplant renal patients.&#xD;
      For this, we will evaluate vascular calcifications by two different methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plain X-ray of the pelvis and hands for evaluation of vascular calcifications through&#xD;
           Teresa Adragão score at day 0 and nearly at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-contrast CT in a low-radiation exposure technique, quantified using the Agatston&#xD;
           method(26), performed nearly at 15 months after the renal transplant.&#xD;
