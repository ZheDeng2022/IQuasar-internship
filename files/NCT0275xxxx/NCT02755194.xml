      Some medications taken by the breastfeeding women are excreted into milk, posing a potential&#xD;
      risk of toxicity to the infant. The first line of evidence required for toxicity risk&#xD;
      assessment is prediction of drug levels in milk. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) information of&#xD;
      drug excretion into milk is largely lacking, or limited to data from case reports. This makes&#xD;
      it difficult to provide population-level prediction of drug levels in milk. The lack of data&#xD;
      on this topic jeopardizes not only maternal adherence to drug therapy during breastfeeding&#xD;
      but also establishment of breastfeeding, even if the drug is considered safe during nursing.&#xD;
      Clearly, this clinical problem in drug safety is an important women's health issue, affecting&#xD;
      both mother and infant. &quot;Drugs in Lactation&quot; Analysis Consortium (DLAC) is a &quot;drug-in-milk&quot;&#xD;
      monitoring network, which is designed as a platform for efficient collection of patient milk&#xD;
      samples in a real world setting to generate population predictions of drug excretion levels&#xD;
      into human milk.&#xD;

      OVERARCHING GOAL OF DLAC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a post-marketing &quot;drug-in-milk&quot; monitoring system for nursing women who are&#xD;
      prescribed and using medications. Drugs in Lactation Analysis Consortium (DLAC) will provide&#xD;
      risk assessment data and tools for toxicity detection in the form of population estimates and&#xD;
      variations of drug levels in mother's milk and infant plasma for several common medications&#xD;
      in a real world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To generate data on drug levels in breast milk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a population pharmacokinetic model describing drug levels in milk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To simulate/predict drug levels in milk in a population, based on the pop PK model&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model describing drug levels&#xD;
           in infant serum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To screen the breastfed infants of mothers on the study drugs for general health&#xD;
           condition (medical issues, developmental milestones)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCOPE AND RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on the extent of drug excretion into mother's milk is lacking, mainly due to the&#xD;
      following two reasons: 1) nursing women are excluded from drug trials; 2) ethical and&#xD;
      practical difficulties in conducting intensive-sampling PK studies in the breastfeeding&#xD;
      mothers. Even if data exist, they are based on small numbers of patients, and it is difficult&#xD;
      to translate the information into population estimates of drug levels in milk. DLAC is&#xD;
      developed as a novel drug safety network using population PK (popPK) modeling approach, which&#xD;
      allows population-level PK parameter estimation, modeling and simulation based on a scheme of&#xD;
      sparse sampling per individual, systematically collected from a large number of nursing women&#xD;
      on medication in real world setting. This approach will provide population risk estimates as&#xD;
      probability distribution of reaching certain drug level in milk and plasma. Equipped with a&#xD;
      versatile drug analysis core and a popPK modeling and simulation unit, DLAC will be able to&#xD;
      generate PK estimates of a population in the context of breastfeeding.&#xD;
