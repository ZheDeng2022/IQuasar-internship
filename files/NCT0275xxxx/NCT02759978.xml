  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a frequent and serious complication of implanted intracardiac&#xD;
      prosthetic material, with a high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this study aims to&#xD;
      improve outcome of IE, with a focus on patients with intracardiac prosthetic material. In&#xD;
      this study the investigators deal with research questions about both the diagnosis&#xD;
      (microbiological, imaging, and expert opinion) and treatment of IE (with antimicrobial agents&#xD;
      and surgical), in order to improve these clinical components and ultimately aim to improve&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a frequent and serious complication of implanted intracardiac&#xD;
      prosthetic material, with a high morbidity and mortality. The number of procedures where&#xD;
      prosthetic material is implanted in the heart increases, as do the age and comorbidity of&#xD;
      treated subjects. In current clinical practice diagnosis of infected intracardiac prosthetic&#xD;
      material is often difficult because of the lack of sensitivity of the available diagnostic&#xD;
      armamentarium for IE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a general rule, first line treatment of intracardiac prosthetic material related&#xD;
      endocarditis consists of surgical prosthesis removal, combined with appropriate antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapy. The exception encompasses uncomplicated prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). PVE&#xD;
      actually has a fair chance of successful medical treatment alone (&gt;50%), depending on the&#xD;
      causative micro-organism. Although there is evidence and consensus with regard to the first&#xD;
      line treatment, surgical removal is not always possible because of its associated high risk,&#xD;
      technical limitations, or unwillingness of patients to undergo an invasive surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Second and third line treatments do not include surgery, and consist of&#xD;
      antimicrobial therapy with biofilm-penetrating agents during a predetermined timespan (second&#xD;
      line) or as life-long suppressive antimicrobial therapy (third line). These treatments are&#xD;
      the alternative in situations wherein first line treatment is not feasible or is unwanted.&#xD;
      Although not extensively investigated, these treatments are considered suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore further research is necessary. More research is needed to diagnose IE more accurate&#xD;
      and prompt, as current diagnostic criteria (the modified Duke criteria) for IE are&#xD;
      insufficient and as it is unclear how to best allocate non-invasive imaging techniques,&#xD;
      especially for intracardiac prosthetic material. More research is also needed to verify the&#xD;
      indications for and optimize the use of second and third line treatments in patients with&#xD;
      intracardiac prosthetic material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the diagnostic value of the combination of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) and electrocardiogram-gated&#xD;
      multidetector computed tomography angiography (ECG-gated MD-CTA) in patients suspected of IE,&#xD;
      in particular those with intracardiac prosthetic material, when added to the standard&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up for IE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the predictive value of MD-CTA and 18F-FDG PET with regard to relapse rate and&#xD;
           mortality of IE;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify sources of false positive and false negative results in MD-CTA and 18F-FDG&#xD;
           PET (e.g. the effect of the use of antimicrobial therapy on imaging findings);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the best MD-CTA and 18F-FDG PET scanning protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the role of 18F-FDG PET for finding other infectious lesions in the body;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare current clinical practices in patients with intracardiac&#xD;
           prosthetic material related infection when the foreign material cannot be removed; to&#xD;
           determine the outcomes of second and third line treatment as compared with first line&#xD;
           treatment, and to determine predictors of outcome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the potential of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to improve the&#xD;
           antimicrobial therapy in patients suspected of IE, in particular those with intracardiac&#xD;
           prosthetic material:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  for which peak and through blood concentrations should be aimed at in IE for&#xD;
                flucloxacillin, rifampicin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin,&#xD;
                penicillin; fluconazole, flucytosine, amphotericin-B?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  for which peak blood concentrations should be aimed at for gentamicin in IE?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  for which peak and through blood concentrations should be aimed at for vancomycin&#xD;
                in intracardiac prosthetic material related IE?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  for which through blood concentrations should be aimed at in IE for voriconazole?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate antimicrobial concentrations in resected cardiac tissue (e.g. heart valve&#xD;
           or vegetation which has been removed based on medical indication) in patients with IE&#xD;
           who have been treated medically with antimicrobials and who subsequently are operated&#xD;
           upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective multicentre observation study, with the University Medical Center Groningen&#xD;
      (UMCG) in Groningen as the leading centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (≥18 years) in which IE is suspected according to the britisch society for&#xD;
      antimicrobial chemotherapy (BSAC) criteria 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of clinically identified (prosthetic material related) endocarditis episodes,&#xD;
      according to (multiple) constellation(s) of diagnostic criteria versus number of &quot;true&quot;&#xD;
      (prosthetic material related) endocarditis episodes, according to our gold standard &quot;expert&#xD;
      opinion after 12 months (+/- 2 weeks) follow-up&quot; (based on clinical reasoning, the modified&#xD;
      Duke criteria, and findings during surgery and from pathology).&#xD;
