    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if it is possible and safe to treat persons with severe&#xD;
      sickle cell disease (SCD) by bone marrow transplant (BMT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#xD;
      half-matched related donors. Preparation before transplant includes the chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      hydroxyurea, fludarabine, thiotepa, anti-thymocyte globulin, and cyclophosphamide. It also&#xD;
      includes radiation.&#xD;

      includes radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators also seek to understand the side effects of BMT in adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      with SCD and measure how often serious side effects occur including those that are expected&#xD;
      and unexpected. After transplant, investigators will measure the health of the body organs&#xD;
      that ordinarily would have been damaged by having SCD in addition to testing the lungs,&#xD;
      brain, and kidneys.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  History of three or more severe pain crises per year in the 2-year period&#xD;
                  preceding enrollment despite the institution of supportive care measures (i.e. a&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Administration of regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy, defined as&#xD;
                  receiving 8 or more transfusions per year for ≥ 1 year to prevent vaso-occlusive&#xD;
                  clinical complications (i.e. pain, stroke, and ACS). Patients on chronic&#xD;
                  transfusion who have to discontinue transfusion because of allo-sensitization&#xD;
                  will be eligible.&#xD;

               -  An echocardiographic finding of tricuspid valve regurgitant jet (TRJ) velocity ≥&#xD;

                  proven pulmonary arterial hypertension to qualify on this eligibility criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age: Patients must be 15 - 40 years of age inclusive OR if younger than 15 years must&#xD;
             be pubertal&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adequate physical function as measured by:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal for age as per&#xD;
                  local laboratory and 24 hour urine creatinine clearance &gt; 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 or&#xD;

                  for age as per local laboratory and ALT and AST &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal as&#xD;
                  per local laboratory. Patients with hyperbilirubinemia as a consequence of&#xD;
                  hyperhemolysis, or who experience a sudden, profound change in the serum&#xD;
                  hemoglobin after a RBC transfusion, are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For participants with a suitable donor who meet eligibility criteria and are&#xD;
                  willing to proceed to HCT, if they have received chronic transfusion therapy for&#xD;
                  ≥ 1 year and have clinical evidence of iron overload by serum ferritin or MRI, an&#xD;
                  evaluation by liver biopsy is required. Histological examination of the liver&#xD;
                  must document the absence of cirrhosis, bridging fibrosis, and active hepatitis.&#xD;
                  The absence of bridging fibrosis will be determined using the histological&#xD;
                  grading and staging scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Suitable Donor: To undergo transplantation on this study, participants must have an&#xD;
             adult first degree relative who shares at least 1 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#xD;
             haplotype with the participant, does not have SCD or other hemoglobinopathy, and is in&#xD;
             good health; if these criteria are met, they will be allowed to serve as donors.&#xD;
             Relatives with sickle cell trait are not excluded as donors. When more than 1 donor is&#xD;
             available, the donor with the fewest HLA allele mismatches will be chosen, unless the&#xD;
             patient had donor anti-HLA antibodies or there was a medical reason to exclude the&#xD;
             donor. If donor anti-HLA antibodies are detected, the next best related match will be&#xD;
             chosen. Umbilical cord blood or peripheral blood stem cell donors will not be&#xD;
             accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of HLA matched sibling or 8 of 8 HLA-A, B, C and DRB1 matched unrelated&#xD;
             donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of donor specific antibodies in the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological examination of the liver must document the absence of cirrhosis, bridging&#xD;
             fibrosis and active hepatitis. The absence of bridging fibrosis will be determined&#xD;
             using the histological grading and staging scale as described by Ishak and colleagues&#xD;
             (1995). The presence of bridging fibrosis will be an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection in the 6 weeks before enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seropositivity for HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial in which the patient received an investigational&#xD;
             drug or device or off-label use of a drug or device within 3 months of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrated lack of compliance with prior medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to use approved contraception for at least 6 months after transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of substance abuse in the last 5 years that interferes with care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females at the time of consideration for HCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        Donor Selection Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preference will be given to related marrow donors who are 2-4 (out of 8) HLA antigen&#xD;
        mismatched and towards whom the recipient does not have donor specific antibodies. Donors&#xD;
        will sign an informed consent disclosing that the marrow donation will be used by a patient&#xD;
        participating in this study. The donor must be matched with the recipient for at least 4 of&#xD;
        8 HLA alleles (HLA -A, -B, -C and -DRB1 by allele-level DNA methodology). The target total&#xD;
        nucleated cell count (TNC) is 3.5-8.0 x 108/kg of recipient weight. Marrow will be&#xD;
        collected without mobilization. Mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (HPC-A) collections&#xD;
        will not be permitted. Donors must undergo hemoglobinopathy screening by electrophoresis;&#xD;
        donors who have a hemoglobinopathy will be excluded but trait condition is acceptable.&#xD;
