    <textblock>
      After approval of the Institutional Review Board and written patient´s informed consent&#xD;
      patients with indication for surgery of the sinuses were randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      study groups. After standardized anaesthetic management and PONV prophylaxis routinely&#xD;
      applied the patients were screened for mucosal injury on second postoperative day.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the amount of analgetic and anti-emetic drugs and the severity of pain and PONV&#xD;
      were recorded throughout the hospital stay.&#xD;

      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a complication of anaesthesia and responsible&#xD;
      for malaise of surgical patients. Furthermore, PONV has been shown causing additive costs due&#xD;
      to anti-emetic drugs and prolonged hospitalisation. The occurrence of PONV is multifactorial.&#xD;
      Beside individual patients factors, opioid use and type of surgery seem to be responsible for&#xD;
      occurrence of PONV. Especially, sinus surgery carries a high risk of PONV. Blood from the&#xD;
      operation site entering the stomach has been discussed the potential cause for PONV in this&#xD;
      specific patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, hypopharyngeal packing following orotracheal intubation is a common clinical&#xD;
      practice to prevent blood passing through the esophagus and so to lower the incidence of&#xD;
      PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there are limited data data supporting the effectiveness of this procedure. In&#xD;
      contrast, some references suggest that hypopharyngeal packing may be associated with&#xD;
      postoperative mucosal injury and sore throat with high impact on patients´ well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the usefulness and safety of hypopharyngeal packing the investigators perform&#xD;
      prospective randomized study with the following objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Does pharyngeal packing during sinus surgery increase the incidence of mucosal injury?&#xD;
