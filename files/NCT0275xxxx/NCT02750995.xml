      The purpose of this phase I study is to investigate the combination of hypomethylating agents&#xD;
      with experimental peptide vaccination against four selected tumor antigens, known to be&#xD;
      upregulated in response to hypomethylating agents, in patients with high risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who&#xD;
      cannot be offered curative treatment, have a poor prognosis with a median survival of 11.5&#xD;
      months. There is currently only one registered drug that has been shown to prolong survival&#xD;
      in this patient group; the hypomethylating agent azacitidine (also known as 5-azacytidine or&#xD;
      VidazaÂ®). The treatment is not curative, but increases the median survival to approximately&#xD;
      two years. The dominant cause of death is progressive disease, and there is a huge need for&#xD;
      new treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will combine experimental immunotherapy of peptide vaccination with standard&#xD;
      therapy of azacitidine for treatment of patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome or&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia. Our project is expected to expand the knowledge in regard to&#xD;
      combination of immunotherapy and conventional treatment and will be essential for further&#xD;
      development of this treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME (MDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulation of both genetic and epigenetic changes in hematopoietic stem cells is considered&#xD;
      the background for development of MDS. In the early stages of the disease, there is increased&#xD;
      apoptosis, but as the disease progresses to high-risk MDS or AML there is an accumulation of&#xD;
      chromosomal breakage, point mutations and promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor&#xD;
      genes, resulting in a more aggressive and proliferative disease. The clinical symptoms are&#xD;
      anemia, repeated infections and bleeding episodes associated with the dysfunctional bone&#xD;
      marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the only curative treatment option for MDS is allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation. This is a high-risk treatment, only feasible in younger patients with a&#xD;
      suitable donor. In 2009, a Phase III study (AZA 001) was published, showing that patients&#xD;
      with high-risk MDS and AML with &lt;30% blasts treated with the hypomethylating drug azacitidine&#xD;
      had superior overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZACITIDINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of azacitidine is not immediate in all patients, and it is therefore necessary to&#xD;
      proceed with a minimum 5-6 cycles to determine whether the patient has a response to&#xD;
      treatment. At present, azacitidine is the standard of care for all patients with high-risk&#xD;
      MDS and AML with &lt;30% blasts, who cannot be offered curative treatment. Unfortunately, most&#xD;
      patients who respond to treatment later relapse and die of their disease. The mechanism&#xD;
      behind the clinical efficacy of azacitidine is not fully elucidated and may be&#xD;
      multiparametric. The hypomethylation results in re-expression of tumor suppressor genes that&#xD;
      may serve as a possible mechanism for growth arrest. In addition, an up-regulation of cancer&#xD;
      testis antigens (CTA) has been observed during treatment, which could lead to increased&#xD;
      immune recognition of tumor cells, and hence immune-mediated tumor cell killing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in this trial, azacitidine is standard therapy and will be administered&#xD;
      according to standard dosing regimens, and participants will be evaluated for treatment&#xD;
      response according to standard criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TUMOR ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle behind cancer vaccination is based on the immune system's ability to&#xD;
      discriminate between normal and malignant cells. The immune system recognizes an altered&#xD;
      pattern of peptide expression on the surface of the malignant cells. The altered pattern may&#xD;
      involve the expression of qualitatively altered cell proteins, simple overexpression of&#xD;
      normally occurring proteins, or de novo expression of proteins/glycoproteins not normally&#xD;
      expressed in that tissue. This category of immune-recognized proteins is known as tumor&#xD;
      associated antigens. As proteins are degraded in cells, peptides are presented on the surface&#xD;
      of these cells as a complex with tissue type molecules (HLA molecules). T-cells may then&#xD;
      recognize the peptide-HLA complexes, via its T-cell receptor, potentially resulting in&#xD;
      tumor-cell killing, if sufficient priming takes place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the present study, the group of cancer testis antigens (CTA's) are of special interest,&#xD;
      since expression of these are known to be regulated by methylation, and therefore affected by&#xD;
      hypo-methylating treatment such as azacitidine. CTA's are known to be immunogenic and are&#xD;
      only expressed at immunoprivileged sites, thus out of reach of immune responses, and on&#xD;
      cancer cells, making them ideal targets for therapeutic cancer vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VACCINE DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have chosen specifically three CTA's for which abundant re-expression has been shown&#xD;
      following azacitidine treatment, including NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3 and PRAME. WT-1 is additionally&#xD;
      included as this protein has proven to be an important antigen in hematological malignancies&#xD;
      and is likewise upregulated in response to azacitidine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peptides we have chosen have not been used together in this particular combination&#xD;
      before, but separately their use as therapeutic vaccination is well studied. Both smaller&#xD;
      peptide sequences and full length proteins have been utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of synthetic long peptides for induction and T-cell responses has shown superior&#xD;
      effects in contrast to minimal peptide sequences in both mice and humans, furthermore&#xD;
      synthetic long peptide has been shown to be efficiently processed and presented to both CD4&#xD;
      and CD8 T-cells of the immune system. Also, long-peptides have the advantage to enable&#xD;
      presentation of several different T-cell epitopes dependent on the patients' HLA type. Thus,&#xD;
      the choice of long peptides will minimize the impact of patients HLA type, and therefore in&#xD;
      the present study allow inclusion of participants without prior selection based on HLA&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peptides we have chosen are between 25 and 29 amino acids and will be mixed as a&#xD;
      suspension with Montanide ISA-51; a commonly used water and oil based vaccine adjuvant,&#xD;
      involved in over 150 registered trials at Clinicaltrail.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with high-risk MDS and AML with &lt;30% blasts are today offered treatment with&#xD;
      azacitidine, 100 mg/m2 for 5 days every 4th week. In the proposed vaccination protocol, we&#xD;
      have chosen to follow this same regimen, but in addition offer vaccination with peptides&#xD;
      derived for cancer testis antigens. Patients will be included after completion of 6 courses&#xD;
      of azacitidine and a treatment evaluation. If the patient shows response to treatment with&#xD;
      azacitidine and the marrow is not hypoplastic, azacitidine treatment will be combined with&#xD;
      peptide vaccination to boost the immune reactivity against selected tumor antigens. Patients&#xD;
      will be vaccinated with a set of 3 vaccinations, with a vaccination on the 1st day of each&#xD;
      azacitidine course, given every 4th week. If treatment is delayed more than 3 weeks the&#xD;
      patient is excluded from the protocol. Patients are evaluated for clinical responses after 6&#xD;
      courses of azacitidine treatment combined with vaccination. Patients that are not&#xD;
      progressing, will continue azacitidine treatment according to standard schedule, and further&#xD;
      vaccinations will be given once every 6th month. Vaccination is continued for up to 2 years&#xD;
      after initiation of vaccination or until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREPARATION OF THE PEPTIDE VACCINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peptide vaccine will be prepared under GMP approved laboratory conditions (approved by&#xD;
      the Danish Medicines Agency), which assures the quality of a sterile medicinal product.&#xD;
      Production takes place in room JM702, Herlev Hospital under the approval number 24223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below is a brief description of the various procedures. The final vaccine product will hold a&#xD;
      label providing information about the vaccine content and the project number given by the&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peptides&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccination will be targeted against four long peptide sequences from the proteins:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NY-ESO-1 (119-143, 25aa): PGVLLKEFTVSGNILTIRLTAADHR ; PRAME (423-447, 25aa):&#xD;
      LQSLLQHLIGLSNLTHVLYPVPLES ; MAGE-A3 (255-279, 25aa): YLEYRQVPGSDPACYEFLWGPRALV ; WT1&#xD;
      (231-259, 29aa): SQLECMTWNQMNLGATLKGVAAGSSSSVK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peptides will be synthesized to &gt;97% purity by an external provider, Pepscan Presto, The&#xD;
      Netherlands. Prior to use, it will be dissolved in DMSO, mixed, and sterile filtered through&#xD;
      a 0.22 micron filter. Endotoxin and bacterial cultivation tests will be carried out on the&#xD;
      preparations. Sterility tests before release of peptides for vaccination treatment is carried&#xD;
      out by hematological laboratory (location 54P4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant: Montanide ISA 51&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montanide ISA 51 is purchased from Seppic Inc., France, in sterile form. We will use 0.5 ml&#xD;
      of Montanide per vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine will be generated as a mix of the peptide-preparation and the adjuvant, on-side,&#xD;
      just prior to injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before use, the peptide mix is subjected to endotoxin tests and microbiological tests&#xD;
      executed by the Department of Microbiology, Herlev Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label Phase I study designed to evaluate the safety of combination therapy of&#xD;
      azacitidine and peptide-vaccination in patients with MDS or AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to enroll all participants within 24 months and evaluate the study 12 months&#xD;
      thereafter. Participants will continue with azacitidine until disease progression, and with&#xD;
      vaccination for up to 2 years, or until disease progression. Participants may stop treatment&#xD;
      at any time upon their own request, or will be withdrawn from treatment following disease&#xD;
      progression or severe toxicity during treatment. The inclusion period is expected to begin in&#xD;
      April 2016 and to be finalized in April 2018. Thereafter a follow-up period of maximum 2&#xD;
      years is following. Last participant last protocolled visit date will be at latest, April&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MDS and AML, who receive treatment with azacitidine, will be recruited through&#xD;
      the Department of Hematology at Herlev Hospital. Since all patients are followed in an&#xD;
      outpatient setting, for around six months prior to inclusion while receiving azacitidine&#xD;
      treatment, possible candidates can be identified early and properly informed before a consent&#xD;
      form needs to be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is voluntary and is preceded by written informed consent. Treatment will be&#xD;
      terminated in cases of unacceptable side effects, or upon patient's request at any time. If a&#xD;
      patient is not interested in participation in the trial, treatment will be given according to&#xD;
      the department's usual guidelines. The study is therefore considered ethically sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study follows the guidelines of the Helsinki Agreement and the responsible physician&#xD;
      obtains a permit from the Scientific Ethical Committee, the Danish Health and Medicines&#xD;
      Agency and the Danish Data Protection Agency to conduct the study.&#xD;
