  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of multiple oral doses of LEO 32731&#xD;
      on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of the cytochrome P450 3A substrate midazolam&#xD;
      in healthy male subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to tolerability issues related to the dose titration, unexpected withdrawals were observed&#xD;
    and it was unlikely for the trial to meet its objectives&#xD;
