      In Hong Kong, the demand of smoking cessation service of Youth was increasing in the past 10&#xD;
      years, the first youth-oriented smoking cessation hotline &quot;Youth Quitline&quot; was established in&#xD;
      2005. From August 2005 to July 2016, &quot;Youth Quitline&quot; has received over 9,267 telephone&#xD;
      inquiries and provided telephone smoking cessation counselling for 1,952 youth smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth smokers are recruited using the reactive and proactive strategies. The operation hours&#xD;
      of Quitline service are weekdays from 17:00 to 21:00 and on weekends from 14:00 to 20:00. A&#xD;
      questionnaire asking the smoking status, reason of smoking, dependency level, knowledge,&#xD;
      attitude and practice of smoking or quitting at baseline, the perceived barriers of the&#xD;
      smokers and the use of other tobacco products were designed to assess the status of&#xD;
      participants, brief counselling with the use of motivational intervention approach is&#xD;
      delivered during the phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone counseling at 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month and follow-up at&#xD;
      24-month are conducted with the participants to assess their smoking status (by&#xD;
      questionnaire) and reinforce intervention (encourage quitting and providing quitting tips).&#xD;
      Self-reported quitters who have quitted smoking for at least 7 days at 6-month are invited to&#xD;
      perform saliva cotinine test (using NicAlert strip) plus exhaled carbon monoxide text to&#xD;
      validate the smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative interview will be conducted to investigate the use of other tobacco products of&#xD;
      the Youth Quitline participants, and aimed to find out their smoking patterns and feelings of&#xD;
      using these products, and how these products might affect quitting or smoking, and how the&#xD;
      protest activates influence the smoking behaviors among the youth smokers.&#xD;
