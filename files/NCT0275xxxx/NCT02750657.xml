  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for better ways of understanding and treating pancreatic cancer. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to see how useful it is to look for changes and characteristics in&#xD;
      your genes (molecules that contain instructions for the development and functioning of the&#xD;
      cells) and the genes within the tumour. These characteristics may be useful in choosing&#xD;
      treatments for patients in the future. Changes (mutations) in genes have been shown to be an&#xD;
      important characteristic in cancers. Looking at differences in genes in patients with&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and comparing this information with response to&#xD;
      their initial chemotherapy treatment may help to learn which treatments may be better for&#xD;
      certain patients after initial treatment.&#xD;
