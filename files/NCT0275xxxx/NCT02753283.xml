    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if denosumab (Prolia®), an injection given&#xD;
      in the arm under the skin every 6 months, works to treat bone loss and prevent it from&#xD;
      worsening in older men and women (ages 65 and older) who have osteoporosis and reside in&#xD;
      long-term care (LTC) facilities.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goal is to improve health, well-being and quality of life in the frail&#xD;
      long-term care (LTC) elderly population by reducing fractures. The short term goal is to&#xD;
      demonstrate efficacy of the non-bisphosphonate denosumab to improve bone mineral density&#xD;
      (BMD), a necessary (but not sufficient) pre-condition of a large fracture reduction trial.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, calcium-vitamin D&#xD;
      controlled trial to test the efficacy and predictability of the antiresorptive RANK ligand&#xD;
      inhibitor, denosumab (60 mg), among a cohort of 212 institutionalized, under-served, frail&#xD;
      men and women ≥65 years old in LTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate efficacy of denosumab in improving/maintaining bone mineral density. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure conventional hip and spine bone mineral density (BMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: After 2 years, women and men on denosumab will have greater hip and spine&#xD;
      BMD increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zoledronic Acid Infusion Safety Treatment and Follow-up Extension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the trial was started, case reports suggested a potential increase in fracture risk&#xD;
      with disuse. A post hoc analysis that combined the pivotal denosumab trial and extension&#xD;
      trial data suggested there was an increase in multiple vertebral fractures when patients&#xD;
      discontinued therapy. Following discontinuation of denosumab/placebo, all patients will be&#xD;
      offered treatment with 1 dose of intravenous zoledronic acid 5 mg. For those consenting to&#xD;
      receive end of study treatment, the zoledronic acid will be given at month 27 for an&#xD;
      individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zoledronic Acid Safety Infusion Extension Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate maintenance of bone mineral density (BMD). Zoledronic acid will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously at 9 months post-denosumab (month 27) and assess BMD by DXA at&#xD;
      months 33 and 39 (6 months and 12 months after zoledronic acid infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Zoledronic acid will prevent BMD loss at the spine and hip following&#xD;
      denosumab discontinuation.&#xD;

             (3) Would be treated based on FRAX® and the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF)&#xD;
             treatment thresholds of a 10 year risk of ≥ 20% for a major fracture or ≥ 3% for hip&#xD;
             fracture suing femoral neck BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Institutionalized residents with subacute illnesses who are not expected to survive or&#xD;
             who will be discharged in &lt; 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-ambulatory residents (those who cannot stand and pivot with assistance in order to&#xD;
             transfer to the DXA table).&#xD;

             who have been on a bisphosphonate for &gt; 1year during the previous 2 years because some&#xD;
             bisphosphonates are long acting.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Those with vitamin D levels &lt; 25ng/mL will be treated with vitamin D 50,000 IU/wk for&#xD;
             8 weeks; they will be enrolled if the follow-up vitamin D level is 25 ng/mL or more&#xD;
             (if after 2 rounds of vitamin D repletion their vitamin D level is not at least 25&#xD;
             ng/mL, they will not be eligible to be randomized into the study).&#xD;
