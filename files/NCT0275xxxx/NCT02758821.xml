      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of C-reactive protein (CRP) Point-of-care (POC)&#xD;
      testing on health care worker prescribing behaviour in patients presenting to primary&#xD;
      healthcare centres with an acute fever or recent history of fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To assess the impact of CRP testing on clinical outcomes within the 14&#xD;
      days of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the correlation between CRP results and clinical outcomes on the day 5 of the&#xD;
      enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the impact of CRP testing on antibiotic consumption after first consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the attitudes of health centre staff towards the POC CRP test. To identify the&#xD;
      prevalence of key pathogens in febrile patients in these settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the ability of CRP to discriminate between viral and bacterial pathogens in a&#xD;
      subset of patients with a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, individually randomized-controlled, three-armed pragmatic trial&#xD;
      comparing CRP guided antibiotic prescription in febrile patients to the current standard&#xD;
      prescribing systems. The study will be implemented in low and middle-income countries in&#xD;
      tropical settings, including Myanmar and Thailand in the first instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As participation in the study itself may raise awareness amongst the health centre staff and&#xD;
      local community, current antibiotic prescribing rates will be assessed in an observational&#xD;
      run-in period before the intervention. Health workers will be asked to complete case record&#xD;
      forms (CRF) for patients presenting to their health centre with current or recent fever. This&#xD;
      aims to capture current antibiotic prescribing habits before the study is launched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention phase, patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria and who consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be randomised to one of the three arms, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: The health care provider will manage the patient using standard&#xD;
           guidelines. No CRP will be measured onsite&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group A: CRP will be measured by a study nurse and the result will be communicated to&#xD;
           the health care provider as &quot;High-CRP&quot; or &quot;Low-CRP&quot; using a low CRP cut-off of 20mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group B: CRP will be measured by a study nurse and the result will be communicated to&#xD;
           the health care provider as &quot;High-CRP&quot; or &quot;Low-CRP&quot; using the higher CRP cut-off, of&#xD;
           40mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the two intervention arms, the following guidance will be given to the health care&#xD;
      provider: if the CRP test is reported as 'high', antibiotic treatment is recommended,&#xD;
      following local guidelines, and if it is reported as 'low' antibiotics are not recommended.&#xD;
      In either case the information provided by the CRP test should be interpreted alongside their&#xD;
      clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second CRP will be sampled at day 5 of the follow-up (+/- 1 day) for all the patients,&#xD;
      using capillary blood from a finger prick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the NycoCard Reader II (Axis Shield, Norway or equivalent) to&#xD;
      measure CRP levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A venous blood sample and a nasopharyngeal swab will be taken in the control group at&#xD;
      enrolment and sent to a central laboratory in order to detect the presence of the following&#xD;
      key pathogens by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flavivirus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alphavirus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Influenza A &amp; B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rickettsia including typhus group and spotted fever group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leptospirosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCR 16s for the detection of any bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRP will also be retrospectively measured in these blood samples to validate its ability to&#xD;
      distinguish between viral and bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A urine sample will be collected to detect the presence of antimicrobials at day 0 and day 5.&#xD;
      This procedure will ascertain pre-study antibiotic intake, as well as the patient's&#xD;
      compliance to the health care worker's prescription or advice that antibiotics are not&#xD;
      required, during their participation in the study. The urine samples will be collected at the&#xD;
      sites, divided into aliquots and frozen to -80Â°c to be stored on site. Monthly shipments will&#xD;
      be made to the laboratory at Mahidol Oxford Tropical Research Medicine Unit in Thailand for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to follow-up every patient face to face on day 5 (+/-1 day), and either&#xD;
      by phone or face-to-face interviews 14 days (+/-2 days) after the initial visit.&#xD;
