    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single &amp; multiple dose escalation study to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SHR0534. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted with starting dose of 5 mg followed by dose escalation groups up to&#xD;
      100 mg. Healthy Chinese subjects will be randomized in each cohort to receive the study drug&#xD;
      or placebo.&#xD;
