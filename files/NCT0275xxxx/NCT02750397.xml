  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals who agree to accept and receive a solid organ transplant from&#xD;
      an HIV+ deceased donor will be followed to determine the safety and efficacy of this&#xD;
      practice. HIV+ individuals who receive a solid organ transplant from HIV-uninfected donors&#xD;
      will also be followed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study designed to evaluate safety and outcomes of solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation in HIV+ recipients of HIV+ deceased donors. This study will evaluate overall&#xD;
      survival and graft survival compared to transplantation with an HIV- organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the study will assess potential complications of organ transplant using HIV+&#xD;
      deceased donors - including but not limited to - HIV superinfection, incidence and severity&#xD;
      of graft rejection, recurrence of HIV-associated nephropathy, incidence of bacterial&#xD;
      infections, and opportunistic infections.&#xD;

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        All individuals with end-stage organ disease and HIV infection who meet standard clinical&#xD;
        criteria for transplantation and the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
        eligible for participation in the study.&#xD;
      </textblock>
    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant is able to understand and provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant meets standard listing criteria for transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented HIV infection (by any licensed ELISA and confirmation by Western Blot,&#xD;
             positive HIV ab IFA, or documented history of detectable HIV-1 RNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Opportunistic Complications: None or previous history of protocol allowed&#xD;
             opportunistic infections or neoplasms with appropriate acute and maintenance therapy&#xD;
             and no evidence of active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant CD4+ T-cell count is &gt;/= 200/μL prior to renal transplant or for liver&#xD;
             transplant is &gt;/= 100/μL within 16 weeks prior to transplant and no history of&#xD;
             opportunistic infection (OI); or ≥200 μL if history of OI is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL (by any FDA-approved assay performed in&#xD;
             CLIA-approved laboratory), in the 26 weeks prior to transplant. Non-consecutive viral&#xD;
             &quot;blips&quot; between 50-400 copies RNA/mL will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Antiretroviral therapy: To avoid drug interactions, ritonavir or cobicistat-containing&#xD;
             regimens are not recommended, unless in the opinion of the HIV/Transplant Infectious&#xD;
             Disease team there is no alternative regimen expected to control HIV replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participant is willing to use PCP, herpes virus and fungal prophylaxis as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant has concomitant conditions that, in the judgment of the investigators,&#xD;
             would preclude transplantation or immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Opportunistic Complication History: Any history of progressive multifocal&#xD;
             leukoencephalopathy (PML), chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis of &gt; 1 month duration,&#xD;
             or primary CNS lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant has a history of any neoplasm except for the following: resolved kaposi's&#xD;
             sarcoma, in situ anogenital carcinoma, adequatelytreated basal or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin, solid tumors (except primary CNS lymphoma) treated with&#xD;
             curative therapy and disease free for more than 5 years. History of renal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma requires disease free state for 2 years. History of leukemia and&#xD;
             disease-free duration will be per site policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding. Note: Participants who become pregnant&#xD;
             post-transplant will continue to be followed in the study and will be managed per&#xD;
             clinical practice. Women that become pregnant should not breastfeed.&#xD;
