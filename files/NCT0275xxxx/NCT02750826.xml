      This randomized phase III trial studies whether weight loss in overweight and obese women may&#xD;
      prevent breast cancer from coming back (recurrence). Previous studies have found that women&#xD;
      who are overweight or obese when their breast cancer is found (diagnosed) have a greater risk&#xD;
      of their breast cancer recurring, as compared to women who were thinner when their cancer was&#xD;
      diagnosed. This study aims to test whether overweight or obese women who take part in a&#xD;
      weight loss program after being diagnosed with breast cancer have a lower rate of cancer&#xD;
      recurrence as compared to women who do not take part in the weight loss program. This study&#xD;
      will help to show whether weight loss programs should be a part of breast cancer treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial of weight loss interventions in overweight and obese women&#xD;
      with early stage breast cancer consists of two arms, please see the arms section for more&#xD;
      information. Patients will be randomized 1:1 within stratification factors: menopausal status&#xD;
      (premenopausal vs. postmenopausal), hormone receptor status of the tumor (ER and/or PR&#xD;
      positive vs. ER and PR negative), and race/ethnicity (African American vs. Hispanic vs.&#xD;
      Other). The primary objective of this trial is to compare the effect of the telephone-based&#xD;
      intervention versus a health educational control on invasive disease-free survival (IDFS).&#xD;
      The total sample size is 3136 patients. Patient follow up for primary and secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will continue to a maximum of 10 years, as per the standard protocol for cooperative group&#xD;
      adjuvant trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To compare the effect of a supervised weight loss intervention plus health&#xD;
      education materials versus health education materials alone upon invasive disease free&#xD;
      survival (IDFS) in overweight (BMI 27-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥30kg/m2) women diagnosed&#xD;
      with HER-2 negative, stage II and III breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the relationship between changes in weight and IDFS, and to explore&#xD;
           interaction between the level of clinical benefit from weight loss and the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of a supervised weight loss intervention upon:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Distant disease free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Body composition (as measured by waist and hip circumference)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Insulin Resistance Syndrome associated conditions - diabetes, hospitalization for&#xD;
                CV disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the impact of a supervised weight loss intervention on IDFS within&#xD;
           subgroups of women with 1) hormone receptor positive breast cancer and 2) hormone&#xD;
           receptor negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the impact of a supervised weight loss intervention on IDFS within&#xD;
           subgroups of 1) premenopausal women and 2) post-menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are to be followed every 6 months for the first 3 years after study enrollment and&#xD;
      then annually until 10 years from registration. The intervention will last 2 years or until&#xD;
      disease recurrence/progression, new invasive primary cancer as defined in the protocol or&#xD;
      patient withdrawal.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive a standardized intervention focusing on healthy living as described in the Arm 1 (Health Education Program). In addition, patients will utilize a standardized, 2-year, telephone-based weight loss intervention. The intervention will include individual weight loss, caloric restriction, and physical activity goals for each participant. It will be administered through semi-structured phone calls delivered by trained coaches at the BWEL call center and supplemented through print and on-line materials. The intervention will utilize a toolbox approach that will allow for tailoring for the individual participant.</description>

      <textblock>
        1. Documentation of Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.1 Subjects must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer and&#xD;
             registration must occur within 14 months after the first histologic diagnosis of&#xD;
             invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A core biopsy interpreted as invasive cancer meets this criterion; if no core&#xD;
                  biopsy is performed, the date of first histologic diagnosis will be the date of&#xD;
                  first surgical procedure that identifies invasive cancer (biopsy, lumpectomy or&#xD;
                  mastectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neoadjuvant subjects should have no evidence of clinical T4 disease prior to&#xD;
                  chemotherapy and surgery; eligibility for neoadjuvant patients can be defined by&#xD;
                  either clinical stage prior to therapy or pathologic stage at surgery; if patient&#xD;
                  is eligible based on either, they are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral breast carcinoma is allowed provided diagnoses are synchronous - that&#xD;
                  is, within 3 months of one another - and at least one of the two breast&#xD;
                  carcinomas meet the eligibility criteria and neither Her-2 positive or&#xD;
                  inflammatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No evidence of metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.2 Her-2 negative, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In-situ hybridization (ISH) ratio of &lt; 2.0 (if performed)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of 0-2+ (if performed)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Deemed to not be a candidate for Her-2 directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.3 Eligible tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) Stages include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estrogen receptor (ER) and Progesterone receptor (PR) negative (defined as &lt;1%&#xD;
                  staining for ER and PR by IHC): T2 or T3 N0, T0-3N1-3. Note: Patients with T1,&#xD;
                  N1mi disease are NOT eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ER and/or PR positive (defined as ≥ 1% staining for ER and/or PR on IHC):&#xD;
                  T0-3N1-3 or T3N0. Note: Patients with T0N0, T1N0, T2N0 or T1N1mi and T2N1mi&#xD;
                  disease are NOT eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The eligibility of neo-adjuvant subjects can be assessed on the basis of clinical&#xD;
                  (c)TNM or pathologic (yp)TNM. The same eligible TNM combinations apply; patients&#xD;
                  may be eligible if they meet eligibility requirements at either time point, as&#xD;
                  long as they do not have T4 disease prior to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.4 No history of invasive breast cancer in 5 years prior to study registration other&#xD;
             than the current diagnosis (prior ductal breast carcinoma in situ [DCIS] at any time&#xD;
             is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.5 Patients must have had a bilateral mammogram within 12 months prior to&#xD;
             registration, unless the initial surgery was a total mastectomy, in which case only a&#xD;
             mammogram of the remaining breast is required. (Subjects with bilateral total&#xD;
             mastectomies do not require imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.6 Investigations, including chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) chest, bone scan&#xD;
             (with radiographs of suspicious areas) and abdominal ultrasound or liver scan or CT&#xD;
             abdomen have been performed between the first histologic diagnosis and the time of&#xD;
             registration as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chest X-Ray, 2 view (or Chest CT, or positron emission tomography [PET]/CT) is&#xD;
                  mandatory&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone scans (with x-rays of abnormal areas) are required only if alanine&#xD;
                  aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alkaline Phosphatase&#xD;
                  is elevated or if there are signs or symptoms of metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abdominal imaging is required only if ALT, AST or Alkaline Phosphatase is&#xD;
                  elevated or if there are signs or symptoms of metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             2.1 All adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery completed at&#xD;
             least 21 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2.2 All triple negative patients must receive chemotherapy of the treating physician's&#xD;
             choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2.3 ER/PR+ patients must receive chemotherapy (of the treating physician's choice)&#xD;
             unless Oncotype Dx or another genomic predictor score indicates that they are at low&#xD;
             or intermediate risk of disease recurrence with endocrine therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2.4 Patients may have breast reconstruction during protocol participation, but&#xD;
             definitive breast cancer surgery must be completed at least 21 days prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Concomitant biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, and bisphosphonates are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2.5 Surgical margins must be clear of invasive carcinoma. If there is microscopic&#xD;
             residual ductal in situ disease present at lumpectomy or total mastectomy margins,&#xD;
             further excision is highly recommended. If further excision is not undertaken, the&#xD;
             subject may still be entered on study, provided that in addition to breast or chest&#xD;
             wall irradiation, a boost to the tumor bed is delivered. In situ lobular disease at&#xD;
             the margin is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2.6 All subjects (both adjuvant and neoadjuvant) must have sentinel lymph node biopsy&#xD;
             and/or axillary lymph node dissection. Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone is allowed in&#xD;
             the following instances:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sentinel lymph node biopsy is negative: pN0&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sentinel lymph node biopsy is positive for isolated tumor cells only:&#xD;
&#xD;
             pN0 (i+)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically node negative, T1-2 tumors with sentinel lymph node biopsy positive in&#xD;
                  &lt; 2 lymph nodes without matted nodes and undergoing breast conserving surgery and&#xD;
                  tangential whole breast irradiation, or undergoing mastectomy and chest wall&#xD;
                  irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients who had a positive node prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, sentinel&#xD;
                  node alone is allowed after neoadjuvant therapy if:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Sentinel node biopsy is negative after chemotherapy and either at least 2&#xD;
                       sentinel nodes were removed or a clip was placed in the involved node prior&#xD;
                       to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  =&lt; 2 lymph nodes are positive for cancer and the patient is participating in&#xD;
                       A011202&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All women who undergo breast conserving therapy must receive concomitant&#xD;
                  radiotherapy. Radiation after mastectomy is to be administered according to&#xD;
                  prespecified institutional guidelines. Radiation must be completed at least 21&#xD;
                  days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer as defined above must&#xD;
                  receive at least 5 years of adjuvant hormonal therapy in the form of tamoxifen or&#xD;
                  an aromatase inhibitor, alone or in combination with ovarian suppression. (NOTE:&#xD;
                  for patients with ER and PR staining in less than 5% of cells, hormonal therapy&#xD;
                  for at least 5 years is strongly recommended but not required). Hormonal therapy&#xD;
                  can be initiated prior to or during protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must be women&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Comorbid Conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
             6.1 No history of other malignancy within the past 4 years, except for malignancies&#xD;
             with a &gt;95% likelihood of cure (e.g. non-melanoma skin cancer, papillary thyroid&#xD;
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer). Patients cannot have metastatic breast or other&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6.2 No diabetes mellitus currently treated with insulin or sulfonylureas.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6.3 No history of serious digestive and/or absorptive problems, including inflammatory&#xD;
             bowel disease and chronic diarrhea that preclude adherence to the study diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6.4 No history of severe cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or&#xD;
             joint problems that preclude moderate physical activity. Examples would include&#xD;
             unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, oxygen-dependent pulmonary disease, and&#xD;
             osteoarthritis requiring imminent joint replacement. Moderate arthritis that does not&#xD;
             preclude physical activity is not a reason for ineligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6.5 No prior bariatric surgery or planning to undergo this procedure within the next 2&#xD;
             years after study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6.6 No comorbid conditions that would cause life expectancy of less than 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6.7 No history of psychiatric disorders that would preclude participation in the study&#xD;
             intervention (e.g. untreated major depression or psychosis, substance abuse, severe&#xD;
