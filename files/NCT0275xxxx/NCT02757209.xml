      This is a randomized, multi-center, active-controlled, repeated measures design study in male&#xD;
      and female patients 60 years of age and older with persistent asthma or COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be conducted in 4 Italian University/Hospital Centers: Ferrara, Parma, Cassano&#xD;
      delle Murge (Ba), Tradate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy parameter of the study is inhaler device usability (expressed as total&#xD;
      number of repeated attempts required to achieve optimal use).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are common conditions with an&#xD;
      increasing prevalence worldwide. Inhaled therapy for these conditions has a number of&#xD;
      advantages over systemic therapy, including reduced side effects and quicker onset of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, poor asthma control is common, despite available effective treatment .This is&#xD;
      partially related to low adherence and to difficulties in using inhaler devices. Among&#xD;
      patients with chronic respiratory disorders, 18% discontinued the prescribed inhaler&#xD;
      treatment because of troubles with the device (Santus 2012). Some devices are not easy to&#xD;
      handle, or require breathing abilities, which reduce the effectiveness in real life,&#xD;
      especially in elderly.Since mistakes in inhaler technique are very common affecting drug&#xD;
      delivery and efficacy, a correct inhaler technique training is fundamental. A single site&#xD;
      study in 2012 (Press 2012) found that patients given verbal and written instructions followed&#xD;
      by demonstrations of inhaler use had better inhaler technique than patients given verbal and&#xD;
      written instructions only. The authors concluded that larger multi-centred studies were&#xD;
      needed to evaluate hospital-based-education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposals to improve inhalers use are based on three key points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the choice of the best device paying attention to patient needs and abilities&#xD;
           (personalized therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a complete explanation of the correct use (patient training)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a regular re-check to evaluate the maintenance of a correct technique (monitoring)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cross over phase: 3 periods of 1 week each. During the training visit at the beginning&#xD;
           of each week period, patients will be instructed on the correct use of one of the 3&#xD;
           devices. Correct use and maintenance of correct use after 1 week will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A longitudinal phase: patient will be treated with the last inhaler device used during&#xD;
           the cross over phase for 8 additional weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum time from screening to end of study visit is12 weeks, with a follow up taking&#xD;
      place 30 days after the final visit .&#xD;

             study investigational drug study within the 30 days (starting at the final follow-up&#xD;
