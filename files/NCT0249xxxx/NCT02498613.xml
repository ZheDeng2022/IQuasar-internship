      This phase II trial studies cediranib maleate in combination with olaparib in treating&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors that have spread to other parts of the body (advanced/metastatic)&#xD;
      or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), including breast cancer, non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Cediranib maleate and olaparib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Cediranib maleate may also block the flow of oxygen to the tumor, and may help make the tumor&#xD;
      more sensitive to olaparib.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of cediranib (cediranib maleate) plus&#xD;
      olaparib in combination in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors of the following&#xD;
      tumor types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),&#xD;
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of oral administration of cediranib in combination&#xD;
      with olaparib in patients with select advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) in each tumor cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the prevalence of the mutations of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes in&#xD;
      tumors using the BROCA panel and to correlate tumor regression with mutations status.&#xD;
      (Integrated) II. To evaluate changes in tumor hypoxia on cediranib treatment compared to&#xD;
      baseline by [F-18] fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) positron emission tomography/computed&#xD;
      tomography (PET/CT) in patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate levels of angiogenesis/inflammatory markers including VEGF at baseline and&#xD;
      on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate levels of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) at baseline and on&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on day 1. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      FMISO scan also receive olaparib PO twice daily (BID) beginning the day after the second&#xD;
      FMISO scan and the rest of the patients receive olaparib PO BID beginning day 4 of cycle 1.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days (35 days for cycle 1) in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 4&#xD;
      weeks thereafter.&#xD;

             registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease or abdominal aortic aneurysm (&gt; 5&#xD;
             cm) or aortic dissection; if known history of abdominal aortic aneurysm with &gt;= 4 cm&#xD;
             in diameter, all of the following must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An ultrasound (US) within the last 6 months prior to registration will be&#xD;
                  required to document that it is =&lt; 5 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient must be asymptomatic from the aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Blood pressure must be well controlled as defined in this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28&#xD;
             days prior to starting cediranib (percutaneous/endobronchial biopsies are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bowel obstruction within 1 month prior to starting study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hemoptysis or any significant bleeding within the last 1 month prior to&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of cavitation of central pulmonary lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of abdominal fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, or gastrointestinal perforation&#xD;
             within the 3 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have current dependency on intravenous (IV) hydration or total&#xD;
             parenteral nutrition (TPN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have evidence of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis; therapeutic&#xD;
             anticoagulation for prior thromboembolic events is permitted; the clinical indication&#xD;
             for therapeutic anticoagulation must be clearly documented prior to enrollment and&#xD;
             must be discussed with the P.I.; given the increases risk of serious bleeding from&#xD;
             cediranib, patients who are on greater than or equal to 2 anti-thrombotic agents,&#xD;
             including but not limited to anti-platelet agents (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
             drugs [NSAIDs]/aspirin, clopidogrel), heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),&#xD;
             warfarin, and a direct thrombin inhibitor, will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute&#xD;
             myelogenous leukemia (AML) on peripheral blood smear or bone marrow biopsy, if&#xD;
             clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib and cediranib have the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; due to the fact that there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with olaparib and cediranib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with cediranib and olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             cediranib or olaparib; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated; HIV-positive patients with&#xD;
             undetectable viral loads and CD4 counts &gt; 300, and not on any antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             may be allowed after discussing with the principle investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the treating investigator would interfere with&#xD;
             evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study&#xD;
             results&#xD;
