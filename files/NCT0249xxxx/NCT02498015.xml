  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 people with chronic HCV and recent injection drug use or recipients of opioid&#xD;
      substitution therapy will be enrolled in 5 countries and 21 study sites. Participants with&#xD;
      genotype 1a infection or cirrhosis will receive 12 weeks of open-label&#xD;
      paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir and dasabuvir (&quot;3D&quot;), and twice-daily ribavirin.&#xD;
      Participants with genotype 1b infection without cirrhosis will receive 12 weeks of open-label&#xD;
      &quot;3D&quot;. The study consists of a screening phase (6 weeks), treatment phase (12 weeks) and&#xD;
      follow-up phase (96 weeks) to evaluate treatment response and reinfection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 people with recent injection drug use or recipients of opioid substitution&#xD;
      therapy will be enrolled from drug and alcohol clinics, tertiary liver and infectious&#xD;
      diseases clinics and community health centres across Canada, Europe, New Zealand, France, and&#xD;
      Australia. This will include at least 30 participants with F3/F4 liver disease. Participants&#xD;
      will be considered recent injection drug users if they have used injection drugs in the 6&#xD;
      months prior to consent. Participants receiving stable opioid substitution therapy (stable&#xD;
      dose for &gt;2 weeks) will also be included. Patients with frequent drug use that is judged by&#xD;
      the treating physician to compromise treatment safety will be excluded. The study drugs&#xD;
      consisting of two tablets of the co-formulated paritepravir/ritonavir/ombitasvir (75/50/12.5&#xD;
      mg) once daily, one dasabuvir tablet (250 mg) twice daily, ribavirin (1000 mg) daily in two&#xD;
      divided doses (genotype 1a only and/or cirrhosis). Electronic blister packs will be used to&#xD;
      improve and monitor treatment adherence. This innovative strategy with the &quot;3D&quot;&#xD;
      interferon-free regimen could considerably enhance the capacity to scale-up HCV treatment&#xD;
      among PWID, and is therefore being evaluated in this phase IV study within a well-defined&#xD;
      PWID population.&#xD;
