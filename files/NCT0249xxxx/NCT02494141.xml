      The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of curcumin for improving the health&#xD;
      and function of arteries in children and young adults with autosomal dominant polycystic&#xD;
      kidney disease (ADPKD). The study also will provide insight into how curcumin improves artery&#xD;
      health by determining the physiological mechanisms (biological reasons) involved and offer&#xD;
      exploratory evidence if curcumin can slow kidney growth. This will be done by comparing these&#xD;
      measurements in children and young adults who are randomized to receive either curcumin or&#xD;
      placebo for 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although often considered to be a disease of adults, complications of autosomal dominant&#xD;
      polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) begin in childhood. While ADPKD causes the continued growth&#xD;
      of multiple kidney cysts that ultimately result in loss of kidney function, the leading cause&#xD;
      of death among patients with ADPKD is cardiovascular disease. Treatment options to prevent&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in adults with ADPKD are limited, thus childhood may be an important&#xD;
      time to reduce risk. Curcumin is a safe, naturally occurring substance found in the Indian&#xD;
      spice tumeric, which is in curry powder. The proposed research will determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of curcumin for improving the health and function of arteries in children and&#xD;
      young adults with ADPKD. The study also will provide insight into how curcumin improves&#xD;
      artery health by determining the physiological mechanisms (biological reasons) involved and&#xD;
      offer exploratory evidence if curcumin can slow kidney growth. This will be done by comparing&#xD;
      these measurements in children and young adults who are randomized to receive either curcumin&#xD;
      or placebo for 1 year.&#xD;
