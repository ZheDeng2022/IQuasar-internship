  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I study is to test the safety of different dose levels of specially&#xD;
      prepared cells collected called &quot;modified T cells&quot;. In the screening part of this study the&#xD;
      tumor was found to have a protein called MUC16. This protein is present on about 70% of&#xD;
      ovarian cancers. The investigators want to find a safe dose of modified T cells for patients&#xD;
      with this type of cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. We also want to&#xD;
      find out what effects these modified T cells have on the patient and their cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 phases to the study: the Screening Phase and the Intervention Phase. Only&#xD;
      patients identified as eligible from the Screening Phase may enroll in the Intervention&#xD;
      Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase: After signing Informed Consent 1 (Screening Informed Consent), the patient's&#xD;
      MUC16ecto tumor expression will be determined as previously described. In order to be&#xD;
      eligible for this protocol, the patient's ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube&#xD;
      carcinoma must express the MUC16ecto protein detectable by IHC analysis of banked (paraffin&#xD;
      embedded) or fresh biopsied tumor. After signing Informed Consent 1, approximately 2 weeks&#xD;
      will elapse while the patient's banked tumor is tested for MUC16ecto expression. If a&#xD;
      patient's tumor is found to express MUC16ecto, she will undergo leukapheresis for the&#xD;
      collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which will be frozen for future use.&#xD;
      The leukapheresis product will be stored until the end of the study in case future research&#xD;
      tests related to this study are developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Phase: Patients must sign Informed Consent 2 (Intervention Informed Consent)&#xD;
      before receiving treatment on the study before receiving treatment on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is eligible to receive the CAR+ T cells, the frozen leukapheresis product&#xD;
      will be thawed and used to generate the 4H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ genetically-modified T cells.&#xD;
      It is expected to take approximately 4-6 weeks to prepare the autologous CAR+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1-3 patients in cohorts V will receive conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      750 mg/m^2 or 300 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide concurrent with 25-30 mg/m2 fludarabine 2-7 days&#xD;
      prior to the initial infusion of autologous CAR+T cells. Patients will receive autologous&#xD;
      CAR+T cells in 2 infusions, the first IV and the second IP, each comprising about half the&#xD;
      total dose. The IV infusion will be given first. The patient will then be closely monitored.&#xD;
      One to 3 days later if clinically stable, the patient will receive the remaining dose of&#xD;
      CAR+T cells IP. Patients in cohort I or -I will not receive cyclophosphamide, but will&#xD;
      receive the T cells in the same manner (approximately half IV, followed by close monitoring&#xD;
      and then 1-3 days later, if the patient is clinically stable, the remaining cells will be&#xD;
      administered IP).&#xD;

The first subject will be treated at dose level 1 (3 x 10^5 4H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ T cells/kg). At least one week will elapse from the first patient's T cell infusions before the second patient is treated (on dose level 1) to allow for toxicity and safely assessment. 3 subjects will be enrolled in cohort I and followed for 30 days for safety assessments. If no DLT is observed after all three subjects have been observed for 30 days, a second cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level (3 x 10^54H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ T cells/kg) with the addition of cyclophosphamide plus or minus fludarabine.</description>

    <description>Cohorts of 3-6 pts will be infused with escalating doses of modified T cells to establish the MTD of modified T cells. There are 5 planned dose levels: 3 x 10^5, 1 x 10^6, 3 x 10^6, &amp; 1 x 10^7 &amp; 3 x 10^7 4H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ T cells/kg. Cohort I-IV &amp; VI will be treated escalating dose levels. Once the MTD of T cells is established, the next cohort will receive lymphodepleting cyclophosphamide dose of 750 mg/m^2 or a regimen of cyclophosphamide dose 300 mg/m2 x 3 days concurrent with fludarabine dose 25-30 mg/m2 x 3 days 2-7 days prior to starting the T cell infusion at one dose level below the MTD. If MTD isn't established after Cohort IV, Cohort V will receive conditioning chemotherapy 2-7 days prior to starting the T cell infusion at the same dose as Cohort III. Pts in Cohort V received cyclophosphamide chemotherapy on Day 1 or cyclophosphamide concurrent with fludarabine on Day 1-3, followed 2 to 4 days later by T cell infusion. This cohort is closed to further accrual.</description>
