  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II open label clinical trial in patients with metastatic castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer. The objective of the phase Ib portion of the study is to establish&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV&#xD;
      q21 days) and prednisone (5mg orally BID) in combination with ribociclib in escalating oral&#xD;
      daily doses in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with prior&#xD;
      resistance to abiraterone and/or enzalutamide who have not undergone prior chemotherapy for&#xD;
      metastatic disease. Up to three cohorts will be enrolled to determine the MTD and DLT profile&#xD;
      of this combination during Phase 1b. Dose escalation will follow the standard 3+3 design. The&#xD;
      dosing schedule is being chosen to allow patients to be exposed to the most efficacious&#xD;
      dosing schedule of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). If there is excess toxicity observed&#xD;
      with the treatment combination at the first dose level (dose level I), an alternative dosing&#xD;
      schema may be pursued with weekly docetaxel treatment (35 mg/m2 weekly), which has&#xD;
      demonstrated activity in mCRPC and decreased risk of cytopenias compared with every 3 week&#xD;
      dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II portion (N = 29) of the study is a single arm, two stage, open-label study of&#xD;
      ribociclib (dosed at the RP2D) in combination with docetaxel and prednisone to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and further define the safety of the treatment combination. Patients will be treated&#xD;
      with the combination of ribociclib plus docetaxel + prednisone for up to 9 cycles. If there&#xD;
      is no evidence of radiographic or clinical disease progression after 9 cycles of protocol&#xD;
      therapy, patients may continue on single agent maintenance ribociclib until the time of&#xD;
      disease progression. Patients will have the option of starting maintenance ribociclib after 6&#xD;
      cycles of docetaxel if stable disease or better on re-staging scans. The dose of ribociclib&#xD;
      used during maintenance will be the same dose as that immediately preceding cessation of&#xD;
      docetaxel treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile, maximally tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose of ribociclib in combination with docetaxel plus prednisone in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). (Phase IB) II. To determine the 6-month&#xD;
      radiographic progression-free survival rate with the combination of ribociclib, docetaxel,&#xD;
      and prednisone in patients with mCRPC. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the median radiographic progression-free survival with the combination of&#xD;
      ribociclib, docetaxel, and prednisone in patients with mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the objective response rate and median duration of response among patients&#xD;
      with measurable disease at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response proportion and time to PSA&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the safety profile of ribociclib in combination with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine if there is evidence of drug-drug interaction between docetaxel + prednisone&#xD;
      with ribociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether baseline or percent change from baseline in gallium citrate uptake on&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) scan is associated with clinical outcomes. (For University&#xD;
      of California San Francisco (USCF) Patients Only) II. To determine whether genomic assessment&#xD;
      of MYC pathway activation (MYC amplification or overexpression, Rb1 deletion, cyclin D/E and&#xD;
      CDK 4/6 overexpression) assessed within metastatic tumor tissue, circulating tumor cells&#xD;
      (CTCs), and/or cell-free circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) is predictive of&#xD;
      clinical outcomes with the combination of ribociclib plus docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether MYC activation score as determined by validated expression&#xD;
      signature can distinguish those with and without clinical benefit with ribociclib in&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To use an unbiased approach with integration of clinical, genomic, and proteomic data&#xD;
      (differential pathway signature correlation; DiPSC) to define a signature associated with&#xD;
      response to taxane + CDK4/6 inhibition in mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of ribociclib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 or on days 1 and 8,&#xD;
      prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, and ribociclib PO once daily (QD) on&#xD;
      days 1-4, and 8-15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 9 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease or better on&#xD;
      re-staging scans after 6 cycles and patients without radiographic or clinical disease&#xD;
      progression after 9 cycles of treatment may continue on single agent maintenance ribociclib&#xD;
      PO QD on days 1-14 of every 21 day cycle in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every three months.&#xD;
