  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      INPH is a chronic, progressive disease characterised by enlarged ventricles in the absence of&#xD;
      elevated intracranial pressure. Patients often present with the Hakim triad comprising gait&#xD;
      disturbance, dementia and urinary incontinence. Treatment consists of ventriculoperitoneal&#xD;
      (VP) shunting reducing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume in the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS); a generally safe and well tolerated procedure nevertheless invasive in nature and&#xD;
      associated with surgical risk. The currently used diagnostic algorithms to predict surgery&#xD;
      outcome by testing patients before and after a diagnostic spinal tap temporarily reducing the&#xD;
      CSF volume in the CNS are of wide variability and limited validity. Developing measures to&#xD;
      accurately diagnose and select patients for intervention is thus of great importance. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to define and validate a diagnostic algorithm for the selection of&#xD;
      patients with symptoms compatible with iNPH for shunt surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is an important differential diagnosis of&#xD;
      dementia in the elderly patients. It is characterised by an enlargement of the ventricular&#xD;
      system and can lead to cognitive deficits, gait disturbance and incontinence. Treatment&#xD;
      consists of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. A major challenge is the identification of patients&#xD;
      who suffer from iNPH and who will benefit from shunt surgery. Typically, cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) is withdrawn by a spinal tap, and walking speed and steps per distance are measured&#xD;
      before and thereafter. In patients who benefit from the test tap the diagnosis iNPH is made&#xD;
      and the indication for shunt surgery is ascertained. The diagnostic procedure is not&#xD;
      standardised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the examinations and time-points suited best to predict surgery&#xD;
      outcome. Thus, patients may undergo surgery who do not benefit, and patients who would&#xD;
      benefit may be missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at defining a diagnostic algorithm to improve the prediction of surgery&#xD;
      outcome in patients supposed to suffer from iNPH. In 25 serial patients, motor function will&#xD;
      be analysed in detail by functional tests and a treadmill-based analysis before and after the&#xD;
      test tap at different time-points. In addition, neuropsychological tests and MRI&#xD;
      investigations (DWI and pw) will be done, and patients will fill-out a micturition diary.&#xD;
      Patients who do not respond to the test tap will be offered a lumbar drainage for continuous&#xD;
      CSF release as diagnostic escalation with repeated tests thereafter. Patients who finally&#xD;
      undergo shunt surgery will be re-assessed to identify those who responded to surgery.&#xD;
      Thereby, post-hoc analyses will identify those parameter(s) that had the best predictive&#xD;
      value for surgery outcome. To confirm the parameters derived from such exploratory analyses,&#xD;
      these parameters will be validated in another series of 25 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study have the potential to improve the clinical routine and to provide a&#xD;
      strategic advantage for the University Hospital Zurich.&#xD;
