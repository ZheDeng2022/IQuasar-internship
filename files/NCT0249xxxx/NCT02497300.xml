  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial dysfunction increases cardiovascular (CV) risk and contributes to the&#xD;
      progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists have&#xD;
      been shown to improve endothelial function, as well as decrease CV mortality and proteinuria.&#xD;
      The specific biochemical pathways that produce these pharmacological effects for MR&#xD;
      antagonists, however, are poorly understood. This study investigates the effect of MR&#xD;
      antagonism on endothelial function in patients with moderate (stage III) CKD using a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To determine if&#xD;
      spironolactone improves endothelial function as compared to amiloride in patients with stage&#xD;
      III CKD; Aim 2: To determine if oxidative stress is associated with changes in endothelial&#xD;
      function by spironolactone compared to amiloride in patients with stage III CKD; and Aim 3:&#xD;
      To determine if endothelial dysfunction contributes to albuminuria in patients with stage III&#xD;
      CKD. The clinical relevance is to improve understanding of the mechanisms of kidney function&#xD;
      decline in CKD in order to develop interventions to delay or prevent dialysis, which would&#xD;
      translate into alleviating patient suffering, caregiver burden, and health care costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants with proteinuric, stage III CKD will be randomly assigned in a&#xD;
      double-masked fashion to spironolactone 25mg daily or amiloride 5 mg daily for 6 weeks and&#xD;
      then crossed over to the alternate study medication after a 1 month wash-out period. Vascular&#xD;
      function will be assessed at baseline and the end of each 6 week treatment period by: 1)&#xD;
      ultrasound guided flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, 2) impedence&#xD;
      cardiography, 3) pulse-wave velocity, 4) 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and 5)&#xD;
      serum and urine biomarkers. Participants will undergo a total of 7 visits over 16-18 weeks; 3&#xD;
      of the 7 visits will involve vascular function testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study visit where vascular function testing is to be performed will begin at 0800 in the&#xD;
      morning and start with a vital sign assessment including height, weight, body fat percent,&#xD;
      and left arm automated BP measurement followed by confirmation of fasting status and a brief&#xD;
      past medical history. Each participant will then lie supine for 10 minutes in preparation for&#xD;
      vascular function testing. Following the pulse wave velocity, impedence cardiography, and FMD&#xD;
      measurements, the participant will have his/her blood and urine collected for laboratory&#xD;
      testing. Laboratory testing will include ~20 mL of blood for plasma and serum testing.&#xD;
      Participants will return 24 hour urine samples and have a 24 hour ambulatory monitor placed.&#xD;
      This entire visit is expected to take 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits where vascular function testing will not be performed (e.g., screening visit,&#xD;
      visit 2, visit 4, and visit 5; should last 30 minutes and involve a medication assessment,&#xD;
      vital sign check, and blood collection for serum potassium (~4 mL of blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study medication will be prepared by the the University of Alabama (UAB) Research&#xD;
      Pharmacy in matching capsules and placed in pill bottles labeled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. The order of&#xD;
      medication dispensing will follow simple randomization using an a priori randomization list&#xD;
      prepared by the research pharmacy. All study personnel with participant interaction are&#xD;
      masked to the order of study medication.&#xD;
