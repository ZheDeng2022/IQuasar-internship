  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted in Hypophosphatasia, a bone disorder caused by gene&#xD;
      mutation(s) resulting in bone defects. These gene mutations cause low levels of an enzyme&#xD;
      needed to harden bone. The purpose of this study is to provide access to treatment in a&#xD;
      disease where no approved treatment exists. This is an experimental treatment provided under&#xD;
      specific treatment guidelines in which safety endpoints will be collected.&#xD;

    <description>Patients participating in this program will receive 6 mg/kg/week asfotase alfa (administered at a dosage regimen of 1 mg/kg 6 times per week or 2 mg/kg 3 times per week at the discretion of the Investigator) by SC injection. During follow-up visits, dose adjustments to account for changes in body weight will be made. Additional incremental dose adjustments for lack of efficacy or safety reasons may also be decided upon by the Investigator in consultation with the Alexion Medical Monitor.</description>
