    <textblock>
      This study targets patients with cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy and will allow us&#xD;
      to: a) study peripheral neuropathy in diverse human sensory neurons in ways that were not&#xD;
      possible previously; b) gain insight on druggable targets to treat or prevent this&#xD;
      devastating side effect of chemotherapy; c) provide a human cellular model that can be used&#xD;
      for screening of drugs to determine if they are neurotoxic. The combination of patient&#xD;
      information and in vitro measurements provides a highly relevant and clinically useful model&#xD;
      for studies aimed to impact treatment selection for the individual cancer patient.&#xD;

      Primary Objective-To establish a biobank of specimens that allows for the future creation of&#xD;
      iPS cells with the potential to make human neurons for functional studies of specific&#xD;
      genes/genetic variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives-To develop a clinically relevant in vitro model of cisplatin induced&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy to be used to 1) screen new drugs for the treatment or prevention of&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy; 2) evaluate candidate genes for their role in cisplatin induced&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures-Subjects who wish to participate will undergo the following study&#xD;
      procedures, which will be performed after the informed consent document is obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample Collection-A trained phlebotomist will conduct a blood draw for the collection of&#xD;
           SIX samples for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation and infectious&#xD;
           disease testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Self-Report of Toxicities-All patients in the study will be asked to fill out&#xD;
           the Patient-reported Toxicity Form. This will take approximately 10 minutes to complete&#xD;
           and consists of 20 questions related to patient symptoms describing toxicities&#xD;
           experienced secondary to receiving cisplatin chemotherapy. They will be asked to fill&#xD;
           out the form twice: (1) describing the peripheral neuropathy they currently are&#xD;
           experiencing and (2) describing the worst peripheral neuropathy toxicity they&#xD;
           experienced as a result of cisplatin therapy. These paper forms will be filled out at&#xD;
           time of enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physician Report of Toxicities-The patient's physician or the designatee will complete&#xD;
           an adverse event form at day of enrollment detailing the physician's assigned grade of&#xD;
           toxicities (according to CTCAE version 4.3) experienced from cisplatin. Other&#xD;
           information regarding the particularly severe neurotoxicity may also be collected from&#xD;
           physicians (e.g. patient use of walker or wheelchair, patient application for disability&#xD;
           based on neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. General Information- This information will be collected at the same time point as all of&#xD;
           the other study procedures (i.e., Day One). This will include but may not be limited to:&#xD;
           age, height, weight, patient-identified race and ethnicity, information about the&#xD;
           chemotherapy regimen, total cisplatin dose administered and date of last cisplatin dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cisplatin Dose-Total cumulative dose of cisplatin administered will be recorded. Outside&#xD;
           records will be obtained where needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Follow-up and Duration of Follow-Up-There will be no subsequent patient follow-up after&#xD;
           time of enrollment. Subjects may withdraw consent for specimen use by contacting the PI&#xD;
           in writing.&#xD;

      Whole blood samples will be obtained from all patients so that peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMCs) can be isolated and stored for the eventual creation of iPS cells. iPS cells&#xD;
      have the potential to make human neurons that the researchers would like to use for&#xD;
      functional studies of specific genes/genetic variants. All samples will also be tested for&#xD;
      infectious diseases (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV 1 and HIV 2).&#xD;

        This study will consist of two groups: testicular cancer patients with severe neuropathy&#xD;
        (experimental group) and testicular cancer patients without neuropathy (control group). One&#xD;
        control subject will be recruited for each experimental subject with severe neurotoxicity.&#xD;
        Controls will be matched based on age (within 10 years), tumor type, race, ethnicity, and&#xD;
        chemotherapy regimen and cumulative dose of cisplatin during which the toxicity occurred.&#xD;
