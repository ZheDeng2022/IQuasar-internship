  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal conditions treated by physical&#xD;
      therapists. One common treatment is passive glenohumeral joint accessory mobilization, which&#xD;
      is the application of a therapist generated force to move the humeral head (ball) on the&#xD;
      glenoid (socket) of the shoulder to improve motion and decrease pain. It is generally&#xD;
      accepted that these mobilizations do not elicit active muscular contractions of the&#xD;
      surrounding musculature. However, there is very little literature to support this assumption,&#xD;
      and a preliminary PubMed search utilizing the terms &quot;shoulder&quot;,&quot; mobilization&quot;, and &quot;EMG&quot;&#xD;
      returned zero relevant references. Therefore, the investigators plan to utilize surface&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG), a non-invasive assessment tool, to objectively measure the activity&#xD;
      of the rotator cuff muscles (the muscles that surround the shoulder and provide stability to&#xD;
      the joint) during various grades(levels of force and amplitude of movement) of glenohumeral&#xD;
      mobilization ( a standard of care treatment). It is also unknown if subjects pain levels&#xD;
      impact the level of rotator cuff activity. To investigate these questions, the investigators&#xD;
      will collect EMG data while performing mobilizations on a total of 20 subjects, divided into&#xD;
      two groups: 10 pain free shoulders and 10 painful shoulders. Data analysis will then include&#xD;
      descriptive analysis, estimates of effect size, and analysis for between group differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there will be significant differences in muscular activity&#xD;
      between groups related to the presence of shoulder pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following informed consent, all participants will be assessed in a private EMG lab setting.&#xD;
      After exposing the posterior shoulder girdle, the areas of the upper trapezius,&#xD;
      supraspinatus, and infraspinatus will be cleaned using a cloth alcohol prep pad, and the skin&#xD;
      at the area of electrode placement will be vigorously abraded for 5 seconds. A previously&#xD;
      calibrated (per Delsys system protocol) Delsys mini-wireless electrode will then be placed at&#xD;
      the appropriate location over each muscle as described by Criswell. These electrodes will be&#xD;
      securely taped in place using specialized tape as specified by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once electrode placement is complete, each participant will first undergo a standardizing&#xD;
      reference contraction of each muscle group. For the upper trapezius, this will consist of 1)&#xD;
      a 9 second shrug,2) 9 second elevation of the arm to 90 degrees in the empty can position,&#xD;
      and 3) a side lying external rotation of the shoulder to 90 degrees. The middle 3 seconds of&#xD;
      each trial will be used to record the average electrical activity of each muscle during&#xD;
      voluntary contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be placed supine on a standard plinth. The investigators will then&#xD;
      proceed to provide a mobilizing force to the subject's glenohumeral joints. Each of two&#xD;
      investigators will, in sequence perform a 15 second longitudinal distraction, followed by a&#xD;
      15 second posteriorly directed glenohumeral glide with the shoulder placed in the open pack&#xD;
      resting position (~50 degrees abduction, slight horizontal adduction, external rotation). The&#xD;
      middle 5 seconds will be captured for mean electrical activity at each of the three&#xD;
      previously identified muscles. Following completion of the mobilizations by the second&#xD;
      investigator, the electrodes will be removed, and the subject's participation will be&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will include basic subject demographics such as age, gender, and handedness.&#xD;
      Tests of between group difference will be analyzed for each mobilization and tester&#xD;
      condition. Data will be analyzed comparing mean EMG values during mobilization compared to&#xD;
      the active contraction using the reference voluntary contraction (RVC) method, as this has&#xD;
      been shown be a more accurate comparator for low levels of muscle activity.&#xD;
