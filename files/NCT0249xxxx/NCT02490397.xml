      The study tests if intense light could be a potential therapy in humans after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction by inducing Per2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Damage to the heart caused by a myocardial infarction (heart attack) occurs most often during&#xD;
      the early morning hours (6AM). Thus, the involvement of the circadian system (circa=&#xD;
      approximately day) has been suggested. The circadian system in humans or animals is based on&#xD;
      the rotation of the earth with day and night phases. When humans (or animals) wake up light&#xD;
      shines in their eyes and the body receives a signal that the day starts. For the human body&#xD;
      it means that certain proteins (named clock, period etc) are produced. The protein that&#xD;
      determines the length of a day (awake and sleep period) is called Period 2 (Per2). Recent&#xD;
      data indicated that the Per2 protein in hearts from mice is induced after daylight exposure&#xD;
      (daylight with an intensity comparable to a bright day at the beach was used, approx. 10 000&#xD;
      LUX). This more Per2 was able to protect the heart from being damaged by no blood going to&#xD;
      the heart (protection from a heart attack). This protection was based on a more efficient use&#xD;
      of sugars (carbohydrates). Thereby the heart needs less oxygen. Current data indicate that&#xD;
      human Per2 is also induced by light exposure and can be detected in human plasma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study Per2 transcript and protein levels will be analyzed in patients that just&#xD;
      experienced a heart attack with and without intense light (daylight) therapy utilizing blood&#xD;
      samples (erythrocytes and leukocytes).&#xD;

    <description>Patients with myocardial infarction (MI): This group will be enrolled on the day of their MI. A blood draw will be performed before any light therapy. The patients will then receive a light box (Square One Wake Up Light NatureBright 10,000 LUX) that they shall use every morning from 8.30-9.00 AM for the next 2 weeks. At the conclusion of the two weeks another blood sample will be drawn.</description>
