  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing incidence of sepsis and septic shock in people after surgery, for which&#xD;
      there may be several reasons: more elderly people and more severe illnesses are entering&#xD;
      operating theatres, more invasive systems are being used to take care of patients in&#xD;
      intensive care units, etc... Sepsis and septic shock are the most prevalent illnesses which&#xD;
      cause the highest mortality in intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of this illness is 500,000 / year in the USA, and 240-400 / 100,000 persons in&#xD;
      Europe. So this is a subject of great interest in hospitals and also to the National Health&#xD;
      System (to both health workers and the health authorities) as a lot of money is spent on this&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 19th century, ultraviolet rays have been known to be able to sterilize&#xD;
      microorganisms (to kill them); yet no ultraviolet system machine has been on the market,&#xD;
      until now, to control nosocomial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medixair system, which aims to do this, has recently come on to the market. It uses&#xD;
      C-ultraviolet rays, which are the strongest kind of ultraviolet rays to kill microorganisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it is of interest to know whether this system is good enough to lower infections in&#xD;
      intensive care units. It is logical to believe that the the fewer the micro-organisms, the&#xD;
      lower the possibilities of infection.&#xD;

      Study design Prospective, comparative, randomized, non intervention study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients older than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac Surgery anesthetized using Extracorporeal Circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 10 independent boxes at the Postoperative Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. (Each of&#xD;
      these boxes have single beds). Every year, the Cardiac Reanimation Unit of our hospital&#xD;
      received 500 patients, post heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After getting the permissions needed to make the research, the Medixair® system has been&#xD;
      placed in 5 of these units, and the comparison group will be the other 5 beds without&#xD;
      Medixair®. Patients have been assigned randomly to either (Medixair® and NO Medixair®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To compare the infection rates after a cardiac surgery, on patients located in boxes with&#xD;
      and without a Medixair® system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to see if there are fewer catheter infections, less bacteraemia, fewer urinary&#xD;
      infections, less site of surgery infections, and fewer pneumonias in patients who have spent&#xD;
      their first days after a heart surgery in a box with Medixair® system than without it. The&#xD;
      infection rates in the intensive care unit will be followed, as well as the whole stay at&#xD;
      hospital, as there might be fewer infections if there were fewer microorganisms around.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative risk factors to develop an&#xD;
           infection illness after cardiac surgery, as well as which increase the length of stay at&#xD;
           hospital and the mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Making an economic study of using this system against not using it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further aim is to measure the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dependent variables (Outcome variables): infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2º Outcome variables: colonization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent variables will be a risk factor for infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative: age, sex, any preoperative illness, immunosuppressor treatment, including&#xD;
           corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative: antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical technique, length of cardiopulmonary&#xD;
           bypass, length of aorta clamped, temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass, hematocrit&#xD;
           at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative: length with mechanical ventilation, time spent in hospital, time spent in&#xD;
           an intensive care unit, any organ complication (pulmonary insufficiency, renal failure,&#xD;
           low cardiac index), septicemia, invasive techniques used, positive microorganism&#xD;
           cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will be treated in the same way&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated number of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the infection rate after cardiac surgery is around 5%, so following the current&#xD;
      hypothesis that the Medixair® system, because of its ultraviolet emissions, is going to lower&#xD;
      the infection rate after cardiac surgery, 419 patients are needed in each group to be able to&#xD;
      demonstrate a significative 5% reduction in infection rates, with an alpha error of 0.05 and&#xD;
      a beta error of 0.2 to have a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a preliminary study, in order to demonstrate a 5% reduction in the infection rate,&#xD;
      half the number of patients (half of 419) will be used. As the patient volume is 500 a year,&#xD;
      the number will be rounded up to 500, in order to be able to consider a complete year.&#xD;
