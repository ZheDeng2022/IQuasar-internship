      The purpose of the protocol is to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on taste&#xD;
      receptors and taste perceptions and to precise the factors implicated in taste alterations in&#xD;
      50 obese patients before and 6 months after bariatric surgery (25 Roux Y gastric bypass and&#xD;
      25 sleeve gastrectomy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over-consumption high sugar and high fat foods was identified as a main risk factor for&#xD;
      obesity. The recent identification of lipid-receptor (CD36, GPR120) in human taste buds&#xD;
      suggests that lipids could be perceived not only by their texture and their olfactory&#xD;
      characteristics, but also by way of taste. Obese subjects tend to consume more high fat foods&#xD;
      than lean subjects. Conversely, bariatric surgery induces behavioral changes limiting the&#xD;
      consumption of foods high in sugar and fat. The mechanisms underlying these behavioral&#xD;
      changes are not understood. Does obesity is accompanied by a distortion of taste detection of&#xD;
      dietary lipids? What are the mechanisms involved? Are they reversible? What could be the&#xD;
      effect on food choices and health? This protocol is part of a broader research program that&#xD;
      aims to answer these questions by studying the feeding behavior in obese subjects and animals&#xD;
      before and after a bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the protocol is to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on the expression&#xD;
      of taste receptors and taste perceptions and in particular the threshold of perception of fat&#xD;
      (and sweet as taste as reference) and to study the association between the changes of taste&#xD;
      perceptions and food preferences, amount of weight loss, surgical technique (with or without&#xD;
      intestinal bypass), hormonal, metabolic and inflammatory changes, and modification of the&#xD;
      oral microbiota. The study will included 50 patients who underwent bariatric surgery, either&#xD;
      Roux Y gastric bypass (25 patients) or sleeve gastrectomy (25 patients) that will be explored&#xD;
      in the two months before and six months after surgery. These explorations will included a&#xD;
      clinical examination with collection of anthropometric data, a body fat determination by&#xD;
      impedance, a detailed dietary survey, blood samples for assessment of hormonal parameters&#xD;
      (GLP1 , PYY, ghrelin, insulin, leptin) and inflammatory parameters (LPS, TNFalpha, IL-1,&#xD;
      IL-6, ...), a tong micro-biopsy to collect taste buds and a sample of oral microbiota and&#xD;
      lipids and sugars thresholds determination (linoleic acid or sucrose).&#xD;
