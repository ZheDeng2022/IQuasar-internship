  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is impaired venous return which results in lower limbs&#xD;
      symptoms that include pain, swelling and dermatologic changes. CVI is a condition that&#xD;
      affects both males and females, but is more prevalent in females due to the effect of&#xD;
      progesterone on vascular tissue resulting in the dilation of veins. The predisposing factors&#xD;
      for CVI include: female gender, long periods of standing, decreased physical activity,&#xD;
      obesity, poor nutrition, metabolic syndrome, tight and restrictive clothing as well as&#xD;
      advanced age, constipation, pregnancy and ascites. Conventional treatment may involve&#xD;
      surgery, compression stockings, laser therapy, sclerotherapy and venoactive drugs, which are&#xD;
      aimed at improving the appearance of varicose veins and decreasing pain and swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Red Vine, Butcher's Broom, Horse Chestnut and Vitamin B6 is an over-the&#xD;
      counter herbal preparation, which is used to treat the symptoms associated with CVI. Studies&#xD;
      done on each of the preparation's individual constituents demonstrate their efficacy in&#xD;
      improving blood circulation, thereby alleviating symptoms associated with venous stasis. The&#xD;
      individual extracts improve venous tone and blood circulation, however there are no studies&#xD;
      on the combined effect of these individual ingredients and their efficacy on the quality of&#xD;
      life of females affected by CVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of a combination of Red Vine Leaf extract,&#xD;
      Butcher's Broom, Horse Chestnut and Vitamin B6 on the quality of life in female participants&#xD;
      with CVI, using the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of forty female participants, aged&#xD;
      thirty to fifty-five years, conducted over a period of ninety days.The research sample will&#xD;
      be shared by another Homoeopathy Master's student Fayrooz Karriem who is researching &quot;The&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination of Red Vine extract, Butcher's Broom, Horse Chestnut and Vitamin&#xD;
      B6 in the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency associated symptoms. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited by means of advertisements at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) Health Clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research sample will be randomly divided into two groups (X and Y), in matched pairs&#xD;
      according to age and severity of symptoms. Participants will select a remedy from one of the&#xD;
      boxes, marked with X or Y, thereby allocating themselves to either the experimental group or&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first consultation, respondents will undergo a screening test for eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in the study. This will be done by means of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Participants that are eligible to take part in the study will be given an information and&#xD;
      consent form to read and sign. If any questions arise, they will be answered by the&#xD;
      researcher. A physical examination will be conducted using a modified University of&#xD;
      Johannesburg Homoeopathy case taking form. The physical examination will include vital signs&#xD;
      and examination procedure for CVI. Participants will be asked to fill in the CIVIQ-20&#xD;
      questionnaire with the assistance of the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first consultation participants will be given either the combination of Red&#xD;
      Vine, Butcher's Broom, Horse Chestnut and Vitamin B6 capsules or placebo capsules and will be&#xD;
      advised to start taking the capsules the next morning. Participants will be given enough&#xD;
      capsules to last them until the next consultation (30 capsules); participants will also be&#xD;
      advised not to change their normal routine during the course of the study. If it happens that&#xD;
      the participants take aspirin during the course of the study, they will be required to report&#xD;
      it to the researcher. Aspirin has anti-coagulant effects which may have an effect on CVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day thirty of the study, participants will have the first follow up consultation. A&#xD;
      physical examination will be conducted and participants will fill out the CIVIQ-20&#xD;
      questionnaire based on their experience over the past thirty days. At the end of the first&#xD;
      follow up, participants will be given thirty capsules of the herbal combination or placebo&#xD;
      (as selected by the participant after the first consultation) to be taken as previously&#xD;
      instructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day sixty a second follow up consultation will be conducted and the procedure followed on&#xD;
      day thirty will be repeated on day sixty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final follow up consultation will be on day ninety, where a physical examination will be&#xD;
      conducted and the CIVIQ-20 questionnaire will be completed. On the last day no capsules will&#xD;
      be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected by the questionnaire, will be statistically analysed with the assistance&#xD;
      of a statistician at Statkon, UJ. The between groups comparison will be analysed using the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test. The comparison within the groups will be conducted using the Friedman&#xD;
      test and differences over time will be analysed using the Wilcoxon post hoc test.&#xD;

    <description>The CIVIQ-20 is made up of 20 multiple choice questions subdivided into four categories: psychology, pain, physical repercussion and social repercussions. The questions are equally weighted and the value indicates the degree of deterioration of quality of life; 0 being the highest quality of life and 100 being the lowest. It has been tested to be a reliable measurement tool in evaluating the quality of life in those with CVI.</description>
