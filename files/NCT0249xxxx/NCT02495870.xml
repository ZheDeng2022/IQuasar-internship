  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cooking meat at low temperatures for prolonged times is widely used among chefs and in food&#xD;
      service due to the possibility to obtain a consistent and appealing eating quality. The&#xD;
      method is generally termed low-temperature long-time (LTLT) cooking. In LTLT cooking, meat is&#xD;
      vacuum-packed and heated at temperatures between 50°C and 65°C in a water bath for several&#xD;
      hours. LTLT has several benefits - improved tenderness and juiciness, less cooking loss,&#xD;
      better vitamin retention and uncompromised food safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent PhD thesis concluded that one of the mechanisms behind the changes in eating quality&#xD;
      during LTLT cooking was due to the proteolytic degradation in the muscle tissue. The activity&#xD;
      of proteolytic enzymes has shown to be dependent on heating temperature and time where the&#xD;
      cathepsins were found to remain active during heat treatment. At 58°C the cathepsin B+L&#xD;
      activity is increased compared to 48°C and 53°C and at 55°C compared to 25°C, 40°C and 70°C.&#xD;
      A prolonged heating time of 17 hours at 58°C has also shown to increase cathepsin B+L&#xD;
      activity. The proteolytic degradation results in the occurrence of peptides and amino acids&#xD;
      such as tryptophan, tyrosine, leucine and histidine which could lead to a faster degree of&#xD;
      satiety when consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the aminostatic hypothesis by Mellinkoff, a rise in plasma amino acids elicited&#xD;
      by protein ingestion could assist in the suppression of food intake and the onset of satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hypothesize that the ingestion of LTLT cooked pork would induce a&#xD;
      faster satiety response due to the higher availability of peptides and amino acids prior to&#xD;
      digestion. An acute meal study will elucidate this. LTLT cooking will be performed by the&#xD;
      &quot;cook-chill&quot; method to mimic real life where meat is rapidly chilled after heat treatment,&#xD;
      stored at 0-2°C and reheated and browned prior to serving.&#xD;
