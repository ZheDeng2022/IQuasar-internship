  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be administered two experimental&#xD;
      Ebola vaccines: ChAd3-EBO-Z and Ad26.ZEBOV. Four groups of volunteers will be vaccinated with&#xD;
      both vaccines one after the other in a prime/boost regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ChAd3-EBO-Z doses are 1x10^11 vp and all Ad26.ZEBOV doses are 5x10^10 vp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive a ChAd3-EBO-Z priming vaccine and an Ad26.ZEBOV boosting vaccine 28 days&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive an Ad26.ZEBOV priming vaccine and a ChAd3-EBO-Z boosting vaccine 28 days&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will receive a ChAd3-EBO-Z priming vaccine and an Ad26.ZEBOV boosting vaccine 56 days&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 will receive an Ad26.ZEBOV priming vaccine and a ChAd3-EBO-Z boosting vaccine 56 days&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the safety of the vaccinations, and the immune responses to&#xD;
      vaccination. Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ChAd3-EBO-Z and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines are called viral vectored vaccines. They are made&#xD;
      from viruses which are modified so that they cannot multiply. The viruses have extra DNA in&#xD;
      them so that after injection, the body makes Ebola proteins (but Ebola does not develop), so&#xD;
      that the immune system builds a response to Ebola without having been infected by it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be recruited in Oxford and London, England. The study will be&#xD;
      co-funded by GSK Biologicals and Crucell Holland BV.&#xD;
