    <textblock>
      This study addresses the hypothesis that intermittent treatment with fenretinide intravenous&#xD;
      emulsion will induce objective responses in patients with relapsed or refractory Peripheral&#xD;
      T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) who have failed at least one prior systemic therapy and will result in&#xD;
      acceptable toxicities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single arm efficacy and safety study in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, who have failed at least one prior system&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 140 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with fenretinide&#xD;
      (4-HPR) intravenous emulsion administered as a continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days,&#xD;
      once every 3 weeks until there is disease progression or unmanageable treatment-related&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Responses will be categorized&#xD;
      using criteria established by the International Harmonization Project on Lymphoma. Safety&#xD;
      will be evaluated during the study and for 30 days after the last administration of study&#xD;
      drug. Adverse events and laboratory studies will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03.&#xD;

             must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and estimated survival of &gt; 12&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with at least ONE of the following sites of measurable disease according to&#xD;
             International Workshop Criteria87: A) Measurable tumor on MRI or CT scan. Measurable&#xD;
             is defined as at least one lesion 20 mm in at least one dimension; for spiral CT,&#xD;
             measurable is defined as 10 mm in at least one dimension. For patients with persistent&#xD;
             disease, a biopsy of bone marrow, or bone, or a soft tissue site, must have&#xD;
             demonstrated viable tumor. If lesion was radiated, biopsy must have been done at least&#xD;
             4 weeks after radiation completed. B) Bone marrow with tumor cells seen on routine&#xD;
             morphology (not by NSE staining only) of bilateral aspirate and/or biopsy on one bone&#xD;
             marrow sample, except for patient who tested positive subsequent to their last&#xD;
             treatment regimen or patients who had a negative marrow within three months of study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;

             site showed viable tumor at least 4 weeks after radiation was completed. Patients must&#xD;
             not have received small field (focal) radiation for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to&#xD;

             attribution. B) Who have active CNS disease or a history of cranial irradiation are&#xD;
             excluded due to concerns regarding toxicity attribution. Patients with previously&#xD;
