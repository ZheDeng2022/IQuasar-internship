      Infant mental health is a significant public health issue as early adversity and expose to&#xD;
      childhood stress has life-long consequences for the affected children. Helping families at&#xD;
      risk correct their adverse effects on the infant has the potential to halt a negative spiral&#xD;
      effect where vulnerable parents fail to cope with an at-risk child - which in turn, adds to&#xD;
      the child's vulnerability, negatively affects the parents, and so forth. Over a four year&#xD;
      period, an estimated 17.600 dyads will be screened in the City of Copenhagen using&#xD;
      standardized screening instruments in detecting infant social withdrawal (ADBB) and maternal&#xD;
      postnatal depression (EPDS). A sample of 314 eligible parent(s) will enter into a clinical,&#xD;
      randomized control trial to test the efficacy of an 8 week group counseling program, Circle&#xD;
      of Security Parenting (COS-P) compared to Care as Usual(CAU) in enhancing maternal&#xD;
      sensitivity, child attachment and cognitive development. CIMHP is the first large-scale&#xD;
      randomized controlled study to test the efficacy of COS-P in promoting parental sensitivity,&#xD;
      child attachment and cognitive development in Denmark. Results will provide evidence&#xD;
      regarding the efficacy of an American short term indicated parenting group program when&#xD;
      implemented in a Scandinavian country.&#xD;

      Background and rationale Infant mental health is a significant public health issue as early&#xD;
      adversity and exposure to early childhood stress has life-long consequences for these&#xD;
      affected children on outcomes such physical and mental health, educational attainment, labor&#xD;
      market success and family formation. Infants are - as a result of their dependency,&#xD;
      vulnerability and relative social invisibility - more exposed to mental health risks than&#xD;
      older children. Infants may be at risk due to a particular biological risk (e.g. infantile&#xD;
      autism, retardation, prematurity, physical disabilities etc) or to psycho-social risks in the&#xD;
      family (e.g. mentally ill parents, poverty, drug/alcohol abuse etc). Recent Danish estimates&#xD;
      suggest that one in five families is at risk of inadequate parenting resources and child&#xD;
      neglect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is by now solid evidence that the establishment of attachment relationships, i.e. a&#xD;
      stable emotional bond with a caregiver - mostly the parent - is one of the most important&#xD;
      developmental milestones in infancy. Early parent-child attachment relationships function as&#xD;
      a blueprint for future social relationships and serve as a framework within which children&#xD;
      learn how to deal with stressful situations and to regulate the accompanying negative&#xD;
      emotions. Insecure and disorganized attachment is a significant risk for longitudinal child&#xD;
      development and psychopathology, as the ability to regulate ones feelings of stress and&#xD;
      negative emotions is important for a wide range of socio-emotional outcomes ranging from&#xD;
      social competence, moral development and empathy, to academic achievement. Recent&#xD;
      meta-analyses show that insecure and disorganized children have a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      mental problems later in life. Insecurely attached children are also more likely than&#xD;
      securely attached children to develop internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, as well as externalizing problems such as aggressive behavior. For externalizing&#xD;
      problems, the risk was even higher for disorganized children. Furthermore, research into&#xD;
      early brain development indicates that brain development can be physiologically altered by&#xD;
      severe stress imposed by neglect and inadequate parenting during a child's early years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from attachment research shows that sensitive parenting, where the parent is alert&#xD;
      and able to understand the infant's expression of emotional states and able to manage and&#xD;
      meet the infant's needs contingently, adequately and in a comforting way will lead to the&#xD;
      establishment of a pattern of secure attachment in the child. Lack of availability,&#xD;
      inconsistent availability, misunderstanding of the infant's emotional expression and parental&#xD;
      behavior that frightens the infant may all lead to an insure attachment and in the most&#xD;
      severe cases a disorganized attachment. This is indicative of a breakdown of an organized&#xD;
      (secure or insecure) attachment behavioral strategy. Disorganized attachment is considered to&#xD;
      be the result of parental behavior that is frightening for the child. An extreme example of&#xD;
      such behavior is child maltreatment, but all sorts of parental behavior that are not&#xD;
      comprehensible for the child, such as dissociation, which is common in depressed parents, is&#xD;
      potentially frightening for the child. This sort of behavior results in the paradoxical&#xD;
      situation that the parent is a source of comfort and a source of fear at the same time. Thus,&#xD;
      in stress situations the child does not know what to do, and the behavioral strategy&#xD;
      collapses .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant social withdrawal indicates infant distress and early attachment disturbances and is a&#xD;
      known risk factor for infant mental health. Infant social withdrawal is indicated by a lack&#xD;
      of either positive (e.g. smiling, eye contact) or negative vocal protestations. Sustained&#xD;
      withdrawal behavior in infants can be seen as a chronic diminution of the attachment system,&#xD;
      which is gradually generalized into a diminished engagement and lowered reactivity to the&#xD;
      environment at large. In more European countries the use of the validated systematic&#xD;
      screening method, Alarm Distress Baby Scale (ADBB) for identifying infant delayed&#xD;
      socio-emotional development in infant mental health clinics and in home visiting programs&#xD;
      have shown promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postnatal depression (PND) is another known risk for infant mental health. A meta-analysis&#xD;
      shows that up to 19% of new mothers may experience minor or major depression during the first&#xD;
      months postpartum. If only including major depression, the prevalence was found to be 7.1 %.&#xD;
      In a more recent European study, 1,066 women were followed from pregnancy to 12 months&#xD;
      postpartum. The results indicated that 9.6% of new mothers may experience a major depressive&#xD;
      episode during the first year after delivery. No estimates were given for minor depression.&#xD;
      Most cases develop within the first three months with a peak incidence of about 4-6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PND has a substantial impact on the mother, her partner, her family, mother-baby interactions&#xD;
      and attachment insecurity and the longer term socio-emotional and cognitive development of&#xD;
      the baby, especially when depression occurs in the first year of life. Often, mothers&#xD;
      suffering from postnatal depression are emotionally, cognitively and/or behaviorally&#xD;
      inhibited or impaired in their ability to recognize and react with appropriate &quot;sensitivity&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;responsiveness&quot; to their children's needs. With regard to the infants of these mothers,&#xD;
      higher incidences of negative behaviors, such as social withdrawal, persistent crying,&#xD;
      averted gaze or head position, physical neediness and a lack of expression of delight in the&#xD;
      presence of their mothers, have been observed. These behaviors increase the mother's&#xD;
      experience of stress, which further contributes to the maintenance of maladaptive&#xD;
      interactional behavioral patterns. Without improvement in these negative interaction cycles,&#xD;
      for example, through early interventions, there is a greater likelihood for infants to&#xD;
      develop an insecure-avoidant, an insecure ambivalent or disorganized attachment pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on the treatment of women with postnatal depression has shown that treatment that&#xD;
      only focuses on the mother (i.e., medication, psychotherapy) is insufficient to buffer&#xD;
      against the negative impact of maternal psychopathology on the child's cognitive and&#xD;
      psychosocial development, as well as infant-mother attachment quality. Even when depression&#xD;
      is effectively treated, this does not seem to &quot;spill over&quot; and improve the mother-infant&#xD;
      relationship and long-term infant social-emotional outcomes. Instead, it is necessary to&#xD;
      support the depressed mothers in their specific needs in caring and relating to their&#xD;
      infants,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions targeting PND delivered in groups have been found to achieve change through the&#xD;
      dual process of emotional experience and reflection in an interpersonal context. Group&#xD;
      sessions provide a support network, reduce isolation and stigma, provide an environment in&#xD;
      which to practice interpersonal and communication skills, shape coping strategies and learn&#xD;
      from each other, and enable a number of families to be treated at once. Recently, building on&#xD;
      evidence from attachment research, a special focus is given to preventive group programs that&#xD;
      enhance parental sensitivity and secure attachment such as the intervention program &quot;Circle&#xD;
      of Security (COS)&quot;. Based on findings from more studies, COS has proved efficient in&#xD;
      enhancing secure attachment as well as reducing maternal depressive symptomatology in&#xD;
      high-risk samples, including mothers in prison and mentally ill mothers. The original COS&#xD;
      program consists of 20 weekly sessions of 2 hour durations and includes an initial video&#xD;
      assessment of parent -child attachment. In the COS intervention graphical illustrations of&#xD;
      &quot;the Circle of Security&quot; are used. This Circle is a roadmap that encompasses the three basic&#xD;
      control systems; the attachment system, the exploration system and the caregiving system. The&#xD;
      parent is illustrated through the pair of hands that hold together the child's world. In COS&#xD;
      concepts, &quot;holding&quot; means to serve as a secure base and safe haven. &quot;The top half&quot; of the&#xD;
      Circle depicts the child's exploration system and needs. I order to explore, the child needs&#xD;
      the parent to serve as a secure base by &quot;watching over,&quot; &quot;delighting in,&quot; &quot;helping,&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;enjoying with&quot; the child. Having a parent that supports exploration helps the child develop&#xD;
      his or her own sense of interest, leading to mastery and competency in later years. Along&#xD;
      &quot;the bottom half&quot; is the child's attachment needs: &quot;protect me,&quot; &quot;comfort me,&quot; &quot;delight in&#xD;
      me,&quot; and &quot;organize my feelings.&quot; By delighting in the child, the parent helps the child&#xD;
      constructing an internal representation of him- of herself as a loved person and thereby&#xD;
      establish self-worth, and by organizing the child's feelings by accepting, sharing and naming&#xD;
      them, the parent co-regulates the child's emotions and lays the groundwork of later&#xD;
      self-regulation of emotions. The child's needs for comfort and exploration encouragement&#xD;
      shift rapidly and the caregiver must continuously adjust to those needs, whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analytic evidence identifies short term group approaches (&lt; 16 sessions), targeting&#xD;
      maternal sensitivity as being the most effective, and sensitivity focused interventions&#xD;
      conducted with referred at-risk samples (e.g. DSM-III-R depressed mothers), as being more&#xD;
      effective than interventions with other groups. Attachment security, in particular, has been&#xD;
      found to be readily influenced by sensitivity-focused interventions. The program &quot;Circle of&#xD;
      Security Parenting&quot; (COS-P) is a recent and shorter version of COS that consists of eight&#xD;
      weekly sessions of two hours durations without the individual video assessment of attachment.&#xD;
      In COS-P standard video materials of child attachment behaviors as well as the graphic&#xD;
      materials to illustrate the Circle of Security are used. Themes that are covered during the&#xD;
      program are: &quot;The Circle of Security&quot;, &quot;Exploration of the child's needs in the circle&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;Being with your child in the circle&quot;, &quot;Exploration of own challenges in meeting child's&#xD;
      needs&quot;, and &quot;Disruption and repair of the relationship&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the investigator's knowledge, the effectiveness of COS-P in relation to&#xD;
      enhancing maternal sensitivity and the mother-infant relationship has not been fully tested&#xD;
      in an RCT design in a general population, making this study the first. Results will provide&#xD;
      evidence regarding the efficacy of an American short term indicated parenting group program&#xD;
      when implemented in a Scandinavian country. Further, COS-P is a promising approach as health&#xD;
      nurses can be trained COS-P therapists in future up-scaling.&#xD;
