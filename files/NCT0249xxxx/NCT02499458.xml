  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have prognostic value in several tumor types, and increasing&#xD;
      evidence suggests that molecular characterization of CTCs can serve as a &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; to&#xD;
      understand and address treatment resistance. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that&#xD;
      CTCs can be accurately enumerated and characterized in metastatic clear cell renal cancer&#xD;
      (CCRC) and can serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers to improve treatment. The challenge&#xD;
      surrounding CTC analysis in CCRC is that most CTC technologies (including the clinical&#xD;
      gold-standard CellSearch®) depend in epithelial markers such as EpCAM that are expressed at&#xD;
      low or heterogeneous levels in CCRC. Members of the research team have developed a novel CTC&#xD;
      microfluidic technology that can effectively detect CTCs that are completely undetectable by&#xD;
      CellSearch® because of very low EpCAM expression, as well as allowing for CTC recovery for&#xD;
      downstream molecular characterization. The goal of this proposal is therefore to test the&#xD;
      hypotheses that (1) The microfluidics CTC technology will have better sensitivity/specificity&#xD;
      relative to the CellSearch in metastatic CCRC; and (2) Enumeration of CTCs in metastatic CCRC&#xD;
      patients (n=66) will have prognostic value, while molecular characterization of CTCs for&#xD;
      expression of biomarkers (VHL, VEGF, mTOR, HIF1/HIF2, AKT) related to CCRC etiology will be&#xD;
      predictive of response/resistance to targeted therapies. Although CCRC is relatively&#xD;
      uncommon, the lack of established adjuvant treatments and high cost of targeted therapies in&#xD;
      the palliative setting makes the search for new prognostic/predictive biomarkers an important&#xD;
      clinical goal.&#xD;

    <description>For comparison of the 2 CTC platforms, a Bland-Altman plot will be constructed. This plot is superior to standard correlation statistics in that it assesses agreement rather than association. Initially we will use a Chi-Square test to compare the 2 methods at a cutoff point of ≥5 versus &lt;5 CTCs/7.5mL, with simple comparison of PFS at this level. As the cut-off point may not be the same for each method, we will also compare the methods using simple 2X2 contingency tables.</description>
