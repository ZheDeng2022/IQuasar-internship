    <textblock>
      USE-PACT is a cohort study of patients initiating Selincro® with one-year follow-up,&#xD;
      performed using a random sample of prescribers. The aim of the study is to evaluate the use&#xD;
      of Selincro in real-life and its impact on alcohol consumption at one year.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selincro® (nalmefene) has obtained European market authorisation and is indicated &quot;for the&#xD;
      reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence who have a high&#xD;
      drinking risk level, without physical withdrawal symptoms and who do not require immediate&#xD;
      detoxification&quot;. The French health authorities (Haute Autorité de Santé, HAS, and Agence&#xD;
      Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des produits de santé, ANSM) have requested an&#xD;
      evaluation of the real-life conditions of use of Selincro and its impact on morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response, USE-PACT has been developed : a cohort of patients initiating Selincro® with&#xD;
      one-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the change of alcohol consumption at one year in&#xD;
      patients initiating Selincro® in usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe prescriber characteristics,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the initial demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics of patients&#xD;
           at the start of treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe patient support, notably psychosocial, at start of treatment and during&#xD;
           treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe characteristics of Selincro® treatment during the study period,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the frequency of adverse effects during Selincro® treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective cohort of patients initiating Selincro® performed using a random sample&#xD;
      of general practitioners (GPs), psychiatrists and physicians practicing in specialised&#xD;
      structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      600 patients are required to obtain precision of ± 5 % for the relative variation in alcohol&#xD;
      consumption in g/day at one year, with standard deviation of 63% and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals, i.e. 1000 patients to be included taking into account 40% loss-to-follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2500 GPs and 2500 psychiatrists will be contacted with the hypothesis of 10% accepting and 7%&#xD;
      active physicians and all physicians/specialised structures from the directory of the French&#xD;
      alcohology society. It is thus expected 175 GPs, 175 psychiatrists and 85 physicians&#xD;
      practicing in specialised structures, based on the hypothesis of an average 2 patients per GP&#xD;
      and psychiatrist, and 4 for physicians practicing in specialised structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participating physician should, during a 4-month period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Include in the cohort all patients for whom he/she initiates Selincro® treatment and&#xD;
           fulfilling the eligibility criteria, with a maximum of 6 patients per physician;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record in a non-inclusion register patients for whom Selincro® is initiated and not&#xD;
           included in the cohort, with a maximum of 10 patients per physician;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician will do a clinical evaluation at the time of inclusion and will follow the&#xD;
      patients included in the cohort according to usual practice, with a clinical evaluation at 1&#xD;
      month ± 8 days (M1), 3 months ± 15 days (M3), 6 months ± 30 days (M6), 9 months ± 30 days&#xD;
      (M9), and 12 months ± 30 days (M12) performed during usual follow-up consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, each included patient will also complete a self-administered questionnaire at&#xD;
      the the time of the inclusion. Then, they will receive and complete the self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire at the 5 follow-up periods (M1, M3, M6, M9 and M12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients declared as lost-to-follow-up and, if required, his/her general practitioner will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone by the coordinating centre in order to fill-out a &quot;last known status&#xD;
      questionnaire&quot;. For patients who could not be reached, vital status will be investigated&#xD;
      using the INSEE/INSERM centralised procedure as defined by decree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis using SAS® software will be conducted on the basis of a detailed&#xD;
      statistical analysis plan developed and submitted for validation to the scientific committee&#xD;
      before analysis, according to the following principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the total population, and in according to prescriber speciality (GP, psychiatrists,&#xD;
           physicians practicing in specialised structures), and the existence or not of previous&#xD;
           medicinal treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Flow chart&quot; presenting the process of physician recruitment and patient inclusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of prescriber characteristics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of treated patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the change in alcohol consumption (primary and secondary criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Principal analysis with multiple imputation of missing data for patients followed&#xD;
                one year with missing Total Alcohol Consumption (TAC)/Heavy Drinking Days (HDD),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  First sensitivity analysis without multiple imputation,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Second sensitivity analysis with multiple imputation of missing data for patients&#xD;
                followed one year with missing TAC/HDD as well as those lost-to-follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of Selincro® treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description and frequency of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Representativeness:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of characteristics common to included patients and those in the registry;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of initial characteristics of patients followed at 1 year and those not&#xD;
           followed at 1 year;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the characteristics of patients included in the cohort with respect to&#xD;
           patients extracted from the national health insurance database (EGB: Echantillon&#xD;
           Généraliste des Bénéficiaires). Adjustments could be performed if an imbalance with&#xD;
           respect to EGB data in order to produce representative data.&#xD;
