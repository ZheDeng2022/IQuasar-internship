      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best doses of cabozantinib s-malate and&#xD;
      nivolumab with or without ipilimumab in treating patients with genitourinary (genital and&#xD;
      urinary organ) tumors that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Cabozantinib&#xD;
      s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving cabozantinib s-malate and nivolumab&#xD;
      alone or with ipilimumab works better in treating patients with genitourinary tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the&#xD;
      combination of cabozantinib s-malate (cabozantinib) and nivolumab (cabo-nivo) and separately&#xD;
      the combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab (cabo-nivo-ipi) in patients with&#xD;
      genitourinary tumors. (Phase I) II. Assess safety and tolerability of cabozantinib, nivolumab&#xD;

      additional data to evaluate the safety of both combinations in patients with clear cell renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (ccRCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the number of malignant soft tissue and bone lesions on fludeoxyglucose F-18&#xD;
      (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) (scan 1) versus&#xD;
      combined fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) and 18F-FDG PET/CT (scan 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess response assessment by RECIST 1.1 using CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis&#xD;
      with intravenous (IV) contrast versus assessment by combined 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG PET/CT (scan&#xD;
      2) using number of malignant and change (modified PET RECIST [PERCIST]) of soft tissue and&#xD;
      bone lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To test the feasibility of automated density and volume application (ADaVA) as a means of&#xD;
      assessing tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess PDL-1 and MET expression data and in exploratory fashion analyze their&#xD;
      association to response or clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall response rates (ORR) on patients who have been challenged or&#xD;
      re-challenged with ipilimumab therapy post disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess effects of treatment in patients with bone-only disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I: Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 22 cycles, patients&#xD;
      receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After progression, patients may receive cabozantinib s-malate PO,&#xD;
      nivolumab IV, and ipilimumab IV at the part II RP2D for 4 cycles followed by cabozantinib&#xD;
      s-malate PO QD and nivolumab IV every 2 weeks or 4 weeks if post-cycle 21 in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate PO QD on days 1-21, nivolumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1, and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After&#xD;
      completion of 4 cycles with ipilimumab, patients continue receiving cabozantinib s-malate PO&#xD;
      QD on days 1-28 and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 21 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      After 26 cycles, patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After progression, patients may receive&#xD;
      cabozantinib s-malate PO, nivolumab IV, and ipilimumab IV at the part II RP2D for 4 cycles&#xD;
      followed by cabozantinib s-malate PO QD and nivolumab IV every 2 weeks or 4 weeks if&#xD;
      post-cycle 21 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 16 weeks, and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening;&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential include women who have experienced menarche and who&#xD;
             have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal; postmenopause is&#xD;
             defined as amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months; Note: women who have been amenorrheic&#xD;
             for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the&#xD;
             amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, ovarian suppression&#xD;
             or any other reversible reason&#xD;

          -  The effects of the drugs used in this trial on the developing human fetus are unknown;&#xD;
             however, cabozantinib was embryolethal in rats at exposures below the 140 mg dose in&#xD;
             the label, with increased incidences of skeletal variations in rats and visceral&#xD;
             variations and malformations in rabbits; for this reason and because tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to&#xD;
             be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception, as defined below, prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 7 months after&#xD;
             completion of all study medications; women treated or enrolled on this protocol must&#xD;
             also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for 5 months after completion of all study medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier&#xD;
             methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study&#xD;
             and for 5 or 7 months for women or men respectively, after the last dose of study&#xD;
             drugs, even if oral contraceptives are also used; all subjects of reproductive&#xD;
             potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control&#xD;
             during the course of the study and for 5 or 7 months for women and men respectively&#xD;
             after the last dose of study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tissue availability for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is mandatory&#xD;
             for enrollment; however if archived tissue is unavailable the patient will be given&#xD;
             the option to consent to pre and post treatment tissue biopsies; tissue biopsies will&#xD;
             be collected pretreatment (prior to the first dose of therapy) and post treatment&#xD;
