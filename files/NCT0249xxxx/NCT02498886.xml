    <textblock>
      At MRC Human Nutrition Research, the investigators have developed an engineered analogue of&#xD;
      the ferritin-core for safe and effective iron supplementation. Iron hydroxide adipate&#xD;
      tartrate (IHAT) is a tartrate-modified, nano-disperse Fe(III) oxo-hydroxide, formed in an&#xD;
      adipate buffer, with similar functional properties and small primary particle size (~2 nm) as&#xD;
      the iron found in the ferritin core; it better mimics iron absorption from food than the&#xD;
      non-physiological bolus doses of ferrous sulphate currently used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory study will test the hypothesis that IHAT has equivalent bioavailability to&#xD;
      ferrous sulphate but produces a less harmful post-ingestion rise in transferrin saturation.&#xD;
      The design is a 3-arm (IDA, non-IDA and IDA-IHAT new manufacture), crossover, randomised,&#xD;
      single-dose study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative bioavailability value of IHAT versus ferrous sulphate. This will be determined from&#xD;
      the red blood cell incorporation of isotope-labelled iron 14 days following a single oral&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum iron at 0, 2, 4, 6 hours following a single dose of each iron compound. Transferrin&#xD;
      saturation at 0, 2, 4, 6 hours following a single dose of each iron compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma 58Fe and 57Fe at 0, 2, 4, 6 hours. Pathogen growth using ex vivo assays in serum&#xD;
      collected from each subject at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours following a single dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study's main hypothesis is that IHAT will be bioavailable in pre-menopausal anaemic&#xD;
      Gambian women and will lead to a lower serum iron and transferrin saturation increase than an&#xD;
      equivalent dose of ferrous sulphate. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that IHAT&#xD;
      will produce a less harmful post-ingestion rise in transferrin saturation, i.e. the serum&#xD;
      collected from subjects following a single dose of IHAT will promote less pathogen growth in&#xD;
      ex vivo assays than that collected following an equivalent dose of ferrous sulphate. Finally,&#xD;
      based on previous animal data [5], the investigators hypothesize that IHAT absorption will be&#xD;
      significantly higher in anaemic women compared to non-anaemic women, and that this will not&#xD;
      be the case with ferrous sulphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a cross-over, single-dose comparison against ferrous sulphate (standard of&#xD;
      care) in anaemic and non-anaemic women. The iron single dosage for both compounds will be&#xD;
      60mg elemental iron equivalent and each compound will be labelled with a stable iron isotope.&#xD;
      Outcomes will be: red blood cell incorporation of labelled iron, serum iron, transferrin&#xD;
      saturation and pathogen growth in ex vivo serum assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine iron bioavailability (i.e. red blood cell incorporation) from a single dose of&#xD;
      IHAT versus ferrous sulphate in pre-menopausal Gambian women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine serum iron absorption following a single dose of IHAT versus ferrous sulphate in&#xD;
      pre-menopausal Gambian women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if a single-dose of IHAT produces a less harmful post-ingestion rise in&#xD;
      transferrin saturation and serum iron than ferrous sulphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each compound is labelled with a stable isotope of Fe so that its absorption can be&#xD;
      determined from the red blood cell incorporation of the stable isotope 14 days after the&#xD;
      single dose. This study is effectively a Phase 0 study (pharmacokinetics) with small numbers&#xD;
      and because iron absorption varies from individual to individual, depending on their body&#xD;
      iron needs and gastrointestinal digestion issues, it is more accurate to use each study&#xD;
      subject as her own control. Therefore, each subject will ingest IHAT on one study day and the&#xD;
      active treatment comparator on a separate day. The 2 study visits need to be 14 days apart to&#xD;
      allow for red blood cell incorporation of the stable iron isotopes used to label the iron&#xD;
      materials. This method is the gold standard to determine relative bioavailability values&#xD;
      (RBV) of novel iron compounds (i.e. in relation to ferrous sulphate absorption) and allows an&#xD;
      accurate determination of RBV of IHAT that otherwise would not be possible if we used a&#xD;
      parallel study design with small numbers.&#xD;
