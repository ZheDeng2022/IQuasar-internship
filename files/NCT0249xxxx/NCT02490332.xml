  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of otitis media among Greenlandic children is one of the highest in the world&#xD;
      and twenty per cent of schoolchildren have impaired hearing in the frequencies for normal&#xD;
      speech. Yet, there are no national guidelines to ensure prevention and treatment of recurrent&#xD;
      acute otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion and impaired hearing in Greenlandic&#xD;
      children. International studies from the developed part of the world have shown that otitis&#xD;
      prone children may benefit from tubulation of the tympanic membrane. However, it is unknown&#xD;
      if these results can be applied to Greenlandic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PhD project will conduct a randomised controlled trial comparing tubulation of the&#xD;
      tympanic membrane, in Greenlandic children aged 9-36 months with recurrent acute otitis media&#xD;
      and/or chronic otitis media with effusion, to conservative treatment. The children will be&#xD;
      followed for two years. Outcome measures will include number of visits to health clinics,&#xD;
      number of tympanic membrane perforations, number of episodes with acute otitis media&#xD;
      according to medical records, Quality of life, measured by the validated questionnaires OM6&#xD;
      and Caregiver Impact Questionnaire, number of episodes where per oral or intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics have been administered according to medical records and serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in collaboration with the Greenlandic health authorities and&#xD;
      Copenhagen Trial Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this trial the investigators hope to decrease the number of episodes with acute otitis&#xD;
      media, the number of Greenlandic children with chronic perforations of the tympanic membrane&#xD;
      and hearing impairment and increase quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will add important knowledge to the effect of ventilation tube treatment also in&#xD;
      an international aspect. There are to date only less than a handful of high quality studies&#xD;
      concerning this issue on an international basis. The study will be among the first addressing&#xD;
      this problem among populations with high risk of otitis media and is also of interest to&#xD;
      other indigenous populations and the developing part of the world.&#xD;
