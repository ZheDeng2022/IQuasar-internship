      Uveitis is a leading cause of blindness in the children and young adult's populations. One&#xD;
      third of etiology are idiopathic. The reference treatments are corticosteroids and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents. They have significant side effects, and patient's compliance is&#xD;
      often poor. In addition, some uveitis are more resistant. Also, in these situations of&#xD;
      deadlock therapeutic, investigators propose a cell therapy by administering regulatory T&#xD;
      cells (Tregs) in the vitreous of patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Arsenal and limitations in the treatment of uveitis Uveitis is a major cause of severe visual&#xD;
      loss or even blindness in children and young adults. In almost one third of cases, it is&#xD;
      associated with an infectious agent, another third is integrated in the field of autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases as systemic entities including (Behçet's disease, sarcoidosis, spondyloarthropathy&#xD;
      ...) or limited to the eye (Birdshot type retinochoroidopathy, sympathetic ophthalmia,&#xD;
      idiopathic retinal vasculitis). The last third remains idiopathic, where despite a careful&#xD;
      etiological research, no cause is identified. The systemic corticosteroids are often&#xD;
      effective but have significant side effects and patient compliance is often poor. That is why&#xD;
      they are sometimes administered directly into the posterior segment of the eye (vitreous),&#xD;
      but the effect is only temporary, often ineffective, and also associated with side effects.&#xD;
      In addition, some are steroid-dependent, requiring treatment with immunosuppressive agents;&#xD;
      which also may be responsible for many adverse effects and are not always effective. In these&#xD;
      therapeutic impasse situations, investigators propose a cell therapy approach injection of&#xD;
      CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 regulators + (Tregs), directly into the vitreous of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new therapy approach uveitis by cell therapy It is now clearly established that Tregs play&#xD;
      a critical role in the control of autoimmune diseases. In man or mouse, a deep deficit in&#xD;
      Tregs is associated with a very severe autoimmune syndrome, leading to death .In uveitis, it&#xD;
      is also shown that Tregs control this disease in deficient mice. Tregs have been reported in&#xD;
      humans . In addition, our group and others have shown that various autoimmune diseases can be&#xD;
      prevented by transfer of Tregs in mice .Thus, cell therapy by injection of Tregs raises hopes&#xD;
      for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases . However, only specific&#xD;
      and not polyclonal Tregs, have a strong therapeutic potential when administered systemically.&#xD;
      The only Tregs that can be used in clinic are polyclonal Tregs purified by magnetic beads to&#xD;
      which, are adsorbed anti- CD25 antibody . This technology provides a cell preparation&#xD;
      enriched in Tregs for 50 to 70%, the balance consisting of effector T cells (Teffs ) , B&#xD;
      lymphocytes and NK cells. A therapeutic alternative to the systemic injection of specific&#xD;
      Tregs is to inject, preactivated polyclonal Tregs directly into the target site of autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, in purified clinical grade condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the study population. Patients with bilateral severe steroid-dependent&#xD;
      non-infectious uveitis. Infectious or tumoral etiologies have been excluded after completion&#xD;
      of a comprehensive review of systems. All patients had a negative Quantiferon test and a&#xD;
      normal Mantoux test. Biological tests sent to specialized laboratories will eliminate an&#xD;
      active infection. In some cases, aqueous humor obtained after AC tap and / or vitreous biopsy&#xD;
      obtained after vitrectomy will be analyzed for diagnostic assay IL-10, immune load factor or&#xD;
      PCR analysis (toxoplasmosis, herpes viruses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology of uveitis in humans. Inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as IL-6,&#xD;
      IFN-g, IL-8 and MCP-1 and sometimes IL-1ß, IL-2 and TNF-alpha were found in the aqueous humor&#xD;
      and vitreous of patients with uveitis . Given the small volume available in these human&#xD;
      samples (around 100 ml), data are obtained with multiple detection techniques using flow&#xD;
      cytometry, for measuring the concentration of thirty different cytokines and chemokines in a&#xD;
      50 microl volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to expand the study to other cytokines and chemokines, investigators also used a&#xD;
      semi-quantitative technique named &quot;&quot;antibody array&quot;&quot; which allows the analysis of a number of&#xD;
      different molecules ranging from 30 to 170. These preliminary results, evaluated in some&#xD;
      patients, confirm the presence of Th1 inflammatory profile in the eye of patients suffering&#xD;
      from uveitis (not shown) and confirm our strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks associated with injected cells. No side effects of Tregs injection has been observed in&#xD;
      preclinical mouse model. In our Biotherapies facilities, production of Tregs, as provided in&#xD;
      this essay, will contain 50 to 70% of Tregs, defined by the phenotype CD4 + Foxp3 + CD25 +.&#xD;
      Therefore investigators tested the effect of leukocyte contaminants on therapeutic effect in&#xD;
      uveitis in mice. The presence of such contaminants effector T cells, B cells, NK cells,&#xD;
      dendritic cells or macrophages did not cause visible side effects at the clinical or&#xD;
      histological levels. A second potential risk is that the injected of polyclonal Tregs have&#xD;
      been differentiated into a different celltype. Anterior study showed that natural human Tregs&#xD;
      can differentiate into Th17 type T lymphocytes in the presence of IL-2 or IL-15. This&#xD;
      differentiation is accentuated by the addition of IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-21 or IL-23 . Although&#xD;
      investigators can not formally exclude the possibility that Tregs injected IVT may&#xD;
      differentiate into Th17 cells, since this event is not probably been detected in uveitis eye&#xD;
      (data not shown).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another potential risk of dissemination of the injected cells from the eye due to reflux at&#xD;
      conjunctiva during the IVT. The last risk that can be considered is the development of non-&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma by creating a tolerogenic environment due to regulatory T cells. This risk&#xD;
      is identical than the one associated with the current reference treatment of uveitis :&#xD;
      immunosuppressives agent and corticosteroids. These risks have never been fully described in&#xD;
      the literature in both animals and humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and number of patients. The 3 levels of Tregs doses will be respectively 0.4, 1.2 and&#xD;
      3.6 million. The lowest dose of 0.4 million Tregs corresponding to 2 times the effective dose&#xD;
      in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two to 18 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Funding is provided for 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good clinical practice( GCP) The research will be conducted in accordance with GCP and the&#xD;
      current legislative and regulation. Investigators certify that the research will be conducted&#xD;
      in accordance with the protocol of GCP The Biotherapies facilities perform production&#xD;
      activities, quality control according to current regulations for cell therapy and compliance&#xD;
      with good practices of Cellular Therapy (BPTC) and also according to standard operating&#xD;
      procedures (SOP). Specific authorization is required from ANSM for the realization of this&#xD;
      essay To conclude, it is now clearly established that cell therapy approach of CD4 + CD25 +&#xD;
      Foxp3 regulators (Tregs) play a critical role in the control of autoimmune diseases in human&#xD;
      or mouse clinical test . Therefore this clinical trial assess the effect of Tolerance- dose&#xD;
      of in patients treated by Tregs for bilateral severe steroid-dependent non-infectious&#xD;
      uveitis.&#xD;
