      This study is designed for descriptive pharmacokinetic characterization of ketamine and&#xD;
      norketamine in serum, urine and feces after oral single dose administration of a new&#xD;
      developed prolonged release tablet formulation containing 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg ketamine under&#xD;
      fasting conditions and for descriptive pharmacokinetic characterization of ketamine and&#xD;
      norketamine in serum, urine and feces after intravenous single dose administration of 5 mg&#xD;
      ketamine solution for infusion within 30 min&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine, a cyclohexanone derivative, is a non-barbiturate anesthetic agent which has been&#xD;
      available in clinical practice for more than 40 years. Ketamine was first synthesized in 1962&#xD;
      and patented in Belgium in 1963. Ketamine, a potent non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate&#xD;
      (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has a recognized unique therapeutic value in human and veterinary&#xD;
      medicine as an anesthetic with analgesic properties. Ketamine is considered as one of the&#xD;
      World Health Organisation (WHO) essential drugs for the management of refractory pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is widely used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, usually in&#xD;
      combination with a sedative and if required a muscle relaxant. When used as an intravenous&#xD;
      (i.v.) or intra-muscular (i.m.) injection, ketamine is best suited for short procedures. With&#xD;
      additional doses, or by i.v. infusion, ketamine can be used for longer procedures. Due to its&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic properties, important clinical applications are mainly brief diagnostic ones&#xD;
      and surgical procedures in paediatric patients and ambulatory anesthesia, treatment of burn&#xD;
      patients, obstetrics, and for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in trauma victims,&#xD;
      hypovolemic patients, patients with septic or cardiogenic shock, and patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      diseases. Other uses include sedation in the intensive care setting, and analgesia&#xD;
      particularly in emergency medicine as well as treatment of bronchospasm / asthma. However,&#xD;
      the use of ketamine for humans in the EU is restricted to special indications, due to the&#xD;
      occurrence of emergence reactions. Outside the EU, its ease of use gives ketamine a major&#xD;
      advantage under difficult circumstances (developing countries and remote areas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For therapeutic purposes, ketamine is usually administered intravenously (i.v.) or&#xD;
      intramuscularly (i.m.). Its hydrochloride salt is marketed under many brand names such as&#xD;
      Ketanest, Ketalar, or Ketaset. Ketamine is a chiral compound. While most marketed ketamine&#xD;
      preparations are racemic mixtures of R-(-)-ketamine and S-(+)-ketamine (1:1), formulations&#xD;
      containing only the enantiomer S-(+)-ketamine are also commercially available (e.g. KetanestÂ®&#xD;
      S, Pfizer Pharma GmbH). S-(+)-ketamine is approximately four times more potent than&#xD;
      R-(-)-ketamine and twice as potent as the racemic mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well-known that ketamine exerts analgesic effects at subanesthetic doses. Therefore,&#xD;
      during the past 15-20 years, ketamine has been used as an analgesic in a wide range of pain&#xD;
      settings, including acute (e.g. post-operative pain, pain during dental procedures) and&#xD;
      chronic pain (e.g. central or peripheral neuropathic pain, cancer pain) conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the drug is only approved for intramuscular injection and intravenous injection or&#xD;
      infusion, ketamine is frequently used via other routes of administration, such as&#xD;
      subcutaneous (s.c.) injection or infusion, rectal, oral, intranasal, transdermal (patch),&#xD;
      intrathecal or epidural administration. Considering that no oral formulation is approved, the&#xD;
      marketed solution for injection/infusion or an extemporaneous preparation was used in&#xD;
      clinical studies investigating the efficacy of orally administered ketamine. For clinical&#xD;
      (off-label) use, the solution for injection/infusion is generally employed for oral&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
