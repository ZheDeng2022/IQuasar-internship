      The objectives of the study are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate pharmacokinetics, distribution in blood leucocytes, metabolism and&#xD;
           methemoglobinemia after single-dose and repeated-dose administration of 100 mg of&#xD;
           dapsone in healthy subjects genotyped for CYP2C9 and NAT2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate serum through levels, distribution in blood leucocytes and methemoglobinemia&#xD;
           after repeated-dose treatment with dapsone in patients with autoimmune bullous&#xD;
           dermatoses before and after concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids&#xD;

      Dapsone (diamino diphenyl sulphone, DDS) was synthesized by Emil Fromm and Jakob Wittmann in&#xD;
      Freiburg (Germany) in 1908. In 1937, the anti-inflammatory potency of dapsone was discovered&#xD;
      in experimentally-induced infections in mice. Since 1941, dapsone (as Promin®) is used with&#xD;
      great success in the therapy of leprosy. Dapsone is a mainstay in the treatment of leprosy,&#xD;
      being one of the components of the multidrug regimen advised by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1950, Esteves and Brandão confirmed the efficacy of the drug in patients with dermatitis&#xD;
      herpetiformis Duhring. Sneddon and Wilkinson in England reported a remission as caused by&#xD;
      dapsone in a patient with subcorneal pustulosis. The efficacy of dapsone in treatment of&#xD;
      pemphigus vulgaris was initially reported by Winkelmann and Roth in 1960.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After oral administration, dapsone is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract with bioavailability of more than 86 %. Maximum serum concentrations between 0,63 and&#xD;
      4,82 mg/l are attained within 2-8 hours after single doses between 50 mg and 300 mg. At&#xD;
      steady-state, the serum concentration fluctuate between 3,26 mg/l and 1,95 mg/l chronic&#xD;
      treatment with 100 mg dapsone once daily (s.i.d.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapsone is distributed to all organs, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and placenta and is&#xD;
      detected in breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 20% of dapsone is excreted unchanged into the urine, 70-85% as water-soluble&#xD;
      metabolites additionally to a small amount in feces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapsone is nearly completely metabolized in the liver and in activated polymorphic&#xD;
      neutrophils (PMN) and/or mononuclear cells. The major metabolic pathway in the liver is&#xD;
      N-acetylation by the polymorphic N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and N-oxidation by cytochrome&#xD;
      P-450 (CYP) enzymes. Major metabolites are monoacetyl-dapsone (MADDS) and dapsone&#xD;
      hydroxylamine (DDS-NOH). Dapsone undergoes enterohepatic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MADDS is subjected also to significant deacetylation. A constant equilibrium between&#xD;
      acetylation and deacetylation is reached within a few hours after the oral administration of&#xD;
      either dapsone or MADDS. The acetylation ratio shows a large interindividual variation,&#xD;
      ranging from 0.1 to 2.0. These ratios show a bimodal distribution pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetylation is not the rate-determining step in overall elimination of dapsone. The amount of&#xD;
      MADDS excreted in urine is very low because it is largely deacetylated to dapsone before&#xD;
      excretion into the urine. Between slow acetylators (SA) and rapid acetylators (RA), there are&#xD;
      no differences neither in dapsone serum concentrations nor any pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      dapsone. Also, the therapeutic response is the same in both acetylator phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, excretion of both MADDS and its conjugated derivatives is higher in RA. Therefore,&#xD;
      dapsone may be used for determination of the NAT2 phenotype even though these metabolites&#xD;
      represent only a very small fraction of the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MADDS is highly bound to plasma proteins (&gt; 98%), about 20-25 times more tightly than&#xD;
      dapsone. Presumably, the small fraction of unbound MADDS and its strong binding to plasma&#xD;
      proteins are reasons for its low availability in erythrocytes (erythrocyte/plasma ratio =&#xD;
      0.33). Tight protein binding is also the reason behind low glomerular filtration rate of the&#xD;
      metabolite; therefore the half-life for MADDS is approximately 20-25 hours, similar like for&#xD;
      dapsone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microsomal N-hydoxylation is the second major metabolic route of dapsone which seems to be&#xD;
      associated with hematological side effects of the drug. However, the data on excretion of&#xD;
      free and conjugated DDS-NOH vary widely in the literature. No reliable information is&#xD;
      available on excretion of hydroxylated MADDS compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of efficacy and safety of dapsone, most important is the generation of DDS-NOH, that&#xD;
      also occurs in inflamed lesions of the skin as mediated by activated PMN. Thus, over the&#xD;
      years, dapsone became a first-line drug in the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring,&#xD;
      Sneddon-Wilkinson-Syndrome and further bullous autoimmune dermatoses. Most recently was&#xD;
      found, that formation of DDS-NOH is mainly under control of CYP2C9 in-vitro.(Lit.) Because of&#xD;
      the known CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms (about 4-6 % are poor metabolizers, PM), efficacy of the&#xD;
      drug in bullous autoimmune dermatoses may be dependent on the metabolizer status of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize, that subjects which are slow acetylators of NAT2 (SA) but&#xD;
      extensive metabolizers of CYP2C9 (EM) may form significantly higher levels of the active&#xD;
      metabolite DDS-NOH than rapid acetylators of NAT2 (RA) being PM of CYP2C9 (PM).&#xD;
