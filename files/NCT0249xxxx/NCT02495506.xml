  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of Leukocyte reduced cold-stored platelet&#xD;
      transfusions used in treatment of immediate postoperative blood loss in patients undergoing&#xD;
      thoracic surgery in combination with extracorporal circulation. Today platelet concentrates&#xD;
      are stored at 22 degrees C .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, non-inferiority two-arm study. Aim of study is&#xD;
      to compare platelet function in bleeding patients transfused with leukoreduced platelet&#xD;
      concentrates stored cold (4 degrees C) and in room temperature (22 degrees C). Storage time&#xD;
      for RCT platelet concentrates are up to 7 days. Patients with expected time on extracorporal&#xD;
      circulation more than 120 minutes and/or medical platelet inhibitors will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet function will be assessed by use of Multiplate Aggregometry, Thromboelastography&#xD;
      (TEG) and/or Thromboelastometry (ROTEM). In addition post operative bleeding, and adverse&#xD;
      events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of recruitment of patients to RCT study of platelet stored cold for up to 7&#xD;
      days, a follow up prospective observational study of platelets stored cold for up to 14 days&#xD;
      is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additonal information 2019, May 03: This trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov with an&#xD;
      original plan to use non-inferiority testing of between-group differences in platelet&#xD;
      function. Due to lack of evidence needed to set acceptable tolerance margins for the&#xD;
      non-inferiority testing, independent reviewers with expertise in clinical trial design&#xD;
      recommended they be replaced by standard tests of superiority, commensurate with the early&#xD;
      phase of the trial. Further, post-operative chest tube drainage was chosen as the primary&#xD;
      outcome to better present the pilot study's focus on the control of clinically significant&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, non-inferiority two-arm study were Arm 1&#xD;
      patients will receive Leukocyte reduced cold-stored platelet concentrates and Arm 2 patients&#xD;
      will receive leukoreduced room-temperature-stored (22 degrees C) platelet concentrates.&#xD;
      Patients with expected time on extracorporal circulation more than 120 minutes and/or medical&#xD;
      platelet inhibitors will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients included is set to 20 patients in each arm, as there is not sufficient&#xD;
      information available in the literature to conduct power calculations. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      cold stored platelets are not inferior to room temperature platelet concentrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline patient data and information on intervention and post operative recovery will be&#xD;
      collected from the Medical journals together with information on transfusion episodes and&#xD;
      Blood Components. Blood samples will be retrieved from study participants at specific&#xD;
      intervals: baseline, immediately after surgery, at arrival at ICU, before and after (every)&#xD;
      platelet transfusion episode, 24 hours post operation, and if indicated, during hospital&#xD;
      stay. Blood samples will be investigated for platelet function, coagulation parameters,&#xD;
      hematologic parameters, and other risk factors for adverse events. If transfusion reactions&#xD;
      occur, additional test of patient and the Blood Component(s) transfused will be performed.&#xD;
      Samples will be collected and stored in the biobank for cytokines, complement and allergy&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of recruitment of patients to RCT study of platelet concentrates stored cold&#xD;
      for up to 7 days, a follow up prospective observational study of platelets stored cold for up&#xD;
      to 14 days is performed.&#xD;
