      The purpose of this single-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel control, phase 3 study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a rabies vaccine (Vero Cell) for human use in&#xD;
      healthy Chinese subjects aged 10-60 years, according to the Essen methods (1-1-1-1-1)&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two immunization arms. 1200 healthy subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1) to&#xD;
      receive an experimental vaccine or a parallel comparator vaccine. All of them will be&#xD;
      received five doses of rabies vaccine at day 0,3,7,14,28 according to the traditional Essen&#xD;
      methods (1-1-1-1-1) vaccination.&#xD;
