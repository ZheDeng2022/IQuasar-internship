      patients who will be recipients of a donation after brain death (DBD) donor kidney.&#xD;

      Phase 2: Sixty (60) adult subjects who will be recipients of a donation after brain death&#xD;
      (DBD) donor kidney and who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 within 48&#xD;
      hours prior to transplant surgery to receive: two infusions of SANGUINATE at a dose of 320&#xD;
      mg/kg or placebo on the day of surgery and approximately 24 hours after surgery. Patients&#xD;
      will be hospitalized for up to 5 days and the study duration will be 30 days. Results will be&#xD;
      used to inform the study design characteristics for Phase III, including sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: The same inclusion/exclusion requirements, dosing schedule, hospitalization stay&#xD;
      and outpatient visits as in Phase II with additional visits scheduled at Day 90, Day 180 and&#xD;
      Day 365. Study duration will be 365 days.&#xD;
