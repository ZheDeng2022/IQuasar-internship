    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized trial examining the administration of a combination of biguanide&#xD;
      metformin and atorvastatin (&quot;Lipitor&quot;) to men who are experiencing rising prostate-specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA) levels, despite having undergone radical therapy (surgery and/or radiation).&#xD;
