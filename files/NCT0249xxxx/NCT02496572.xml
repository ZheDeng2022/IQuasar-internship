  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a growing problem and few people have access to&#xD;
      adequate diagnosis and treatment. The current recommended treatment regimen for MDR TB has a&#xD;
      minimum of 20 months duration with high toxicity. Scale up of MDR TB treatment is associated&#xD;
      with high default rates, and experience in the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) programme in&#xD;
      Uzbekistan shows that the current standard treatment greatly limits the ability to scale up&#xD;
      to meet the high rates of MDR TB in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from Bangladesh in 2010 showed that a 9-month short-course regimen could achieve a&#xD;
      relapse-free cure rate of 88%. Several countries in West Africa started implementing similar&#xD;
      regimens with similar outcomes. Evidence of effectiveness of this shortened regimen among&#xD;
      regions with high second line drug use and resistance is still limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an observational study under programmatic conditions to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a shortened course MDR TB regimen in the high MDR/extensively drug&#xD;
      resistant (XDR) TB prevalence and high second-line drug resistance setting of Karakalpakstan,&#xD;
      Uzbekistan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective observational study has been designed. The study regimen is composed of an&#xD;
      intensive phase of at least 4 months duration of Pyrazinamide (Z) + Ethambutol (E) +&#xD;
      Isoniazid (H) + Moxifloxacin (Mfx) + Capreomycin (or Kanamycin/Amikacin) (Cm/Km/Am) +&#xD;
      Prothionamide (Pto) + Clofazimine (Cfz) and a continuation phase of oral drugs&#xD;
      Z-E-Mfx-Pto-Cfz. Patients will be followed up until the end of treatment and during 12 months&#xD;
      after treatment completion in order to evaluate the rate of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded in patient's clinical files and electronic databases and analyzed with&#xD;
      Stata 11.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a result of ongoing collaboration of MSF with the Ministry of Health in&#xD;
      Uzbekistan; results will be shared with the national health authorities, World Health&#xD;
      Organization and the rest of the scientific community and aim to influence and improve&#xD;
      treatment and care of patients with MDR TB.&#xD;
