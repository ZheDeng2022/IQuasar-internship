    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the use of a targeted therapy called LY SARM, which is an&#xD;
      investigational drug from a new class of molecules called Selective Androgen Receptor&#xD;
      Modulators (SARMs) as a possible improvement in quality of life for participants who have&#xD;
      undergone radical prostatectomy. Androgens are a group of hormones that play a role in male&#xD;
      traits and reproductive activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - LY2452473&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved LY SARM/LY2452473 as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying a new investigational drug called LY&#xD;
      SARM (LY2452473). Concerns about the potential adverse effects of testosterone on the&#xD;
      prostate have led to the development of molecules called SARMs (Selective Androgen Receptor&#xD;
      Modulators). This investigational drug may improve sexual function, quality of life, muscle&#xD;
      and bone mass in men with prostate cancer. This molecule was chosen because there is some&#xD;
      evidence that shows it may help to improve sexual function and aid in the improvement of&#xD;
      muscle mass while not having any influence on the prostate.&#xD;

        <description>Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a 50-item, comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. Of its four domains, the sexual domain (range 0-100) and hormonal domain (range 0-100) were utilized. The response for each item is standardized to a 0 to 100 scale. Higher score yields better quality of life.</description>

          <title>Change in Two Domains of Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)</title>
          <description>Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a 50-item, comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. Of its four domains, the sexual domain (range 0-100) and hormonal domain (range 0-100) were utilized. The response for each item is standardized to a 0 to 100 scale. Higher score yields better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change of 50 Meters Walk Tests- Unloaded /Loaded</title>
        <description>Tests of Physical Function and Task-Specific Performance measured by 50-meter timed walk + 20% load carry. Physical Function was evaluated using test of 50-meter loaded walking speed. One test consisted of walking 50 meters as rapidly as possible without running (unloaded) while the second test required participants to carry a load equivalent to 20% of their baseline body weight evenly distributed in two canvas tote bags(loaded). Time was measured electronically with a digital clock. Speed in meters per second is calculated by the following: 50/time.</description>

        <title>Change in Power of Stair Climbing Tests- Unloaded/Loaded</title>
        <description>Tests of Physical Function and Task-Specific Performance measured by Stair-climbing power +/- 20% load carry. Physical Function was evaluated using two tests of stair climb power using an indoor 12-step staircase. One test consisted of ascending the 12-steps as rapidly as possible without running (unloaded stair climb) while the second test required participants to carry a load equivalent to 20% of their baseline body weight evenly distributed in two canvas tote bags (loaded stair climb). Time to ascend the stairs was measured electronically with a digital clock and switch mats placed at the base of the steps and on the 12th step. Power in watts is calculated by the following: [body weight (kilograms) * distance (meters)/ (time/60)] /6.12.</description>
