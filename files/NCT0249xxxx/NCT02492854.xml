      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standard moist dressings and&#xD;
      PICO single-use negative pressure dressings in post-operative lower extremity bypass&#xD;
      patients. This study will compare the dressings' ability to decrease swelling, decrease&#xD;
      post-operative infection, and improve mobility and quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to participate in this study because they will undergo a lower&#xD;
      extremity bypass using the ipsilateral great saphenous vein. Subjects will then be randomized&#xD;
      to two post-operative treatment groups. One group will receive standard sterile gauze and the&#xD;
      other will receive PICO single-use negative pressure dressings. Both groups will be assessed&#xD;
      for study measures in follow-up visits as clinically indicated up to 1 year with the 30 day&#xD;
      timepoint as the primary outcome for study measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative infection after lower extremity bypass operations (LEB) can lead to&#xD;
      devastating consequences. A systematic review of lower-extremity (LE) re-vascularization&#xD;
      cases using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program&#xD;
      (ACS-NSQIP) found that 11.1% of patients were diagnosed with surgical site infections (SSI).&#xD;
      Another main issue in LEB is swelling, which occurs in about 70% of these patients and leads&#xD;
      to increased pressure along the leading edges of often-long wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide variety of methods to decrease these post-operative consequences are currently part of&#xD;
      standard practice. These techniques include covering incision sites with sterile gauze&#xD;
      dressing, elevating the leg, and wrapping with pressure dressings. Patients are then&#xD;
      instructed to change dressings themselves at home. However, SSI rates demonstrate that these&#xD;
      are only partially effective measures, and there remains room to improve post-operative&#xD;
      management of infection and swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), over the past several years, has provided a way to&#xD;
      post-operatively manage complex wounds (see device description). PICO single-use negative&#xD;
      pressure dressings have been examined in previous studies. However, these were either case&#xD;
      series, for chronic wounds, or for non-vascular procedures. The effectiveness of PICO versus&#xD;
      standard dressings in LEB has yet to be determined in a prospective, comparative study.&#xD;
      Results will indicate whether PICO should be included standard post-operative care of&#xD;
      lower-extremity bypass patients. This study is designed to compare PICO and standard care,&#xD;
      and determine which offers the best outcomes of decreased days to ambulation and&#xD;
      post-operative wound complications.&#xD;

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is lower-extremity bypass post-operative recovery that is free of major complications at 30 days post operation. This will be measured by a composite score based on three outcomes- leg swelling, ambulation, and infection (defined as antibiotics being prescribed). Each will be assigned a 0 if not present or a 1 if present and then summed for the composite score. The range can be from 0 to 3 with higher scores associated with more complications associated with surgical site infection.</description>

    <description>The Vascular Quality of Life (VascuQol) survey is a 25 item instrument that is used to assess function and quality of life. Every item has a 7-point response scale ranging from 1 (worst) to 7 (best). The range of scores is 25 to 175. Higher scores are associated with higher function and quality of life.</description>

    <description>Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), over the past several years, has provided a way to post-operatively manage complex wounds. This is a therapy with potential to decrease rates of SSIs post-LE bypass. Unlike standard gauze dressings, negative pressure wound therapy provides a sealed, moist environment and shuttles fluid away from the wound. A suctioning unit applies even, negative pressure (typically -80 to -120 mmHg) and exudate is suctioned and collected in a control unit. The investigators would like to investigate the efficacy of PICO (Smith&amp;Nephew), a single-use one-step wound dressing which is effective for 7 days. It is lightweight and uses a small hand-held vacuum pump, both of which allow for ease of use. PICO has been FDA-approved.</description>

        <title>Composite Score for Post-Operative Recovery</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is lower-extremity bypass post-operative recovery that is free of major complications at 30 days post operation. This will be measured by a composite score based on three outcomes- leg swelling, ambulation, and infection (defined as antibiotics being prescribed). Each will be assigned a 0 if not present or a 1 if present and then summed for the composite score. The range can be from 0 to 3 with higher scores associated with more complications associated with surgical site infection.</description>

PICO Single-Use Negative Pressure Dressings: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), over the past several years, has provided a way to post-operatively manage complex wounds. This is a therapy with potential to decrease rates of SSIs post-LE bypass. Unlike standard gauze dressings, negative pressure wound therapy provides a sealed, moist environment and shuttles fluid away from the wound. A suctioning unit applies even, negative pressure (typically -80 to -120 mmHg) and exudate is suctioned and collected in a control unit. The investigators would like to investigate the efficacy of PICO (Smith&amp;Nephew), a single-use one-step wound dressing which is effective for 7 days. It is lightweight and uses a small hand-held vacuum pump, both of which allow for ease of use. PICO has been FDA-approved.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The Covid pause halted participant enrollment and the PI decided not to proceed with the major amendment and switching to the new generation of the device due to lack of funding. This resulted in study termination, a small number of subjects for analysis, and incomplete data collection for the outcome measure designed to be collected at 1 year.</limitations_and_caveats>
