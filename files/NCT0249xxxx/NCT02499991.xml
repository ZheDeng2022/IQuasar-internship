      Research shows that there are a plenitude of interventions that can be used to enhance memory&#xD;
      for older adults; however, the evidence as to whether these interventions enhance memory for&#xD;
      daily activities is equivocal. The purpose of this pilot study is to test a memory&#xD;
      intervention that is potentially useful in everyday life. Objectives of the pilot study are:&#xD;
      1) to examine the feasibility of the intervention (e.g., ease of use of materials provided);&#xD;
      and 2) to gain preliminary evidence of the intervention's impact on recall of recent daily&#xD;
      social events. Participants will be 20 cognitively healthy (i.e. not cognitively impaired)&#xD;
      older adults, with 10 participants randomly assigned to either an intervention or control&#xD;
      group, respectively. The study will consist of: a) a pre-training session; b) seven days of&#xD;
      independent memory training; and c) a post-training session. The pre-training session will&#xD;
      involve a test that measures recall of daily social events from the previous week. This will&#xD;
      be followed by seven days of training for recall of daily social events. During the seven&#xD;
      days, the intervention group will perform daily memory tasks using self-instructional&#xD;
      materials given to them by the researcher, whereas the control group will use their own&#xD;
      strategies for remembering social events that they are involved in during the week. The&#xD;
      post-training session will occur after the seven days and will involve the same test as the&#xD;
      pre-training session that measures recall of social events from the previous week. The&#xD;
      hypotheses are that: a) recall of social events will be higher for the post-training test&#xD;
      than in the pre-training test and; b) recall will be better for in the intervention group&#xD;
      than the control group. The ease of use of the memory recall materials provided to the&#xD;
      intervention group will be assessed in interviews.&#xD;

      Method Participants The sample will consist of 20 cognitively healthy older adults (aged 55&#xD;
      or older) recruited from the Centre on Aging participant database. The participant database&#xD;
      has been approved by the Health REB (REB #HS14652). Individuals who are in the participant&#xD;
      database have given their consent to be contacted by researchers about their willingness to&#xD;
      participate in specific research projects. Names of individuals are provided to researchers&#xD;
      by the Centre on Aging upon submission of REB approval and the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials Questionnaires Pre-training Questionnaire - demographics. The questionnaire will&#xD;
      consist of general questions about the participants. Items will include gender, age, and&#xD;
      experience with memory training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-training memory recall test. The questionnaire will ask participants to describe social&#xD;
      events they did during the previous week. This questionnaire will be given in the&#xD;
      pre-training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-training memory recall test. The questionnaire will ask participants to describe social&#xD;
      events they did during the previous week. This questionnaire will be given in the&#xD;
      post-training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-training questionnaire. The questionnaire will ask participants about their thoughts&#xD;
      regarding the format and usefulness of the instruction materials. For example, participants&#xD;
      will be asked if they thought the study helped them remember social events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group materials Memory tasks - instructions. This document instructs&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group on how to use the memory tasks for daily social&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory tasks - forms. Each day has a separate document that has a) a diary of social events;&#xD;
      and b) tasks to review the week's social events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory tasks - forms example. This is an example of the above form filled out to help explain&#xD;
      how memory tasks are to be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This study involves an experimental design, whereby participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups, an intervention group (n=10) and a control group (n=10). The&#xD;
      independent variable is, therefore, the presence or absence of the daily memory recording&#xD;
      task for social events. The dependent variables are: (a) the changes in performance on the&#xD;
      written recall tests from pre- to post-training; and (b) the difference between the groups&#xD;
      (i.e., Control vs. intervention group) on performance of memory of social events. Information&#xD;
      about how useful the intervention materials were will be used in a more qualitative way to&#xD;
      help improve the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The study will consist of: a) a pre-training session; b) seven days of independent&#xD;
      memory training (intervention group) or usual way of remembering social events (control&#xD;
      group); and c) a post-training session. The pre-training session will involve a test that&#xD;
      measures recall of social events from the previous week. This will be followed by seven days&#xD;
      of training for recall of daily social events. The post-training session will occur after the&#xD;
      seven days and involve the same test as the pre-training session that measures recall of&#xD;
      social events from the previous week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-training session. There will be separate pre-training sessions for each individual&#xD;
      participant with the principal investigator either at the University of Manitoba (Bannatyne&#xD;
      campus or Fort Garry campus) or, if participants prefers, in his or her own home. During the&#xD;
      pre-training session, the principal investigator will provide an informed consent form to the&#xD;
      participant. The principal investigator will describe the project, review the consent form&#xD;
      and answer any questions. Once the participant provides written consent, a demographics&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered. A pre-training memory recall test will also be done that&#xD;
      asks participants to list social events they did during the previous week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven day training week. Materials will be provided to the intervention group during the&#xD;
      pre-training session. Materials will include: a) instructions for memory tasks; b) forms for&#xD;
      each day for diaries and tasks; and c) an example of the form filled out. The control group&#xD;
      will not receive materials and will have to rely on their own memory strategies to remember&#xD;
      social events during the 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-training session. There will be separate post-training sessions for each individual&#xD;
      participant with the principal investigator either at the University of Manitoba (Bannatyne&#xD;
      campus or Fort Garry campus) or in the participants' homes. A post-training memory recall&#xD;
      test will be done that asks participants to list social events that they did on the previous&#xD;
      week (i.e., this is the same test that was used in pre-training session). The post-training&#xD;
      questionnaire will then also be administered to each participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Data will be entered into the computer. The computer file will not contain&#xD;
      any names or addresses and each participant data will be identified by a unique participant&#xD;
      ID only. Consent forms will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in Dr. Menec's research&#xD;
      space (S112 Medical Services Bldg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses A total score of all social events recalled will be created. Scores will be&#xD;
      calculated by the following scheme: a) one point for remembering an event; and b) one point&#xD;
      for remembering the day of the event. Other scoring approaches will also be considered; for&#xD;
      example, assigning a higher score if more detail about a person met is remembered. SPSS will&#xD;
      be used to test hypotheses using two independent group t-tests. The use of t-tests is&#xD;
      justified because a) the investigators can compare scoring on pre- and post-session memory&#xD;
      recall tests; b) the investigators have an appropriate sample size of 20; and c) the&#xD;
      investigators have two independent groups. The usefulness of the memory intervention&#xD;
      materials will be examined more qualitatively by looking at responses to each of the&#xD;
      questions and participants' comments.&#xD;
