  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see whether the use of DIANATAL during active labor, reduces&#xD;
      the rates of episiotomy and vaginal tears.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk for vaginal tears during birth is about 20%. These tears require surgical repair,&#xD;
      are painful and make the recovery of the mother more difficult. Less commonly there is a risk&#xD;
      of tear infection and regional scarring that make intercourse more difficult. Moreover,&#xD;
      according to some studies, it appears that there is a link between damage to the pelvic floor&#xD;
      and vagina during labor and Urinary incontinence in stress later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear that there is an advantage for the prevention of vaginal tears. Dianatal is a gel&#xD;
      preparation, designed for use in births, in order to reduce the rate of vaginal tears and&#xD;
      possibly shorten the second stage of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested and found that using the gel reduces friction on tissue in processes simulating&#xD;
      pressure of birth and therefore it is less likely to see tears in the vaginal tissue when&#xD;
      using gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product is approved for use by the ministry of health, was safety approved by regulatory&#xD;
      bodies in Switzerland - the country of production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, there is only one study published in the professional literature. The study found&#xD;
      that using the gel at birth, reduces the duration of the second stage (full opening to the&#xD;
      birth of the fetus) and reduces the rate of tears. The aim of the work was to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of the product on the duration of labor. Women on their first birth, were divided&#xD;
      randomly into two groups, one was treated with Dianatal from the stage of active labor, and&#xD;
      the other group did not receive any treatment. In each research group were about ninety&#xD;
      women. This is the single research in one population. In addition, the research group is too&#xD;
      small to have statistical power in order to answer issues related to the number of vaginal&#xD;
      tears and the need to perform episiotomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering such a significant issue for a woman who is giving birth and for the medical&#xD;
      staff dealing with the newborn and in light of the minority research information on this&#xD;
      subject, it is clear that there is room for further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruit to the research when arriving in the&#xD;
      delivery room. They will sign the consent form and will be computerized randomized to one of&#xD;
      two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group - using DIANATAL according to manufacturer's protocol from their being in&#xD;
      active labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group - women with the same conditions that will not be using this medicine that&#xD;
      is checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected: medical background, pregnancy complications,&#xD;
      preparations that were used to reduce the risk of birth tears before birth (perineal massage,&#xD;
      EPINO), the duration of the stages in labor, use of epidural, neonatal weight, whether&#xD;
      episiotomy or vaginal tears that required surgical intervention ( sewing) were done, post&#xD;
      delivery process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison between the two groups will be made respectively with the results of the study&#xD;
      that were defined.&#xD;
