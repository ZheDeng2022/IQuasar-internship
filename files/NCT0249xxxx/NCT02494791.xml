      This study will maximize identification of women with Lynch Syndrome using an enhanced&#xD;
      screening strategy to identify those at risk. These women will be referred to genetic&#xD;
      counselling for testing and those found to have Lynch Syndrome will be asked to invite first&#xD;
      degree relatives to participate and undergo genetic testing for Lynch Syndrome. Screening&#xD;
      guidelines and risk reducing surgery options for participants found to have Lynch Syndrome&#xD;
      will be reinforced by the study and adherence to these guidelines will be assessed annually&#xD;
      for ten years following Lynch Syndrome diagnosis to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of this enhanced screening approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lynch Syndrome increases an individual's risk for several cancers, such as colorectal,&#xD;
      endometrial (EC) and certain types of ovarian cancer (OC). Lynch Syndrome is caused by&#xD;
      inherited changes in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. In this study we will establish the&#xD;
      proportion of EC and OC patients with Lynch Syndrome. We will screen all EC and OC patients&#xD;
      by performing MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) on their surgical specimen. These data will then&#xD;
      be used along with family history data to determine which women are at high risk of Lynch&#xD;
      Syndrome. We will facilitate the referral of all women at risk for Lynch Syndrome to genetic&#xD;
      counselling on behalf of their treating physician. First degree relatives of those patients&#xD;
      found to have Lynch Syndrome who consent to participate in the study will also be referred to&#xD;
      genetics by the study PI. We will encourage all participants found to have Lynch Syndrome to&#xD;
      attend regular colonoscopy screening to prevent colorectal cancer, and (for females with&#xD;
      Lynch Syndrome) consideration of gynecologic risk reducing surgery to prevent endometrial and&#xD;
      ovarian cancers. We will assess adherence to Lynch Syndrome screening guidelines in this&#xD;
      population and will determine if our universal screening strategy is feasible and&#xD;
      cost-effective for widespread implementation across Canada in an effort to prevent Lynch&#xD;
      Syndrome associated cancers in women and their families. In addition to this, consenting&#xD;
      patients may provide blood and tumour tissue samples for sequencing studies which will&#xD;
      investigate the genetic basis for Lynch Syndrome and shed light on cases of MMR loss in the&#xD;
      absence of germline mutation.&#xD;

    <description>Participants found to have Lynch Syndrome will be followed after diagnosis and asked to update the study annually with information about any colorectal cancer screening (colonoscopy) and/or gynecologic risk-reducing surgery they've undergone. This information will be used to assess the success of the enhanced universal screening protocol in helping treat pre-cancerous lesions and therefore prevent a possible cancer as well as aid in detection of early malignancies that otherwise may have gone undetected.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Lynch Syndrome in an unselected group of women with endometrial and non-serous ovarian cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This study will add data about the number of Lynch Syndrome cases among a large cohort of endometrial cancer patients in Canada, adding to previous work. This will be the first prospective study to assess Lynch Syndrome incidence in non-serous, non-mucinous ovarian cancer patients in Canada.</description>

    <measure>Discovery of novel genetic mutations and molecular events in unexplained MMR loss (Lynch-like Syndrome)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This study will investigate tumour samples from women with unexplained MMR loss (MMR IHC deficient without a germline mutation) to probe what other factors may contribute to Lynch-like Syndrome. Currently these patients are believed to have an intermediate risk for Lynch-associated cancers and are counselled accordingly. Further investigation into the biology of this condition may yield more effective strategies for stratifying and managing risk for Lynch-like Syndrome patients.</description>
