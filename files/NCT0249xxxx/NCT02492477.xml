    <textblock>
      The benefits and risks of flushing or not flushing the non-used PORT-A-CATH® in cancer&#xD;
      patients and the time interval of eventual PORT-A-CATH® flushing are currently unknown. The&#xD;
      manufacturers of PORT-A-CATH® recommend regular flushings every 4 weeks. In clinical&#xD;
      practice, the intervals are usually at least three months. Regular flushing might lead to a&#xD;
      decreased risk of PORT-A-CATH® thrombosis, but may also lead to an increased infection or&#xD;
      thrombosis rate and patients discomfort. Therefore, this study investigates the safety of not&#xD;
      flushing the PORT-A-CATH® for 6 or 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently it is unknown if flushing a non-used PORT-A-CATH® every 4 weeks is a valid strategy&#xD;
      to preserve its functioning. Even more, decision to keep the PORT-A-CATH® after completion of&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy cannot be based on profound patient information as there exist hardly any&#xD;
      data regarding PORT-A-CATH® related complications of non-used PORT-A-CATH®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed prospective, two arm trial aims to investigate if no flushing of a non-used&#xD;
      PORT-A-CATH® over a period of one year has equal PORT-A-CATH® related complications compared&#xD;
      to flushing the PORT-A-CATH® every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial also aims to examine the frequencies of PORT-A-CATH® related complications&#xD;
      in non-used PORT-A-CATH®. The authors put up the hypothesis that there will be fewer&#xD;
      port-a-cath related infections in the experimental arms compared to the infection rate&#xD;
      mentioned in the literature up to 27 %, since the puncture of the PORT-A-CATH® and the&#xD;
      administration of fluids are the main causes of infection.&#xD;
