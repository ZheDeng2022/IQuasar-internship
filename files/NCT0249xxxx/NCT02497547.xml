  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of postmenopausal women frequently suffer from atrophic vaginitis or vaginal&#xD;
      atrophy with symptoms including vaginal dryness, irritation, burning, itching or discomfort.&#xD;
      Vaginal atrophy is a consequence of the lining tissue of the vagina becoming thinner, drier,&#xD;
      and less elastic due to lack of estrogen. In addition, vaginal atrophy is associated with an&#xD;
      increased pH, which creates an environment more susceptible to infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopausal hormone therapy is a common treatment for vaginal atrophy. However, menopausal&#xD;
      hormone therapy has been shown to coincide with an increased incidence of breast cancer,&#xD;
      heart attack and stroke. Some women experience adverse reactions such as uterine bleeding,&#xD;
      perineal pain, and breast pain with menopausal hormone therapy. Many women are also reluctant&#xD;
      to initiate estrogen treatment, due to a general negative view of menopausal hormone therapy&#xD;
      in the society. There are also many contraindicated conditions like undiagnosed vaginal&#xD;
      bleeding, thromboembolic disease, breast cancer, other estrogen-sensitive cancers, or liver&#xD;
      disease. Women suffering from vaginal atrophy and presenting with these conditions have&#xD;
      extremely limited options for effective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin is a peptide hormone, normally released into the circulation via the pituitary.&#xD;
      Oxytocin has been shown in vitro to exert positive effects on the proliferation of human&#xD;
      vaginal mucosal cells from postmenopausal women. Local application of oxytocin, in the form&#xD;
      of a vaginal gel, Vagitocin, has been investigated in previous studies on postmenopausal&#xD;
      women, as a new effective and safe option for the treatment of vaginal atrophy. Vagitocin&#xD;
      appeared to reverse the manifestation of vaginal atrophy by stimulating vaginal mucosal&#xD;
      growth, reducing symptoms of vaginal atrophy and increasing the patients' wellbeing and&#xD;
      quality of life. Overall, treatment with Vagitocin was safe and well tolerated by the&#xD;
      subjects in the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the clinical efficacy of Vagitocin as a potential treatment for postmenopausal&#xD;
      women suffering from moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy, vaginal&#xD;
      irritation/itching and vaginal discomfort and/or pain associated with sexual activity will be&#xD;
      explored. In addition, the dose relationship and lowest effective dose of Vagitocin will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
