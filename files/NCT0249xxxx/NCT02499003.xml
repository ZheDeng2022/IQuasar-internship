      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate of Obinutuzumab (GA101) in&#xD;
      combination with Pixantrone in patients with relapsed aggressive B-cell lymphoma. 70 patients&#xD;
      with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma grade IIIB or transformed indolent&#xD;
      lymphoma will receive up to 6 cycles of the described combination regimen. Follow up visits&#xD;
      are scheduled for up to 3 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with multiple relapsed aggressive lymphoma or refractory lymphoma life expectancy&#xD;
      is short. Without potent treatment options the remaining life span can be measured in weeks&#xD;
      to a few months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an increasing number of reports have shown that either single agent use or the&#xD;
      incorporation of potentially more potent agents or new approaches aiming at the inhibition of&#xD;
      lymphoma specific pathways may help to overcome the current stagnation in the improvement of&#xD;
      first and second line therapies. Surprisingly, little efforts have been undertaken to&#xD;
      identify optimal standard dose backbone regimens based on currently available and novel&#xD;
      drugs, which ideally would combine activity with reasonable safety and tolerability which&#xD;
      allows the addition of targeted drugs in the future. Therefore this trial aims to test&#xD;
      prospectively one potential combination to evaluate its potency in patients not suitable for&#xD;
      intensive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obinutuzumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which has shown clinical efficacy even in&#xD;
      patients failing Rituximab pre-treatment and therefore is an attractive combination partner&#xD;
      within chemo-immunotherapy regimen. Pixantrone belongs to the most potent class of cytostatic&#xD;
      drugs for the treatment of lymphoma. Given the proven efficacy of both drugs in relapsed&#xD;
      aggressive lymphoma as well as the side effect profiles of both drugs, combination treatment&#xD;
      seems sufficiently safe and promises significant efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, non-randomized trial to evaluate the overall&#xD;
      response rate of Obinutuzumab (GA101) in combination with Pixantrone in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed aggressive B-cell lymphoma. The trial consists of a 28-days screening period, a&#xD;
      treatment-period of up to 6 cycles of the combination regiment, including an interim staging&#xD;
      prior to cycle 4 and an end of treatment visit 4-6 weeks after the last study-medication&#xD;
      application. The response to treatment is measured by results of computer tomography (CT)&#xD;
      after cycle 6 or at the individual end of treatment. Structured follow up visits are&#xD;
      scheduled for 2 years, afterwards patients will be followed for survival and progression via&#xD;
      a simplified survey until the end of the trial.&#xD;
