      Using Virtual Reality and Robotics Technologies for Vocational Evaluation, Training and&#xD;
      Placement (VR4VR) is a project that incorporates Virtual Reality into job training to&#xD;
      increase job opportunities for people who have physical or mental disabilities. The&#xD;
      investigators are using Virtual Reality and robotics for job evaluation, training and&#xD;
      placement of people with disabilities. The investigators' goal is to assess and train people&#xD;
      in a safe, adaptable, and fun virtual environment similar to a video game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an interventional study with three target populations: autism spectrum disorder,&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury, and severe mobility and manipulation impairments. The prototype&#xD;
      system allows for a wide range of environments with the vocational evaluator easily&#xD;
      controlling the virtual experience, while the job seekers interact realistically.&#xD;

      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant takes part in this study, they will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arrive at the Rehabilitation Robotics &amp; Prosthetics Testbed (RRT) building at the times&#xD;
           agreed to between the participant, the job coach and the key research personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use a virtual reality system that is like a large video game with the job coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete some skill tasks in the virtual world video game:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cleaning skills such as vacuum cleaning, mopping and litter collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Loading virtual boxes into back of a virtual truck.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fulfilling orders and deliveries with tangible boxes in a virtual warehouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Navigating to different checkpoints in an outdoor virtual environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Money management skills such as recognizing coin and bill amounts, counting money&#xD;
                and giving correct amount of change to virtual customers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Communicating with virtual characters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These tasks will take place in non-real virtual environments such as: warehouse,&#xD;
           grocery, parking lot, and outside.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The job coach or counselor will be with the participant just as they would in a&#xD;
           traditional job training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The researchers will ask the participant questions about what they liked and disliked&#xD;
           about the virtual reality system video game. These questions can be asked directly or&#xD;
           via a form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be 15 minutes break times every hour and the total time will be equal to the&#xD;
           participant's normal job coach interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be asked to participate no more than 5 hours each day, up to 15&#xD;
           days. Number of training days will be decided by the participant, the job coach, and the&#xD;
           research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data related to the time and the performance from the start to the end of each task will&#xD;
           be recorded at the background automatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Audio/visual and/or video documentation of the study may be recorded. Video and&#xD;
           photographic recordings will be used only to aid in presenting the study for academic&#xD;
           purposes. All information will be kept anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects' screening will be performed by the subjects' therapists beforehand, who will&#xD;
           decide whether the subject is eligible for this study or not, based on the&#xD;
           investigators' inclusion/exclusion requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total Number of Participants: Up to 100 people (Up to 50 individuals with disabilities&#xD;
           and Up to 50 healthy individuals) will take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A $50 gift card will be given to each participant on their first training session as a thank&#xD;
      you gift and an incentive to participate in the study.&#xD;
