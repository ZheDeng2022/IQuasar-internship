      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether a single dose combination of OZ439 (Artefenomel)/FQ (Ferroquine) was an&#xD;
      efficacious treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  To determine the time to relief of fever and parasite clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of OZ439/FQ in adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of OZ439 in plasma, FQ and its active metabolite&#xD;
           SSR97213 in blood.&#xD;

TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment phase that was defined as the time from the start of the first dose of double-blind drug administration up to the Day 63. AE of special interest (AESI) was an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor's product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor was required.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Study conducted at 12 active sites in 7 countries. Total of 806 participants were screened between 25 July 2015 and 22 July 2019, of which 377 were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms (via Integrated Web Recognition System using permuted block randomization schedules). 429 participants failed screening mainly due to meeting exclusion criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In each arm, participants were divided in 4 cohorts (C):C1 (greater than [&gt;] 14 years (yrs) to less than [&lt;] 70 yrs); C2 (&gt;5 yrs to less than or equal to [&lt;=] 14 yrs );C3 (&gt;2 yrs to &lt;=5 yrs); C4 (&gt;6 months to &lt;=2 yrs). Day 0 (drug administration day, per protocol) was Day 1 for safety reporting as per Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Crude ACPR was defined as negative parasitemia at Day 63, irrespective of AT, in participants not meeting any criteria of ETF: DS or SM at Day 1, 2 or 3 in presence of parasitemia; or Day 2 parasite count &gt; Day 0 irrespective of AT; or parasitemia at Day 3 with AT &gt;=37.5°C; or parasite count on Day 3 &gt;=25% on Day 0, or LCF: DS/ SM in presence of parasitemia between Day 4 and 63; or presence of parasitemia and AT &gt;=37.5°C between Day 4 and 63 or, LPF: presence of parasitemia between Day 7 and 63 and AT &lt;37.5°C or having rescue therapy for malaria. PCR-adjusted ACPR applied to recrudescence (appearance of asexual parasites after clearance of initial infection with a genotype identical to that of parasites present at Baseline), excluding participants with re-infection, whereas crude ACPR did not distinguish re-infection (new clone of parasite) or recrudescence.</description>

        <description>FCT was defined as the time (in hours) from start of study drug administration to the first assessment of adjusted body temperature &lt;37.5°C, confirmed by second assessment, taken within &gt;=6 to &lt;=12 hours of the first. Only participants with fever (adjusted body temperature &gt;=37.5°C present at Baseline) and did not receive paracetamol on day of study drug administration until 96 hours after study drug administration were included in FCT analysis. Participants with no event were censored at the time of study completion, premature study discontinuation, including switch to established anti-malarial treatment or start of any other treatment with anti-malarial activity, whichever was earliest. Kaplan-Meier method was used for the estimation. Here, &quot;overall number of participants analyzed&quot;=participants who were included in the analysis of below reported results which consisted of both, who had the event, plus those who were censored.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and did not necessarily had to have a causal relationship with the treatment. SAEs were any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment phase that was defined as the time from the start of the first dose of double-blind drug administration up to the Day 63. AE of special interest (AESI) was an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor's product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor was required.</description>
