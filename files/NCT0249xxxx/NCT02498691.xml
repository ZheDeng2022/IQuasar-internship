  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a benign gynecological disease, characterized by the presence of&#xD;
      endometrium-like tissue outside the uterine cavity that affect up to 10-15% of women in&#xD;
      reproductive age worldwide, with an extensive impact on women's wellbeing and their&#xD;
      reproductive life. Endometriosis lesions are heterogeneous and three phenotypes of the&#xD;
      disease are well recognized and are fundamentally different from each other: superficial&#xD;
      peritoneal endometriosis (peritoneal implants), ovarian endometrioma (cyst ovarian&#xD;
      endometriosis), and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (invasive nodules greater than 5 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed a prospective multicenter comparative study to assess the&#xD;
      maternal and fetal risks related to endometriosis during pregnancy, regarding disease&#xD;
      phenotype, This study will evaluate with sufficient power the risk of prematurity and&#xD;
      obstetrical complications associated with endometriosis according to disease phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to provide new informations to pregnant women with endometriosis, guide the&#xD;
      monitoring of pregnancy, optimize management strategies based on the nature of complications&#xD;
      and ultimately to improve the health of women and their unborn child&#xD;

      Design selected and justification: the study ENDOBST is a&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exposed / unexposed type&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in superiority&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with two comparative groups (endometriosis / without endometriosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ratio of distribution of subjects in study groups = 1: 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDOBST is a comparative prospective multicenter study presentation exposed - unexposed type.&#xD;
      The study aims to compare the outcomes of pregnancy in the whole exposed group to controls&#xD;
      and then according to the three disease phenotype (superficial, ovarian, and deep&#xD;
      endometriosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endobst aims to test the hypothesis that women with endometriosis have an increased risk of&#xD;
      preterm delivery (primary endpoint) and an increased risk of pregnancy complications&#xD;
      (secondary endpoints) when compared to diseases-free women. Comparisons will be performed&#xD;
      according to disease phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These analyzes will be conducted after taking into account factors likely to influence the&#xD;
      occurrence of preterm birth such as particularly social characteristics (education level,&#xD;
      employment status), age and body mass index of women, pathological medical and obstetrical&#xD;
      history and behavioral factors (tobacco).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyzes will be conducted to investigate the link between endometriosis, and other&#xD;
      adverse pregnancy outcomes (premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth restriction),&#xD;
      complications related to the surgical treatment endometriosis prior to pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the previous surgical treatment, the subgroup of women operated for their&#xD;
      endometriosis will be compared to the subgroup of non-operated endometriosis in women and&#xD;
      free subset of women. Particular attention will be paid to the phenotype of endometriosis and&#xD;
      the nature of previous surgical treatment for pregnancy to control bias indication inherent&#xD;
      in observational studies. These associations will be studied from multivariate regression&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
