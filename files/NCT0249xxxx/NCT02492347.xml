    <textblock>
      Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are a group of antidepressants that suppress&#xD;
      the re-absorption of a chemical called Serotonin in the brain, and improve mood. SSRI use in&#xD;
      the treatment of mental health problems has increased greatly since their introduction in the&#xD;
      1980's. When given in pregnancy they cause less fetal effects than other antidepressants.&#xD;
      However they are still known to cause premature birth, heart defects and withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      in the baby. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in up to 30% of exposed babies, where as heart&#xD;
      defects have been found to increase by 2-3 times against the normal rate of 1%. There is very&#xD;
      limited information available, but it is also thought it may cause lengthening of a certain&#xD;
      portion of the heart beat, the QT interval, which has been shown to lead to sudden death in&#xD;
      adults. The QT interval will be looked at in this study, comparing babies exposed to SSRIs in&#xD;
      pregnancy with unexposed babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be based in the United Kingdom (UK), at the Maternity Unit of a District&#xD;
      General Hospital, and will be carried out over 12-18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of babies whose mothers took SSRIs whilst pregnant will have an Electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) done when they are 2-3 days old. These will be compared with babies whose mothers did&#xD;
      not, but whose babies were still in hospital because they were at risk of having an&#xD;
      infection, but were found to be healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hopes to see whether there is a link between SSRI use in pregnancy and lengthening&#xD;
      of the QT interval and if so, extra surveillance may be considered for this group of babies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out at the maternity unit of the local district general hospital.&#xD;
      It is normal practice for women who have taken SSRIs in pregnancy to deliver at the local&#xD;
      district general hospital, rather than at home or in the community, due to the possible&#xD;
      problems with their babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently it is standard practice for a plan of care for after the baby is born (an ALERT) to&#xD;
      be generated whilst the woman is pregnant. The ALERT form is developed by specialist nurses,&#xD;
      Advanced Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (ANNPs) and Doctors specialising in newborn babies. The&#xD;
      ALERT form details the recommended place of birth; length of expected hospital stay; known&#xD;
      side effects of SSRIs; the monitoring that is done after birth and why; and whether&#xD;
      breastfeeding is advised. This is returned to community midwifery staff to discuss with the&#xD;
      woman ahead of delivery. When the woman who has taken SSRIs in her pregnancy comes to the&#xD;
      maternity unit to deliver the ALERT form is activated. After birth she will be assessed by&#xD;
      maternity staff and ANNPs to see if her baby is suitable for the study, and if so, she will&#xD;
      be given an information leaflet and invitation letter when her baby is 12 hours old by these&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other group of mothers that will be asked for the participation of their babies, will be&#xD;
      those who require treatment with intravenous antibiotics for at least 36 hours, having been&#xD;
      identified as being at risk of having an infection within 12 hours of being born. An&#xD;
      infection marker, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in their blood is measured, and if this remains&#xD;
      normal after 18 hours and the baby is suitable for the study, the mother will be given an&#xD;
      information leaflet and invitation letter by maternity staff/ ANNPs. Antibiotics will&#xD;
      continue to be given to the baby for at least 36- 47 hours until a blood test shows whether&#xD;
      they have an infection or not. If they don't have an infection and are healthy, they will be&#xD;
      considered for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of babies are regularly monitored by the staff in the maternity unit to make sure&#xD;
      that any problems they have are acted on quickly. Both groups of babies would normally be in&#xD;
      hospital for 36- 48 hours for this monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the babies in both groups are 48-72 hours old, the ANNPs will ask the mother if she is&#xD;
      happy for her baby to have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to look at their heart beat pattern.&#xD;
      After consideration time, a consent form is signed, a data collection sheet completed, and&#xD;
      the ECG is carried out on the baby. This will happen on the ward so there is minimal&#xD;
      disruption to the mother and baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECG machine used is very accurate so if it shows the heart beat pattern is normal, the&#xD;
      parents are told the result and can go home. The ANNPs and Doctors specialising in the care&#xD;
      of newborn babies will check the result within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the ECG machine says the heart beat pattern is not normal, then the baby remains in&#xD;
      hospital, whilst the result is checked by the ANNPs and the Doctors specialising in the care&#xD;
      of newborn babies, as soon as possible after it is taken. If the heart beat reading is&#xD;
      abnormal, the ANNPs and Doctors specialising in the care of newborn babies will talk to the&#xD;
      parents about further tests and other monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the confirmed ECG result is known before discharge home, the General Practitioner (GP) /&#xD;
      Community staff will be told of the study and the result, on the hospital discharge letter&#xD;
      the mother takes home for them. If the family have gone home before this happens they will&#xD;
      receive a confirmed normal result in the post. The confirmed result will also be added to the&#xD;
      electronic hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to give statistically significant results, the study will be carried out over 12 -18&#xD;
      months, and involve 121 babies in each group. After 50 babies have had an ECG, the results&#xD;
      will be reviewed to see what results are being seen and to see if the study is following the&#xD;
      original plan/ time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistician helped to determine how many babies would be needed for the study to show a&#xD;
      difference between the two groups. However even if the difference is less than expected, the&#xD;
      study may still point to the possibility of an association and provide useful data for future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
