  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the Smartphone electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
      is an acceptable replacement for a standard ECG in the identification of ST Elevation&#xD;
      Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toward this objective, this study involves the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain simultaneous recordings of a standard 12-lead ECG and the iPhone &quot;12-lead&#xD;
           equivalent&quot; ECG on patients presenting with chest pain in which the STEMI protocol was&#xD;
           activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain simultaneous recordings of a standard 12-lead ECG and the iPhone &quot;12-lead&#xD;
           equivalent&quot; ECG on patients presenting to the Emergency Department for evaluation of&#xD;
           chest pain, not necessarily presenting with STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reading of ECGs (standard 12-lead and iPhone) by three independent cardiologists, who&#xD;
           are blinded to the initial clinical ECG readings, the type of ECG equipment used, and&#xD;
           the patient's clinical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the operational feasibility of using the Smartphone to obtain &quot;12-lead&#xD;
           equivalent&quot; ECG recordings in patients suspected to have STEMI, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the possibility of pooling the data obtained from this study with data from&#xD;
           other institutions conducting identical studies, and developing a future IRB-approved&#xD;
           protocol and statistical analysis plan to compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
           predictive value and the negative predictive power of the iPhone ECG, using a paired&#xD;
           standard 12-lead ECG as the gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no therapeutic interventions. A single research-related procedure will be&#xD;
      required, i.e. an iPhone ECG. Effort will be made to ensure that the performance of this&#xD;
      procedure will not delay any treatment and/or diagnostic procedures that are part of usual or&#xD;
      specialized care that the patient requires. Effort will be made to enroll 1 STEMI patient for&#xD;
      every 2 non-STEMI patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male or female &gt;= 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained&#xD;
             prior to initiation of any study procedures (patient or legally acceptable&#xD;
             representative).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms of chest pain upon presentation at the Intermountain Medical Center Emergency&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or refusal of the patient and/or the patient's legally-acceptable&#xD;
             representative to provide written informed consent for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other conditions that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
             Co-Investigator(s) may increase risk to the subject and/or compromise the quality of&#xD;
