  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients are often ventilated in dedicated critical care units to provide&#xD;
      respiratory support. Despite best practice patients can often develop a condition called&#xD;
      adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterised by deterioration in their&#xD;
      respiratory function, and changes on chest x-ray. The correct management for ARDS is&#xD;
      identifying the underlying condition causing the deterioration and identifying appropriate&#xD;
      targeted therapy. One such cause is pneumonia, caused by a bacterial infection in the lungs&#xD;
      of a ventilated patient. The patients may have been ventilated due to pneumonia but they may&#xD;
      also develop pneumonia whilst ventilated. Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) has&#xD;
      significant mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite all the clinical and laboratory data at the investigators' disposal there remains&#xD;
      great difficulty in the accurate diagnosis of pneumonia and therefore treatment is often&#xD;
      given empirically. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for accurate methods to&#xD;
      diagnose the presence of bacteria deep in the lung in ventilated critically ill patients. As&#xD;
      such, the investigating team have developed and synthesised an imaging agent called BAC TWO.&#xD;
      BAC TWO will be instilled directly into the lungs of 12 patients to assess whether it can&#xD;
      label gram-negative bacteria in the human lung.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to deliver a BAC TWO microdose to 3 ventilated&#xD;
      controls and 9 patients to assess the imaging parameters of BAC TWO over human&#xD;
      autofluorescence and to assess if gram-negative bacteria can be detected in vivo in situ&#xD;
      within the distal lung. The primary endpoint is to visualise the delivery of a microdose of&#xD;
      BAC TWO and assess imaging parameters in;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 mechanically ventilated patients to provide a control population (cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-negative bacteria&#xD;
           (cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-positive bacteria&#xD;
           (cohort 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 patients with suspected pneumonia and pulmonary infiltrates in ICU (cohort 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all cohorts, eligibility will be verified by a clinical trial physician after written&#xD;
      informed consent has been obtained. For all cohorts, a bronchoscopy with lavage will be&#xD;
      performed to harvest broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Fibre-based endomicroscopy (FE)&#xD;
      will be performed on up to three areas and up to 80μg (± 25%) in total of BAC TWO will be&#xD;
      instilled in up to 3 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide additional blood and urine samples with the intention&#xD;
      of examining for systemic uptake of the BAC TWO probe. Routine blood investigations will be&#xD;
      performed 4-6 hours following the administration of BAC TWO. The completion of all&#xD;
      assessments at 4-6 hours post dose marks the end of the participant's participation in this&#xD;
      study unless there are ongoing adverse events requiring resolution. The primary aim will be&#xD;
      measured during bronchoscopy and all routine investigations will have been completed 6 hours&#xD;
      post dose.&#xD;
