    <textblock>
      Fuel for Fun: Cooking with Kids Plus Parents and Play (FFF), is an integrated research,&#xD;
      extension, and education project targeting 4th grade students. Its long-term goal of reducing&#xD;
      the risk of childhood obesity will be addressed by promoting healthful food and activity&#xD;
      environments, policies and behaviors through: 1) building and testing the efficacy of a 4th&#xD;
      grade comprehensive school- and family-based intervention, 2) applying it to an after-school&#xD;
      setting to broaden its reach, and, 3) disseminating both versions through outreach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fuel for Fun: Cooking with Kids Plus Parents and Play (FFF) is based on existing,&#xD;
      evidence-based components: the experiential Cooking with Kids curriculum, the SPARK Active&#xD;
      Recreation program; principles of behavioral economics in school cafeterias and homes; the&#xD;
      online About Eating 5-lesson module based on eating competence concepts, and a family-based&#xD;
      FFF component specifically designed for this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each component addresses policy and environment in addition to behavior change at school and&#xD;
      home. The main research project - school-based FFF - will be implemented in 8 low-to-moderate&#xD;
      income schools for two years using an asynchronous design that allows for assessment of the&#xD;
      school-based program alone and in combination with both parent programs. Changes in fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable intake (measured by self-report, cafeteria plate waste) and activity levels&#xD;
      (measured by self-report and accelerometry) are primary outcomes, with measured BMI as a&#xD;
      secondary outcome. Subsequent studies will involve the development of an after-school version&#xD;
      and adoption of FFF by other districts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      University students will gain valuable research experience and school and Extension educators&#xD;
      will receive important childhood obesity prevention training. The project's long term goal is&#xD;
      consistent with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) goal of improving the&#xD;
      nation's nutrition and health by promoting the development of healthy eating and activity&#xD;
      habits in children.&#xD;

    <time_frame>assessed 3 times over 1 year; initially prior to the intervention beginning (i.e., September), a 2nd time once the intervention ends (i.e., May), and then again at the beginning of the following school year (i.e., September)</time_frame>

    <description>using a standard protocol, we will measure height and weight of all participating students and then calculate BMI z-scores</description>
