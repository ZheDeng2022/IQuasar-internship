    <textblock>
      This is a study of people with type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol between age 18 and 65.&#xD;
      This study is trying to figure out if a partial bypass of the small intestine can reverse&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes for people who require cholesterol lowering and who cannot tolerate the&#xD;
      statin drugs.&#xD;

      The partial ileal bypass (PIB) operation is a standard procedure used in the management of&#xD;
      hyperlipidmia since 1963. POSCH was the intervention modality in the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute-funded Program on the Surgical Control of the&#xD;
      Hyperlipidemias (POSCH) trial. The POSCH study was a secondary trial in patients with a&#xD;
      documented prior myocardial infarction. The trial compared the post-dietary lipid therapy&#xD;
      changes in 421 PIB-intervention patients to 417 controls, with a lowering of total plasma&#xD;
      cholesterol of 24% (P&lt;0.0001), a lowering of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol of 38%&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.0001), and an elevation of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol of 4% (P=0.02).&#xD;
      These lipid changes were associated with a 35% (P&lt;0.001) reduction in the intervention group&#xD;
      of death due to coronary heart disease and confirmed recurrent myocardial infarction, as well&#xD;
      as a 27% (P&lt;0.038) reduction in peripheral vascular disease, and a 54% (P&lt;0.005) diminution&#xD;
      in the occurrence of coronary artery surgery or angioplasty. Concurrently with the clinical&#xD;
      study, POSCH assessed sequential coronary arteriograms at 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years, which&#xD;
      showed less disease progression in the surgery group, and even statistically significant&#xD;
      plaque regression in the PIB cohort. POSCH PIB patients exhibited a statistically significant&#xD;
      increase in life expectancy; this finding persisted at a 25-year follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of metabolic/bariatric surgery, resolution of type 2 diabetes by&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract manipulations was clearly demonstrated by 1998. In three&#xD;
      meta-analyses, the procedures that involved shortening of the ileum (biliopancreatic&#xD;
      diversion and duodenal switch) were responsible for the highest percentage of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      resolution. Recently under evaluation are standard metabolic/bariatric and experimental&#xD;
      metabolic operations that will engender type 2 diabetes resolution with minimal or no weight&#xD;
      loss in non-obese diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut-diabetes relationship has often been attributed to an increased elaboration of the&#xD;
      hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), both secreted by the L-cells&#xD;
      of the intestinal mucosa. These hormones seem to work in concert, either eliciting the same&#xD;
      metabolic response or augmenting the actions of the other. With respect to pancreatic&#xD;
      endocrine function, GLP-1 and PYY contribute to the incretin effect, counteract the insulin&#xD;
      depression action of gastrin stimulating peptide and gastrin-releasing peptide, and stimulate&#xD;
      glucose-dependent insulin secretion, preinsulin gene expression, beta-cell proliferation, and&#xD;
      antiapoptopic pathways. It has been shown that GLP-1 secretion is reduced in patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. In a recent study of the effects of direct human terminal ileum and cecal&#xD;
      contact with a food hydrolysate, significant plasma GLP-1 and PYY elevations were&#xD;
      demonstrated, confirming the ability of the cecum, as well as the ileum, to secrete GLP-1 and&#xD;
      PYY on stimulation. In the Goto-Kakizaki rat with naturally occurring type 2 diabetes, ileal&#xD;
      bypass or excision did not lower GLP-1 production, but interestingly increased it five- to&#xD;
      six-fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These complementary studies gave rise to the hypothesis that: the PIB operation, in addition&#xD;
      to its action on cholesterol metabolism, may aslo prevent and resolve type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our laboratory at the University of Minnesota, the investigators have clearly established&#xD;
      the mechanism for the reduction of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol by PIB: interference&#xD;
      with the cholesterol and bile acid enterohepatic cycles, markedly decreased absorption and&#xD;
      reabsorption of cholesterol and bile acids, increased excretion of cholesterol and bile&#xD;
      acids, increased turnover of cholesterol to generate bile acids and replenish the cholesterol&#xD;
      pool, and the insufficient ability of the body (even in familial hypercholesterolemics) to&#xD;
      maintain the miscible (plasma and liver) and less-freely miscible (tissues, including the&#xD;
      arteries) body pools, and, thereby, a depletion of the cholesterol content of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaques. the investigators have now (see above) added to that knowledge that the elimination&#xD;
      of the terminal ileum from the intestinal pathway will increase circulating GLP-1 levels,&#xD;
      with this incretin probably emanating from the cecum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have now completed and submitted for publication our study on the incidence&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes in the POSCH program 25 plus years after formal trial closure (IRB Code&#xD;
      Number: 1408M53283). The title of our paper is &quot;Partial Ileal Bypass Affords Protection from&#xD;
      Onset of Type 2 Diabetes&quot;. Of the 66 control patient responders in POSCH, 17 contracted type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (25.8%); of 80 PIB responders, 8 contracted type 2 diabetes (10%). The difference&#xD;
      between groups was significant (P=0.015 by Fisher Exact Test) with an odds ratio of 0.320 for&#xD;
      the PIB group and an over two-fold (2.6) increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the&#xD;
      controls. Including borderline type 2 diabetes (prediabetic) patients, these values were 22&#xD;
      of 66 controls (33.3%) and 10 of 80 PIB patients (12.5%), with an odds ratio of 0.286 and a&#xD;
      P&lt;0.004, and again an over two-fold (2.7) increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the&#xD;
      control patients. Therefore, PIB appeared to afford protection from the onset of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes for over 30 years.&#xD;

        Individuals in need of lipid modification but are intolerant of statin drugs who are&#xD;
        referred for a partial ileal bypass (PIB) operation, still the most efficacious means to&#xD;
        treat hyperlipidemia. In the subgroup of these patients who also have type 2 diabetes, with&#xD;
        a functioning pancreas, we hope to perform a pilot study on the effect of PIB on type 2&#xD;
        diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study blood tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Pre-PIB and at 6 month and 12 months postop fasting blood samples for glucose, hemoglobin&#xD;
        A1c, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, ghrelin, and glucagon; then after oral glucose meal testing&#xD;
        for determination of glucose, GLP-1, and ghrelin at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.&#xD;
