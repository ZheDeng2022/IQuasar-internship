  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study comparing a new treatment for bacterial keratitis (also known as corneal&#xD;
      ulcers) with the current standard of care. It is a randomized trial, and the investigators&#xD;
      plan to test whether besifloxacin (a new antibiotic) in comparison to the current standard of&#xD;
      treatment, fortified antibiotic drops (cefazolin and tobramycin).&#xD;

      Hypothesis: patients with bacterial keratitis treated with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension&#xD;
      will have non inferior clinical outcomes as compared to those treated with fortified&#xD;
      antibiotic drops (tobramycin and cefazolin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular problem that can, if not appropriately treated, lead&#xD;
      to corneal scarring, perforation, endophthalmitis, and ultimately blindness. Current accepted&#xD;
      treatment by some practitioners at a major academic center (McGill University Department of&#xD;
      Ophthalmology) for corneal ulcers involves aggressive therapy with fortified antibiotics1,&#xD;
      typically tobramycin (for gram negative coverage) and either vancomycin or cefazolin (for&#xD;
      gram positive and/or MRSA coverage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are a number of problems with this treatment method. Patients must obtain the&#xD;
      fortified antibiotics from specific pharmacies who must compound the preparations, increasing&#xD;
      cost to the patient and potentially risk of contamination. The regimen typically involves&#xD;
      every hour, round the clock dosing for at least the 48 hours, causing significant distress to&#xD;
      patients (many of whom are eldery) and their families, as well as compliance issues. Finally,&#xD;
      fortified antibiotics are toxic, by retarding the epithelial healing rate, as well as having&#xD;
      conjunctival and corneal toxic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' overall goal is to determine whether besifloxacin (at less frequent dosing&#xD;
      than that used with fortified antibiotics) can be used safely and effectively in the&#xD;
      treatment of bacterial keratitis. Previous studies have examined its effect on bacterial&#xD;
      conjunctivitis, but not to the investigators' knowledge bacterial keratitis. However, as some&#xD;
      clinicians are already using besifloxacin in this purpose, the investigators wish to examine&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators' study shows that besifloxacin is safe and effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      bacterial keratitis, a new treatment option for bacterial keratitis may emerge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore plan to conduct a randomized, open label trial enrolling patients&#xD;
      newly diagnosed and not previously treated with bacterial keratitis. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either besifloxacin 6 x daily initially, or fortified antibiotics&#xD;
      (cefazolin and tobramycin) every hour. The investigators will follow the patients closely to&#xD;
      try to evaluate whether besifloxacin is an effective treatment for bacterial keratitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, single-center, two-arm, open-label study comparing a novel therapy,&#xD;
      besofloxacin ophthalmic suspension, to traditional therapy of fortified cefazolin and&#xD;
      tobramycin drops, in the treatment of bacterial keratitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting with bacterial keratitis to the McGill Ophthalmology Center at 5252&#xD;
      Maissoneuve in Montreal, will be offered the opportunity by the resident and staff physician&#xD;
      on call, to enroll in the study, with full discussion of risks and benefits as detailed&#xD;
      above. Referrals will come from outpatient clinics and emergency departments as detailed&#xD;
      above. The population of patients is expected to be outpatients, with a wide range of age&#xD;
      groups &gt;18 years old (no pediatrics as the study center does not see any pediatric age&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients choose not to enroll in the study, they will proceed to receive standard&#xD;
      treatment at the center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients choose to enroll in the study, the resident or staff on call, will, in&#xD;
      consultation with the study investigators (Dr Jean Deschenes), use a pre-determined random&#xD;
      number generator to randomize the patients to A) Besifloxacin arm, or B) Fortified&#xD;
      Antibiotics arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, a complete anterior ophthalmological exam will be performed, along with a&#xD;
      detailed ophthalmic and medical history. Corneal scrapings will be performed (blood agar,&#xD;
      chocolate agar, Sabaroud agar, slide mount for gram stain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then be prescribed either Besifloxacin or Fortified Antibiotics&#xD;
      (Cefazolin and Tobramycin) depending on their randomization. The participants will need to&#xD;
      take the prescription to an outside pharmacy for purchase at their own cost of the&#xD;
      medications. Suggested pharmacies will be made for the Fortified Antibiotics arm (as is&#xD;
      standard of care due to the limited number of pharmacies that prepare the compounded drops).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be re-evaluated multiple times following initial presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each arm the medication will be tapered according to the clinical discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physicians. In the besifloxacin arm, only besifloxacin will be used. In the&#xD;
      fortified antibiotics arm, the fortified drops will be tapered and may be switched to another&#xD;
      standard of care medication (moxifloxacin drops) as the bacterial keratitis improves as per&#xD;
      the typical treatment regimen. Importantly, in this arm, the treatment will be carried out as&#xD;
      normal standard of care for bacterial keratitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the besifloxacin arm, if, at the visit on day 8, previous corneal bacterial cultures&#xD;
      remain positive, the patient will be crossed over into the fortified antibiotic arm.&#xD;
      Otherwise, crossover may occur only if there is significant clinical deterioration by the&#xD;
      treating physician that requires urgent intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of each subject participation is 4 months. Study enrollment is expected&#xD;
      to last for about 4 months as well.&#xD;
