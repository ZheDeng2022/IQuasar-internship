  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this double-blinded, randomized controlled trial are (1) to determine if the&#xD;
      addition of trigger point dry needling (TDN) to a standard stretching program results in&#xD;
      greater improvements in hamstring flexibility versus stretching alone in a population with&#xD;
      atraumatic knee pain; (2) measure length of time that flexibility gains are maintained, (3)&#xD;
      assess resulting movement mechanics and (4) assess patient reported changes in pain. Findings&#xD;
      will potentially lead to insights as to the benefit of applying this intervention to&#xD;
      additional body regions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, up to 40 subjects with a history of atraumatic knee pain will be randomized&#xD;
      into 2 groups of up to 20 subjects per group (1 experimental group and 1 control group).&#xD;
      Subjects in the experimental group will receive TDN intervention with hamstring stretching&#xD;
      while subjects in the control group will receive an alternative needling intervention with&#xD;
      hamstring stretching. After meeting all inclusion criteria, all subjects will undergo the&#xD;
      following tests: supine active knee extension, the active straight leg raise test, deep&#xD;
      squat, and a single leg step down from a 6 inch step. Subjects who measure less than 20° from&#xD;
      full extension on the active knee extension test will be excluded. Hamstring tightness has&#xD;
      been operationally defined as having greater than 20° loss of knee extension as measured with&#xD;
      the femur held at 90° of hip flexion.[1] Manual palpation of the bilateral biceps femoris,&#xD;
      semitendinosus, and semimembranosus will be performed to detect the presence of myofascial&#xD;
      trigger points (TPs) in groups 1 and 2. Dry needling will be performed to all detected TPs by&#xD;
      a provider trained and experienced in TDN. Post TDN, all tests will be immediately repeated&#xD;
      and at each follow up the subject will complete the Global Rating of Change survey (GROC) and&#xD;
      Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post intervention, subjects in experimental group 1 will be given a standing hamstring&#xD;
      stretch to perform 1 repetition held for 30 seconds, repeated 3 times daily. These parameters&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective at improving flexibility.[2] Subjects will be instructed by&#xD;
      demonstration and will be provided with a handout of stretching instructions. Subjects will&#xD;
      be given an exercise log to record home exercise compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in group 2 will be given an alternative needling intervention followed by a standing&#xD;
      hamstring stretch to perform 3 times per day, 1 repetition held for 30 seconds. Alternative&#xD;
      needling intervention will be performed to give the appearance of regular TDN intervention;&#xD;
      however, no needle penetration will be performed. Following alternative needling&#xD;
      intervention, subjects will be instructed by demonstration and will be provided with a&#xD;
      handout of hamstring stretching instructions. Home exercise compliance will be recorded at&#xD;
      each follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up measurements will be recorded between 1-2 days, 3-4 days, and 7-8 days post&#xD;
      intervention. All tests will be repeated. One additional session of TDN and alternative&#xD;
      needling intervention will be performed at day 3-4.&#xD;
