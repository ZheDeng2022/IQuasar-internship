    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate superiority of Fluticasone/Formoterol&#xD;
      (Flutiform®) to Fluticasone/salmeterol based on the small airway function by assessing the&#xD;
      Impulse Oscillometic System (IOS) in uncontrolled asthma patients requiring ICS/LABA&#xD;
      concomitant treatment.&#xD;
