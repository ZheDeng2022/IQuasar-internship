  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a relatively common cardial problem in which one or more of&#xD;
      the leaflets of the mitral valve prolapse during systole into the left atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease is very heterogeneous and can vary from a benign disease with almost no impact on&#xD;
      the patient's life to a severe cardiac problem with many complications and high mortality&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to see if the investigators can find a relation between the&#xD;
      severity of the MVP to the exercise capacity of the patient. The investigators also want to&#xD;
      see if they can find a difference between the exercise capacity of mild MVP patients and&#xD;
      healthy people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the exercise capacity of the subjects the investigators use Cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      Exercise Testing (CPET). CPET is probably the best known way to get a full picture of the&#xD;
      subject's functions during exercise. By combining gas exchange monitoring and ECG during a&#xD;
      controlled exercise in which the subject reaches maximal effort, the test gives information&#xD;
      about the cardiac, the pulmonary and the metabolic functions of the subject. This information&#xD;
      can help identify if there is a problem to perform exercise properly and more specifically if&#xD;
      the limitation is due to a cardiac, pulmonary or metabolic problem.&#xD;
