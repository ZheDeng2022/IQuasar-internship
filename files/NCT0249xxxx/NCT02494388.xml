      The study is based on a multi-center approach of needle based confocal laser endomicroscopy&#xD;
      (nCLE) combined with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA)&#xD;
      to evaluate pancreatic cystic lesions (PCL), in order to obtain a correct histopathological&#xD;
      diagnosis.After detection of PCL, certain morphological EUS features allow the discrimination&#xD;
      of specific cyst types. Additionally, EUS-FNA is recommended as the first-line procedure&#xD;
      whenever pathological diagnosis is required; however the procedure has its drawbacks, mainly&#xD;
      represented by the relatively low negative predictive value in diagnosing pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      In this case a more precisely diagnostic tool is required; the potential role of CLE has been&#xD;
      explored in gastrointestinal (GI) pathology showing good accuracy for predicting the final&#xD;
      histopathological diagnosis based on immediate evaluation of tissue and vascular patterns.&#xD;
      Although the clinical impact of nCLE for the decision making algorithms in cystic pancreatic&#xD;
      neoplasm has not yet been described, the hypothesis is that EUS-nCLE could allow targeted&#xD;
      tissue sampling of cystic pancreatic neoplasms resulting in more accurate diagnosis. The aim&#xD;
      of the study is to describe the clinical impact of nCLE for the clinical decision management&#xD;
      algorithm based on EUS, EUS-FNA and/or EUS-CLE imaging criteria for cystic pancreatic&#xD;
      neoplasms, while evaluating also the feasibility and safety of nCLE examination.&#xD;

      Clinical Impact of Needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy of Cystic Pancreatic Lesions&#xD;
      (CINE-Cyst)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The diagnostic evaluation of cystic pancreatic lesions represents a difficult&#xD;
      problem for clinical decision making, due to the increased incidental discovery of such&#xD;
      lesions during cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance).&#xD;
      Prevalence of cystic pancreatic lesions is estimated between 2 to 20% in the adult population&#xD;
      (1-3), while autopsy studies show that the prevalence increases with age (4). The WHO&#xD;
      classification (revised in 2010) reported several categories, with serous cystadenoma (SCA),&#xD;
      mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and&#xD;
      pseudopapillary neoplasms representing more than 90% (5). Several of these lesions progress&#xD;
      to cystadenocarcinoma (with the notable exception of SCA), hence the differential diagnosis&#xD;
      is extremely important for the clinical decisions that currently involve either imaging&#xD;
      follow-up (usually based on EUS and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or referral to surgery&#xD;
      with a final pathological diagnosis established after resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap in the imaging characteristics of benign,&#xD;
      premalignant or malignant pancreatic cysts which leads to unclear clinical management&#xD;
      algorithms. Several international guidelines addressed the diagnosis and management of cystic&#xD;
      pancreatic lesions (6-8). The most comprehensive guideline reported a clinical decision&#xD;
      algorithm which included clinical and imaging criteria, like pancreatitis / jaundice or cyst&#xD;
      size &gt; 3 cm, thickening / enhancing cyst walls, main pancreatic duct (MPD) size 5-9 mm,&#xD;
      non-enhancing mural nodules and abrupt changes in the caliber of pancreatic duct with distal&#xD;
      pancreatic atrophy [8]. If any of these clinical / imaging characteristics are present then&#xD;
      EUS is considered mandatory to assess a definite mural nodule, main duct features suspicious&#xD;
      for involvement, as well as to perform EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) with&#xD;
      cytopathology exam in order to exclude malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) represents a highly valuable tool in the management of patients&#xD;
      with focal pancreatic masses, either solid or cystic. As a minimally invasive technique that&#xD;
      enables high-resolution imaging of the pancreatic parenchyma and surrounding structures it is&#xD;
      considered the method of choice for the detection of clinically suspected pancreatic lesions,&#xD;
      with a negative predictive value close to 100% [9]. Its diagnostic sensitivity was shown by&#xD;
      previous studies to be superior compared to other imaging techniques, especially in the case&#xD;
      of smaller tumors [10, 11]. After detection of cystic pancreatic lesions, certain&#xD;
      morphological features allow the discrimination of specific types [12]:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pseudocysts - parenchymal changes , without septation or nodules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serous cystadenomas - multiple microcysts and honeycomb appearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mucinous cystadenoma - thickened septations and wall, with calcifications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intrapapillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) - communication with the MPD There aren't&#xD;
           universally accepted morphological parameters to predict either the type or the risk of&#xD;
           malignancy by EUS [8]. &quot;Worrisome features&quot; on imaging include cyst size (above 3 cm),&#xD;
           thickened cyst walls, MPD size of 5-9 mm, non-enhanced mural nodules, abrupt changes in&#xD;
           MPD caliber with distal pancreatic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy. &quot;High risk stigmata&quot;&#xD;
           include obstructive jaundice in a cystic pancreatic head mass, enhanced solid component&#xD;
           or MPD size of over 10 mm, thus warranting an indication for surgery, if clinically&#xD;
           feasible. Generally, all cysts with &quot;worrisome features&quot; and cysts over 3 cm, without&#xD;
           worrisome features, should undergo EUS, while all cysts with &quot;high-risk stigmata&quot; should&#xD;
           undergo surgical resection [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, EUS enables guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) which is currently&#xD;
      recommended as the first-line procedure whenever pathological diagnosis is required [13].&#xD;
      However, EUS-FNA as a sampling technique has its drawbacks, mainly represented by the&#xD;
      relatively low negative predictive value in diagnosing pancreatic cancer. It thus cannot&#xD;
      reliably rule out a diagnosis of malignancy and patients with high clinical suspicion usually&#xD;
      need repeated FNA [14]. The role of EUS-FNA for the differential diagnosis of focal cystic&#xD;
      lesions is still controversial, as CEA and amylase levels as well as cytology are often&#xD;
      useful to differentiate various lesions, but not all of them [8]. Thus, SCA have low levels&#xD;
      of both CEA and amylase. For CEA, values over 192-200 ng/ml have 80% diagnostic accuracy for&#xD;
      mucinous cysts [15]. Likewise, amylase levels might be increased in both IPMN and MCN, making&#xD;
      the differential diagnosis difficult [16]. Cytology has a limited sensitivity, as the&#xD;
      aspirates yield a low number of cells, being most useful if it detects atypical epithelial&#xD;
      cells which can highly predict malignancy, again with an 80% accuracy [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) has emerged in recent years as a novel technique that&#xD;
      actually enables in vivo microscopic analysis during ongoing endoscopy. Endomicroscopy can be&#xD;
      performed either with dedicated (eCLE) or with miniprobe-based systems (pCLE) [18]. It is a&#xD;
      contrast based technique, the most widely used agent being the intravenously administered&#xD;
      fluorescein [19]. The probe-based endomicroscopy system consists of a flexible catheter probe&#xD;
      representing a bundle of optical fibers linked to a micro-objective, a laser scanning unit&#xD;
      and the control and acquisition software (Cellvizio; Mauna Kea Technology, Paris, France).&#xD;
      The flexible confocal miniprobes were specifically designed to be passed through the working&#xD;
      channels of standard endoscopes, biliary catheters or cholangioscopes and thus the pCLE&#xD;
      system can be easily integrated in any endoscopy unit. The principle of the technique is&#xD;
      based on a laser beam of defined wavelength being focused towards the targeted tissue and the&#xD;
      recaptured signal is displayed as 'optical biopsies' in a single horizontal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential role of CLE has been explored in pathology of both upper and lower&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, showing good accuracy for predicting the final histopathological&#xD;
      diagnosis based on immediate evaluation of tissue and vascular patterns [20]. Recently CLE&#xD;
      has gone beyond the superficial luminal indications with the development of a new microprobe,&#xD;
      i.e. a flexible probe thin enough that it can be passed through a 19-gauge needle. Thus under&#xD;
      EUS guidance solid organs can be accessed for real-time microscopic information. nCLE imaging&#xD;
      of abdominal organs has been so far achieved in animal models [21, 22]. The feasibility of&#xD;
      the technique was also proved in a clinical study [23] and descriptive criteria for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms were developed from a multicentre trial [24].&#xD;
      However, the clinical impact of nCLE for the decision making algorithms in cystic pancreatic&#xD;
      neoplasm has not yet been described. The hypothesis is that EUS-nCLE could allow targeted&#xD;
      tissue sampling of cystic pancreatic neoplasms resulting in more accurate diagnosis. With&#xD;
      further validation of the technique real-time pathological diagnosis could be obtained with&#xD;
      immediate initiation of an adequate therapy after a single investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of the proposed study is to describe the clinical impact of nCLE for the clinical&#xD;
      decision management algorithm based on EUS, EUS-FNA and/or EUS-CLE imaging criteria for&#xD;
      cystic pancreatic neoplasms, while evaluating also the feasibility and safety of nCLE&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging tests All patients with a suspicion (clinical, US, CT/MRI) of cystic pancreatic&#xD;
      lesions will be evaluated by EUS, EUS-FNA and EUS-nCLE and compared with the final&#xD;
      pathological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For EUS examination linear instruments will be used to perform complete examination of&#xD;
           the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lesion characteristics (echogenicity, echostructure, size, wall, mural nodules,&#xD;
                septations, etc.) will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The presence of regional lymph nodes will be reported with their maximal size,&#xD;
                echogenicity, shape and margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identification of liver metastasis will also be looked upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EUS-nCLE will be performed after EUS identification of the cystic pancreatic lesion /&#xD;
           lymph node / liver metastasis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The confocal microprobe will be preloaded in a 19G FNA needle as previously&#xD;
                described [13] and advanced into the lesion under EUS guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  nCLE examination will follow after the intravenous administration of the contrast&#xD;
                agent (2.5 ml fluorescein 10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Image data will be stored digitally for offline analysis (at least 2 suggestive&#xD;
                images and 2 suggestive movies of 10 seconds, each).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EUS-FNA will be performed after image acquisition for cytology smears and cell blocks to&#xD;
           enable a final pathological diagnosis. CEA, CA19-9 and amylase levels will be measured&#xD;
           in the aspirate. Molecular analyses like KRAS and GNAS will be performed, if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nCLE images will be analyzed during the examination by the principal investigator, with&#xD;
           clinical and other procedural information in mind. In a second step offline analysis,&#xD;
           the correlations between representative CLE images and classical hematoxylin and eosin&#xD;
           sections will be identified.&#xD;
