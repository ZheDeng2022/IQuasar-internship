  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological, clinicopathological and animal studies show that vascular disease in various&#xD;
      forms contributes to cognitive decline. Increasing age is the strongest risk for dementia&#xD;
      irrespective of whether it results from a vascular etiology or neurodegenerative disease&#xD;
      processes such as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD and vascular cognitive impairment, the two&#xD;
      most common causes of dementia, represent two extremes of a spectrum of disorders; however, a&#xD;
      number of entities, which possess varying degrees of neurodegenerative and vascular&#xD;
      pathologies, occur in between. The pure forms of the disorders are preferred for convenience&#xD;
      to label, treat or manage but conditions within the spectrum are the norm rather than the&#xD;
      exception as dementia advances. Therefore, combinatorial therapy directed at both vascular&#xD;
      and neurodegenerative aspects of dementia is a promising approach for the treatment of&#xD;
      dementia in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cilostazol acts as an antiplatelet agent and has other pleiotropic effects based on&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase-3-dependent mechanisms. Increasing evidence suggests that cilostazol offers&#xD;
      endothelial protection, via pleiotropic effects. Intriguingly, cilostazol has been shown to&#xD;
      decrease amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation and protect Abeta-induced cognitive deficits in an&#xD;
      experimental model. In a pilot study of 10 patients with moderate AD (mean MMSE score, 11.9&#xD;
      points) who received donepezil, cilostazol add-on treatment for 5-6 months demonstrated&#xD;
      significantly increased MMSE score in comparison to baseline. Moreover, cilostazol was shown&#xD;
      to be effective in preventing cognitive decline in patients with AD with cerebrovascular&#xD;
      diseases, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild dementia who received donepezil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results highlight the need for a comprehensive prospective cohort study to analyze the&#xD;
      effect of cilostazol on the preservation of cognitive function in patients with early-stage&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, namely MCI.&#xD;
