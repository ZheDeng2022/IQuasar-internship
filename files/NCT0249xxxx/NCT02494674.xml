  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1-month study that will examine the use of podcasting and a wearable wrist-worn&#xD;
      device to track calorie intake and promote weight loss. A podcast is a digital audio file&#xD;
      that can be listened to on portable media players, like iPods, and personal computers. This&#xD;
      study will run from July 14, 2015 to August 11, 2015. In this study, you will receive weight&#xD;
      loss information delivered via twice weekly podcasts. You will also track each meal you eat&#xD;
      by wearing a provided watch-like device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will last approximately 1 month (about 4 weeks). Participants will need to attend&#xD;
      one 1.5-hour orientation meeting, baseline assessment, and training meeting, and then weekly&#xD;
      1-hour meetings for four weeks (5 meetings total). Participants will listen to 2 podcasts per&#xD;
      week and will be encouraged to monitor exercise and body weight and track each meal using the&#xD;
      provided wearable, wrist worn device. Each of the podcasts will take about 15 - 20 minutes to&#xD;
      listen to and so participants should expect to spend 30 - 40 minutes each week listening to&#xD;
      podcasts and up to 3 hours completing other study-related activities each week-including&#xD;
      attending the weekly meetings-for a total of about 4 hours per week.&#xD;
