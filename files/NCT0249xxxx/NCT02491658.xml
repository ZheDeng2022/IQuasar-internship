    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris. Any&#xD;
      adverse events related to UC-MSCs infusion will be monitored and the patients will be&#xD;
      assessed by Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index&#xD;
      (DLQI) in the baseline and after MSCs infusions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is considered as an incurable immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. The widely&#xD;
      used treatments include topical agents, systemic medications and biologic agents, but all of&#xD;
      them have some drawbacks or limitations. Besides, non-standardized treatment or the disease&#xD;
      itself may lead transformation to other diseases, which add more importance to finding&#xD;
      improved management strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that can differentiate&#xD;
      into bone, cartilage and fat cells. They have several functions, such as migration to skin&#xD;
      lesions, immunomodulation, limitation of autoimmunity and local paracrine effects. It&#xD;
      reported MSCs have already been used in some kinds of autoimmune disease, such as systemic&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, consenting umbilical cords are donated by healthy donors. After several&#xD;
      processing steps, UC-MSCs are separated and froze for future infusions. When volunteers are&#xD;
      recruited, their condition will be assessed by Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI)&#xD;
      and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Then MSCs will be infused according to a standard&#xD;
      scheme. After all 6 infusions, the patient will be re-assessed by the PASI and DLQI and will&#xD;
      be followed up for one year.&#xD;
