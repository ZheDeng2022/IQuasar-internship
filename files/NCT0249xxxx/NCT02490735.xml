  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is the main treatment method for patients with Esophageal Cancer. However,&#xD;
      Relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure.Biological therapies such as CIK&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. A series of studies reported&#xD;
      that cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) have a broad anti-tumor spectrum. The investigators&#xD;
      suppose that CIK will improve the prognosis. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy&#xD;
      may kill more tumor cells. In this study, the patients will be treated with CIK cells after&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CIK for Esophageal&#xD;
      Cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 2000 patients with staging I-III of Esophageal Cancer, after accepting chemotherapy,&#xD;
      will be randomly divided into group A (receive CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly&#xD;
      follow up), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of&#xD;
      CIK cells treatment (every 12 weeks). Patients in group B will have no anti-tumor therapy.&#xD;
