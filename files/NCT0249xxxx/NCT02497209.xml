      Aim: To collate data on Anogenital Distance (AGD) from several population studies to build an&#xD;
      international database for Anogenital Distance (AGD) Primary objective: To build a database&#xD;
      platform to promote and facilitate international collaboration on research related to AGD,&#xD;
      endocrine disruptors and reproductive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Observational study Outcome Measures Outcomes from varying projects based on the&#xD;

      Introduction Increasing incidence of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer has&#xD;
      paralleled the concomitant decline in male fertility in several countries(1). Exposures of&#xD;
      environmental agents, which act as endocrine disruptors resulting in abnormalities in the&#xD;
      development and function of fetal tests, have been hypothesised to underlie these trends.&#xD;
      However, these outcomes are relatively rare, and in some cases occur a long period after&#xD;
      exposure. Development of a sensitive biomarker of fetal androgen action during infancy is&#xD;
      critical to evaluate the effects of potential endocrine disrupting environmental agents on&#xD;
      the reproductive system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anogenital distance (AGD) defined as the distance from the anus to genital tubercle is a&#xD;
      sensitive marker for prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in animals (1,2).&#xD;
      However, unlike in animals, the external genitalia are well differentiated in humans and the&#xD;
      anatomical landmarks to measure AGD have been a matter of debate. This has resulted in&#xD;
      several proxy measurements of AGD using multiple anterior landmarks such as anterior&#xD;
      insertion of the penis, posterior insertion of penis or perineoscrotal junction (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, several human studies have reported an association between exposure to a&#xD;
      variety of commonly used environmental chemicals and reduction in AGD in humans (1,2,4). AGD&#xD;
      remains the single biomarker, which has showed consistent alterations related to prenatal&#xD;
      exposure to environmental agents with established endocrine-disrupting activity in animals.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a reduced AGD has been shown in common disorders of male reproductive health&#xD;
      such as hypospadias, cryptorchidism, reduced semen quality and infertility (1,2,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the study The use of AGD in epidemiological studies has several limitations.&#xD;
      Varying methods used for measurement is believed to result in considerable variations in the&#xD;
      AGD values (6). A few small studies have also suggested the possibility of ethnic variation.&#xD;
      Normative data is vital particularly in cross-sectional studies. Normative data for some&#xD;
      types of AGD has been published, however, population data using more standardised methods for&#xD;
      measurement and on other types of AGD are vital in understanding the potential effect of&#xD;
      endocrine disruptors on reproductive health (7,8). Large datasets from international&#xD;
      collaboration are important to study variations related to types of measurement techniques&#xD;
      and ethnicity, and explore the relationship between AGD, environmental exposures and male&#xD;
      reproductive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to set up an international AGD database to promote and facilitate&#xD;
      research in the area related to AGD and, therefore, provide the researchers access to a large&#xD;
      dataset derived from multiple studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Cohorts of healthy subjects from populationbased studies which included&#xD;
      measurements of anogenital distance will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International AGD database An international AGD database (IAGD) will be established and&#xD;
      located in the Department of Growth and Reproduction, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.&#xD;
      The database will consist of anonymised data from multiple studies. For each approved&#xD;
      research project, appropriate data will be exported from the contributing studies to the&#xD;
      international database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International AGD Consortium An international AGD consortium will provide the governance&#xD;
      framework for the international AGD database. This consortium will consist of the founding&#xD;
      members and a member from each of the contributing studies. They will be responsible for&#xD;
      advising on the design and structure of the database, evaluating and approving specific&#xD;
      research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database management &amp; Data Protection For each research project approved by the consortium,&#xD;
      the members (PI's of the contributing studies) will be asked for permission for their data to&#xD;
      be included. The data relevant for each specific research project will be extracted from the&#xD;
      contributing studies, which expressed an interest in the project and exported to the&#xD;
      international AGD database. This database will be unlinked from the original databases for&#xD;
      the participating studies so that subjects will not be identified by linkage. The data will&#xD;
      be anonymised, and no patient identifiable information including the date of birth will be&#xD;
      exported to the international database. Furthermore, no data, which could potentially link&#xD;
      international AGD database with that of the contributing studies such as the study specific&#xD;
      identifier for the contributing study, will be exported to the international database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the database will have relevant details of all the contributing studies&#xD;
      including participant numbers, the schedule of assessments and collection of biological&#xD;
      samples, and method of measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical &amp; Regulatory considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      International AGD database The database will be located in Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen,&#xD;
      Denmark and comply with Data protection guidance in Denmark. Appropriate regulatory approvals&#xD;
      will be obtained from the Data protection agency in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory approvals for the contributing studies The regulatory framework for sharing data&#xD;
      with external researchers varies considerably in different countries. Regulatory permissions&#xD;
      if necessary will be obtained by the PI's of the contributing studies to share anonymised&#xD;
      data with the international database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsorship &amp; Funding The database will be sponsored by Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.&#xD;
      The study will be funded by International Center for Research and Research Training in&#xD;
      Endocrine Disrupting Effects on Male Reproduction and Child Health (EDMaRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An international Anogenital Distance (AGD) consortium was set up to manage the database. The&#xD;
      current members of the consortium are:&#xD;
