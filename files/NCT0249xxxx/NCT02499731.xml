    <textblock>
      Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities is a research study which aims to reduce cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD), improve quality of life, and reduce CVD related health care costs in rural&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' aim is to better understand how changes in lifestyle can affect the health&#xD;
      of rural women and others in their communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are notable cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities among people living in rural&#xD;
      settings, particularly medically underserved rural areas. Complex factors such as&#xD;
      socioeconomic disadvantage, social and cultural dynamics, geographic distances/barriers, and&#xD;
      limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities&#xD;
      contribute to the issue. The objective of Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities (SHHC) is to&#xD;
      reduce rural CVD disparities through civic engagement and implementation of a community-based&#xD;
      intervention in 16 underserved rural towns. In Montana, SHHC builds upon a long-standing&#xD;
      collaboration with National Institute of Food and Agriculture cooperative extension&#xD;
      educators, who will implement the project. SHHC in New York will work with a health care&#xD;
      system to implement the project. There is limited knowledge about how programs and services&#xD;
      can move beyond commonly used individual-level approaches-which have limitations in terms of&#xD;
      cost, impact, reach, and sustainability-to effectively reduce rural CVD health disparities&#xD;
      using an integrated, multi-level, community-engaged approach. The objective of Strong Hearts,&#xD;
      Healthy Communities (SHHC) is to address this gap in knowledge and practice by working with&#xD;
      residents, practitioners, health educators, local leadership, and other stakeholders in 16&#xD;
      medically underserved rural towns to develop and test a comprehensive program designed to: a)&#xD;
      improve diet and physical activity behaviors, b) promote local built environment resources,&#xD;
      and c) shift social norms about active living and healthy eating through civic engagement,&#xD;
      capacity building, and community-based programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FORMATIVE RESEARCH (STAGE1: Completed) The investigators conducted community audits, focus&#xD;
      groups, and key informant interviews with members of the above key groups to gather in-depth&#xD;
      data about a number of topics related to CVD awareness and risk factors. These topics&#xD;
      included: economic, healthcare, and social/cultural factors, as well as, barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to healthy eating and active living. The community audit and qualitative data&#xD;
      gathered during the formative research, as well as, feedback from extension educators and the&#xD;
      National Advisory Board has informed and been incorporated in the development and refinement&#xD;
      of the SHHC curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED INTERVENTION (STAGE 2) In the second phase of the project, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the efficacy of the SHHC curriculum in a 24-week community based&#xD;
      randomized controlled intervention trial. The investigators will compare changes in&#xD;
      CVD-related anthropometric, physiologic, behavioral, and psychosocial parameters between&#xD;
      subjects in 8 intervention and 8 control communities. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate changes in behavior, attitudes, and knowledge among SHHC intervention subjects'&#xD;
      &quot;social network&quot;.&#xD;
