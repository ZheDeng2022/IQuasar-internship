    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 1 dose-escalation study of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion&#xD;
      administered to adult patients with advanced malignancies. Patients will be administered&#xD;
      escalating doses of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion intradermally or subcutaneously in accordance&#xD;
      with the following regimen: once weekly for four weeks during the Induction Phase, once every&#xD;
      7 to 14 days for 6 weeks during the Consolidation Phase, and once every 14 to 28 days until a&#xD;
      discontinuation criterion is met during the Maintenance Phase. Once RP2D is determined from&#xD;
      either the intradermal or subcutaneous group, an additional 40 patients evaluable for&#xD;
      response may be enrolled as an expansion cohort at this dose and route of administration to&#xD;
      confirm safety and tolerability. Separate from the dose-ascending cohort and RP2D expansion&#xD;
      cohort described previously, and once the intradermal dose-ascending cohort is completed, up&#xD;
      to 20 MDS patients who are refractory to treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) will be&#xD;
      enrolled into an MDS expansion cohort. Of these 20 MDS patients, one-half will receive&#xD;
      DSP-7888 at 10.5 mg according to the modified schedule employed in Phase 1 (every week for 4&#xD;
      weeks, every 2 weeks until Week 24, and then every 4 weeks; [MDS Cohort 1]). The other half&#xD;
      of the MDS patients will receive DSP-7888 at 10.5 mg in an alternative dosing schedule where&#xD;
      DSP-7888 is administered every 2 weeks until Week 24, after which it will be administered&#xD;
      every 4 weeks (MDS Cohort 2).&#xD;
