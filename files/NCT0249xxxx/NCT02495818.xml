    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of suprascapular nerve block guided by&#xD;
      ultrasound combined with home exercises compared with placebo. Pain intensity, function,&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold and goniometry were designed to be assessed in all patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is being carried out in the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of&#xD;
      the University of São Paulo since June 2013. The investigators are including patients with&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of supraspinatus tendinitis based on the Lateral Jobe Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are being randomized in two arms: Active (2% 5ml lidocaine for suprascapular&#xD;
      nerve block and home exercises) and placebo control (saline solution as the nerve block and&#xD;
      home exercises). The randomization is being performed in blocks of 4 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator, the raters, the MD who makes the procedure and the patients are blind to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 visits are being performed. Screening and initial evaluation visit, procedure visit, follow&#xD;
      up 1 week after intervention and follow up 12 weeks after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated to be 54 in each arm.&#xD;
