  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) as a single agent in relapsed/refractory CD30+ PTCL&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BV will be administered as a single IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Measures of&#xD;
      anti-cancer activity will be assessed using the revised response criteria for malignant&#xD;
      lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) scans (chest, neck, abdomen, and pelvis) and PET scan will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and Cycles 3, 8, 12, and 16. Patients will have an End of Treatment&#xD;
      (EOT) assessment 30 ± 7 days after receiving their final dose of study drug. Patients with at&#xD;
      least stable disease will enter short follow up phase till month 24 with radiology assessment&#xD;
      every 6 months and visit every 12 weeks. After month 24 and for all patients with progressive&#xD;
      disease, long-term follow-up assessments (including survival, disease status and next therapy&#xD;
      information) will be performed every 12 weeks until either patient death or study closure,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first.&#xD;
