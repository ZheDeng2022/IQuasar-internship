  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase II, open-label, 42-patient single-arm trial of intratumoral&#xD;
      pIL-12 electroporation (EP) in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated in 2 parts. Part A patients will be selected using a flow&#xD;
      cytometric assay that quantifies intratumoral PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4+ &quot;exhausted&quot; lymphocytes in the&#xD;
      tumor. Part B will enroll patients who have or are failing pembrolizumab at least 12 weeks&#xD;
      after starting Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody alone or in combination, or,&#xD;
      who have been selected using a flow cytometric assay that quantifies intratumoral&#xD;
      PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4+ &quot;exhausted&quot; lymphocytes in the tumor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

    <measure>Best Overall Objective Response Rate (ORR) Within 24 Weeks Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall ORR within 24 weeks of first treatment with pIL-12 electroporation (EP) and pembrolizumab will be determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI. The ORR is the proportion of participants with either a Complete Response (CR) defined as a disappearance of all target lesions determined by 2 separate scans conducted not &lt; 4 weeks apart and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm (the sum may not be &quot;0&quot; if there are target nodes) and no appearance of new lesions or a Partial Response (PR) defined as a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions with no appearance of new lesions. ORR = CR + PR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall ORR Determined by Immune Related-Response Criteria (irRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall objective response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with a demonstrated complete or partial response according to irRC. In the irRC, an immune-related Complete Response (irCR) is the disappearance of all lesions, measured or unmeasured, and no new lesions; an immune-related Partial Response (irPR) is a 50% drop in tumour burden from baseline as defined by the irRC.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histological or cytological diagnosis of melanoma with progressive&#xD;
             locally advanced or metastatic disease that is not amenable to definitive local&#xD;
             therapy with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable tumor accessible for intratumoral injection and EP on&#xD;
             investigator's assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy or radiation therapy. All&#xD;
             prior therapies must be stopped 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment, with&#xD;
             the exception of patients who have received ipilimumab, which must be stopped 6 weeks&#xD;
             prior to first dose of study treatment. Patients are prohibited from receiving live&#xD;
             vaccines within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part A: Patient has agreed to two newly obtained tumor biopsies and as required&#xD;
             re-biopsies (that can be biopsied on investigator's assessment) and to providing the&#xD;

             for PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4hi in the CD8+CD45+ gate based on flow cytometry will be done. A&#xD;
             second fresh biopsy sample is required for further biomarker analysis and confirmation&#xD;
             at a later date of low PD-L1 expression using an Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay for&#xD;
             PD-L1 expression. A valid flow cytometry result is not required for study&#xD;
             participation, but repeated biopsy for reanalysis is strongly recommended for patient&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to administration of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of pIL-12 EP and pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason women of child-bearing potential (not free from menses for &gt;2 years,&#xD;
             post hysterectomy/oophorectomy, or surgically sterilized) must agree to use two&#xD;
             methods of contraception, or abstain from heterosexual activity, during participation&#xD;
             in study, from the time of consent through 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             therapy. The two methods must include at least one &quot;barrier method&quot;. Barrier methods&#xD;
             are diaphragms, cervical caps, cervical shields, male condoms, and female condoms. The&#xD;
             second method of contraception may be another barrier method, a copper containing&#xD;
             intrauterine device (IUD), spermicidal foams, sponges and films, or hormone-based&#xD;
             contraception (for example, hormone pills, hormone rings, hormone patches,&#xD;
             hormone-releasing IUDs, or Depo Provera). Men with partners who are capable of getting&#xD;
             pregnant must agree to use one of the barrier methods of contraception listed above&#xD;
             during participation in the study, starting with the first dose of study drug through&#xD;
             120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign&#xD;
