    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) develops in 50-80% of subjects who have a limb amputated. It is not&#xD;
      well known what causes PLP to develop and the current treatments have been shown to be&#xD;
      largely ineffective. Resent research, however, have indicated that cortical reorganizing&#xD;
      occurring after amputation of the cortex areas related to the missing limb may be related to&#xD;
      the development of PLP. Furthermore, the research indicated that by providing meaningful&#xD;
      sensory input coming from the phantom limb the PLP may be alleviated and the cortical&#xD;
      organization normalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CIP described in the current application, is part of a the EU-project &quot;EPIONE&quot;, which&#xD;
      aims to investigate if and how cortical normalization and PLP alleviation can be induced by&#xD;
      providing phantom limb sensations (sensations which seems to originate from the missing limb)&#xD;
      in hand amputated subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, which will take place at Aalborg University Hospital (AUH), 2-4 hand&#xD;
      amputated subjects experiencing severe PLP will implanted with interneural nerve electrodes&#xD;
      in the arm stump for up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy will be evaluated in two stages, first during a standardized four week phase where&#xD;
      the subject receives daily therapy. If the therapy is shown to be effective, therapy may be&#xD;
      reinitiated during a second longer therapy phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the therapy sessions, selective nerve stimulation will be performed. The amputee will&#xD;
      experience this as sensations (movement, touch, temperature, vibration etc.) originating from&#xD;
      the phantom limb. While implanted, we will investigate how well we can induce these&#xD;
      sensations and we will provide a stimulation therapy, which consist of stimulation activities&#xD;
      which requires the subject to focus on the evoked sensations. Prior to, during a and&#xD;
      following therapy a series of assessments (standardized across all EPIONE partners to enable&#xD;
      comparison) will be conducted to relate therapy with PLP, cortical organization, the mental&#xD;
      state etc. of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation therapy is expected to alleviate PLP and induce cortical normalization. The&#xD;
      experience we gain might be used for deriving clinical guidelines on how to treat PLP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out in two parts. The first part will function as a pilot part&#xD;
      where the investigators will seek to get experience with, e.g., stimulation procedures: Which&#xD;
      therapies activities and stimulation parameters do the participants feel are the most&#xD;
      intuitive (i.e., most effective reintroducing the phantom hand into the body image of the&#xD;
      amputee) and thus might be expected to be most effective in normalizing the cortical&#xD;
      organization and alleviating PLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After part 1 the data will be analyzed together with the international partners (no&#xD;
      participants identifiable data will be shared) and the shared experiences will be used to&#xD;
      adjust the activities of part two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment is conducted in the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Startup&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline and entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Implantation (defined as week 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Repetition. Redo phase 3 to 7 with longer therapy phase durations only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures during phases 1 to 7 (weeks -5 to 12) are standardized across international EPIONE&#xD;
      partners (which carry out different interventions, but similar assessments), to enable&#xD;
      comparison between treatment modalities. At AUH, if therapy is shown to be effective during&#xD;
      phase 1-7, the investigators will repeat the initial phases 3 to 7, but with a longer therapy&#xD;
      phase, to investigate the effect of long term stimulation therapy. TIME-4H electrodes will&#xD;
      not be left implanted for a longer duration than one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the different phases of the study a collection of assessment methods is conducted to&#xD;
      monitor the effect of stimulation therapy on the amputee's level of perceived PLP and&#xD;
      cortical organization. In addition, the psychological state of the subject, the strength and&#xD;
      type of the non-painful phantom limb sensations are also assessed to provide a more detailed&#xD;
      view on the possible effects of the stimulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will be conducted as a series of case studies where the effect of the&#xD;
      stimulation therapy in a participant is compared with the PLP sensations the same subjects&#xD;
      perceived before initiating the therapy. Therefore, only amputees who are in a stable state&#xD;
      (e.g., not newly amputated subjects) are included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No placebo or blinding is performed as the participant can feel the stimulation and also has&#xD;
      to be mentally active involved in performing &quot;phantom limb movements&quot; when receiving&#xD;
      stimulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases 1-7 for each subject (week -3 to week 12, week = 0 is implantation) are performed&#xD;
      according to the experiment protocol defined in collaboration with international partners.&#xD;
      Phase 8, has been defined by AUH, and is constituted by a repetition of the phases 3-7, where&#xD;
      the treatment phase has been prolonged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Startup The participant is invited to a meeting with the principal investigator and&#xD;
      one of the senior researchers involved in the study to be informed about the experiment. Only&#xD;
      the PI, who is a medical doctor, will be allowed to answer health and medical related&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Pre-screening This phase is conducted before the start of the experiment but after&#xD;
      the subject has signed the informed consent form and the authority form, the latter granting&#xD;
      representatives from Danish Health and Medicines Agency access to the study data and patient&#xD;
      record for control purposes. Via questionnaires, tests and interviews it is evaluated if the&#xD;
      participant fulfills the inclusion criteria in relation to physical health (able to undergo&#xD;
      surgery), depression, normal range of IQ and PLP. The principal investigator will evaluate&#xD;
      the results and decide whether the participant should be included or excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: Baseline and entry The baseline and entry phase aims to determine the stability and&#xD;
      intra-subject variability of the pain sensations without treatment. The measure control for&#xD;
      the daily variability in pain, assessment scoring variability, site-to-site variability and&#xD;
      inter subject variability in the &quot;before intervention&quot; state. These variances will be used in&#xD;
      the analysis to estimate baseline noise in the measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second rationale for the repetition of these measures in this phase is to trap any effect&#xD;
      that might come out of running the assessment, e.g., due to the increased attention on PLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participants live close to AUH, these assessments will be conducted at AUH under&#xD;
      supervision of experimenters. If it is unpractical for the participants to attend the daily&#xD;
      sessions at AUH, the subject may conduct them at home after receiving adequate training and&#xD;
      while being in regular contact with an experimenter. If performed at home, assessments&#xD;
      (questionnaire) may be filled out by the subjects on printed-out versions or using a laptop&#xD;
      with the Psychophysical Testing Platform installed using a participants specific login with&#xD;
      accompanying functional restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the questionnaire used for quantifying the perceived phantom limb pain and&#xD;
      sensation, the last week before implantation includes the application of cortical mapping&#xD;
      methods (EEG, SEP and fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all phases of the study the subject is required to fill out a diary before going to&#xD;
      bed about the development of PLP during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Implantation Surgical implantation of the TIME-4H electrodes is conducted under full&#xD;
      anesthesia. During the operation, the median and the ulnar nerves are freed through an&#xD;
      incision of 20 cm on the medial aspect of the upper-arm. The fascicles of both nerves are&#xD;
      dissected free for a couple of centimeters at the level where the TIME-4H electrodes are to&#xD;
      be implanted. Four TIME-4H electrodes are pulled in to the fascicles of the nerves using the&#xD;
      attached needle and thread, two TIME-4H in each nerve. The electrode are anchored to the&#xD;
      nerve using the dedicated anchoring points of the TIME-4H (seen on figure 4 (B)). After&#xD;
      placing the electrodes the electrical integrity of each TIME-4H electrode is tested, before&#xD;
      closing the wound. Lead out wires are lead out through the skin and the wound is closed.&#xD;
      During surgery the participant is treated with prophylactic antibiotics. Prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics are not administered later in the study due to the risk of the development of&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the implantation the subject is offered to stay at Patienthotellet to enable routine&#xD;
      assessment of the surgical outcome as long as the PI judges it necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound treatment While the electrodes are implanted, the subject will routinely have the wound&#xD;
      where the wires exit the arm cleaned and treated to reduce the risk of infection. This will&#xD;
      be conducted by a nurse who is member of the project group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will receive training in treating/cleaning the wound and also in what&#xD;
      symptoms to be aware of. During phases of the study where the subject does not attend daily&#xD;
      therapy sessions and thus is not in daily face-to-face contact with the project team, the&#xD;
      participant may for shorter periods perform the wound treatment him/herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 5: Therapy Phantom limb pain and sensations are assessed via questionnaire prior to and&#xD;
      following the stimulation therapy. Several assessments are conducted during this phase with&#xD;
      the purpose of characterizing the sensations which can be evoked and to provide sensory&#xD;
      stimulation therapy with the aim of alleviating the phantom limb pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PsyP-Map (B): Stimulation is conducted using each of the individual contact sites and&#xD;
           different combinations of the implanted TIME-4H with the purpose (1) of determining&#xD;
           suitable (above sensation threshold and below pain threshold) stimulation parameters&#xD;
           (intensity, pulse width etc.) and (2) of mapping the perceived location and type of the&#xD;
           sensations evoked.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Will be conducted once every week; each session will last approx. 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulation therapy: Stimulation is performed with the aim of inducing meaningful&#xD;
           sensory input to the subject and thereby inducing a normalization of the cortical&#xD;
           organization and alleviation of PLP. This is sought accomplished by performing&#xD;
           activities which reintroduce the missing limb into the subject's body image:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The subject is instructed to imagine performing a movement or sensation indicated&#xD;
                on the subject computer screen with the phantom hand. During this &quot;movement&quot; the&#xD;
                experimenter will seek to evoke relevant sensations via electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The therapy session will be conducted once every weekday; each session will last&#xD;
                approx. 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results indicate that the therapy was effective and the subject is interested in&#xD;
      continuing the therapy, the TIME-4H electrodes are left implanted during the outcome and&#xD;
      follow-up phase. However, no stimulation therapy is performed during these phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An fMRI examination is scheduled to be carried out at the end of the therapy phase. The&#xD;
      TIME-4H is currently being tested for MR compatibility, and the result is expected in March&#xD;
      2015. If the TIME-4H is compatible, the fMRI examination will be conducted as planned. If it&#xD;
      is not compatible, the fMRI examination will be conducted when the TIME-4H has been&#xD;
      explanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 6: Outcome After four weeks of therapy a series of assessments are performed to assess&#xD;
      the effect of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No stimulation therapy is conducted during the outcome and the following follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 7: Follow-up During the follow-up phase it is assessed how long time it takes for any&#xD;
      effects pain alleviating effect of the therapy to wear off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of the follow-up assessment will be dependent on whether the therapy is&#xD;
      effective in the individual subjects (entry assessments compared with outcome assessments).&#xD;
      If effective, follow-up assessments are conducted one time each week, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after&#xD;
      ended therapy. If deemed ineffective, follow-up assessments are only conducted 4 weeks after&#xD;
      ended therapy (week 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the follow-up phase the procedures standardized between the EPIONE&#xD;
      international partners end, and partners decide individually how to proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 8: Repetition of therapy At AUH, in the case that the applied stimulation therapy&#xD;
      reduces the PLP of the subject and the subject is interested in continuing the therapy, the&#xD;
      therapy may be reinitiated by repeating the procedures of phase 3 to7, however, with a longer&#xD;
      therapy period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration for a subject will be limited by the maximum TIME-4H implantation&#xD;
      duration, which has been set to one year maximum, and later in the study the overall&#xD;
      termination of experimental activities in the EPIONE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing the potential long duration of the study and the large effect daily therapy&#xD;
      sessions will have on the subject's everyday life, especially for subjects living far from&#xD;
      AUH, the therapy will be adjusted in terms of frequency (e.g., one time weekly) and duration&#xD;
      (hours per session) to suit the subject, while aiming at the administration of enough therapy&#xD;
      to induce a sufficient PLP alleviating effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explantation In the event of infection, blushing, swelling, pain or other complications which&#xD;
      render continuous implantation impossible, the electrodes will be explanted and the subject&#xD;
      treated with antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explantation of the TIME-4H electrodes may be conducted at the end of the therapy phase if&#xD;
      the therapy is unsuccessful or if the subject does not wish to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject wishes to continue the therapy, the maximal allowed implantation time will be&#xD;
      1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explantation will be carried out under full anesthesia. Access is obtained via an insertion&#xD;
      made through the skin on the medial side of the upper arm. The TIME-4H electrodes are&#xD;
      dissected free, thread cut and the implant pulled out of the nerve and removed. Following the&#xD;
      explantation normal wound treatment will be conducted and the stitches removed according to&#xD;
      standard procedures.&#xD;
