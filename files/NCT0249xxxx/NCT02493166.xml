  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative disorder of the central&#xD;
      nervous system, with more than 2.5 million people in the world. It is the most non-traumatic&#xD;
      cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the lesions are spread in the brains, there is a variety of symptoms. The most common&#xD;
      symptom is the typical motor dysfunction. 66% of persons with MS, and even 81% of them after&#xD;
      15 years, have problems with movements in one or both upper extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, 40 untill 70% of persons with Multiple Sclerosis have cognitive impairment. Although&#xD;
      they are less visible, they can have a major determining influence on social or work-related&#xD;
      domains. The most frequent cognitive dysfunctions are sustained attention, reduced speed of&#xD;
      information processing, impaired memory and limited executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a combination, of motor and cognitive task, is asked, the execution of these tasks could&#xD;
      be difficult with the foregoing in mind. For example problems during chatting while cooking,&#xD;
      typing a report at a meeting or watching television while ironing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dual-task paradigm assumes that the attention should be divided between two simultaneous&#xD;
      tasks. A dual task cost (DTC) is a restriction in performance on each task, compared whit the&#xD;
      separate task versus simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on dual tasking with persons with MS has already studied extensively, but not&#xD;
      specific on the upper limb. In 2015 Learmonth, Pilutti and Motl published an primary research&#xD;
      on the DTC. They combined the movements of the upper limb with a cognitive task. The research&#xD;
      showed a difference between Persons with MS and the control group. At methodological level,&#xD;
      there is lacking on the randomization of tasks. That is an important bias because of the&#xD;
      learning effect of the tasks. They used only one task for the upper limb; this isn't enough&#xD;
      to generalize the concept of motor interference in Persons with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have Persons with MS a greater DTC compared with a healthy control group? The motor task&#xD;
           is executed with the upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a difference on DTC in persons with MS depending on the motor task?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is an observational case-control study in which individuals with MS will be&#xD;
      compared to a healthy control group. They will be two moments of assessments. On the first&#xD;
      day the general performance of the persons will be measured, by using clinical evaluation&#xD;
      tests and questionnaires. On the second day they will be tests on the dual tasks, specific a&#xD;
      comparison between single versus simultaneously performed tasks.&#xD;
