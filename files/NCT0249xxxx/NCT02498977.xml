    <textblock>
      LIFT is prospective randomised marker-based trial to assess the clinical utility and safety&#xD;
      of biomarker-guided immunosuppression withdrawal in liver transplantation. 'LIFT' aims to&#xD;
      validate a biomarker test of operational tolerance to stratify liver transplant recipients&#xD;
      before withdrawing immunosuppressive medication. Primary objective is clinical utility and&#xD;
      risk/benefit ratio of employing a transcriptional test of tolerance to stratify liver&#xD;
      recipients prior to immunosuppression withdrawal. Secondary objectives are: safety of&#xD;
      biomarker-guided immunosuppression withdrawal; health-economic and quality of life impact of&#xD;
      biomarker-guided immunosuppression withdrawal; improvement in drug-related co-morbidities;&#xD;
      prevalence of tolerance over time; role of donor-specific anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#xD;
      antibodies; identify mechanisms of liver allograft tolerance. It is a prospective,&#xD;
      multi-centre, phase IV, biomarker-strategy design trial with a randomized control group in&#xD;
      which adult liver transplant recipients will undergo immunosuppression withdrawal. The sample&#xD;
      size is 148 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-centre, phase IV, biomarker-strategy design trial with a&#xD;
      randomised control group in which adult liver transplant recipients will undergo&#xD;
      immunosuppression (IS) withdrawal. Immunosuppression drugs (IS) are: Tacrolimus, cyclosporine&#xD;
      and/or mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will be randomised 1:1 to either: 1) Non-Biomarker-based IS weaning&#xD;
      (Weaning-All; Arm A); or 2) Biomarker-based IS weaning (Arm B). In participants allocated to&#xD;
      Arm A IS will be withdrawn regardless of the result of the biomarker test. Among participants&#xD;
      allocated to Arm B, only those found to be biomarker-positive (Arm B+, i.e. potentially&#xD;
      tolerant) will be offered IS withdrawal, while biomarker-negative participants (Arm B-, i.e.&#xD;
      potentially non-tolerant) will remain on their baseline maintenance IS. This will allow us to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the biomarker is a useful test to personalise IS by offering drug withdrawal&#xD;
      only to those participants who are likely to complete the process successfully, avoiding&#xD;
      unnecessary rejections among those who have not developed tolerance. Comparing the outcome of&#xD;
      IS withdrawal between arms A and B+ will provide direct evidence of the clinical usefulness&#xD;
      of the test as a function of its predictive accuracy. We have established that for the&#xD;
      biomarker to drive safe IS withdrawal its Positive Predictive Value should be no less than&#xD;
      0.80, and its sensitivity at least 070. To account for centre effects, we will use stratified&#xD;
      randomization. Furthermore, to avoid biases, participants undergoing drug withdrawal and&#xD;
      their physicians will be blinded to the biomarker results. Participants randomized to Arm B-&#xD;
      will know their biomarker status, and will be maintained in the study until its termination&#xD;
      and contribute to secondary clinical outcomes and to the evaluation of the stability of the&#xD;
      tolerance signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost and quality of life (HrQOL) assessments will be conducted alongside the trial to&#xD;
      estimate the health-economic implications of the 2 different strategies. Furthermore,&#xD;
      sequential biological specimens will be collected to conduct ancillary mechanistic studies.&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place in 11 European liver transplant units (King's College Hospital,&#xD;
      Royal Free London, Newcastle, Birmingham, Leeds, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Leuven, Hannover,&#xD;
      Berlin and Barcelona).&#xD;
