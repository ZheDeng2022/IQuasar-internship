  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a global concern with links to conditions such as diabetes. Historically, these&#xD;
      conditions have been managed by reducing energy intake on a daily basis, which is often&#xD;
      hampered by low adherence rates and compensatory reductions in physical activity.&#xD;
      Intermittent fasting (IMF) has become popular as an alternative method of weight loss, where&#xD;
      periods of normal eating are punctuated by days of fasting. However, despite its popularity,&#xD;
      IMF is scarcely examined within the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the impact of IMF on energy balance and the associated health&#xD;
      outcomes relating to conditions such as diabetes. To achieve this, 36 lean adults and 36&#xD;
      overweight/obese adults will be recruited, excluding those with conditions which may be&#xD;
      adversely affected by fasting. Once enrolled, participants will complete a one month control&#xD;
      phase, incorporating 12 days of diet and activity monitoring, to ensure their weight is&#xD;
      stable before moving in to the intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention phase will begin with a lab protocol designed to examine body composition,&#xD;
      resting metabolic rate and metabolic responses to two successive meals. Once completed,&#xD;
      participants will be randomised to one of three diets which are listed below. Comparing the&#xD;
      changes seen with diets 1 and 2 will provide the first direct comparison of IMF against more&#xD;
      conventional strategies, while diet 3 will allow us to ascertain the role of weight loss in&#xD;
      mediating any effects of IMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Daily calorie restriction - Reduce energy intake by 25% on a daily basis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IMF with weight loss - Alternate between 24 hour cycles of fasting and feeding with 150%&#xD;
           of normal intake when feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IMF without weight loss - Alternate between 24 hour cycles of fasting and feeding with&#xD;
           200% of normal intake when feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three diets will last for 20 consecutive days, with transitions between each 24 hour diet&#xD;
      cycle occurring at 15:00 each day to allow at least one main meal per day. When fasting,&#xD;
      participants will only be permitted water and black tea/coffee to eliminate energy intake.&#xD;
      Once again physical activity and diet will be monitored for 12 days during the intervention&#xD;
      to examine changes in energy expenditure and ensure compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having completed all 20 diet cycles participants will return to the laboratory to repeat the&#xD;
      protocol described earlier. Comparing these results against the values seen before the&#xD;
      intervention will then allow the effects of IMF to be identified and compared.&#xD;

      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local advertising in the form of posters will distributed throughout the research&#xD;
      institution, nearby organisations and the city of Bath. The posters will encourage interested&#xD;
      persons to contact the chief investigator to receive more information on what the study will&#xD;
      involve. The research team will be looking to recruit 72 (36 lean, 36 overweight/obese)&#xD;
      individuals who satisfy the entry criteria (discussed later).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential volunteers will use the contact details provided in advertising materials to&#xD;
      express their interest to the research team who will then provide them with a copy of the&#xD;
      participant information sheet to read through at their convenience. Those interested in&#xD;
      participating will then be invited to a pre-enrolment consultation where they will be given&#xD;
      the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about the study before being screened for&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This will involve measurements of weight and height, as&#xD;
      well as the completion of an entry criteria questionnaire, the Eating Disorder Examination&#xD;
      Questionnaire and the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire. Providing they satisfy the&#xD;
      relevant criteria they will be talked through the study and before being asked to complete an&#xD;
      informed consent form. As part of this, the procedure for an adipose tissue biopsy will be&#xD;
      discussed with the participant and they will be asked to decide whether or not they would&#xD;
      like to include this as it is an optional test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Lab Protocol (LAB 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having formally enrolled in the study, participants will be invited to begin their&#xD;
      involvement in the study with a 60 minute visit to the University of Bath following a 12 hour&#xD;
      fast. During this visit, the researcher will obtain a urine sample to check hydration levels&#xD;
      using an Osmometer, before taking measurements of height, weight and waist circumference. A&#xD;
      fasting blood sample will also be obtained using venepuncture to measure resting levels of&#xD;
      key hormones and metabolites. To conclude this visit participants will be asked to perform a&#xD;
      submaximal exercise test to calibrate the 'Actiheart' monitor being used throughout the study&#xD;
      to measure physical activity energy expenditure. For this, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      remain on a treadmill as the intensity increases over the following four stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1 - level walking at 3.2 km/h&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2 - brisk walking at 5.2 km/h&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 3 - brisk walking at 5.8 km/h with a steep gradient of +10.2%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 4 - level running at 12.5 km/h&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4 will only be included for those who are formal exercisers, as non-exercisers are&#xD;
      unlikely to be doing this kind of activity in their normal routine rendering a calibration at&#xD;
      this intensity unnecessary. Formal exercisers will be identified using the entry criteria&#xD;
      questionnaire. In addition, the treadmill protocol will be stopped earlier if the participant&#xD;
      asks to stop or if their heart rate exceeds 85% of their age-predicted maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before leaving the lab, participants will be provided with an Actiheart monitor, a small&#xD;
      device applied to the chest which measures physical activity by recording heart rate and&#xD;
      movement every minute. They will also be provided with a set of kitchen scales and a log book&#xD;
      to create a weighed record of their food and fluid intake and a set of body weight scales to&#xD;
      track their weight and help keep it stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the four week monitoring phase, participants will be asked to complete four 3-day&#xD;
      monitoring periods, each comprising two weekdays and one weekend day whilst they continue in&#xD;
      their normal dietary and exercise habits. The researchers will arrange the collection and&#xD;
      delivery of monitoring equipment where necessary. The purpose of this is firstly to ensure&#xD;
      weight stability to minimise any confounding influences, secondly to provide accurate&#xD;
      baseline values for key variables such as physical activity, and finally to ensure the&#xD;
      dietary records provided are a valid reflection of habitual intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provided the data obtained in the control phase satisfies the relevant reliability criteria,&#xD;
      participants will be invited to return to the physiology lab at least four weeks after their&#xD;
      first visit. In preparation for this, participants will be asked to avoid strenuous exercise,&#xD;
      alcohol and caffeine, before fasting overnight until they arrive at the lab the following&#xD;
      morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Intervention Lab Protocol (LAB 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning their intervention participants will be asked to attend a pre-intervention&#xD;
      lab protocol, as outlined below. Female participants will be asked to schedule this so that&#xD;
      it coincides with the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle (3-10 days after the onset of&#xD;
      menses) as this is when their hormone profiles are at their most stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of their visit participants will be asked to consume one pint of water at 06:30&#xD;
      before preparing themselves to arrive at the lab by 07:30, wearing light clothes (i.e.&#xD;
      shorts, t-shirt) with no metal components or jewellery. They will then need to provide a&#xD;
      small urine sample to check hydration levels before measurements of height, weight and waist&#xD;
      circumference are taken (NOTE: If weight varies by more than 1.0 kilograms compared to their&#xD;
      baseline measurement they may be asked to repeat the monitoring phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 07:45 participants will be asked to lie in a semi-recumbent position and rest for 30&#xD;
      minutes. This is in preparation for the measurement of resting metabolic rate and substrate&#xD;
      oxidation which will be completed at 08:15 over three 5-minute periods using indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry while the participant remains rested. Following this an intravenous cannula will&#xD;
      be fitted to the antecubital vein at the elbow for blood sampling throughout the visit. At&#xD;
      this point a 12 ml fasting blood sample will also be drawn to measure resting levels of key&#xD;
      metabolites (e.g. glucose, insulin, cholesterol, leptin, ghrelin, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 08:45, participants who have elected to include the adipose tissue biopsy will undergo&#xD;
      this procedure. If included, an area on the side of the abdomen just above the waistband will&#xD;
      be sterilised and injected with an anaesthetic (Lidocaine Hydrochloride) to numb the area.&#xD;
      Using a larger needle a 0.5 gram sample of adipose tissue will then be taken from just below&#xD;
      the skin. There will some bruising, but if left to heal there should be no scarring. Those&#xD;
      who choose not to include this biopsy will simply continue resting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 09:00 participants will be asked to complete visual analogue scales (VAS) which will&#xD;
      provide subjective measures of appetite, fullness and desire to eat. Immediately after this,&#xD;
      participants will be provided with a test breakfast of instant porridge made with whole milk&#xD;
      and sugar which they will need to consume within 10 minutes. Key measures will then be taken&#xD;
      at the following intervals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 ml blood sample - 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analogue scales - 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry) - 60. 120, 180&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Note: total urine output will also be quantified throughout the postprandial period to&#xD;
      adjust substrate oxidation values for protein oxidation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12:05 participants will be asked to place the hand of their cannulated arm in a padded&#xD;
      Perspex box which will be heated to 55 degrees. This is to allow the venous blood to be&#xD;
      arterialised which will provide a better indication of whole body glucose metabolism in the&#xD;
      test which follows. At 12:15 a 7 ml blood sample will be drawn after which the participant&#xD;
      will be asked to consume a milkshake which provides 33% of their energy requirements. Blood&#xD;
      samples (7 ml) will then be drawn every 15 minutes for the ensuing two hours to test for the&#xD;
      presence of a second meal effect. At 14:15 the final blood sample for this visit will be&#xD;
      drawn and the cannula will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conclude the pre-intervention protocol participants will be taken to a separate lab for a&#xD;
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. This is a specialized form of whole-body scan&#xD;
      which measures how a person's weight is distributed between fat and muscle tissue. It takes&#xD;
      approximately eight minutes and requires the participant to lie still throughout. It does&#xD;
      administer a small dose of ionizing radiation, but this is equivalent to 7 microSieverts&#xD;
      which is accompanied by a risk of detrimental radiation effects in the region of 1 in 10&#xD;
      million. The application of this method has been approved in this study by an independent&#xD;
      medical physics expert and a clinical radiation expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before exiting the lab participants will be randomised to one of three treatment conditions&#xD;
      outlined below. All three diet groups will last for 20 days in total, with transitions&#xD;
      between each 24 hour cycle occurring at 15:00 each day, the idea being that it will allow&#xD;
      them to consume at least one main meal per day in all cases. For the intermittent fasting&#xD;
      groups (IMF), please note that during fasted cycles participants will be asked to only&#xD;
      consume water and black tea/coffee with no milk or sugar. During feeding cycles, and&#xD;
      throughout the daily calorie restriction diet, participants will be asked to recreate their&#xD;
      control phase diet record with appropriately modified quantities to give 75%, 150% or 200% of&#xD;
      their normal calorie intake in accordance with the group they are assigned to. Where&#xD;
      recreation is not possible, participants will be asked to note the item that has been removed&#xD;
      and/or the item that was added in a new diet record that will be provided before they leave&#xD;
      the lab. Physical activity will also be monitored for the first and last week of the&#xD;
      intervention using an Actiheart monitor to examine behavioural adaptations to the diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Daily calorie restriction - Reduce energy intake by 25% on a daily basis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IMF with weight loss - Alternate between 24 hour cycles of fasting and feeding with 150%&#xD;
           of normal intake when feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IMF without weight loss - Alternate between 24 hour cycles of fasting and feeding with&#xD;
           200% of normal intake when feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 15:00 on the day of their initial lab visit, male participants will begin their assigned&#xD;
      diet, although this can be postponed by up to one week if necessary. Female participants will&#xD;
      be asked to delay this by six days in all cases in order to ensure their post-intervention&#xD;
      lab visit falls within the same phase of their menstrual cycle to minimise the impact of&#xD;
      monthly hormonal fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Lab Protocol (LAB 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of 20 consecutive 24 hour dietary cycles, participants will return&#xD;
      to their normal diet for one day (prescribed) whilst avoiding strenuous exercise, smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol and caffeine, before fasting until they arrive at the lab the following morning for&#xD;
      their post-intervention lab visit. Having consumed a pint of water at 06:30 and arrived at&#xD;
      07:30 in light clothing, participants will undergo the same lab protocol described earlier&#xD;
      for their pre-intervention visit. However, instead of being randomised to a diet group they&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a feedback questionnaire on their experience of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks after their post-intervention lab visit participants will be invited to a feedback&#xD;
      session to discuss all available results. The results from the meal test and the study as a&#xD;
      whole will follow at a later date due to logistics and cost-effectiveness. Where convenient&#xD;
      participants will also be asked to include a weight measurement to provide an indication of&#xD;
      weight loss sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once datasets are obtained for all 72 participants, the daily calorie restriction group will&#xD;
      be compared against the IMF with weight loss group. This will permit the comparison of the&#xD;
      effects of an IMF diet against the effects of a more conventional approach when matched for&#xD;
      energy deficit. The final group, IMF without weight loss, will then highlight the relative&#xD;
      contributions of weight loss and fasting-dependent mechanisms in producing any observed&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
