    <textblock>
      Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are increasing each year. There are about 1 in&#xD;
      160 children for the age group of 6-12 years old in Australia are diagnosed with ASD.&#xD;
      Children with ASD have impairment in two common areas including: i) social and communication&#xD;
      and ii) repetitive and stereotypical patterns of behaviours. These common features result in&#xD;
      behavioural problems which negatively impact children's participation in school, activities&#xD;
      of daily living and social engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need for effective interventions to overcome the behavioural problems&#xD;
      in children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of sensory integration (SI) and&#xD;
      self-regulated learning versus an activity-based control programme in reducing behavioural&#xD;
      problems in children with ASD that interfere with their daily livings, school, and social&#xD;
      engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will adopt a randomized controlled trial design with three intervention groups: I)&#xD;
      self-regulated learning, II) sensory integration and III) activity-based intervention as the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are commonly associated with behavioural&#xD;
      problems which may negatively impact on their participation in school, activities of daily&#xD;
      livings and social engagement. In order to minimise the impact on the daily functioning of&#xD;
      these children, overcoming the behavioural problems in these children is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two intervention approaches will be used in this study. These are i) self-regulated learning&#xD;
      and ii) sensory integration. Sensory integration is commonly used for children with&#xD;
      developmental problems. Self-regulated learning has been used to promote children's&#xD;
      self-directed learning and in people with brain injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the evidence towards the effectiveness of these two interventions in alleviating the&#xD;
      effects of behavioural problems on participation in school, daily and social activities for&#xD;
      children with ASD is limited and inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-regulated learning theory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The origin of self-regulated learning approach came from Albert Bandura's social cognitive&#xD;
      theory. The theory states that intervention affects one's learning by modifying the personal,&#xD;
      environmental and behavioural factors. The personal factor refers to one's beliefs and&#xD;
      attitudes. The environment factor comprises of feedback, instructions, information gathered&#xD;
      from teachers or instructors and also from the assistance of parents and peers. The&#xD;
      behavioural factor includes past performance that are socially unacceptable. The key of&#xD;
      self-regulated learning is to ensure that children make use of a cognitive strategy to&#xD;
      facilitate behaviour learning by helping them to bring problems and solutions towards own&#xD;
      consciousness. Several studies had used self-regulated learning in children and adults&#xD;
      population. It was found a significant improvement in task performance for children with&#xD;
      Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorders (ADHD). The positive effect was also shown in another&#xD;
      study showing improvements in performance measures of reading and intelligence quotient among&#xD;
      children with moderate learning disabilities. Similar results were also seen in adults with&#xD;
      brain injury in various studies. They suggested that self-regulated learning could enhance&#xD;
      the active learning of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with ASD were reported to commonly associate with self-regulation problems affecting&#xD;
      their behaviour and learning ability. However, there is no study using self-regulated&#xD;
      learning for this group of children to alleviate the effect of behavioural problems on their&#xD;
      school, daily and social participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory integration intervention theory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory integration theory was developed in 1960s and 1970s. The theory was developed to&#xD;
      target on the neurological processing of sensory information. The theory suggests that&#xD;
      purposeful behaviours may be interrupted when there is an interference of neurological&#xD;
      processing and integration of sensory information. Sensory integration interventions have&#xD;
      been widely used in varieties of settings among children with development problems. However,&#xD;
      despite the vast amount of literature that exists on the effectiveness of sensory integration&#xD;
      intervention, the overall evidence on the effectiveness on children with ASD and behavioural&#xD;
      problems remains inconclusive. Some studies showed that sensory integration was an effective&#xD;
      intervention given a positive result, but others showed no benefit or inconclusive findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies previously used sensory integration intervention seemed not using the fidelity&#xD;
      measures in the intervention design to ensure that the intervention met the requirement of&#xD;
      sensory integration theory. This could be one of the reasons for the inconclusive finding&#xD;
      made on its effectiveness. Furthermore, most of the studies used a single-case study design&#xD;
      with small sample sizes. In addition, previous studies using sensory integration did not&#xD;
      focus on alleviating the effects of behavioural problems on function in the daily livings,&#xD;
      school and social engagement for children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, will therefore, adopt a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of sensory integration and self-regulated learning interventions (comparing with&#xD;
      activity-based control intervention) in reducing the effects of behavioural problems on daily&#xD;
      living, school and social engagement in children with ASD.&#xD;
