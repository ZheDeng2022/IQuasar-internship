      This study aims to understand the role of metabolic tissues in the changes of the metabolism&#xD;
      of pregnant women and whether this contributes to some women developing metabolic diseases of&#xD;
      pregnancy such as gestational diabetes (GDM) or intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP).&#xD;
      Samples of adipose tissue will be taken when pregnant women are having caesarean section or&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a gradual change in metabolism in pregnancy. This is characterised by a switch from&#xD;
      normal levels of cholesterol, glucose and bile acids in early pregnancy to high levels of&#xD;
      lipids, glucose and bile acids in late pregnancy. This is important to ensure that nutrients&#xD;
      are provided for the growing fetus. However, it results in some women developing metabolic&#xD;
      diseases of pregnancy, e.g. gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or intrahepatic cholestasis&#xD;
      of pregnancy (ICP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to understand the role of metabolic tissues in the changes of the&#xD;
      metabolism of pregnant women. The investigators are asking for permission to collect samples&#xD;
      of adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral fat) when women are having surgical procedures.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators would like to take small samples of fat at two time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When having a caesarean section (3rd trimester of pregnancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When having laparoscopic surgery for ectopic pregnancy (1st trimester of pregnancy)&#xD;
           Samples will only be taken from women having surgery as part of their clinical care. The&#xD;
           investigators are requesting permission to collect samples from women with metabolic&#xD;
           diseases of pregnancy (GDM and ICP) and matched controls (women with uncomplicated&#xD;
           pregnancy). The investigators will also want to collect blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence from non-pregnant individuals (and from animal studies) that the adipose&#xD;
      tissue in different parts of the body function in different ways. Subcutaneous fat is&#xD;
      typically a fat storage tissue while visceral adipose tissue plays a role in metabolism of&#xD;
      fat. The investigators' studies in mice suggest that these different fat stores function&#xD;
      differently in pregnancy, and they may play a role in the metabolic changes that cause&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia and susceptibility to diabetes mellitus. The investigators aim to identify&#xD;
      where there are similar changes in function of adipose tissue in human pregnancy, and whether&#xD;
      this contributes to the development of GDM and ICP.&#xD;
