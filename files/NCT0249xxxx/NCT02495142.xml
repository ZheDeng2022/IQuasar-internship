  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is associated with long-term weight loss, as well as short-term&#xD;
      improvements in obesity-related medical comorbidities. However, a significant proportion of&#xD;
      patients fail to lose sufficient weight, or experience significant weight regain. Although no&#xD;
      robust predictors of response have been identified, pilot data that will be presented and&#xD;
      reviewed suggest that surgery has profound effects on eating behaviors and psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning, and that these factors may affect postoperative weight control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present investigation capitalizes on the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery&#xD;
      (LABS) consortium to conduct an in-depth examination of the psychosocial aspects of surgery&#xD;
      among a geographically, ethnically, and racially diverse sample of men and women undergoing&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. This project unites experts in the areas of psychopathology, eating&#xD;
      behaviors and quality of life to conduct a naturalistic study using state-of-the-art&#xD;
      assessment tools; to document the relationships among psychosocial factors; and to examine&#xD;
      psychosocial predictors of surgical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective. Despite the obvious impact of bariatric surgery procedures on intake, no&#xD;
      study to date has included a careful assessment of psychological factors, feeding patterns,&#xD;
      energy intake and eating problems in this group of patients longitudinally. The Investigators&#xD;
      believe that a careful examination of the structure of eating behavior and eating problems&#xD;
      (e.g. vomiting) would be very helpful in guiding bariatric surgeons and dieticians who work&#xD;
      with this group of patients in terms of dietary advice and recommendations, and with the&#xD;
      prediction of eating problems and poor nutrient intake in the subgroup that develops such&#xD;
      problems. This study involves prospective assessment of psychosocial outcomes of surgery by&#xD;
      adding a supplemental battery to the LABS-2 assessment schedule. Conducting assessments at&#xD;
      three of the LABS clinical sites assures the geographic, ethnic, and racial diversity of the&#xD;
      sample, and hence enhances the potential to identify a subgroup or subgroups of patients&#xD;
      susceptible to poor outcomes after surgery and the generalizability of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would also include an evaluation of psychopathological and behavioral variables&#xD;
      that might impact on weight loss and weight regain, and psychosocial complications&#xD;
      post-operatively, as well as quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to obtain detailed information that will allow a careful&#xD;
      assessment of psychopathology, quality of life and eating behavior pre-surgically and at&#xD;
      regular intervals for up to 7 years after the surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators believe that the instruments and procedures selected will allow a detailed&#xD;
      examination of psychopathology, eating pathology and quality of life in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators believe that the measures and tasks added at year 7 will allow the&#xD;
      examination of theories of affect regulation, cognitive control, and reward processing in&#xD;
      understanding postsurgical outcomes regarding pathological eating behavior and&#xD;
      alcohol/substance use and their shared similarities as well as underlying neurobiological&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
