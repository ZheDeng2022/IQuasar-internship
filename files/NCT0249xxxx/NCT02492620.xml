  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the investigators hypothesis that participants treated with Ferric Citrate (FC) during&#xD;
      the non-dialysis CKD stage (4/5) with sufficient duration prior to initiating RRT, will&#xD;
      result in improved biochemical control of anemia (Hb, TSAT) and mineral metabolism (P, FGF23)&#xD;
      and furthermore, will result in a reduced need for ESA and intravenous iron. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize that effective treatment of anemia and mineral metabolism&#xD;
      with FC in the pre-dialysis and transition period will result in improved physical&#xD;
      functioning, reduced hospitalization and reduced total cost of care when compared to&#xD;
      participants receiving contemporaneously provided standard of care therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an up to 50 week, phase 3, clinical trial in patients with estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (eGFR) ≤ 20 ml/min/1.73m2. It will be comprised of an up to 36-week&#xD;
      non-dialysis period (NDP), or until such time as subjects require renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (RRT) with dialysis when they will immediately roll into a 12-week dialysis period (DP). The&#xD;
      study will consist of up to 16 clinic visits over a maximum period of 50 weeks. There will be&#xD;
      a screening period of up to 14 days after which subjects will be randomized into the NDP in a&#xD;
      2:1 ratio to receive either FC (n=150) or SOC (n=75). Each eligible participant will be&#xD;
      randomized to either fixed dose open-label ferric citrate (FC) or standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      treatment. Participants randomized to SOC will receive care directed by their primary&#xD;
      nephrologist throughout the study duration with the only restriction being that they cannot&#xD;
      receive treatment with FC during the NDP or DP. Participants randomized to FC will receive it&#xD;
      throughout the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      220 participants were screened to randomize 200 subjects 2:1 (FC:SOC) into the NDP. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that 35-45% of participants will reach the dialysis period (DP) during the 36&#xD;
      week follow up. Participants who initiate RRT with dialysis will enter the Dialysis Period&#xD;
      (DP) during which those participants previously assigned to ferric citrate will continue to&#xD;
      receive open-label ferric citrate and those previously assigned to SOC will receive&#xD;
      open-label, non-FC phosphate binders at the discretion of their treating physician. During&#xD;
      this period all participants will be treated to standard of care guidelines which suggest&#xD;
      that if serum phosphate is above the upper limit of normal (4.5 mg/dL), it should be reduced.&#xD;
      During the DP, dose of P binders, use of ESA, intravenous iron and blood transfusions will be&#xD;
      at the discretion of the primary treating nephrologist. Participants assigned to the SOC&#xD;
      treatment arm may not receive FC at any point during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only participants that begin permanent RRT with dialysis will be eligible to enter the 12&#xD;
      week DP. Participants that do not begin RRT after 9 months participation in the NDP will be&#xD;
      deemed to have reach the end of study and have end of study procedures performed.&#xD;
