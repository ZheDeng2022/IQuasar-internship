    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine&#xD;
      produced by Beijing Minhai Biotechnology Co., Ltd., a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-controlled phase III clinical trial is planned to conduct in healthy infants aged 2&#xD;
      months in China.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two arms. 1200 healthy infants aged 2 months will be randomly assigned (1:1) to&#xD;
      receive an experimental vaccine or a comparator vaccine in Month 0,2 and 4 (primary&#xD;
      vaccination). All of them will receive a fourth dose as booster vaccination in Month 10.&#xD;
