  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, phase II trial in previously treated patients with MPM who&#xD;
      are considered candidates for immunotherapy and repeat thoracoscopies/transthoracic biopsies.&#xD;
      Nivolumab will be administered 3 mg/kg q2 weeks by intravenous injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of nivolumab as monotherapy will improve DCR form 20% to 40% at 12 weeks&#xD;
      when compared to DCR of patients treated with best supportive care based on historical&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
