  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      JNJ-42165279 in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) with anxiety symptoms who&#xD;
      have had inadequate response to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor&#xD;
      (SSRI) or serotonergic/noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment&#xD;
      that the participant receives), placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study in&#xD;
      participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress. Participants who had&#xD;
      treatment initiated with a SSRI/SNRI allowed by the protocol will be evaluated at the&#xD;
      investigation site. The site assessment will be reviewed and validated by an independent&#xD;
      central rater. The review will include the clinical history of MDD, SSRI/SNRI treatment of&#xD;
      adequate dose and duration for the current episode of depression, and current symptom&#xD;
      severity on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17). Enrolled participants will be&#xD;
      maintained on SSRI/SNRI treatment throughout the study to determine whether additional&#xD;
      treatment with JNJ-4216579 can reduce the symptoms of MDD with anxious distress.The study&#xD;
      will consist of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of up to 4 weeks, an 11-week double-blind&#xD;
      Treatment Phase, and a 3-week post-treatment (follow up) Phase. The double-blind treatment&#xD;
      Phase of the trial will consist of 3 periods. The first period is a placebo lead-in of&#xD;
      double-blind duration, after which participants will enter the treatment period when they&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to JNJ-42165279 or continuation on placebo for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants who successfully complete the treatment period prior to the end of Week 11, will&#xD;
      be treated with placebo for the remaining time of the double-blind phase of the study, which&#xD;
      will vary depending on the duration of the placebo lead-in for the specific participant. The&#xD;
      total study duration for each participant will be approximately 18 weeks. Efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of JNJ-42165279 will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS17 is a clinician-administered rating scale designed to assess the severity of symptoms in participants diagnosed with depression with a score range of 0 to 52. Questions are related to symptoms such as depressed mood, guilt feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels and weight loss. The higher the score, the more severe the depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAM-A6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A6 is a 6-item subscale derived from the original Hamilton Anxiety scale (HAM-A). The rating scale measures the severity of anxiety symptomatology. Higher scores represent more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint on the SIGH-A (Structured Interview Guide of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale 14-item HAM-A) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The (HAM-A) is a 14-item scale designed to measure anxiety in individuals. Each question reflects a symptom of anxiety and physical as well as mental symptoms are represented. The answers range from 0 which signifies a complete lack of that symptom to 4, which indicates a very severe show of anxiety with that symptom.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAM-D6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D6 is a 6-item subscale derived from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17). The rating scale measures the severity of depressive symptomatology. Higher scores represent more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) Anxiety/Somatization Factor Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The anxiety/somatization factor total score derived from HDRS scale. It includes six items from the original 17-item version: psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight. The scale measures the severity of anxious depression. The higher the score, the more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 2 to 4 hours post-dose on Day 14, 35, 63 and 77</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-t) is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to Dosing Interval (t). AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body.</description>
