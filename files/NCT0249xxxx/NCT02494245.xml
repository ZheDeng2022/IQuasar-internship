  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the most common disabling conditions worldwide. The various physical&#xD;
      impairments that arise from stroke may encourage a physically inactive lifestyle (Michael et&#xD;
      al. 2005). Ninety percent of stroke survivors have some functional disability with reduced&#xD;
      mobility being the major impairment (Gresham et al. 1975). Stroke survivors generally spend&#xD;
      less time physically active and more time sedentary than their age-matched healthy&#xD;
      counterparts (Alzahrani et al. 2011; Michael and Macko 2007; Rand et al. 2010) Physical&#xD;
      inactivity following a stroke is associated with decreased muscle strength and cardiovascular&#xD;
      fitness, decreased ability to perform activities of daily living and a heightened risk for&#xD;
      recurrent stroke and cardiovascular disease (Ivey et al. 2005). Cardiovascular disease is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death in chronic stroke. Inactivity and low cardiovascular fitness are two&#xD;
      of the modifiable risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. Activities which&#xD;
      promote mobility and fitness are therefore vital for the prevention of further cardiovascular&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previous Chest, Heart and Stroke, Scotland (CHSS) funded pilot study demonstrated that&#xD;
      community dwelling stroke survivors are significantly less physically active and spend&#xD;
      significantly more time sedentary compared to healthy, matched controls. (Paul et al. 2015).&#xD;
      The investigators have also reported that using the STARFISH smartphone app (described below)&#xD;
      for six weeks had a positive effect on physical activity These pilot results support the&#xD;
      development of a fully powered, randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starfish description Research team members have developed STARFISH, a smartphone app, which&#xD;
      aims to encourage users to become more physically active. The sensors within a standard&#xD;
      smartphone record the number of steps taken per day by the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STARFISH is undertaken in groups of four to facilitate social support and each group member&#xD;
      receives a personalised daily step count target. Each person is represented by coloured fish,&#xD;
      and participants can see their own and other group members' fish in a fish tank on their&#xD;
      smartphone. When the participant is walking, their fish swims and blows bubbles and, as&#xD;
      participants progress towards their daily step count target, their fish's fins and tail grow.&#xD;
      When all group members reach their target on five days of the week, the group is rewarded by&#xD;
      another sea creature appearing in their fish tank (e.g. a seahorse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare objectively measured physical activity in community dwelling stroke survivors who&#xD;
      have undertaken a four month physical activity intervention using the STARFISH application&#xD;
      with a control group receiving four months of usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare objectively measured sedentary time, activity profiles, walking endurance,&#xD;
           walking speed, activities of daily living (ADL), fatigue, anxiety and depression,&#xD;
           quality of life and metabolic health-risk biomarkers in community dwelling stroke&#xD;
           survivors who have undertaken a four month physical activity intervention using the&#xD;
           STARFISH application with a control group receiving four months of usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if the effects of the STARFISH intervention are evident two months after&#xD;
           completion of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods The design is a single blind, parallel randomised control trial (RCT). An&#xD;
      assessor, who will be blinded to the group allocation will perform the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Participants Using pilot study data the investigators estimated that the RCT will&#xD;
      need 58 subjects in each group to detect, with 80% power a 30% increase in step count,&#xD;
      between intervention and control groups, at a 5% level of significance. Therefore to allow&#xD;
      for some drop out, 128 people who fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and who give&#xD;
      written informed consent will be recruited to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through a number of routes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  through Chest Heart &amp; Stroke (CHSS) affiliated groups in the West of Scotland&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in NHS Lanarkshire through the stroke liaison nurses who will identify appropriate&#xD;
           patients from stroke audit system and through the Lifestyle Group .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in NHS Ayrshire and Arran through the physiotherapists and stroke liaison nurses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in NHS GG&amp;C through the Community Stroke Team Participants identified in any one of&#xD;
           routes described above will be given a Participant Information Sheet (PIS), from the&#xD;
           clinician or CHSS group co-ordinator. In NHS Lanarkshire potential participants&#xD;
           identified from the database will be sent a letter and PIS from the Lead Stroke&#xD;
           Clinician. Those interested in taking part in the study will be asked to contact the&#xD;
           researcher using the contact details on the PIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following discussion with the researcher those willing to take part will be invited to attend&#xD;
      Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) clinical research facility, NHS Lanarkshire clinical research&#xD;
      facility and NHS Ayrshire &amp; Arran clinical research facility . At the initial visit the&#xD;
      participant will meet both researcher and assessor. In order to keep assessor blind to the&#xD;
      group allocation the researcher and the assessor will see participants separately in&#xD;
      different rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will see the researcher first, where they will have the opportunity to ask&#xD;
      further questions, if they then agree to taking part in the study they will be asked to sign&#xD;
      a consent form. Consent will also be sought to contact participant's GPs to inform them of&#xD;
      their participation in the research study. For participants recruited from CHSS groups their&#xD;
      GPs agreement will be sought for their participation in this study. All participants will be&#xD;
      informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who provide their informed consent will then be directed to the assessor to undergo&#xD;
      baseline measures. All baseline measures will be made prior to group allocation, Participants&#xD;
      will then be directed to see the researcher who will randomise them to one of the groups. The&#xD;
      patients will be recruited in groups of 8. For the randomisation process a list of random&#xD;
      numbers will be generated using an Excel spreadsheet. Each number will then be printed out&#xD;
      and placed in identical, opaque envelopes, even numbers represent the Intervention group and&#xD;
      odd numbers the Control group. Participants will be given consecutive envelopes as they are&#xD;
      recruited so that two groups of 4 participants will be formed with each randomisation stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is a four month physical activity intervention using the STARFISH app with&#xD;
      the aim of increasing the participant's number of steps above their baseline value.&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the intervention group will be given a mobile phone and asked to&#xD;
      carry the phone for seven days to establish their normal level of physical activity (PA).&#xD;
      They will work in groups of four (as explained above) but each participant will have their&#xD;
      own individualised step count target. The initial step count target will be created by adding&#xD;
      10% to the mean number of steps per day recorded on the phone. At the end of each week, step&#xD;
      counts will be reviewed from the data on the server. If the participant reaches their step&#xD;
      count target on at least five days of the week, then their target will be increased remotely&#xD;
      by 5% for the following week, up to a maximum increase of 3000 steps above baseline&#xD;
      (Fitzsimons et al. 2008). Where a participant fails to reach their step count target, it&#xD;
      remains unchanged for the following week. Participants will be notified about their step&#xD;
      count target change via a message displayed on their smartphone screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each intervention group will meet, as a group of four participants, seven days after their&#xD;
      baseline assessment. At this visit the researcher will explain STARFISH app and provide&#xD;
      participants with an instruction manual to refer to if needed. Initial step count targets&#xD;
      will be calculated (as described above), agreed with participants and set. The Intervention&#xD;
      group will then meet with the researcher 2 months later to discuss their progress, ask any&#xD;
      questions or raise any concerns. The researcher will meet the intervention group at the end&#xD;
      of the programme, before their second assessment (at 4 months) to collect their smartphones.&#xD;
      At this visit a focus group, with the STARFISH group of four participants, will be undertaken&#xD;
      to explore participants' views of the acceptability and usability of STARFISH app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention period participants will be given contact numbers of the researcher&#xD;
      to call if they experience any problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the control group will be given a booklet with general advice on&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be sent a lay summary of the study at the end. Outcome measures will be&#xD;
      taken at baseline, 4 months (end of the intervention, primary end point) and 6 months (two&#xD;
      months after the intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise all variables at each time point. Group&#xD;
      differences and interaction effects for each variable will be assessed using a two-factor&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA model with a Greehosue-Geisser correction factor. Model assumptions&#xD;
      will be checked and if required appropriate transformation will be used. Where a significant&#xD;
      Time effect is found Tukey's post hoc test will be used. Effect sizes will be reported as&#xD;
      will estimates of observed power. All analysis will be performed on IBM SPSS v22 and the&#xD;
      level of significance will be set at 5%.&#xD;
