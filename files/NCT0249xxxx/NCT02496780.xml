      Insulin replacement therapy may be effective in breaking the cycle of protein catabolism,&#xD;
      undernutrition and overall clinical deterioration in pre-diabetic, insulin insufficient CF&#xD;
      youth because of its potent anabolic effect. A significant number of CF patients might&#xD;
      benefit from this therapeutic approach with a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin insufficiency related to pancreatic fibrosis and β-cell dysfunction is present in&#xD;
      almost every cystic fibrosis (CF) patient. Progressive abnormalities in insulin secretion&#xD;
      begin in childhood, and, in adults, CF related diabetes (CFRD) is eventually present in more&#xD;
      than half of the CF population. CFRD is associated with weight loss, protein catabolism, loss&#xD;
      of lean body mass (LBM), and early death from lung disease and malnutrition. The negative&#xD;
      consequences of diabetes are just the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot;, since clinical deterioration has&#xD;
      been documented to begin in the pre-diabetic period. Non-diabetic glucose tolerance&#xD;
      abnormalities in CF are associated with protein catabolism, weight loss and lung function&#xD;
      decline, all of which correlate with the severity of insulin secretory defects, suggesting a&#xD;
      key pathologic role for insulin insufficiency. Insulin is a potent anabolic hormone, critical&#xD;
      for maintenance of body weight and muscle mass. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial,&#xD;
      insulin therapy improved body mass index (BMI) and LBM in patients with very early CFRD (CFRD&#xD;
      without fasting hyperglycemia), and this is now standard care for these patients. There is&#xD;
      growing preliminary evidence that insulin therapy is beneficial even earlier, in CF patients&#xD;
      with pre-diabetes due to insulin insufficiency. Given the universal prevalence of insulin&#xD;
      insufficiency in CF, the high lifetime risk of developing diabetes, the clinical impact of&#xD;
      insulin insufficiency on protein catabolism and survival in CF, and the critical importance&#xD;
      of maintaining body weight and LBM in this population, there is an urgent need to determine&#xD;
      whether insulin replacement therapy should be instituted for anabolic purposes prior to the&#xD;
      actual onset of diabetes and, if so, to ascertain the optimal regimen. The current protocol&#xD;
      describes a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether insulin therapy&#xD;
      improves protein catabolism in youth with CF and abnormal glucose tolerance, and to explore&#xD;
      differences in efficacy between multiple daily pre-meal insulin dosing (as is currently&#xD;
      standard for early CFRD) versus a more convenient once daily basal insulin dose (as has been&#xD;
      used in small uncontrolled pilot studies). The findings of this study will provide a&#xD;
      mechanistic rationale for instituting insulin in youth with CF and pre-diabetes, and will&#xD;
      inform both research studies and clinical practice as to the best regimen for insulin&#xD;
      delivery in this population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, age 10-25 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A standard routine annual OGTT performed within 12 months of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Abnormal glucose tolerance, with a fasting glucose level &lt;126 mg/dl and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The 1-hr OGTT glucose is ≥200 mg/dl but the 2-hr glucose is &lt;140 (INDET), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The 2-hour OGTT glucose is 140-199 mg/dl (impaired glucose tolerance, IGT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of CFRD, Consensus Conference definition (45)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous organ transplant, or transplant imminent during study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. BMI percentile &gt;95&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (nasal or inhaled glucocorticoids are&#xD;
             acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Therapy with growth hormone or Megace&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Nighttime continuous drip gastrostomy/jejunostomy feedings&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy or breast-feeding or plans to become pregnant during study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any change in medications during the 3 months prior to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Exception: the new corrector/potentiator combination drug lumacaftor/ivacaftor is&#xD;
             expected to get FDA approval in early 2015, and most CF patients with severe&#xD;
             genotypes, including many eligible for this proposal, will receive this drug. This is&#xD;
             not a contraindication to participation in the current proposal (and participation in&#xD;
             other studies is not contraindicated in the PROSPECT post-marketing drug study).&#xD;
             Though the primary effects of the combination therapy appear to be apparent after 1&#xD;
             month, we will wait 6 months after initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor before&#xD;
             enrollment in this study to make sure subjects are in a steady state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any anticipated change in medication during the 3 month study period&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Acute illness in the 6 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
