      The purpose of this study is to determine if avoidance of peanut by children with positive&#xD;
      allergy testing to peanut in the first 5 years of life increases the likelihood of developing&#xD;
      a persistent peanut allergy by age 5 years. To answer this question, the investigators need&#xD;
      to determine which children with positive allergy testing to peanut have reactions after&#xD;
      eating peanut (allergic to peanut) and which are able to tolerate eating peanut (not&#xD;
      allergic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct double-blind placebo-controlled peanut challenges (gold&#xD;
      standard for peanut allergy diagnosis) for CHILD study (http://www.canadianchildstudy.ca)&#xD;
      participants who had positive skin prick testing to peanut at ages 1, 3 or 5 years (in other&#xD;
      words, children who are sensitized to peanut, but may or may not be allergic to peanut) and&#xD;
      who are avoiding peanut without ever having had a reaction or whose history suggests that&#xD;
      they may have outgrown a known peanut allergy. These challenges will not change a child's&#xD;
      ability to tolerate peanut, but will determine if children who are avoiding peanut are&#xD;
      allergic to peanut (and need to continue avoiding peanut) or clinically tolerant to peanut&#xD;
      (and may continue to eat peanut after passing the challenge).&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food allergy has reached epidemic levels in Canada and peanut allergy is the most prevalent&#xD;
      and one of the more persistent food allergies among Canadian children and adults. Avoidance&#xD;
      or later introduction of peanut has been proposed as a possible cause of the increased rates&#xD;
      of peanut sensitization and allergy. Although delaying the introduction of peanut into&#xD;
      children's diets is no longer recommended, many parents continue to worry about introducing&#xD;
      peanut and some will not introduce peanut into their child's diet without a negative skin&#xD;
      prick test to peanut. However, some children who have never had a reaction to peanut can eat&#xD;
      and tolerate peanut despite being sensitized (having a positive skin prick test) to peanut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if avoidance of peanut by children with positive&#xD;
      skin prick testing to peanut in the first 5 years of life increases the likelihood of&#xD;
      developing a persistent peanut allergy by age 5 years. To answer this question, the&#xD;
      investigators need to determine which children with positive skin prick testing to peanut&#xD;
      have reactions after eating peanut (allergic to peanut) and which are able to tolerate eating&#xD;
      peanut (not allergic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct double-blind placebo-controlled peanut challenges among 5-year-old children&#xD;
           who are sensitized to and avoiding peanut, to determine if they are allergic to peanut&#xD;
           (and need to continue avoiding peanut) or clinically tolerant to peanut (and may&#xD;
           continue to eat peanut after passing the challenge)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the relative risk of developing peanut allergy among peanut-sensitized&#xD;
           children who have been eating versus avoiding peanut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenge Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges are the gold standard clinical practice for&#xD;
      diagnosis of food allergies, and involve the child undergoing separate challenges to the food&#xD;
      and to a placebo so that the child, parents, and physicians and nurses administering the&#xD;
      challenge are masked regarding which challenge is to the food and which is to the placebo.&#xD;
      All children will undergo challenges to both peanut and placebo, in a randomized order. These&#xD;
      challenges will not change a child's ability to tolerate peanut, but will determine if&#xD;
      children who are avoiding peanut are allergic to peanut (and need to continue avoiding&#xD;
      peanut) or clinically tolerant to peanut (and may continue to eat peanut after passing the&#xD;
      challenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenges will be conducted in clinical units set up for food challenges, by a research&#xD;
      nurse and a pediatric allergist with expertise and experience in managing food allergies and&#xD;
      oral food challenges. Each child will undergo a challenge to peanut on one day and a&#xD;
      challenge to placebo on another day. The peanut will be concealed in a vehicle, such as a&#xD;
      shake or smoothie. One of the challenges will contain peanut and the concealing vehicle and&#xD;
      the other challenge will contain only the vehicle. The challenge foods will be prepared by a&#xD;
      team member who is not otherwise involved in the challenges. A study worker not involved in&#xD;
      the challenges will also be in charge of randomizing the two challenges to peanut or placebo&#xD;
      and of decoding the challenge food identity after both challenges are completed. The&#xD;
      children, their families, the research nurse and the pediatric allergist will not know&#xD;
      whether the challenge food contains the peanut or the placebo until both challenges have been&#xD;
      completed. This procedure helps to distinguish symptoms that occur due to anxiety (equally&#xD;
      likely to occur in both the peanut and placebo challenges) and those that are a reaction to&#xD;
      peanut (occur only during the peanut challenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who do not develop any symptoms of anaphylaxis (e.g. hives, swelling, trouble&#xD;
      breathing, vomiting, abdominal pain or changes in their level of consciousness) during the&#xD;
      challenge or the 2-hour observation period after the challenge will have passed the challenge&#xD;
      and will be considered clinically tolerant; they will be encouraged to continue eating peanut&#xD;
      at home at least once per week. Children who develop any of these symptoms during the&#xD;
      challenge containing peanut will be considered allergic, especially if symptoms did not occur&#xD;
      during the challenge containing only the vehicle.&#xD;

&#xD;
        CHILD study participants will be ineligible for challenge if&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They have never had a positive skin prick test or allergen-specific IgE level to&#xD;
             peanut&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. They are eating 8-10 g of peanut at least once per month, despite having had a&#xD;
             positive skin prick test or allergen-specific IgE level to peanut&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Their family has declined to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. They have a peanut skin prick test wheal size &gt;8mm and/or a peanut-specific IgE &gt;15&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. They have a history of anaphylaxis to peanut or a challenge-proven diagnosis of peanut&#xD;
             allergy within the past 1-2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. They have uncontrolled asthma or any other contraindication to performing a DBPC food&#xD;
             challenge on the day of challenge. These children may be rescheduled if their asthma&#xD;
             control improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Blood Draw Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        CHILD study participants will be eligible for blood draw if they&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have completed their 5-year-old CHILD Study visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Are or have been sensitized to peanut i.e. have had a positive skin prick test (wheal&#xD;
             diameter at least 2 mm greater than the negative control) and/or allergen-specific IgE&#xD;
