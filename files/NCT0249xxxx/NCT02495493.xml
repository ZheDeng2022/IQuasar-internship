      Currently, for further improved survival outcome, new cytotoxic compounds such as irinotecan&#xD;
      and docetaxel have been combined with 5-FU/cisplatin. However, triplet regimen often burdened&#xD;
      with higher toxicity and serious neutropenic infection. Therefore, future trials in&#xD;
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings need to incorporate new molecular agents which improve&#xD;
      efficacy, but less toxicity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Though a significant decrease in its incidence over the last 70 years, gastric cancer remains&#xD;
      a significant health problem worldwide. Despite the R0 resection and adjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      the prognosis for patients with locally advanced GC remains poor, with 5-year survival rate&#xD;
      below 60%. Therefore, active strategy to improve survival outcome is ongoing in gastric&#xD;
      cancer. Due to the nature of gastric surgery, postsurgical recovery can be avoided by the&#xD;
      administration of systemic therapy and/or radiation prior to the surgical procedure.&#xD;
      Furthermore, preoperative therapy has the theoretical advantage of treating an untouched&#xD;
      tumor (lack of treatment-induced resistance), with intact vascularization and without&#xD;
      fibrotic remodeling of the tumor bed due to surgical trauma. These considerations addressed&#xD;
      clinical trials incorporating neoadjuvant treatment for gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative chemotherapy proved superiority to surgery alone in esophagogastric junction&#xD;
      cancer Regarding the pattern of failure, locoregional recurrence after surgical resection has&#xD;
      been reported 20-50% of cases. To improve local control and survival outcome,&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy in the neoadjuvant or preoperative setting has been widely applied. In&#xD;
      recently published meta-analysis, preoperative chemoradiotherapy combined with surgery&#xD;
      significantly reduced the 5-year death rate compared to surgery alone (OR 0.57, P=0.001).&#xD;
      Ajani et al reported phase II preoperative chemoradiotherapy (5-fluorouracil/cisplatin and 45&#xD;
      Gy radiotherapy) for localized gastric cancer. Among the 34 stage II/III gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients, 30% had pathologic complete response and 24% had pathologic partial response (&lt;10%&#xD;
      residual carcinoma). Lowy et al also demonstrated 11% and 63% of complete, partial pathologic&#xD;
      responses and preoperative chemoradiotherapy was safe and well tolerated. Based on those&#xD;
      rationale, 28 clinical trials with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is ongoing for gastric cancer&#xD;
      (clinicaltrial.gov) and the investigators' center is also conducting neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy trial for localized gastric cancer (NCT01269255).Currently, for further&#xD;
      improved survival outcome, new cytotoxic compounds such as irinotecan and docetaxel have been&#xD;
      combined with 5-FU/cisplatin. However, triplet regimen often burdened with higher toxicity&#xD;
      and serious neutropenic infection. Therefore, future trials in neoadjuvant and adjuvant&#xD;
      settings need to incorporate new molecular agents which improve efficacy, but less toxicity.&#xD;
