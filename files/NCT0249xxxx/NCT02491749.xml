      Ultra-fast track anaesthesia (UFTA) aims at immediate extubation of cardiac surgical patients&#xD;
      at the end of the operation. This study compares the effect of UFTA versus continued&#xD;
      postoperative mechanical ventilation on the ICU length of stay (LOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Fifty two elective adult patients were randomly allocated into UFTA and conventional&#xD;
      groups by computer-generated random numbers. Redo operations, pre-operative intubation,&#xD;
      uncontrolled diabetes, shock/LVEF &lt;45%, PASP &gt;55mmHg, creatinine clearance &lt;50 ml min-1,&#xD;
      haemodynamic instability, or those with concerns of postoperative bleeding were excluded.&#xD;
      Pre- and intra-operative management was similar and Logistic EuroSCORE II was calculated for&#xD;
      all. Intra-operatively, haemodynamic parameters, urine output, SPO2, arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis (ABG), 5-lead ECG, operative- bypass- and cross clamp time, and opioid consumption&#xD;
      were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients were compared during their ICU stay. Data were analysed by&#xD;
      χ²/Fischer exact, unpaired student's t-test, univariate two-group repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      with post hoc Dunnett's test, and Mann-Whitney U tests as appropriate. p&lt;0.05 was considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;

      Background The question whether early extubation leads to shorter post-operative length of&#xD;
      ICU stay has rapidly gained importance over the past few decades considering the correlation&#xD;
      between length of hospital stay and costs. Although some investigations did not find a&#xD;
      difference between post-operative length of stay in early and late extubated patients, most&#xD;
      observational studies and small randomized clinical trials showed significant benefits for&#xD;
      early extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultra-fast track anesthesia (UFTA) aims at immediate extubation of cardiac surgical patients&#xD;
      at the end of the operation. There are few contraindications to the adoption of early&#xD;
      extubation protocols. Generally most cardiac surgical patients, presenting for either&#xD;
      elective or emergent surgery, have adequate ventilatory function. If patients were not&#xD;
      intubated and ventilated preoperatively, they are not likely to require prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study was to assess the impact of adopting UFTA on the length of ICU&#xD;
      stay of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. The incidence of complications during&#xD;
      their ICU stay was recorded as secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods From February, 2011, through October, 2013, 52 consecutive patients underwent open&#xD;
      heart surgeries and were managed by the same anesthesiologists. Adult patients (&gt;18yrs)&#xD;
      scheduled for primary elective cardiac operations were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded from the study were patients undergoing emergency/redo operations, those already&#xD;
      intubated preoperatively, patients with preoperative uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1C &gt;5.9&#xD;
      mg/dl), cardiogenic shock, poor left ventricular function (ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 45%),&#xD;
      severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) &gt; 55 mmHg), severe&#xD;
      renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CC) &lt; 50 ml.min-1) or regular dialysis, and patients&#xD;
      deliberately kept intubated for hemodynamic instability, and/or concerns of postoperative&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Based on two-tailed α error probability of 0.05 and β error&#xD;
      probability of 0.2 (power of 80%), a total sample size of 52 patients equally allocated into&#xD;
      two groups was required to detect a presumed minimum clinically significant effect size d of&#xD;
      0.8 in length of ICU stay. Statistical power calculations was performed using computer&#xD;
      program G*Power 3 for Windows. (Franz Faul, Universität Kiel, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization participants were randomly allocated to either the UFTA group or conventional&#xD;
      group using computer generated random numbers and opaque sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative evaluation Routine preoperative investigations included complete blood picture,&#xD;
      bleeding profile, liver and kidney functions tests, fasting blood glucose level, chest X-ray,&#xD;
      twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiography, and coronary angiography&#xD;
      if indicated. Logistic EuroSCORE II (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation)&#xD;
      was calculated to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups received their usual medications, excluding oral hypoglycemic and&#xD;
      ACEI and ARB's, up to the time of surgery. Premedication with intravenous midazolam, 1-3 mg&#xD;
      was given to patients upon arrival to the anesthesia bay 20-30 min before admission to the&#xD;
      operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring was achieved using standard 5-lead ECG, invasive arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse oximeter, and nasopharyngeal temperature probe, and transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of anesthesia Induction of anesthesia was performed with midazolam 0.03-0.05 mg/kg,&#xD;
      fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg, and propofol 1-2 mg/kg. Orotracheal intubation was facilitated by&#xD;
      atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane titrated to an expired MAC&#xD;
      between 1-1.5, and a continuous infusion of morphine at 10 to 20 mcg/kg/h. Additional doses&#xD;
      of fentanyl and atracurium were given as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard median sternotomy was performed for all but one patient, who had mitral valve&#xD;
      replacement through lateral thoracotomy. One patient had off-pump coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post bypass fluid balance was maintained with warmed lactated/acetated Ringer's to maintain&#xD;
      patient's nasopharyngeal temperature above 35.5°C. Hemodynamic instability (defined as&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg and/or mean arterial pressure less than 60 mmHg),&#xD;
      if encountered, was corrected with intravenous bolus doses of ﬂuids, table positioning,&#xD;
      and/or norepinephrine boluses 4-8 mcg per dose. While closing the subcutaneous tissue,&#xD;
      patients received intravenous paracetamol 15 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of surgery, for UFTA group, the inhalational anesthetic concentration was&#xD;
      reduced gradually to 0.4 expired MAC. If patients met the preset extubation criteria (SpO2 &gt;&#xD;
      95% with FiO2 &lt; 0.6, ETCO2 &lt; 50 mmHg, spontaneous respiratory rate &lt; 24/min), and train of&#xD;
      four (TOF) &gt; 90%, residual muscle relaxation was antagonized with neostigmine and atropine&#xD;
      0.05 mg/kg and 0.02 mg/kg respectively. The trachea then was extubated and oxygen delivered&#xD;
      via open face mask 10 L/min during the transfer from the operating theatre to the ICU.&#xD;
      Patients were questioned about recall of intraoperative events 12 and 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in the conventional group, patients were transferred to the ICU intubated and&#xD;
      sedated with propofol infusion 50 - 70 mcg/kg/min and morphine 10 - 20 mcg/kg/hr and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per the local ICU protocol and after discontinuation of sedation, patients were judged&#xD;
      eligible for extubation if they were awake and able to respond comprehensively to simple&#xD;
      verbal commands, provided that they were hemodynamically stable and had normal ventilatory&#xD;
      mechanics, acid-base status, PaO2, and PaCO2 at an inspired FiO2 of 0.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain control Postoperative pain management was multimodal. Each patient&#xD;
      received a combination of the following treatments: continuous intravenous morphine 10-20&#xD;
      mcg/kg/hr, intravenous morphine on demand 0.05mg/kg (if pain scored 4 or more on a 0 to 10&#xD;
      pain scale with lockout time of 10 min), and intravenous paracetamol 15 mg/kg every 6 hours.&#xD;
      Pain was assessed with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), every 6 hours for the first 24 hours of&#xD;
      their ICU stay, by the intensivist in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Preoperative data included (1) demographic data (2) preoperative diagnosis&#xD;
      and comorbidities (3) preoperative investigations and (4) logistic Euro SCORE II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, urine output, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2),&#xD;
      arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), standard 5 lead ECG analysis with ST segment analysis,&#xD;
      total operative time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross clamp time, and total opioid&#xD;
      consumption (fentanyl &amp; morphine) were continuously recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative data collected included (1) time to extubation (in hours), (2) the total length&#xD;
      of ICU stay (in hours), (3) pain score (assessed every 6 hours), (4) total opioid&#xD;
      requirements, (5) incidence of complications, including reintubation, excessive mediastinal&#xD;
      bleeding, need for reopening, and postoperative nausea and vomiting, (6) incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative ischemia, detected by ECG changes (ST segment elevation or depression),&#xD;
      creatinine kinase (CK), creatinine kinase - myocardial band (CK-MB) and Troponin I, (7)&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative renal impairment, detected by diminished urine output &lt; 0.5&#xD;
      ml/kg/hr and/or rising creatinine level, and (8) incidence of respiratory dysfunction&#xD;
      detected by ABG changes and decreased SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Obtained data was presented as mean (SD), median (interquartile ranges),&#xD;
      or numbers and percentages as appropriate. Nominal variables were analyzed using Chi-squared&#xD;
      (χ²) test or Fischer exact test as appropriate. Continuous variables were analyzed using&#xD;
      unpaired Student's t-test or univariate two-group repeated measures analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) with post hoc Dunnett's test as appropriate. Nominal and non-normally distributed&#xD;
      variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical calculations were performed&#xD;
      using Microsoft® Office Excel 2010 and SPSS 16.0 for windows. P value &lt; 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
