  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the primary treatment modality for many types of cancer and the extent of surgical&#xD;
      resection is directly related to patient survival. However, it is often difficult for&#xD;
      surgeons to distinguish normal from neoplastic tissue or to detect metastatic disease or&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes. In some sites, surgical precision is also required to avoid&#xD;
      damage to critical normal tissues. The purpose of this exploratory study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      intra-operative and ex vivo fluorescence of BLZ-100 in tumor samples from subjects with&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects diagnosed to have breast cancer for which surgical resection is clinically indicated&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon obtaining signed informed consent, subjects will enter a Screening Period for up to 14&#xD;
      days to determine eligibility. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects entered into the study will be required to arrive at the hospital (or Phase 1&#xD;
      unit if applicable) for BLZ-100 administration at least 2 hours before their scheduled&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Following administration of BLZ-100, subjects will be continuously&#xD;
      monitored for safety and any allergic reaction occurrence for 30 minutes; thereafter,&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated for 7 days after drug administration. All subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for at least 30 days following drug administration to monitor for SAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor samples will be imaged in situ and ex vivo with the SIRIS imaging system or equivalent&#xD;
      device, processed, and sent to a central laboratory to be evaluated for ex vivo fluorescence&#xD;
      using the Odyssey® CLx imaging system.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subject aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosed solid tumor scheduled for surgical excision. Subjects with recurrent disease&#xD;
             will be eligible only if the duration between last tumor surgery and scheduled new&#xD;
             surgery is ≥3 months.&#xD;

             contraceptive from study entry (time of informed consent) through 30 days after&#xD;
             BLZ-100 administration. Male subjects with vasectomy do not need to use a second form&#xD;
             of contraceptive.&#xD;
