  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to verify the clinical effectiveness of a managed home&#xD;
      telemonitoring program in patients with severe COPD against usual clinical practice, as&#xD;
      measured by the decrease in the number of exacerbations, number of hospitalizations, hospital&#xD;
      days and emergency room visits in a 12 month period&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of effectiveness is &quot;severe exacerbations avoided.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that patients with severe or very severe COPD patients managed with a&#xD;
      home telehealth program have better outcomes than patients managed according to usual&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, multicenter, performance, cost assessment and economic evaluation&#xD;
      clinical trial. An arm of the trial will consist of patients assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      group (telehealth group: TG ), and the other arm will consist of patients randomized to the&#xD;
      control group (routine clinical practice: RCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the economic evaluation, the perspective of the health system will be used. Therefore it&#xD;
      only direct costs will be considered. In the TG arm also intervention costs it will be&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responsible researcher at each hospital center will coordinate the patient selection process.&#xD;
      The researchers will identify candidate patients screening through hospital medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this first screening, patients will be contacted and invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study. In a personal interview, the researcher explains the study to the patient and deliver&#xD;
      the information sheet, verifying that patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, obtains&#xD;
      informed consent and then proceeds to patient randomization. To avoid bias from exclusions,&#xD;
      researchers will hold record with patient exclusion causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every hospital centers will include on average 60 patients (30 in each arm). The inclusion of&#xD;
      patients will be competitive; having centers including patients in the study until reaching&#xD;
      the final sample size of 120 patients per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid selection bias, patients assigned to each group will be randomized. To ensure that&#xD;
      the number of subjects in each arm is the same, a restrictive block randomization is&#xD;
      performed. Randomization is performed using random number generation by computer and the&#xD;
      block size of 10 units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Telehealth program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital sign devices being used: spirometer, pulse oximeter with capacity for heart rate&#xD;
      monitor, blood pressure, Visionox® (device capable of measuring respiratory rate, compliance&#xD;
      with the hours of oxygen, and the flow and pattern of oxygen used).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices send data automatically to a modem by Bluetooth. Modem receives and transmits data&#xD;
      simultaneously from the monitoring devices to a Central Monitoring Center (CMC). Data&#xD;
      received by the modem are encrypted and sent to the telehealth monitoring platform via a 3G&#xD;
      signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CMC is manned by registered nurses and operates during office hours, 7 days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses will attend the patient's home for: the installation of the telehealth devices; to&#xD;
      perform a thorough training of the patients / caregivers in the use of equipment and the COPD&#xD;
      telehealth program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will perform daily vital sign measurements at the same time, at rest, after&#xD;
      administration of the medication and the pattern of oxygen used. Visionox® performs&#xD;
      measurements of respiratory rate and oxygen adherence automatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured data will be monitored on a daily bases by the nurses at the CMC. CMC will follow-up&#xD;
      information, filter for fle positives and false negatives, and use an application acting as a&#xD;
      traffic light system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Green: meant that measurements had been taken and were within the predefined limits, and&#xD;
           no further action was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yellow: &quot;technical alert&quot;. This means that the measurements had not been taken or had&#xD;
           not been received. This alert could lead to a &quot;clinical alert&quot; due to a lack of&#xD;
           adherence or discouragement. When the parameters were not received the nurse at the CMC&#xD;
           called the patient to find the reason behind the alert, and either ruled out medical&#xD;
           causes or, if one, notified the researcher leading the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Red: &quot;clinical alert&quot;. Meant that a measurement exceeded the limits that were previously&#xD;
           preestablished for each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of severity of clinical alerts is performed by the CMC according to an&#xD;
      algorithm. Depending n severity different early medical interventions are taken, or escalated&#xD;
      to clinical responsible for early intervention.&#xD;
