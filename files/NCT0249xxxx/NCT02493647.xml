  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests a 12-episode Internet-based, guide enhanced Love, Sex, &amp; Choices (LSC) HIV&#xD;
      prevention soap opera video series for smartphones or computers, in a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial among predominately at-risk African American urban women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses are to be tested: 1) The LSC treatment arm will show lower&#xD;
      unprotected sex risk, meaning lower frequency of unprotected sex (vaginal + anal) with high&#xD;
      risk partners at 6 months post intervention compared to an attention control arm 2) The LSC&#xD;
      treatment arm will show higher participation in HIV testing at 6 months post intervention&#xD;
      compared to the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If effective, this video intervention could be rapidly implemented and brought to scale at&#xD;
      low cost via the Internet, widely reaching young urban women with the goal of reducing HIV&#xD;
      risk behavior and increasing HIV testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Love, Sex, and Choices (LSC) is an engaging 12-episode video series to reduce HIV risk in&#xD;
      young, adult predominately Black women. A peer video guide was added to the end of LSC&#xD;
      episodes to provoke viewers to question their own sex scripts and consider their own need for&#xD;
      change. The investigators propose to conduct a two-arm clinical trial of the guide enhanced&#xD;
      LSC impact on reducing unprotected sex with high risk partners and increasing HIV testing in&#xD;
      Black women in high HIV prevalence neighborhoods. Undiagnosed HIV is a significant factor&#xD;
      fueling the epidemic. The Control is a 12-episode popular web miniseries with a storyline&#xD;
      that promotes respectful relationships. A previous online pilot study was conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the guide enhanced LSC acceptability, the feasibility of Facebook® advertising, and&#xD;
      streaming the guide enhanced LSC to smartphones. This pilot study indicated 43.6% went for&#xD;
      HIV testing within 30 days post viewing. The guide enhanced LSC was associated with sex risk&#xD;
      reduction. Recruitment and retention of Black women in online HIV prevention research remain&#xD;
      understudied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1 is to conduct a RCT to evaluate the effect of the guide enhanced LSC on HIV sex risk&#xD;
      behavior compared to a true attention control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2 is to evaluate effect of the guide enhanced LSC on HIV testing. AIM 3 is to compare the&#xD;
      reach, meaning enrollment, engagement, retention, risk behaviors, and demographics of high&#xD;
      risk, young urban Black women recruited online to those obtained by conventional recruitment:&#xD;
      with and without research team assistance, to determine whether online recruitment reaches&#xD;
      subgroups not reached in conventional recruitment. Data from Facebook© ads, QR codes, site&#xD;
      specific URL on flyers, tracking video viewing, retention data, and risk behaviors will help&#xD;
      evaluate efforts to reach and retain high risk women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 4 is to specify a model of the effect of the guide enhanced LSC series on high risk sex&#xD;
      scripts and sex risk. Storytelling can promote behavior change but the study of the mechanism&#xD;
      of effect is still young, and entertainment-education concepts of effective film are not yet&#xD;
      well integrated into HIV prevention science. Identification with film characters and&#xD;
      transportation, characterized by emotional and cognitive empathy and merging, are known to&#xD;
      mediate cognitive shifts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses are to be tested in a RCT in predominately young urban Black women&#xD;
      [1) The guide enhanced LSC treatment arm will show lower unprotected sex risk, meaning lower&#xD;
      frequency of unprotected sex (vaginal + anal) with high risk partners at 6 months post&#xD;
      intervention compared to an attention control arm (2) The guide enhanced LSC treatment arm&#xD;
      will show higher participation in HIV testing at 6 months post intervention compared to the&#xD;
      control. Investigators will learn by secondary analyses, whether (3) there are differences in&#xD;
      reach by Facebook© compared to conventional recruitment, and 4) Retention of at risk women&#xD;
      recruited online will be similar to those recruited in the field and 5) whether&#xD;
      identification and transportation will lower high risk sex scripts as a mediator of lower USR&#xD;
      and greater HIV testing.&#xD;
