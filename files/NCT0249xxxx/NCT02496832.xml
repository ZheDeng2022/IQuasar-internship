  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for better ways of diagnosing and treating pancreatic cancer. It is&#xD;
      believed that looking for low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in tumours may give a better&#xD;
      understanding of how certain tumours grow or respond to certain treatments. This study will&#xD;
      look at hypoxia in pancreatic tumours while participants are receiving treatment with the&#xD;
      combination of gemcitabine and TH-302/placebo in the EMR 200592-001 clinical research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) scans to look at hypoxia in tumours.&#xD;
      PET is an imaging test that can be used to measure hypoxia in tumours. For this study, a&#xD;
      radioactive tracer called Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside (FAZA) will be used to &quot;label&quot; areas of&#xD;
      hypoxia in tumours. Determining the levels of hypoxia in tumour tissue using FAZA-PET scans&#xD;
      and comparing these levels with the patient's response to treatment with gemcitabine and&#xD;
      TH-302/placebo for pancreatic cancer may help the researchers to determine the relationship&#xD;
      between hypoxia and response to this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to see how useful looking at hypoxia in tumours are when&#xD;
      they are done at different centres.&#xD;
