  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel disposable sheathed gastroscope system has been shown to be safe and more efficient&#xD;
      in clinical practice during gastroscopy. This novel disposable sheathed endoscope system&#xD;
      could effectively prevent cross-infection by simply taking off the contaminated sheath after&#xD;
      examination of a patient and placing a new sheath on the endoscope. In this way,&#xD;
      investigators can save the endoscopic reprocessing time and also decrease the need for&#xD;
      endoscopic cleaning and disinfecting equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may think that placing a new sheath on the endoscope can decrease the success&#xD;
      rate of cecal intubation in patients undergoing screening colonoscopy. With a new sheath on&#xD;
      the endoscope during scope insertion can probably increases distension of the colonic lumen&#xD;
      and loop formation. The probable adhesion may increase the discomfort of investigators and&#xD;
      participants. But a previous clinical study by investigators' team showed that the&#xD;
      participants' feeling were no significant difference (Z = -1.783, P = 0.075) between sheathed&#xD;
      and conventional groups. No significant differences were observed in optical clarity, or&#xD;
      pathology detection rate. There were no complications, and no microbial contamination was&#xD;
      detected. Based on this study, investigators hypothesize that compared with conventional&#xD;
      group, placing a new sheath on the endoscope does not significantly reduce the success rate&#xD;
      of cecal intubation in average patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the outcome of colonoscopy placing a new sheath on the&#xD;
      endoscope versus the conventional method in average participants. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      cecal intubation success rate. The secondary outcomes include cecal intubation time, maximum&#xD;
      pain score during colonoscopy, overall pain score after colonoscopy and adenoma detection&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
