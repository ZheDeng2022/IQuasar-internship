  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A human dietary intervention study will be performed in overweight to obese subjects with a&#xD;
      slow gastrointestinal transit time comparing the effects of a soluble prebiotic fibre vs.&#xD;
      placebo on gut health, including gut microbiota composition, gastrointestinal transit time,&#xD;
      metabolic health and quality of life.&#xD;
