      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an individuals cardio-respiratory fitness&#xD;
      level can protect them from the negative metabolic impacts of prolonged sitting time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, it is hypothesised that in individuals with high fitness, the unfavourable effect of&#xD;
      prolonged sitting (build up of sugar, fat and insulin in the blood following a meal) will not&#xD;
      be as substantial, nor will light activity breaks be as advantageous, compared to individuals&#xD;
      with lower fitness as they have a smaller scope for metabolic improvement.&#xD;

      The FIT 2 SIT study requires three separate study visits in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit one, we will check the participants blood pressure, height, weight, waist&#xD;
      measurement and body fat percentage, we will also take a blood sample to measure HbA1c and&#xD;
      cholesterol, all of which will help confirm that this participant is eligible to continue in&#xD;
      this study (some may be excluded based on results of the above). We will also measure the&#xD;
      amount of energy participants expend per minute while at rest and during a slow walking task&#xD;
      (3km.h on a treadmill) using a gas mask technique. Energy responses to sitting and walking&#xD;
      differ between individuals, therefore it is of interest to observe how each participant in&#xD;
      this study responds to these conditions as it may help explain any potential findings of this&#xD;
      study. For instance, introducing walking breaks (by way of reducing sitting time) may only&#xD;
      benefit those who have consequent increases in energy expenditure as a result of these&#xD;
      breaks. Lastly, to mark the end of the first study visit, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      perform an exercise test based on a treadmill to assess their fitness level. whilst running a&#xD;
      special mask covering the nose and mouth will be worn to analyse breathing, this will be&#xD;
      connected to a machine (gas analyser) that gives information on the amount of oxygen&#xD;
      participants breathe in and out. The point at which the amount of oxygen they breathe in&#xD;
      remains stable despite increases in exercise difficulty is the point that we will stop the&#xD;
      exercise test because this tells us that they have reached their exercise capacity (called&#xD;
      V02max), and from this we can determine fitness level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this first visit we will have fitness level data from all participants. Recruiting&#xD;
      participants with a diverse fitness level will then help to elucidate the role that an&#xD;
      individuals fitness has on their response to the following treatment conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment condition A is referred to as the 'sitting' condition. Here participants will&#xD;
      remain seated throughout the whole of the 7 ½ hour test period (8am - 3:30pm) whilst watching&#xD;
      TV/DVD's, reading, using the internet, doing paperwork etc. at their will. On arrival,&#xD;
      participants will have a cannula (a small tube that allows us to take blood) inserted into&#xD;
      their arm; this will stay in the arm and allow us to take regular blood samples throughout&#xD;
      the day, without the need for multiple needles. After we take the first blood sample,&#xD;
      participants will sit quietly for an hour. We will then provide breakfast. Whilst sitting, we&#xD;
      will take blood samples (using the cannula) and blood pressure at 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes&#xD;
      after breakfast. We will then provide a lunch meal and will continue taking blood samples and&#xD;
      blood pressure at 30, 60, 120, 180 and 210 minutes after this lunch meal. In total, we will&#xD;
      take 11 blood samples over the 7 ½ hour testing period. Although this may sound a lot, it is&#xD;
      equivalent to around 8-9 teaspoons of blood over the course of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition B is the 'light activity breaks' condition. Participants will go through exactly&#xD;
      the same process as condition A but will also be asked to do 5 minute bouts of slow walking&#xD;
      on a treadmill every 30 minutes following breakfast and lunch. In total they will do 12 five&#xD;
      minute walks on the treadmill throughout the 7 ½ hour test period (60 minutes of walking in&#xD;
      total). In total, we will take 11 blood samples on the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With data on each participants metabolic response to a meal during A) prolonged sitting and&#xD;
      B) during an interrupted sitting condition, we can see how fitness influenced the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, at present, the absence of laboratory randomised crossover trials assessing the&#xD;
      'extent' to which fitness moderates the relationship between sedentary behaviour and&#xD;
      metabolic health markers appear absent from the literature, warranting further investigation,&#xD;
      which is why this design was chosen.&#xD;
