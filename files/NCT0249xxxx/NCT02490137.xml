  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to use MRI to investigate brain changes associated with playing a race car&#xD;
      video game for 90 minutes in aging adults both with and without early signs of dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroplasticity is an important process associated with memory and learning, and may be&#xD;
      impaired in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Video games are one potential strategy for&#xD;
      investigating adaptive cognitive learning. Recent neuroimaging studies in healthy young&#xD;
      adults have been able to detect brain changes associated with learning and memory from a&#xD;
      racing video game over relatively short training periods of a couple hours. This strategy&#xD;
      offers significant promise for characterizing the potential for neuroplasticity in patients&#xD;
      at risk for AD including amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will apply video game training with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain&#xD;
      scanning to investigate adaptive learning, working memory and neuroplasticity as a function&#xD;
      of aging and in patients with aMCI. A total of forty participants will be studied. Twenty&#xD;
      subjects will undergo the video game training. Twenty subjects will be passive controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the microstructural brain changes after video game training in aging subjects&#xD;
      and determine how patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and early AD are affected. For this&#xD;
      study, adult participants ages 50 and older including patients with aMCI and early AD will&#xD;
      undergo two neuroimaging sessions spaced roughly two hours apart that are bracketed around&#xD;
      roughly 90 minutes of car racing game play. We will use diffusion-weighted imaging to detect&#xD;
      longitudinal changes in microstructure of the hippocampus and parahippocampus. A primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to demonstrate that these training and imaging methods are&#xD;
      translatable to patients with MCI. We will investigate the following two important&#xD;
      hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Following car racing video game play, participants, on average, will&#xD;
      demonstrate significant microstructural changes in hippocampal and parahippocampal brain&#xD;
      regions measured with MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The microstructural changes in the hippocampus and parahippocampus measured&#xD;
      with MRI will be significantly correlated with (a) cognitive memory performance as assessed&#xD;
      by recent memory assessments, and (b) improvements in video game performance in all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures for both Hypotheses are the changes in the MRI measurements&#xD;
      following car racing video game play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A long-term objective of this project is to determine whether imaging short term&#xD;
      neuroplasticity is predictive for individual patients of either future conversion to AD or&#xD;
      the effectiveness of cognitive training therapies. More generally, neuroimaging markers of&#xD;
      learning-induced brain plasticity would provide extremely useful tools for investigations of&#xD;
      aging, dementias, and neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
