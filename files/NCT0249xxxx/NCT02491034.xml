      The purpose of this project is to implement a Depression Education Intervention (DEI)&#xD;
      designed to increase disease literacy, and dispel myths about depression and its treatment&#xD;
      among Hispanic patients thus reducing stigma and increasing treatment engagement. This&#xD;
      project will be conducted at one community health center whose patient population is majority&#xD;
      Hispanic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Barriers to depression treatment among Hispanic populations include persistent stigma,&#xD;
      inadequate doctor patient communication (DPC) and resultant sub-optimal use of&#xD;
      anti-depressant medications. Stigma is primarily perpetuated due to inadequate disease&#xD;
      literacy and cultural factors. Common concerns about depression treatments among Hispanics&#xD;
      include fears about the addictive and harmful properties of antidepressants, worries about&#xD;
      taking too many pills, and the stigma attached to taking psychotropic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary care settings often are the gateway to identifying undiagnosed or untreated mental&#xD;
      health disorders, particularly for people with comorbid physical health conditions.&#xD;
      Hispanics, in particular, are more likely to receive mental health care in primary care&#xD;
      settings. Recent recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are that&#xD;
      primary care providers screen adult patients for depression only if systems are in place to&#xD;
      ensure adequate treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Purpose, Goals and Objectives Purpose: The purpose of this project is to implement a&#xD;
      Depression Education Intervention (DEI) designed to increase disease literacy, and dispel&#xD;
      myths about depression and its treatment among Hispanic patients thus reducing stigma and&#xD;
      increasing treatment engagement. This project will be conducted at one community health&#xD;
      center whose patient population is majority Hispanic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal #1: Patients who screen positive for depression will engage in the Depression Education&#xD;
      Intervention (DEI) (two sessions) with a trained Depression Educator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To increase knowledge of depression (signs/symptoms, causes, risk factors, treatment,&#xD;
           cultural beliefs, and its role in chronic disease) among Hispanics in a primary care&#xD;
           setting as measured by changes in scores from pre- to post- DEI on the Knowledge of&#xD;
           Depression-MCQ scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To reduce perceived cultural stigma about depression and its treatment through a&#xD;
           culturally and linguistically appropriate educational intervention as measured by&#xD;
           changes in scores from pre- to post- DEI on the Stigma Checklist for Latinos in Primary&#xD;
           Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To increase engagement in depression treatment in primary care by Hispanic patients as&#xD;
           measured by the iPad Depression Screening application, which will record the treatment&#xD;
           decision after the diagnosis and measure the number of patients engaged in depression&#xD;
           treatment of any kind (pharmacotherapy, counseling, other behavioral intervention) at&#xD;
           the time of the DEI and one month after completion of the DEI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal #2: In order to identify patients with depression, all adult primary care patients will&#xD;
      be screened for depression utilizing the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) via the&#xD;
      iPad Depression Screening application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To systematically screen all adult primary care patients with an iPad Depression&#xD;
           Screening application as measured by number of patients screened compared to the number&#xD;
           eligible for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To increase provider detection of depression in patients through the proper use and&#xD;
           interpretation of the PHQ-9 as measured by depression diagnoses recorded in the EHR.&#xD;
