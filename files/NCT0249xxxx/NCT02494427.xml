  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental restorations (crowns, inlays or onlays) can be made conventionally or by CAD/CAM. The&#xD;
      current literature is weak and does not separate the medical results of these two techniques.&#xD;
      However, the efficiencies enabled by CAD/CAM could, for the price of an initial investment,&#xD;
      improve service to the patient by reducing the time required for these restorations, and&#xD;
      possibly lower care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare immediate medical results and short-term prosthetic&#xD;
      restorations made conventionally or by CAD/CAM in randomized patients, and evaluate economic&#xD;
      impacts and organizational aspects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medico-economic objective of this study is to assess an organizational innovation for&#xD;
      patients treated at the hospital for dental substance loss. The intervention study is the&#xD;
      availability of such information for the management of patients, not that of its systematic&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The economic evaluation of this innovation consists of several parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A costing study seeking to determine the costs of compensation for dental substance loss&#xD;
           by conventional technique and CAD/CAM per patient ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the cost from an hospital perspective to substitute CAD/CAM to conventional&#xD;
           dental treatment equipments;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To built a cost-effectiveness ratio comparing the conventional technique and the CAD/CAM&#xD;
           on the criterion of proportions of effective restorations obtained .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the medical and medico-technical impact of prosthesis availability from CAD/CAM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modifications of treatment plans (some indications of plastic fillings could shift toward&#xD;
      CD/CAM restorations?) and/or their chronology (order of execution phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient cohort is cared for in a hospital Department of Dentistry for oral&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is indication of at least a partial or total dental crown restoration either by&#xD;
      conventional methods or by CAD/CAM (equipoise).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directly assessable elements are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      at the individual restoration level: Effective restoration time between indication and&#xD;
      effective restoration, quality of the restoration, number of clinical sessions required,&#xD;
      unitary cost of the restoration at the patient level: compliance, overall duration of&#xD;
      treatment, duration of the restoration phase, number of clinical sessions (global and&#xD;
      restoration phase) , criteria of quality of life (OHIP, SF36), treatment costs (global and&#xD;
      restoration phase) at the hospital level: number of patients cared for per unit of time,&#xD;
      number of restorations, revenues, expenses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seeking dental restorations in one of the study centers an needing at least one&#xD;
      fixed restoration feasible either by CAD/CAM or conventional means will be selected during&#xD;
      their first consultation (excluding emergency consultations). Quality of life (QOL) indices&#xD;
      are then recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two treatment plans are then created, one using conventional means and another using CAD/CAM&#xD;
      means as required ; those two plans may differ in steps order. The last treatment step where&#xD;
      these plans are identical is the randomization point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment plans are maintained during the pre-prosthetic phases of the treatment, and&#xD;
      updated in case of intercurrent events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is formally included at the randomization point, and the plan selected by the&#xD;
      randomization is carried out. The resource consumptions entailed by the prosthetic steps are&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of treatment, patient satisfaction and QOL indices are recorded. An identical&#xD;
      record is made 6 months after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further long-term follow-up of the patients included in this study is planned, but will be&#xD;
      the object of another protocol.&#xD;
