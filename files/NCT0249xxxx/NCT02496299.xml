      METHODOLOGY STUDY DESIGN. The study will be a prospective study. All the patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups, B and BD. In group B, patients will receive 1 ml/kg bupivacaine&#xD;
      0.25% (maximum volume = 20 ml). In group BD, patients will receive a mixture of 0.2 mg/kg&#xD;
      dexamethasone in 1 ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25% (maximum volume = 20 ml). The total volume&#xD;
      injected will be 1 ml/kg in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH SETTING. The study will take place at Gbagada, Alimosho and Ifako Ijaye General&#xD;
      Hospitals in Lagos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are all secondary health care facilities with 800 bed spaces in Gbagada, 400 at Alimosho&#xD;
      and 300 at Ifako Ijaye. General Hospital Gbagada was established in 1983 and situated in&#xD;
      Gbagada, Alimosho in 2006, situated at Igando while Ifako ijaye was created in 2005 and&#xD;
      located at Ifako. These three areas are densely populated suburbs of Lagos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION. The minimum sample size for this study was calculated with the&#xD;
      formula below 21&#xD;
&#xD;
      n= z 2 x p x q d2 Assuming a 95% interval, 5% level of precision and a proportion of 90% 21 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where n =minimum sample size Z =a constant (1.96 ;) a percentage point on standard normal&#xD;
      deviation corresponding to 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P =proportion of patient with positive dexamethasone analgesic effect obtained from a past&#xD;
      study. (90%) 21 Q = complimentary probability; equivalent to (1-p) d =predetermined level of&#xD;
      precision equivalent to 5% n= (1.96) 2 x 0.90 x.055 0.05 =76.0 approximated to 80 Sample size&#xD;
      will be increased by 20% to provide for attrition=16 Therefore, sample size will be 80+16=96&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION After local ethics committee approval and a written informed consent has been&#xD;
      obtained from parents or legal guardians, 96 patients undergoing elective unilateral inguinal&#xD;
      herniotomy will be selected for this prospective randomized-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be distributed into two equal groups: group B (n = 48), in which the caudal&#xD;
      block will be performed using only bupivacaine, and group BD (n = 48), in which the caudal&#xD;
      block will be performed using dexamethasone added to bupivacaine. The distribution will be by&#xD;
      simple randomization method using computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbers 1-96 will be randomly distributed into the two groups with each group having a total&#xD;
      of 48 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT MECHANISM The patients will be seen at least a day before surgery for&#xD;
      preoperative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients would be fasted according to the AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGY (ASA)&#xD;
      guidelines (2 h for clear fluids; 4 h for breast milk; 6 h for formula milk or light meal).&#xD;
      No premedication will be administered and an informed written consent form will be filled by&#xD;
      parent or guardian after adequate explanation of the scope of the study to parent or guardian&#xD;
      and the older child as the case may be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have routine investigations performed. There will be two residents&#xD;
      recruited as research assistants.Post emergence, the first ,assistant(who is also unaware of&#xD;
      the group allocation)is to observe patient in the recovery room post operatively hence&#xD;
      methods of pain assessment post operatively will be discussed with this research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second research assistant assigns participants to interventions and prepares the drugs.&#xD;
      This assistant stays outside the operating room but within the theatre environ as he holds&#xD;
      the key to the code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the sealed envelope technique, numbers 1-96 is placed in an envelope from which a&#xD;
      research assistant allows patients parent or legal guardian to randomly pick a number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistant then compares with the computer generated random sequence to determine&#xD;
      which of the groups the patient belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the patient and investigator will be blinded to the allocation. All drugs will be&#xD;
      prepared aseptically by this research assistant. The assistant would prepare the drugs. On&#xD;
      arrival at the operating room, routine standard monitors would be applied&#xD;
      (Electrocardiograph, noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry) and baseline vital signs&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia would be induced by the investigator (who is unaware of the group&#xD;
      allocation) with incremental dose of halothane from 0.5- 2% in 100% oxygen. After induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia, an intravenous line would be placed, followed by the insertion of an&#xD;
      appropriately sized laryngeal mask airway which will be secured with tapes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When an adequate depth of anesthesia is attained, anesthesia would be maintained using&#xD;
      isoflurane 1-2% in 100% oxygen. No muscle relaxants will be administered and the patients&#xD;
      would breathe spontaneously using Mapleson F till the end of surgery. After properly securing&#xD;
      the laryngeal mask airway, patients will be turned to the left lateral position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under complete aseptic conditions caudal block will be performed using a 25-G short beveled&#xD;
      needle. Correct placement of the needle will be confirmed by the characteristic 'pop' felt as&#xD;
      the sacrococcygeal membrane when penetrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stilet will be removed while the plastic cannula is secured. Correct placement in the&#xD;
      epidural space will be confirmed by absence of cerebrospinal fluid flow and absence of&#xD;
      swelling during injection of drugs which occurs with a subcutaneous insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator, who is the anesthesiologist performing the block would be blinded to the&#xD;
      identity of the drug used as the epidural injectate for all patients would be presented in a&#xD;
      20 mls syringe containing 20mls of a colourless, odourless, non-particulate solution of which&#xD;
      the investigator who is the performer of the caudal block gives a dose of 1ml/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The codes B and BD are only known to the research assistant who prepared the drugs and only&#xD;
      discloses the codes at the end of the study or in the event of an adverse reaction to any of&#xD;
      the drugs used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of injection will be taken as zero time. Surgery would commence 10 min after the&#xD;
      block is performed to allow for the drugs to take effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized intraoperative fluid therapy will be used in all patients (10 ml/kg/h of&#xD;
      normal saline solution). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) would be recorded using non invasive blood pressure monitor and&#xD;
      pulse oxymetry before induction and then every 5 min after induction of anesthesia till the&#xD;
      end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intraoperative period, adequacy of analgesia would be assessed by hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability, which would be defined by the absence of an increase of more than 20% in HR or MAP&#xD;
      compared with pre incision values. An increase of more than 20% in HR or MAP would be&#xD;
      considered an indication of inadequate analgesia and managed by a bolus dose of intravenous&#xD;
      paracetamol 15 mg/kg, followed by further doses of intravenous diclofenac 1mg/kg if needed.&#xD;
      The need for intraoperative analgesics would be recorded.Such patient will be considered as&#xD;
      part of attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, isoflurane is switched off and LMA is extubated when patient is awake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergence time (the time from end of surgery to opening of the eyes on calling the patients&#xD;
      name) and a delayed anesthetic emergence (considered if 20 minutes elapsed from the end of&#xD;
      surgery to exiting the operating theatre) were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recovery, when the patients are able to maintain a patent airway, they would be&#xD;
      transferred to the recovery room, where they remain for at least 2 h before being transferred&#xD;
      to the ward. Post operative pain and hemodynamic variables (MAP and HR) would be recorded at&#xD;
      the recovery room and then every 30 min till the patient is discharged to the ward after 3&#xD;
      hours. Postoperative pain will be assessed using a modified Objective Pain Score (mOPS) every&#xD;
      30 min for the first 2 h and at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 24 h postoperatively. This score&#xD;
      includes five criteria: crying, agitation, movement, posture, and localization of pain. Each&#xD;
      criterion is assigned a score from 0 to 2, with 2 being the worst, to yield a possible total&#xD;
      score of 0-10 [5]. If the mOPS score is 4 or more, rescue analgesia in the form of&#xD;
      paracetamol 15 mg/kg orally would be administered. Further boluses of paracetamol 15 mg/kg&#xD;
      would be administered orally every 4 h if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual motor block and sedation level will be also assessed at 30 min and at 1, 2, 4, and 6&#xD;
      h after surgery. Motor block will be assessed using a modified Bromage scale consisting of&#xD;
      four points [0 = full motor strength (flexion of knees and feet), 1 = flexion of knees, 2 =&#xD;
      little movement of feet only, 3 = no movement of knees or feet] [29]. The sedation score&#xD;
      will; be assessed using a four-point scale (1, alert and aware; 2, asleep, arousable by&#xD;
      verbal contact; 3, asleep, arousable by physical contact; and 4, asleep, not arousable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After transferring to the ward, rescue analgesia consumption, pain scores,the occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative vomiting during the first 24h after surgery will be recorded. Any other&#xD;
      complications including itching, urine retention (no voiding of urine for 6 hour&#xD;
      postoperative), respiratory depression (respiratory rate&lt;10 breaths/min), hypotension (MAP&#xD;
      decreased&gt;20% of baseline), or bradycardia (HR decreased&gt;20% of baseline) would be recorded&#xD;
      by a research assistant for 24 hours. Any undesirable effect will be treated as follows; for&#xD;
      shivering, patient is covered, given warm intravenous fluids, theatre room temperature is&#xD;
      increased, for itching; intravenous chlorpheniramine is given, metoclopramide for vomiting,&#xD;
      for urinary retention a catheter is passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to first supplemental oral paracetamol from the end of surgery to the first modified&#xD;
      objective pain score of greater than or equal to 4 will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to first micturition post caudal block and the incidence of bladder catheterization&#xD;
      would also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative data in the recovery room would be recorded by the second research&#xD;
      assistant mentioned above, this is the second research assistant mentioned above, a resident&#xD;
      who was also blinded to the drugs used during the caudal block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assistant would be with the patient in the recovery room for at least 3 hours before&#xD;
      being transferred to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENT Data will be collected using a data collection form designed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' blood pressure is measured with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, heart rate&#xD;
      and arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2) will be measured with a pulse oximeter and respiratory&#xD;
      rate will be counted. These vital signs will be recorded at 2 minutes, 5 minutes and&#xD;
      thereafter at 10 minutes interval throughout the course of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRUGS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drugs that will be used in this study will be those licensed for clinical use in Nigeria&#xD;
      and they include:&#xD;
&#xD;
