    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of&#xD;
      trans-incisional rectus sheath block to laparoscopic guided rectus sheath block for pediatric&#xD;
      single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). umbilical hernia repair in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 10-21 years old undergoing SILC for cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, or biliary&#xD;
      dyskinesia will be screened for study inclusion. Eligible patients and their&#xD;
      parents/guardians will be approached and, if agreeable, consented for the study&#xD;
      pre-operatively. Patients will be randomized to receive either trans-incisional rectus sheath&#xD;
      block or intra-operative rectus sheath block under direct laparoscopic visualization. Both&#xD;
      will be done by the attending pediatric surgeon. The patient, patient guardians, select&#xD;
      research team members, and Post anesthesia care unit (PACU) staff will be blinded to the&#xD;
      method of analgesic administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia has been increasingly utilized for providing post-operative analgesia for&#xD;
      a number of surgical procedures in children. Rectus sheath block and local anesthetic&#xD;
      infiltration of the surgical site are two common modes for providing post-operative&#xD;
      analgesia. Studies comparing the two modes have shown ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block&#xD;
      to improve immediate pain scores and reduce use of post-operative analgesia in pediatric&#xD;
      patients undergoing umbilical hernia repair. However, these studies have compared&#xD;
      pre-incisional ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block to post-operative local anesthetic&#xD;
      infiltration as a subcutaneous and/or intradermal injection. Also, to our knowledge, there&#xD;
      are no studies evaluating the use or efficacy of laparoscopic guided rectus sheath block for&#xD;
      pediatric single-incision laparoscopic surgery. Single-incision surgery involves performing&#xD;
      abdominal operations though a single, small incision, usually located at the umbilicus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of trans-incisional rectus sheath block&#xD;
      to intra-operative infiltration of the rectus sheath under direct laparoscopic visualization&#xD;
      via an intra-abdominal approach for providing post-operative analgesia following&#xD;
      single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective study where pediatric patients who are undergoing&#xD;
      single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be randomized pre-operatively to receive&#xD;
      either a trans-incisional rectus sheath block after facial closure but prior to skin closure&#xD;
      or intra-operative infiltration of the rectus sheath under direct laparoscopic visualization&#xD;
      after cholecystectomy. The primary outcome is the post-operative pain rating based on the&#xD;
      Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS) following SILC. Additional outcomes measured will&#xD;
      include: operative times, the use of intravenous/oral opioid and/or non-opioid medication in&#xD;
      the post-operative period, duration of analgesia following surgery based on time to first&#xD;
      rescue analgesic, intra-operative hemodynamic changes, post-operative hemodynamic changes,&#xD;
      incidence of side-effects, and complications. Patients/patient guardians will receive a sheet&#xD;
      to document post-operative WBFPRS scores, oral opioid and non-opioid medication&#xD;
      administration once discharged to home for a total of 5 days.&#xD;

Laparoscopic guided rectus sheath block: After removal of the gallbladder, a predetermined volume of 0.2% ropivacaine (1cc/kg, max dose 10cc, divided into equal doses bilaterally) will be administered intra-abdominally under direct laparoscopic visualization into the rectus sheath bilaterally by the attending surgeon.&#xD;
Ropivacaine: Ropivacaine is a long-acting local anesthetic. It has been shown to be effective for peripheral nerve, caudal, and lumbar/thoracic epidural blocks and produce less motor blockade than bupivacaine after caudal administration.
