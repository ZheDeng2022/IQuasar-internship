      Rollover study supporting solid tumor and hematological disorder indications from Celgene&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The open-label, multicenter, multinational rollover study is intended to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of CC-486, while providing continued treatment with CC-486 for subjects who are receiving&#xD;
      single agent CC-486 at the time of transition to the rollover study and tolerated the&#xD;
      protocol prescribed regimen in Celgene-sponsored trials, and whom in the opinion of the&#xD;
      Investigator may derive clinical benefit from continuing treatment with CC-486. Subjects'&#xD;
      survival will also be followed if required by the parent CC-486 study protocol. If approved&#xD;
      by Celgene, subjects from any ongoing or future Celgene sponsored CC-486 studies in solid&#xD;
      tumors and hematological disorders will be included in this protocol.&#xD;

    <description>This study is an open-label, single-arm study and is divided into the screening period, treatment period and follow-up period. It is intended to evaluate the long-term safety of CC-486 and is to be taken at the same dose, schedule and frequency used from the last dose of CC-486 given in the parent study.</description>

    <description>The subject will continue at the same dose, frequency and schedule used for the last dose of CC-486 given in the preceding CC-486 study. Subjects are allowed to rollover after the last cycle is finished and before the new cycle begins in the parent protocol. There is a 7 day window from End of Study on the parent protocol and when the participant will start Day 1 of the rollover study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previously participated in, and received oral azacitidine, and continues to fulfill&#xD;
             the eligibility criteria in one of the parent oral azacitidine clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The Investigator believes the subject is tolerating treatment with oral azacitidine&#xD;
             monotherapy and continued oral azacitidine treatment is of benefit to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any study&#xD;
             related assessments or procedures being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to&#xD;
                  starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the&#xD;
                  course of the study, and after end of study treatment. This applies even if the&#xD;

&#xD;
