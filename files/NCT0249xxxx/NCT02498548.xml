  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will characterize lower extremity eccentric muscle function among individuals&#xD;
      who have undergone locomotor training after spinal cord injury and will evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of downhill training at moderate speeds - targeted to rehabilitation eccentric function of&#xD;
      the knee or hip.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity eccentric motor control is is critically important for locomotor function but&#xD;
      is impaired after spinal cord injury (SCI). Even after treadmill training, preliminary&#xD;
      evidence indicates that eccentric deficits persist among individuals with SCI. This proposal&#xD;
      aims to characterize eccentric motor control of the muscles about the knee or hip during&#xD;
      locomotion and evaluate the efficacy of downhill gait training at moderate speeds as an&#xD;
      intervention to improve eccentric function of the knee joint or hip joint during walking.&#xD;
