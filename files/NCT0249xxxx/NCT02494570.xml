             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

         12. The use of certain medications and illicit drugs within 5 half-lives or 28 days,&#xD;
             whichever is shorter prior to the first dose of study drug and for the duration of the&#xD;
             study will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Use of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 within the 14 days prior to receiving&#xD;
             the first dose of ABI-009. Additionally, use of any known CYP3A4 substrates with&#xD;
             narrow therapeutic window (such as fentanyl, alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride,&#xD;
             dihydroergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, terfanide) within the 14 days prior to&#xD;
