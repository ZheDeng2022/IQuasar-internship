    <textblock>
      To evaluate the increase in Overall Response Rate (ORR) in the pembrolizumab alone arm&#xD;
      compared to the pembrolizumab after SBRT arm at 12 weeks&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that in a significant subset of patients with recurrent NSCLC&#xD;
      immunotherapy after SBRT will be superior to treatment with immunotherapy alone and that&#xD;
      SBRT, given to a single metastatic site of the tumor, will augment the immune response to the&#xD;
      tumor. Objectives: Disease Control Rate (DCR), defined as the percentage of patients having a&#xD;
      complete response, partial response or stable disease at 12 weeks, PFS, defined as time from&#xD;
      randomization to disease progression or death, OS, defined as time from randomization to&#xD;
      death (of any cause). Toxicity.&#xD;

        the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

        cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
        projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through&#xD;
