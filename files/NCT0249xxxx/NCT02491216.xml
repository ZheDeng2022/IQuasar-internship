  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acupressure has been used for thousands of years in China. Through applying pressure on the&#xD;
      specific acupoints based on Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, acupressure could promote&#xD;
      relaxation and wellness, balance yin-yang and treat diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI has been using acupressure to treat various diseases in the clinics of the School of&#xD;
      Chinese Medicine, The University of Hong Kong. Acupressure has demonstrated significant&#xD;
      efficacy in treating geriatric diseases, obstetric diseases, pediatric diseases, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis and various painful symptoms. When applying acupressure on the Head- Neck -&#xD;
      Shoulder area, it could also help to improve insomnia, reduce pain, and regulate the mood of&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Frailty&quot; is a geriatric syndrome of growing importance in the medical field. Prevalence of&#xD;
      frailty increases with age. As our life expectancy increase, there will be more elderly&#xD;
      suffered from frailty in the later stage of their life. Although there is still a lack of&#xD;
      universally accepted clinical definition for frailty, the syndrome is now commonly understood&#xD;
      as decreased reserves in multiple systems, and lowered resilience to negative stress. Frailty&#xD;
      could be initiated by single or multiple conditions including malnutrition, chronic diseases,&#xD;
      lack of exercise, stress and physiological or social changes caused by aging. Its&#xD;
      manifestation includes sarcopenia, anorexia, energy reduction, dysfunctional neuroendocrine&#xD;
      system and a pro-inflammatory state. Frailty could affect the emotional state of the elderly,&#xD;
      meanwhile, positive affect is protective against the functional and physical decline&#xD;
      associated with frailty. There is limited treatment or medication for frailty. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that acupressure could be a possible non invasive means to improve the&#xD;
      general health conditions, including the emotional conditions of the frail elderly. In the&#xD;
      past 2 years, the school of Chinese Medicine has been promoting acupressure as a health&#xD;
      maintenance technique to the elderly, mostly frail elderly living in the community dwelling&#xD;
      through seminars. It is in investigator's interest to run a prospective research to further&#xD;
      understand the efficacy of acupressure in a wider range of frail elderly. The investigators&#xD;
      would like to use a well-designed pragmatic randomized controlled trial (PRCT) to investigate&#xD;
      if acupressure could help the frail elderly to improve their general quality of life&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research is a collaborative project by The University of Hong Kong and Yan Chai Hospital,&#xD;
      with the aim of investigating the potential benefits of applying acupressure regularly on&#xD;
      frail elderly. The study is designed as a prospective randomized control trial with the&#xD;
      primary objective to investigate if acupressure could help the elderlies to improve their&#xD;
      general quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Frailty&quot; is a geriatric syndrome of growing importance in the medical field. Although there&#xD;
      is still a lack of universally accepted clinical definition for frailty, the syndrome is now&#xD;
      commonly understood as decreased reserves in multiple systems, and lowered resilience to&#xD;
      negative stress. Frailty could affect the emotional state of the elderlies; meanwhile,&#xD;
      positive affect is protective against the functional and physical decline associated with&#xD;
      frailty. Since there is limited treatment or medication for frailty. The investigators would&#xD;
      like to investigate if acupressure could be a possible non-invasive means to improve the&#xD;
      general health conditions, including the psycho-social well being of the frail elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to study potential beneficial effects of acupressure on a group&#xD;
      of frail elderly living in the Homes for the Aged and Care and Attention Homes for the&#xD;
      Elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will use Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) to assess the&#xD;
      frailty level of the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, pragmatic randomized control trial (PRCT) with a prospective design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Applying regular acupressure (4 times a week, totally 12 weeks) on frail elderly in&#xD;
           residential care will improve one or more of the following aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Elderly's quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Elderly's sleeping quality&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Elderly's Blood pressure/heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Regular acupressure provides additional benefit to the frail elderly in residential care&#xD;
           on top of their regular exercise program 108 frail elderlies currently served by the&#xD;
           Homes for the Aged and Care and Attention Homes for the Elderly of the Yan Chai&#xD;
           Hospital, Social Services Department (YCHSS) will be recruited. All these elderlies are&#xD;
           currently participating in the exercise program offered by the residential services of&#xD;
           YCHSS. All applications will be screened by the para-medical staffs in the residential&#xD;
           services based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Qualified applicants will be&#xD;
           invited for a health assessment conducted by registered Traditional Chinese Medicine&#xD;
           practitioner in the research team to confirm their suitability and invite them to sign&#xD;
           the consent form. The consented elderlies will be allocated randomly into treatment&#xD;
           group and control group. Randomization is done by computer generated number list in&#xD;
           block of 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Intervention The enrolled elderly will participate in all the assessments and continue to&#xD;
      participate in the exercise program offered by the residential care of YCHSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupressure Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 15 minutes structured acupressure protocol with specific acupoints and applications&#xD;
      technique will be performed on the elderly participants twice a week by the research team in&#xD;
      YCHSS Homes. Designated para-medical staffs working in the elderly home or informal care&#xD;
      giver of the elderly will be trained and perform the same acupressure protocol on the elderly&#xD;
      at 2 additional occasions during the week. The total trial period is 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acupressure treatment involved 12 steps, and mainly concentrates on the acupoints on&#xD;
      face, head, neck and shoulder. The treatment is designed to be operated by layman. The&#xD;
      acupoints chosen are all easy to be located. All the movements/steps selected are well&#xD;
      established and commonly used in the Traditional Chinese Medicine practices. Any movement&#xD;
      that demand professional training or involve potential risk (e.g. joint mobilization) is&#xD;
      excluded from the protocol. The total treatment process will last for approximately 15 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the elderly will be invited to participate in a lecture of health care in Chinese&#xD;
      medicine after the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No acupressure therapy will be provided during the study. All the elderly will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in a lecture of health care in Chinese medicine after the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assessment of Efficacy Efficacy of the treatments will be measured in multi dimensions&#xD;
      before and after the treatment for both groups. Time Frame of the assessment are: (1)&#xD;
      Baseline; (2) Change from baseline after 12 weeks; (3) Change from baseline at 6th month. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes will be the change in quality of life of the frail elderly. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be sleeping quality and physiological aspects of the frail elderly. All&#xD;
      instruments employed are international recognized and provide an absolute score in&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
