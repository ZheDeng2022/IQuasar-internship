      A randomised double blind dose non-inferiority trial of a daily dose of 600mg versus 300mg&#xD;
      versus 100mg of enteric coated aspirin as a cancer preventive in carriers of a germline&#xD;
      pathological mismatch repair gene defect, Lynch Syndrome. Project 3 in the Cancer Prevention&#xD;
      Programme (CaPP3).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design: A randomised, double-blind, dose non-inferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention: Enteric-coated aspirin 100mg, 300mg or 600mg blinded dose daily followed&#xD;
      by daily 100mg open label dose daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine whether the cancer preventive properties of enteric coated&#xD;
      aspirin in Lynch syndrome are dose sensitive by comparing overall cumulative Lynch syndrome&#xD;
      cancer incidence rates after 5 years in people who took 100mg, 300mg or 600mg enteric coated&#xD;
      aspirin for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Compare overall cumulative incidence of primary colorectal cancers&#xD;
      using Poisson regression to allow for multiple primaries in individual patients in the three&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare overall cumulative incidence of primary endometrial cancers using Poisson regression&#xD;
      to allow for multiple primaries in individual patients in the three treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare overall cumulative incidence of cancers of all types, using Poisson regression to&#xD;
      allow for multiple primaries in individual patients in the three treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden of adverse events associated with the different aspirin doses in this relatively&#xD;
      young and healthy population will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The number of new primary mismatch repair deficient cancers (&quot;Lynch syndrome&#xD;
      cancers&quot;) at 5 years and beyond which develop in participants who remain on prescribed&#xD;
      treatment for a minimum of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of study sites: 4 ISRAEL sites. 20 sites all over the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population/size: 300 patients in ISRAEL. UK 1000-1500 patients. Total with&#xD;
      International 3,000 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 7 years.&#xD;

    <description>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has a marketing approval for use in the EU and is widely available as an over the counter medicine. However it is not being used within its licensed indication and the aspirin (at any dose in this study) will be treated as an investigational medicinal product (IMP).&#xD;
Tablets will be provided as enteric-coated 100mg or 300mg tablets for oral use. All patients will receive at least some dose of aspirin but blinding to the actual dose will be achieved by the use of 'dummy' tablets using the same excipients as in the active formulation of the aspirin minus the active ingredient.&#xD;
The aspirin and dummy tablets should be stored at room temperature below 25⁰C in a dry place.</description>
