    <textblock>
      Background： Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of substantial mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      from thromboembolism, heart failure (HF), and cognitive dysfunction. With the aging of the&#xD;
      population and improved survival after myocardial infarction and HF, AF is emerging as a&#xD;
      major public health concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, significant progress has been made in treatment of AF with catheter ablation,&#xD;
      emerging as an increasingly important technique. According to the current guidelines,&#xD;
      catheter ablation can be considered as the first-line treatment of choice for patients with&#xD;
      drug refractory paroxysmal AF (PAF). Circumferential PV isolation (CPVI) is a widely accepted&#xD;
      cornerstone of this procedure, but limited by an unacceptable recurrence rate, mainly due to&#xD;
      recovery of pulmonary vein (PV) conduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durable, continuous, transmural isolation of PV is one of the most important goals of&#xD;
      radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for PAF. The contact force (CF) between the ablation&#xD;
      catheter and target tissue was considered closely related to the ablation effectiveness.&#xD;
      Appropriate CF should be able to generate enough tissue lesions, and avoid the complications,&#xD;
      such as cardiac perforation, atrial-esophageal fistula. Nowadays, irrigated ablation&#xD;
      catheters are widely used, but the CF is mostly dependent on operators' experience and&#xD;
      feeling, unable to be precisely measured. The tissue lesion produced would be variable in&#xD;
      different operators, and the learning curve would be time consuming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newly approved CF catheter enables measurement of catheter tip contact force and force&#xD;
      vector, providing the real-time CF during ablation. It would be helpful, not only for&#xD;
      effective lesions formation, but also for the prevention from complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies from Western-population indicated that higher long-term successful rate could be&#xD;
      achieved by using CF catheter, and CF between 10 to 20g was adopted in most centers. It would&#xD;
      be important to find the appropriate range of CF for Chinese populations, because of various&#xD;
      factors including for instance thinner and smaller atrial chambers among Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Phase I: To validate or otherwise determine the Chinese-specific appropriate CF&#xD;
      during PVI in PAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ablation guided by the appropriate CF&#xD;
      Trial design and Treatment of Subjects Phase I Instrument: CARTO™, Biosense Webster,&#xD;
      Electrophysiology（EP）recording system, Thermocool® SmartTouch™ Catheter，Lasso/Navi-Lasso&#xD;
      catheter, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NO. of cases: 20 Study duration: 2 months Strategy：Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation&#xD;
      Procedure： Local anaesthesia, Sedation Catheters are advanced through the right/left femoral&#xD;
      vein. After double transseptal punctures, 8F or 8.5F SL1 Swartz sheath and Steerable sheath&#xD;
      (e.g. Agilis, St Jude) will be placed in left atrium (LA), followed by PVs' venography&#xD;
      Establishment of the anatomical model of LA and all PVs: Respiratory gating, Point-by-Point&#xD;
      or Fast Anatomical Mapping (FAM). When using Point-by-Point, CF would be controlled between 5&#xD;
      to 10g. When using FAM, the model around PVs would be adjusted by SmartTouch catheter with CF&#xD;
      5-10g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameter setting: Power-anterior wall 35W, posterior wall 30W; Irrigated flow rate =&#xD;
      17-30ml/min；Impendence - up to 170Ω； Operator: Dr. Chenyang Jiang Ablation catheter could be&#xD;
      moved if, electrical activity amplitude decrease &gt;80%, impedance decrease &gt;10Ω, or ablation&#xD;
      time more than 20s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: Bi-directional block between left atrial and pulmonary vein (LA-PV), and no capture&#xD;
      along CPVI line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator will be blinded to CF data, which would be monitored by the assistant. When the&#xD;
      CF is higher than 40g, the operator will be warned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters: total procedure time, model reconstruction time, power, ablation time, impedance,&#xD;
      CF, force-time integral (FTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction for PV ablation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perform circumferential PV ablation in the order.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When PV is isolated after circular linear ablation without touch-up ablation, 30min&#xD;
           waiting time + isoproterenol（ISP）/adenosine triphosphate（ATP） induction would be&#xD;
           performed to detect the acute reconnection. If there's no reconnection, each segment&#xD;
           will be identified as &quot;isolated segment&quot;, and the ablation CF, time, FTI, and the power&#xD;
           of each segment will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When PV isolated initially, but reconnected by 30min+ISP/ATP observation, re-isolation&#xD;
           would be performed, and the segment with conduction gaps(GAP) will be identified as&#xD;
           &quot;acute reconnected segment(s)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If PV isolation not achieved by initial circumferential ablation, additional ablation&#xD;
           along the circular lesion will be performed until PV isolated, and the segment(s)&#xD;
           re-ablated will be identified as &quot;unisolated segment(s)&quot;, record the parameters.&#xD;
           30min+ISP/ATP detection will be performed after isolation, &quot;isolated segment(s)&quot; and&#xD;
           &quot;acute reconnected segment(s)&quot; will be identified, as described above in a. and b. If&#xD;
           the &quot;acute reconnected segment(s)&quot; is the same segment(s) as &quot;unisolated segment(s)&quot;,&#xD;
           classify to the latter group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis for appropriate CF For each segment, single variable and multiple regression&#xD;
      analysis will be performed between the three groups (&quot;isolated segment&quot;,&quot; acute reconnected&#xD;
      segment &quot;, and &quot;unisolated segment&quot;), to define an &quot;appropriate CF&quot;. The sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the &quot;appropriate CF&quot; will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument: CARTO™, Biosense Webster, EP recording system, Thermocool® SmartTouch™&#xD;
      Catheter，Lasso/Navi-Lasso catheter, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NO. of cases: 120 Study duration: enrollment - 12 months, follow-up - 12 months, Data&#xD;
      analysis and papers preparation - 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy：Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation Patients will be randomized with 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      into one of the two following groups: &quot;CF guided group&quot; and &quot;usual ablation group&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure： The preparation, including anaesthesia, sedation, vascular access, transseptal&#xD;
      puncture, is the same as described in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CF guided group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the establishment of the anatomical model of LA and all PVs (the same as phase I),&#xD;
      ablation will be performed with the guidance of real-time CF, ablation time, FTI, etc. CF&#xD;
      will be controlled in the range of &quot;appropriate CF&quot;, which has been defined in phase I.&#xD;
      Circumferential PV ablation will be performed orderly, &quot;isolated segment&quot;,&quot; acute reconnected&#xD;
      segment &quot;, and &quot;unisolated segment&quot; will be also identified as described in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: bi-directional block between LA-PV, and no capture along CPVI line. Parameters&#xD;
      recording: total procedure time, model reconstruction time, power, ablation time, impedance,&#xD;
      CF, FTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual ablation group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operator will be blinded to CF data, the procedure performance is the same as described in&#xD;
      phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Warfarin or new oral anticoagulants will be administered to all patients for at&#xD;
      least 3months after the procedure. The international normalized ratio will be controlled&#xD;
      between 2.0 and 3.0 if warfarin prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, patients will be followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12months post ablation.&#xD;
      Patients' experiences, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and Holter monitoring (non-required&#xD;
      at 1, 9 months) will be recorded to evaluate recurrence at each appointment (not including 1&#xD;
      and 3 month visit post procedure) and any visits when the patient experience symptoms that&#xD;
      suggestive of arrhythmia. The first 3 months is considered as a blanking period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence is defined as AF/flutter/tachycardia, lasting longer than 30s, that documented by&#xD;
      an ECG or Holter recording, or highly suggestive symptoms, after 3 months post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point: Freedom from AF recurrence on the ECGs and Holter monitoring at each visit&#xD;
      during the period from 3 months to 1 years after procedure, independent of antiarrhythmic&#xD;
      drug(AAD) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points: (1) Freedom from AF recurrence, dependent of AAD therapy; (2)Freedom of&#xD;
      arrhythmia-related symptoms; (3)Safety Outcomes, contain mortality (death overall and&#xD;
      procedure-related), vascular access complications (bleeding, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm,&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula), periprocedural events (stroke, transient ischemic attack, cardiac&#xD;
      tamponade, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, other embolism, LA-esophageal fistula,&#xD;
      Other fistula, pericardial effusion, PV stenosis, atrioventricular block, heart failure&#xD;
      exacerbation, need for a pacemaker, phrenic nerve injury, acute coronary artery occlusion,&#xD;
      valve injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will terminate after a maximum follow-up period of 12 months. Data Management&#xD;
      Requirements for investigators on data entry The investigator ensures that data are entered&#xD;
      into the medical records and the Case Report Forms (CRFs) truthfully, precisely, completely,&#xD;
      timely and legally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on all patients who signed the Informed Consent Form and enter the trial when&#xD;
      considered eligible through screening should be closely observed and recorded in the CRFs&#xD;
      without any field left blank or missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data on the CRFs should be checked against the source records for consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As source documents, the CRFs should be revised only by drawing a single line with the&#xD;
      investigator's signature and date of revision added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source laboratory test reports (or their copies) should be adhered to the field for adhering&#xD;
      laboratory test reports in the medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that are significantly high or low or outside the clinically acceptable range should be&#xD;
      carefully verified and reviewed, and necessary explanations should be given by the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Requirements for monitors on data monitoring The monitors should pay regular visits to the&#xD;
      sites to examine the status of signing of informed consent, screening and enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ensure that all the CRFs are correctly filled out and are consistent with the source data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ensure that all the errors or missing data have been corrected or explained, and have been&#xD;
      signed and dated by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in treatment, concomitant medications, intercurrent conditions and ECG recording&#xD;
      should be confirmed and recorded for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuations and loss-to-follow-ups of each subject should be indicated in the CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirm that all the adverse events (AEs) have been filed. Establishment of database and data&#xD;
      entry Establishment of database：A study-specific database system will be established as per&#xD;
      the items on the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry: Data will be entered concurrently by data managers through double entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data review: Each data item should be verified and the discrepancies be reported. The source&#xD;
      forms should be verified on an item-by-item basis and the errors be corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of any doubt during data entry, the data manager may fill out a Data Query Form which&#xD;
      will be returned to the monitor. When the investigator has resolved in writing the queries in&#xD;
      the query form and signed, the form will be sent back to the data managers. Data Query Forms&#xD;
      should be appropriately stored.Selection and withdrawal of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Phase I For each segment, single variable and multiple regression&#xD;
      analysis will be performed between the three groups (&quot;isolated segment&quot;,&quot; acute reconnected&#xD;
      segment &quot;, and &quot;unisolated segment&quot;), to define an &quot;appropriate CF&quot;. The sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the &quot;appropriate CF&quot; will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Log-rank test will be used for inter-group comparison of recurrence. Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method will be used for the estimation of currency curves for all points. When considering&#xD;
      the central effects and the important prognostic factors, Cox proportional risk model will be&#xD;
      used to estimate the risks compared with blank with the confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More data for &quot;initially-isolated segment&quot;, &quot;initially- nonisolated segment&quot;, and&#xD;
      &quot;additionally-isolated segment&quot; will be collected, and the &quot;appropriated CF&quot; will be&#xD;
      re-analyzed.&#xD;
