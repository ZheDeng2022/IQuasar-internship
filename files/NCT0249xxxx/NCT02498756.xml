      For investigators' current experimental clinical trial, patients are given 4 injections of&#xD;
      ipilimumab, given 3 weeks apart x 4 injections with or without cytokine-induced killer&#xD;
      therapy. Investigators propose to test this dual therapy in patients with melanoma who have&#xD;
      known stage I, metastatic melanoma. Investigators hypothesize that this form of combinatorial&#xD;
      immunotherapy will result in tumor stabilization or shrinkage, significant prolongation of&#xD;
      progression-free, disease-free or overall survival compared to the use of ipilimumab alone&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      despite the best clinical efforts and breakthroughs in biotechnology, most patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with advanced stage melanoma continue to die from their disease. Reasons for this include: 1)&#xD;
      patients are often diagnosed at a time when their melanoma has already spread to other sites&#xD;
      such as the chest cavity, bone, liver, and brain limiting the options for surgical excision&#xD;
      and 2) the cancer cells are resistant or become resistant to chemotherapy drugs used to treat&#xD;
      the patient. Resistance to one type of chemotherapy agent often rapidly leads to resistance&#xD;
      against many other chemotherapy drugs. These reasons are the major causes of cancer&#xD;
      progression that are usually discussed when considering treatment options for patients with&#xD;
      disease that continues to grow and spread. However, another important part of the body should&#xD;
      be considered-- the immune system. Scientists have clearly shown that melanoma cells produce&#xD;
      a number of abnormal proteins or abnormal amounts of certain proteins found in normal&#xD;
      melanoma cells. Normally one would expect a patient to develop an immune response against&#xD;
      these abnormal proteins found in their cancer and attack them much the way the investigators&#xD;
      would fight off an infection from a foreign bacteria or virus. However, for reasons that&#xD;
      scientists do not fully understand, the immune system fails to respond adequately to these&#xD;
      abnormal proteins and does not destroy the melanoma cells. This human clinical trial proposes&#xD;
      a new way to make the immune system recognize the cancer cells and encourages it to attack&#xD;
      and destroy them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators have put a mouse gene into human melanoma cancer cells, so&#xD;
      that those cells produce these abnormal sugar patterns and stimulate the immune system to&#xD;
      attack the melanoma. This strategy works well to kill other human cancer cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory, but it needs to be tried in melanoma patients to see if it will be effective and&#xD;
      to determine if such a treatment causes any side effects. Investigators propose to test this&#xD;
      new treatment in patients with melanoma to see if it can stop, slow or destroy tumors in&#xD;
      these patients. Patients will be injected with an anti-tumor immunotherapy consisting of&#xD;
      three types of dead human melanoma cancer cells that have been genetically altered to express&#xD;
      the mouse gene responsible for making this abnormal sugar-protein on the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Phase II Study, patients with early stage melanoma will undergo a series of&#xD;
      intradermal injections with cytokine-induced killer therapy. These cell lines have been&#xD;
      transduced with a recombinant. In addition to the cik therapy, some patients will also&#xD;
      receive ipilimumab as an important component of this immunization strategy that will attempt&#xD;
      to enhance and activate the host immune system to destroy growing tumor cells. Endpoints of&#xD;
      the study include safety assessments, and clinical, tumor and immunological responses.&#xD;
