  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity may affect periodontal health by inducing gingival oxidative damage through increased&#xD;
      production in circulating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Previous studies have reported&#xD;
      decreased glutathione levels in patients with periodontitis when compared to healthy subjects&#xD;
      in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), plasma and saliva. In the present study we hypothesized&#xD;
      that high ROS levels in circulation may decrease glutathione levels in the GCF,plasma and&#xD;
      saliva in obese patients with chronic periodontitis, whereas periodontal therapy could have&#xD;
      positive effects on glutathione levels.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity on glutathione levels in&#xD;
      the plasma, GCF and saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis and to evaluate changes&#xD;
      after nonsurgical periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosed as obese (n=30) and normal-weight (n=30) individuals were categorized; chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis (CP) and periodontally healthy controls (PH). Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF),&#xD;
      plasma, saliva samples and clinical measurements were obtained at baseline and a month after&#xD;
      nonsurgical periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unstimulated salivary samples were collected using standard techniques. About 2 mL whole&#xD;
      saliva was collected in disposable tubes and centrifuged immediately to remove cell debris&#xD;
      (10,000 g x 10 minutes). The supernatants (50µL each) were stored at -40C until analyzed. GCF&#xD;
      samples were collected from a mesio-buccal and disto-palatal site on each tooth. In the CP&#xD;
      group, the samples were obtained from patients at areas with ≥5 mm CAL, ≥6 mm PD and ≥30%&#xD;
      bone loss. In gingivitis group, GCF samples were obtained from teeth with BOP and without&#xD;
      CAL. In the healthy group, GCF samples were collected from teeth exhibiting PD&lt;3 mm without&#xD;
      CAL and BOP. The area was isolated with cotton rolls, saliva contamination elimination was&#xD;
      ensured, and it was slightly air dried. GCF was sampled with paper strips. Paper strips were&#xD;
      placed into the crevice until mild resistance was felt (intracrevicular method) and left in&#xD;
      the position for 30 seconds. Strips contaminated with blood or saliva were discarded. Each&#xD;
      sampled strip was placed into a 400µl eppendorf centrifuge tube and stored at -40C until&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five milliliters of venous blood was taken from antecubital vein by using a standard&#xD;
      venipuncture method. Obtained blood sample was collected in vacutainer tubes and&#xD;
      anti-coagulated with EDTA. The blood samples were then stored at -40C until required for use&#xD;
      in ELISAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis indicated that 12 individuals for each group would be sufficient to achieve&#xD;
      80% power to detect a difference of 0.05 between the alternative and the null hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shapiro Wilk test was used to investigate whether or not the data were normally&#xD;
      distributed. Continuous variables with unequal variances were compared by means of Welch and&#xD;
      Tamhane's T2 post-hoc test for BMI, PD, CAL and the levels of glutathione. The comparison of&#xD;
      the age, GI, PI and BOP was analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test followed by&#xD;
      post hoc group comparisons with the Bonferroni-adjusted Mann-Whitney U test. Paired Student's&#xD;
      t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the measurements at two points (baseline&#xD;
      and after SRP). The Spearman's rank correlation test was also used to detect the relationship&#xD;
      between biochemical and clinical findings.&#xD;
