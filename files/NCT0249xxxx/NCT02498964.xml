      High fidelity simulations provide a unique opportunity for teaching and evaluation of&#xD;
      knowledge, clinical reasoning, decision making and teamwork. We have developed a series of&#xD;
      novel cardiac based simulations that review difficult learning objectives of cardiac&#xD;
      anesthesiology rotation. We hypothesized that residents who have completed a rotation in&#xD;
      cardiac anesthesiology will perceive these simulations to be both mentally challenging and a&#xD;
      useful tool in preparing them for their subsequent clinical experience and for their&#xD;
      anesthesiology board. For the first time, we have used the NASA Task Load Index Scale in&#xD;
      evaluating Neuro Cognitive Workload during Cardiac Anesthesia Based simulation scenarios&#xD;
      .Residents who have completed the cardiac rotation at least once would be assigned the task&#xD;
      in small groups either a group of 2 or group of 3.The module consists of 3 different&#xD;
      scenarios. The scenarios include, weaning the patient off of cardio pulmonary bypass,&#xD;
      management of severe protamine drug reaction and acute hypotension from malfunction of the&#xD;
      coronary graft in a simulated operating room in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Setting up a Simulation Lab,almost similar to real cardiac operating rooms would have&#xD;
           cardio-pulmonary bypass machine,transesophageal echocardiography images upon request,all&#xD;
           emergency medications with various infusions pumps,defibrillator,real time monitors&#xD;
           include EKG,SpO2,invasive arterial line,CVP,PAP,ETCO2,operating room surgical&#xD;
           equipment,anesthesia machine with ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tasks Assigned to the residents&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Feed-back and Teaching Session&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the end of each session residents are encouraged to reflect upon how they performed&#xD;
           and learning gaps that they perceived and areas that they felt needed to improve upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Feedback session would be followed by interactive teaching to reinforce the knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluation of Hypothesis using NASA TLX Scale. Immediately following the Simulation&#xD;
           based training, residents would be given the paper based NASA TLX scale to assess the&#xD;

      The Ohio State University CSEAC Scenarios Content expert: Sujatha Bhandary MD The Ohio State&#xD;
      University CSEAC 1st Scenario Development Form Scenario Name: Weaning from Cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      Bypass Content expert: Sujatha Bhandary MD Date of Development: 8/29/14 Targeted Audience:&#xD;
      CA-2, CA-3 anesthesia residents Simulation Platform: HPS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synopsis of Scenario:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this scenario is for the participant to take a thoughtful, systematic approach&#xD;
      to weaning a patient off of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Separation from cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass is a task which requires attention to multiple organ systems, communication with other&#xD;
      members of the patient care team (i.e. surgeon, perfusionist), and a firm grasp of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary physiology. A small randomized controlled study of residents has previously&#xD;
      demonstrated that simulation-based training in weaning from CPB has translated to improved&#xD;
      clinical performance in the OR. While this task can at first be overwhelming for the trainee,&#xD;
      high fidelity simulation provides an opportunity to practice this complex task in a safe&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scenario will begin with the patient under general anesthesia and on cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass. The surgeon will have just completed an uncomplicated triple vessel CABG on a 57 year&#xD;
      old male with 45 minutes of bypass time. When the participant takes over the case the patient&#xD;
      will have a junctional bradycardia (rate 40) with a MAP of 50 mmHg, a temperature of 35&#xD;
      degrees celcius, and a SpO2 of 100%. The surgeon will announce that he is planning to remove&#xD;
      the aortic cross clamp at which time the resident should call for their attending. The&#xD;
      participant will be informed that their attending will not arrive and they will need to&#xD;
      complete the task on their own. After removal of the cross clamp the patient will go into&#xD;
      ventricular fibrillation. The participant will be responsible for recognizing the arrhythmia&#xD;
      and treating the condition with lidocaine and defibrillation. After defibrillation the&#xD;
      patient will go back into a junctional bradycardia which the participant will need to treat&#xD;
      by pacing. At this point the participant will also need to begin ventilating the patient and&#xD;
      treating underlying hyperkalemia (which will become evident upon obtaining an ABG). Failure&#xD;
      to treat the hyperkalemia will result in refractory ventricular fibrillation. An&#xD;
      echocardiogram (if requested) will reveal a normal appearing heart with good contractility.&#xD;
      After pacing the patient, ventilating, and treating the underlying metabolic disturbances the&#xD;
      patient can be successfully weaned off of CPB with a low dose epinephrine drip. At this point&#xD;
      the scenario will end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the conditions necessary before attempting to wean the patient from CPB&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demonstrate the steps involved in weaning the patient from CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Communicate effectively with other members of the patient care team (i.e. perfusionist&#xD;
           and surgeon) during weaning from CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recognize and treat arrhythmias and metabolic disturbances prior to weaning from CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Scenario Intro (read to learner) Your patient is a 57 year old male who is undergoing a&#xD;
           triple vessel CABG (LIMA to LAD, saphenous to RCA, and saphenous to OM). In addition to&#xD;
           CAD the patient has a history of type 2 DM and HLD. The surgeon has just completed the&#xD;
           last graft with a total bypass time of 45 minutes. The procedure has been uncomplicated&#xD;
           to this point. The patient has an arterial line, a 16 g IV, and an introducer with a&#xD;
           PAC. The patient is on no infusions and is receiving isoflurance via the bypass machine.&#xD;
           The patient is currently paralyzed. There is a transesophageal echocardiogram available&#xD;
           upon request. The surgeon has placed epicardial pacing wires. Your task will be to wean&#xD;
           the patient off of CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Facilitator briefing/ Curricular information:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to receiving hand-off and beginning the scenario the participant will be handed a&#xD;
           sheet with the patient's pre-op history and physical already completed. All labs and&#xD;
           imaging will be provided. The resident will have the opportunity to ask additional&#xD;
           questions to the departing provider. The confederates in the room will include the&#xD;
           cardiac surgeon and a perfusionist. Echocardiography will be available upon request as&#xD;
           will arterial blood gases. The following infusions will already be in-line but not yet&#xD;
           started: epinephrine, nitroprusside, and insulin. Other cardiac drugs (lidocaine,&#xD;
           amiodarone, nitroglycerine, norepinephrine, vasopressin) will be drawn up and available.&#xD;
           Epicardial wires coming from the surgical field. These can be connected to a pacing box&#xD;

      The Ohio State University CSEAC 2nd Scenario Development Form Scenario Name: Protamine&#xD;
      Reaction Content expert: Sujatha Bhandary MD Date of Development: 8/29/14 Targeted Audience:&#xD;
      CA-2, CA-3 anesthesia residents Simulation Platform: HPS&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Synopsis of Scenario:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this scenario is to expose trainees to a severe type III protamine reaction&#xD;
      after weaning off of cardiopulmonary bypass. Although the most severe reaction to&#xD;
      administration of protamine (severe pulmonary vasoconstriction, RV failure, systemic&#xD;
      hypotesnsion) is rare, the result can be catastrophic. High fidelity simulation provides an&#xD;
      opportunity for trainees to get exposure to this entity in a safe, controlled environment.&#xD;
      The scenario will be followed by both a debriefing session to allow the participants to&#xD;
      reflect on their performance and a short didactic session on proper administration of&#xD;
      protamine and the pathophysiology of protamine reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scenario will begin after completion of the previous scenario: &quot;Weaning from&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass&quot;. As before the patient is a 57 year old male who has just undergone&#xD;
      an uncomplicated triple vessel CABG with 45 minutes of bypass time. The patient was&#xD;
      successfully weaned off of CPB after treatment of hyperkalemia (see prior scenario). This&#xD;
      scenario can begin either after debriefing the previous scenario or may begin without&#xD;
      interruption. The surgeon will start the scenario by asking the participant to administer&#xD;
      protamine. At this point the patient is hemodynamically stable (V-paced at 80, BP 110/60, PAP&#xD;
      30/15, CO 5.2). The patient will start the scenario on an epinephrine drip at 0.02&#xD;
      mcg/kg/min. The participant will be informed that the patient was given 30,000 unites of&#xD;
      heparin in preparation for going on CPB. The last ACT was 468. The patient will not have any&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes in response to a test dose of protamine, and the participant should&#xD;
      continue to administer the appropriate dose. After 2 minutes without a change in vitals the&#xD;
      patient will begin to undergo hemodynamic changes consistent with a type III protamine&#xD;
      reaction over the course of 5 minutes (hypotesnsion, desaturation, decreased cardiac output,&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension). Upon recognizing the problem the participant should discontinue the&#xD;
      protamine infusion, call for help, communicate with the surgeon, and provide supportive care&#xD;
      for the patient. An echocardiogram (upon request) will demonstrate a dilated RV. Intervening&#xD;
      to stop the protamine and administer vasopressors will stabilize the patient, however failure&#xD;
      to act will result in cardiovascular collapse and necessitate going back on CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.Demonstrate appropriate administration of protamine following cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.Recognize the signs of an acute type III protamine reaction and respond appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.Describe the different types of protamine reactions, the pathophysiology of each, and the&#xD;
      risk factors for developing them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scenario Intro (read to learner) Your patient is a 57 year old male who is undergoing a&#xD;
      triple vessel CABG (LIMA to LAD, saphenous to RCA, and saphenous to OM). In addition to CAD&#xD;
      the patient has a history of type 2 DM and HLD. The procedure has been uncomplicated to this&#xD;
      point. The patient has an arterial line, a 16 g IV, and an introducer with a PAC. The patient&#xD;
      is currently paralyzed. There is a transesophageal echocardiogram available upon request. The&#xD;
      patient as already been successfully weaned off of CPB and is hemodynamically stable on a low&#xD;
      dose epinephrine drip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Facilitator briefing/ Curricular information: Prior to receiving hand-off and beginning the&#xD;

                state will take off directly after the final state of the prior scenario (&quot;weaning&#xD;
                off CPB&quot;). The surgeon will ask for protamine to be given. If the participant asks&#xD;
                the perfusionist will inform him/her that the total heparin dose was 30,000 units&#xD;
                and the last ACT was 468. The test dose will be negative (no change in vital&#xD;

      The Ohio State University CSEAC 3rd Scenario Development Form Scenario Name: Coronary Air&#xD;
      After Bypass Grafting Content expert: Sujatha Bhandary MD Date of Development: 8/29/14&#xD;
      Targeted Audience: CA-2, CA-3 anesthesia residents Simulation Platform: HPS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synopsis of Scenario:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this scenario is for the participant to take a thoughtful, systematic approach&#xD;
      to the sudden onset of ST changes and hypotension following completion of coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Specifically this scenario will deal with intracoronary air,&#xD;
      which if unrecognized can be fatal. Residual air has been reported to be present as in as&#xD;
      much as 12% of patients undergoing CABG surgery.* This simulation will give residents the&#xD;
      chance to treat this condition in a safe, constructive environment so that they will be more&#xD;
      comfortable with diagnosing this rare but potentially devastating condition. The simulation&#xD;
      is intended to rely on the residents' knowledge of cardiac physiology, and basic&#xD;
      echocardiography interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scenario will start following the completion of the previous scenario (Protamine&#xD;
      Reaction) at which the time patient has been successfully weaned off of bypass and the chest&#xD;
      has just been closed. Immediately after beginning the scenario the surgeon will leave the&#xD;
      room. At this time the fellow (confederate) will begin to suture the skin. Shortly thereafter&#xD;
      the patient will have ST elevation in the inferior EKG leads. The fellow will ask if the&#xD;
      echocardiogram looks okay. A mid-esophageal four-chamber view of the patient's heart will&#xD;
      demonstrate air bubbles in the left ventricle. A trans-gastric short axis view of the heart&#xD;
      (if requested) will show the inferior wall of the heart to be akinetic. The patient will&#xD;
      become hypotensive with decreased cardiac index. The resident should simultaneously form a&#xD;
      differential diagnosis and treat the symptoms while communicating to the surgeon his/her&#xD;
      findings. Ultimately the resident should request that the surgeon reopen the patient's chest&#xD;
      and purge the intra-cardiac air. Failing to do so will result in the patient going into&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock and ventricular fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Form a differential for post CABG hypotension and EKG changes. 9. Diagnose intra-cardiac&#xD;
      air and regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Effectively treat cardiogenic shock with pharmacologic agents. 11. Communicate with the&#xD;
      surgeon regarding the need for surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scenario Intro (read to learner) Your patient is a 57 year old male who is undergoing a&#xD;
      triple vessel CABG (LIMA to LAD, saphenous to RCA, and saphenous to OM). In addition to CAD&#xD;
      the patient has a history of type 2 DM and HLD. The surgeon completed the grafts with a total&#xD;
      bypass time of 45 minutes. The patient has been weaned of cardiac bypass and successfully&#xD;
      reversed with protamine. The chest has just been closed. The procedure has been uncomplicated&#xD;
      to this point. The patient has an arterial line, a 16 g IV, and an introducer with a PAC. The&#xD;
      patient is on a low dose epinephrine infusion (.0.02 mcg/kg/min). The patient is currently&#xD;
      paralyzed. There is a transesophageal echocardiogram available upon request. The surgeon has&#xD;
      placed epicardial pacing wires. You will be responsible for transitioning the patient to the&#xD;
      cardiac ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilitator briefing/ Curricular information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to receiving hand-off and beginning the scenario the participant will be handed a sheet&#xD;
      with the patient's pre-op history and physical already completed. All labs and imaging will&#xD;
      be provided. The resident will have the opportunity to ask additional questions to the&#xD;
      departing provider. The confederates in the room will include the cardiac surgeon and a&#xD;
      perfusionist. Echocardiography will be available upon request as will arterial blood gases.&#xD;
      The patient is on a low dose epinephrine infusion (0.02 mcg/kg/min). Other cardiac drugs&#xD;
      (lidocaine, amiodarone, nitroglycerine, norepinephrine, vasopressin) will be drawn up and&#xD;
      available. Epicardial wires coming from the surgical field. These can be connected to a&#xD;
      pacing box which will provided upon request.&#xD;
