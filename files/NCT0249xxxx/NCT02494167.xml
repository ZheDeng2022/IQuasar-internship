  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study uses special blood cells called multiple tumor-associated antigen&#xD;
      (TAA)-specific T cells (a new experimental therapy) to treat patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) which has come back, or may come back, or&#xD;
      has not gone away after standard treatment, including an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously used this sort of therapy to treat Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphomas that are infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is found in cancer cells of up&#xD;
      to half of all patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This suggests that it may play&#xD;
      a role in causing lymphoma. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's&#xD;
      immune system and escape being killed. The investigators previously tested whether special&#xD;
      white blood cells (called T cells) that were trained to kill EBV-infected cells could affect&#xD;
      these tumors, and in many patients the investigators found that giving these trained T cells&#xD;
      causes a complete or partial response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other cancers express specific proteins that can be targeted in the same way. The&#xD;
      investigators have been able to infuse such tumor-targeted cells into up to 10 patients with&#xD;
      lymphoma who do not have EBV, and seen some complete responses. Importantly, the treatment&#xD;
      appears to be safe. Therefore, the investigators now want to test whether the investigators&#xD;
      can direct these special T cells against other types of cancers that carry similar proteins&#xD;
      called tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). These proteins are specific to the cancer cell, so&#xD;
      they either do not show up, or show up in low quantities, or normal human cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will grow T cells from patients' stem cell donors in the laboratory in a&#xD;
      way that will train them to recognize the tumor proteins WT1, NY-ESO-1, PRAME, and Survivin,&#xD;
      which are expressed on most AML and MDS cancer cells. The cells will be infused at least 30&#xD;
      days post-allogeneic stem cell transplant. In this study, the investigators want see whether&#xD;
      these cells will be able to recognize and kill cancer cells that express these proteins.&#xD;
      These donor-derived multiTAA-specific T cells are an investigational product not yet approved&#xD;
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of donor-derived tumor protein&#xD;
      multiTAA-specific T cells for patients with AML or MDS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To make donor derived multiTAA-specific T cells, the investigators will collect blood from&#xD;
      the patient's stem cell donor, and mix the donor's T cells with small pieces of tumor&#xD;
      proteins WT1, PRAME, NY-ESO-1, and Survivin. These protein fragments stimulate the donor T&#xD;
      cells to grow and react against these proteins in such a way that they will recognize and&#xD;
      kill cancer cells that express these proteins. Once sufficient numbers of multiTAA-specific T&#xD;
      cells have been made, the investigators test them to make sure they target the patient's&#xD;
      cancer cells, but not their normal healthy cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multiTAA-specific T cells will be administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion over&#xD;
      10 minutes. The patient's cancer will be assessed within 4 weeks prior to the T cell&#xD;
      infusion, and then 4-6 weeks after the infusion. If at least 4 weeks after the infusion there&#xD;
      is no change or a reduction in the number of cancer cells measured in the bone marrow, or a&#xD;
      decline in cancer-specific markers in the blood, patients may receive up to six (6)&#xD;
      additional doses of T cells at least 4 weeks apart. All of the treatments will be given by&#xD;
      the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Houston Methodist Hospital or Texas Children's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For at least 4 weeks after the infusion, patients may not receive any other anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatments, such as radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Patients who do receive any other&#xD;
      therapies will be taken off treatment and will not be able to receive additional doses of T&#xD;
      cells. However, drugs such as 5-azacytidine (Vidaza), decitabine (Dacogen), or lenalidomide&#xD;
      (Revlimid) will be allowed during infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study, which means that at the beginning, patients will be started&#xD;
      on the lowest dose (1 of 5 different levels) of T cells. Once that dose level proves safe,&#xD;
      the next group of patients will be started at the next highest dose. This process will&#xD;
      continue until all 5 dose levels have been studied. If side-effects are too severe, the dose&#xD;
      will be lowered or the T cells injections will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL TESTS BEFORE TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, patients will undergo a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of AML/MDS (done by bone marrow biopsy or tests on blood or other tissues)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test, if patient is a female who can have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL TESTS DURING TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo standard medical tests on the day of infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL TESTS AFTER TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function on week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of AML/MDS 4-6 weeks after the T cells infusion and 8-12 weeks after the&#xD;
           infusion (done by bone marrow biopsy and tests done on your blood or other tissues).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body, an extra 20-40 mL&#xD;
      (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before the infusion, and at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8.&#xD;
      Afterwards, blood will be collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the infusion. Blood should&#xD;
      come from the central intravenous line, and should not require extra needle sticks.&#xD;
      Investigators will use this blood to see how long the T cells last, and to look at the immune&#xD;
      response to the patient's cancer. Investigators will also look at this in bone marrow and&#xD;
      other tissue samples collected from the patient at the time points stated above&#xD;
      (pre-infusion, 4 - 6 weeks and 8 - 12 weeks post infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for up to one year from the date of the last T cell infusion, so&#xD;
      that the investigators can learn more about the way the T cells are working, how long the T&#xD;
      cells last in the body, and to assess the immune response to the cancer. Patients who receive&#xD;
      additional doses of T cells will undergo the same tests and evaluations performed for each&#xD;
      dose as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be contacted once a year for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years&#xD;
      follow-up) to evaluate their disease response long-term.&#xD;
