  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this community randomized operations research study was to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      a peer-facilitated community support group intervention on uptake of maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      child health (MNCH) and PMTCT services and on adherence outcomes in Zimbabwe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To increase uptake of, and retention within maternal and child health/prevention of&#xD;
      maternal-to-child HIV transmission (MCH/PMTCT) services, the investigators conducted a&#xD;
      community-based peer facilitator intervention study in Hurungwe District of Zimbabwe. Using a&#xD;
      paired community randomized design, 16 health facility-linked communities were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to the intervention or control condition, with a total of approximately 1,600&#xD;
      pregnant and lactating women, (100 women in each community), recruited into the study. In the&#xD;
      intervention communities, 24 trained peer facilitators (3 in each community) using&#xD;
      participatory educational approaches were encouraging women to form antenatal and post-natal&#xD;
      groups, and to utilize and adhere to MCH/PMTCT services and recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer facilitators, by the definition of this project, were women from the community who were&#xD;
      peers to pregnant and lactating women; who had recently been through the process themselves&#xD;
      and could speak to their experience. A key activity of the community-based peer facilitators&#xD;
      was the encouragement of the formation of women into groups, and the participation of these&#xD;
      women into antenatal care (ANC), prevention of maternal to child transmission (PMTCT), and&#xD;
      postnatal care (PNC) programs. The group process was enable solidarity and support among the&#xD;
      women at the vulnerable times of pregnancy and lactation.&#xD;

    <description>Peer-facilitated community support group is the experimental intervention. The intervention tested in this study involved using trained peer facilitators to create demand for and retention within the ANC/PMTCT program.The peer facilitators were volunteer women from the community, who had recently been through the ANC process themselves and could speak about their experience(s). the support group meetings was to develop skills and generate self-efficacy for the women to be able to take actions such as routine antenatal and postnatal clinic attendance using participatory learning techniques. The peer facilitators were provided with job aids which outlined key points for the various educational sessions.</description>

    <description>Support groups were composed of up to 20 women from community. Peer facilitator facilitated a total of 6 groups of a maximum of 20 women each. Women were exposed to 8 two hour sessions. Facilitators gave activities in support of MCH/PMTCT. Group met twice a month for four months. The support group meetings took place in the community at a convenient location for those attending (e.g. village meeting point, churches, schools or individual households). With local support through community leaders, the intervention involved trained peer facilitators working with pregnant and post-partum women to form ANC and PNC support groups through which they will present information on general maternal and child health and PMTCT specific topics using participatory learning and problem-solving approaches.</description>
