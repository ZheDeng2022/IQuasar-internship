      This is a prospective observational multi-center multi-national study of the characteristics&#xD;
      and outcomes of patients receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) in the Arab&#xD;
      Gulf region. A total of 1,500 patients will be enrolled. Data on baseline clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, ICD programming parameters, inpatient outcomes, and clinical events such as&#xD;
      mortality and ICD discharges over 1 year of follow-up will be collected.&#xD;

      1. INTRUDUCTION 1.1 Background and Rationale The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator&#xD;
           (ICD) is an effective tool for the prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in high-risk&#xD;
           patients. The efficacy of the ICD in the secondary and primary prevention of SCD was&#xD;
           demonstrated in several large randomized clinical trials. The evolution of clinical&#xD;
           trials of ICD therapy for primary prevention of SCD and the adoption of current national&#xD;
           practice guidelines has lead to a considerable increase in the use of ICDs worldwide. In&#xD;
           the Arab Gulf region, utilization of ICD therapy in high-risk patients had increased in&#xD;
           the past decade with the arrival of trained electrophysiologists in the Gulf states.&#xD;
           While observational studies in the United States and Europe have evaluated ICD use in&#xD;
           those regions, there are scarce data on how ICDs are being used in the Gulf. Few single&#xD;
           center studies have reported early results, and to date there are no prospective&#xD;
           multinational data on ICD use in the Gulf. The Gulf Implantable&#xD;
           Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry (GulfICD) will be the first prospective,&#xD;
           multicentre, multinational, observational studies of patients receiving ICDs in the Arab&#xD;
           Gulf states.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS The primary objective of the study is to describe the&#xD;
           characteristics and outcomes of patients receiving ICD in the Arab Gulf region. Once&#xD;
           completed, the data collected from GulfICD will be available for further secondary&#xD;
           analyses including a description of ICD implant indications and programming patterns in&#xD;
           the Gulf. As this is an observational and descriptive study, no specific endpoint is&#xD;
           considered primary. However, main outcomes to be measured include all-cause mortality&#xD;
           and ICD discharges including appropriate discharges for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and&#xD;
           inappropriate discharges for other causes. Other endpoints to be measured include&#xD;
           adverse events in the immediate post-implant period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN Gulf ICD is a prospective, multicentre, multinational observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SUBJECT SELECTION 4.1 Inclusion Criteria All adult patients 18 years or older, receiving&#xD;
           a new ICD implant and willing to sign a consent form will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Exclusion Criteria Patients &lt; 18 years and those not willing to sign a consent form.&#xD;
           Subjects with existing ICDs undergoing pulse generator replacements or system revisions&#xD;
           will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. STUDY TREATMENTS All subjects will be treated per routine clinical practice. There will&#xD;
           be no study-specific interventions/treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STUDY PROCEDURES 6.1 Subject Withdrawal Subjects will have the right to withdraw from&#xD;
           the study at anytime.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. DATA VARIABLES 7.1 Data Variables Data variables to be collected are detailed in the&#xD;
           attached case-report form(CRF) (Baseline CRF Appendix 1, Follow Up CRF Appendix 2). Data&#xD;
           will be collected on paper CRF and then entered online. Variables to be collected at&#xD;
           baseline will include the following domains: 1. Baseline Demographics, 2. Admission&#xD;
           Characteristics, 3. Medical History and Risk Factors, 4. Diagnostic Procedures, 5. ICD&#xD;
           Implant Procedure Characteristics, 6. ICD Programming, 7. Adverse Events, 8. Discharge&#xD;
           Characteristics, 9. Discharge Medications, 10. Interim Events (during follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Variable definitions will be based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart&#xD;
           Association/Heart Rhythm Society 2006 Key Data Elements and Definitions for&#xD;
           Electrophysiological Studies and Procedures and the American College of Cardiology&#xD;
           National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) ICD Registry data dictionary&#xD;
           (httpp://www.ncdr.com/Web&#xD;
           NCDR/docs/public-data-collection-documents/icd_v2_datadictionary_codersdictionary_2-1.pd&#xD;
           f?sfvrsn=2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 8.1 Adverse Events Reporting Since there will be no&#xD;
           study-specific intervention/treatment, we do not expect study specific adverse events.&#xD;
           However, adverse events that may be related to ICD implantation will be collected as per&#xD;
           the attached CRF (Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. DATA ANALYSIS 9.1 Sample Size Considerations Unlike randomized controlled trials where&#xD;
           specific hypotheses are tested and primary comparative analyses are planned,&#xD;
           observational studies and patient registries typically address descriptive objectives.&#xD;
           Such objectives do not lend themselves to classic sample size/power calculations.&#xD;
           Nonetheless, sample size considerations are important in the planning of registries.&#xD;
           Typically, adequate sample size is required to ensure adequate precision around key&#xD;
           outcomes and provide sufficient generalizability. With that in mind, we wanted to ensure&#xD;
           adequate precision around two key outcomes: all-cause mortality and/or rate of&#xD;
           appropriate ICD discharges at one year. To estimate an event rate of 10% at 1 year with&#xD;
           a margin of error of 2% and 95% confidence intervals, a sample size of 829 patients is&#xD;
           required. Since there is little guidance in the literature on such event rates among ICD&#xD;
           recipients in the Gulf, and to compensate for losses to follow-up, we adjusted our&#xD;
           sample size upwards to 1,000 patients. Sample size was later increased to 1,500 patients&#xD;
           as additional funding became available. Such a sample size was considered logistically&#xD;
           feasible given our experience with ICD implant rates in the Gulf.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9.2 Statistical Methods Standard descriptive statistics will be used to analyse the&#xD;
           data. Continuous variables will be summarized using mean and standard deviation or&#xD;
           median and 25th and 75th percentile when significant deviation from a normal&#xD;
           distribution is observed. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and&#xD;
           percentages. Basic univariate comparisons will be performed using Student's t-test or&#xD;
           the Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate for continuous variables, and the Chi square&#xD;
           test for categorical variables. Associations between baseline variables and outcomes&#xD;
           during follow-up will be assessed using logistic regression or when exact event dates&#xD;
           are available Cox proportional hazard models.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE There is no substitute for good conscious. The&#xD;
           investigators and their personnel filling the CRFs are responsible for filling the forms&#xD;
           honestly and accurately. All forms must be filled prospectively. Quality control&#xD;
           checking mechanisms are implemented in the online CRF system to prevent entry of&#xD;
           inconsistent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 11.1 Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records A CRF is&#xD;
           required and should be collected and completed for each patient. Online data entry of&#xD;
           the CRF will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11.2 Record Retention Investigators will retain the paper CRFs per local ethics&#xD;
           regulations. Paper CRFs will be stored in a secure area with access only available to&#xD;
           study investigators. The online CRF portal will be password protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. ETHICS 12.1 Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee Approval It is the&#xD;
           responsibility of the investigator to get prospective approval of the study protocol,&#xD;
           consent form, and any amendments from the local institutional review boards/ethic&#xD;
           committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
           protocol and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. Study conduct will also&#xD;
           conform to the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research&#xD;
           Involving Human Subjects adopted by the General Assembly of the World Medical&#xD;
           Association&#xD;
&#xD;
           12.3 Subject Information and Consent All investigators will ensure protections of&#xD;
           subjects' personal data and subject names or identifiers will not be included on any&#xD;
           reports or publications from the study. Each study subject will be informed about the&#xD;
           study objectives and procedures and all questions will be answered. Subjects will have&#xD;
           to sign a consent form to be enrolled in the study. The consent form must be in&#xD;
           compliance with local regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. SPONSORSHIP GulfICD will be conducted under the auspices of the Gulf Heart Rhythm&#xD;
           Society (GHRS) and the Gulf Heart Association (GHA). Partial funding for the development&#xD;
           of the online CRF portal is provided by Medtronic, Inc.&#xD;
