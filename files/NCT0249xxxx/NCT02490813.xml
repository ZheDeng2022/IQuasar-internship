  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using traditional Chinese medicine for&#xD;
      food allergy. The Harvard group has successfully demonstrated the Food Allergy Herbal Formula&#xD;
      - FAHF2 completely blocked peanut-induced anaphylaxis in a murine model, and currently being&#xD;
      studied in human. Therefore, in collaboration with the Institute of Chinese Medicine, CUHK,&#xD;
      the investigators have developed a more simplified Chinese herbal formula - X (CHFX),&#xD;
      containing four food-grade Chinese herbs, Wu-mei (Fructus Pruni Mume); Ling-zhi (Gonoderma);&#xD;
      Huang-bai (Cortex Phellodendron) and Zhi-su (Perilla frutescens).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators would like to examine whether there is reduction in&#xD;
      allergic symptoms in food challenge after administering the CHFX for 8 weeks. There will be&#xD;
      pre- and post- CHFX food challenges and other related tests.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to recruit 24 subjects for the present study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups, control group (n=12) and treatment group (n=12). At recruitment&#xD;
      all subjects will be required to stop anti-allergic medicines and Chinese medicines as a wash&#xD;
      out period for two weeks (week 1 and week 2). They will be required to keep a record of their&#xD;
      symptoms and peak flow rates twice daily throughout the entire study. Skin prick test will be&#xD;
      performed with a panel of commercially available skin test solutions for cod, shrimp and crab&#xD;
      (ALK). Total and specific IgE as well as total and specific IgG4 for fish and shellfish will&#xD;
      be measured (by the HKSH laboratory or CUHK laboratory). Graded open cod, shrimp or crab&#xD;
      challenge will be performed as described later at HKSH in each patient to determine the&#xD;
      baseline tolerance level to fish or shellfish, using freeze-dried cod, shrimp or crab as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determining the baseline tolerance level, subjects in the treatment group will take 2&#xD;
      grams of the CHFX or placebo daily for 8 weeks (week 4 to week 11). The placebo powder&#xD;
      consists of food grade medicinal starch blended with coloring agent. After the 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, skin prick tests, blood tests as at baseline and oral challenges will be repeated&#xD;
      (week 12). During the study subjects will be requested to consume their normal diet but&#xD;
      avoiding fish and shellfish, with no consumption of any other Chinese herbal medication. They&#xD;
      can take anti-allergic medicines as necessary but will note when medicines are taken in their&#xD;
      symptom and peak flow diary.&#xD;
