      This randomized phase II study aims to investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to&#xD;
      standard corticosteroid therapy results in greater improvement in symptoms and less&#xD;
      treatment-induced symptoms compared with standard corticosteroid therapy for patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery. It is hypothesized that the addition&#xD;
      of bevacizumab to standard care corticosteroids will reduce treatment-induced toxicities and&#xD;
      improve neurologic impairments in patients with brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery&#xD;
      for brain metastases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blinded phase II study of corticosteroids with bevacizumab vs.&#xD;
      corticosteroids with placebo for brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery for brain&#xD;
      metastases. This is a two-arm clinical trial with parallel group design for longitudinal&#xD;
      quality of life endpoint. Patients will be stratified according to age (≤ 65 years vs. &gt; 65&#xD;
      years), pathological confirmation of necrosis (yes vs. no), MDASI-BT mean global score&#xD;
      (symptom + interference scores) ( &lt; 4.0 vs. &gt; 4.0) and prior whole brain radiotherapy (yes&#xD;
      vs. no). The primary and secondary objectives are detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to standard corticosteroid therapy results&#xD;
      in greater improvement in symptoms (clinical and patient-reported symptom improvement&#xD;
      associated with radionecrosis and less radionecrosis treatment-induced symptoms) compared&#xD;
      with standard corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the toxicity profile associated with bevacizumab and corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare self-reported health related quality of life (HRQOL) using LASA,&#xD;
           Dexamethasone Symptoms Questionnaire-Chronic (DSQ-C), and MDASI-BT symptom and&#xD;
           interference score between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare intracranial progression-free survival and time to maximum radiographic&#xD;
           response between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the dose and duration of corticosteroids required between treatment arms and&#xD;
           correlate steroid requirement with DSQ-C and MDASI-BT scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient event monitoring will occur every 2 months after treatment up to 6 months. Then event&#xD;
      monitoring will occur up to one year.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) Symptom Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for brain tumor (MDASI-BT) is a 28-item multi-symptom patient-reported outcome measure assessing the severity of symptoms experienced by cancer patients and the interference with daily living caused by these symptoms, with 9 items specific to brain tumors. Each item ranges from 0 (best condition) to 10 (worst condition). A subscale score (Symptom Severity) is the average of the subscale items with 0 being &quot;not present&quot; and 10 being &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot;, given that a specified minimum numbers of items were completed. A negative change in score from baseline to given time point indicates a worsening score.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Measure Using the Single Item Linear Analogue Scale (LASA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1.5 years post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Linear Analogue Scale used is a 5-question survey. Patients are asked to score the following questions on a 1(as bad as it can be) -10 (as good as it can be) scale: 1) your overall quality of life, 2) your overall (intellectual) well being, 3) your overall physical well being, 4) your overall emotional well being, and 5) your overall spiritual well being. The change in score was computed from baseline to 1.5 years post-treatment. A negative difference is thought of as a worsening score from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Measure Using the Dexamethasone Symptoms Questionnaire - Chronic (DSQ-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The DSQ-C was developed for use in the brain tumor patient population. It consists of 18 questions rated on a 4-point scale (1 to 4, with 4 indicating a worse symptom) to indicate the presence and severity of symptoms. For each patient, the sum across all 18 questions were computed(18-72, with 18 being a score of 1 for each of the 18 questions and 72 being a score of 4 for each of the questions, refering to the previous sentence, a score of 18(a score of 1, 18 times) indicates the best possible score. A score of 72(a score of 4, 18 times) indicates the worst possible. The mean for total score across each week (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8) is reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 1.5 years post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The MDASI-BT was developed and validated for use in the brain tumor patient population, including those with brain metastases and typically requires less than 4 minutes to complete. It consists of 23 symptoms rated on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) to indicate the presence and severity of the symptom, with 0 being &quot;not present&quot; and 10 being &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot; MDASI-BT Symptom Scoring: A global symptom score for the MDASI symptom severity scale is obtained by taking the average of the 23 items together. This puts the score on a 0-10 scalenumerical rating scale (NRS) to indicate the presence and severity of the symptom, with 0 being &quot;not present&quot; and 10 being &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The mean global symptom at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 were used in this analysis.</description>

          2. Patients at institutions that elect to utilize central imaging review to confirm&#xD;
             eligibility must be pre-registered prior to submission of these images; images should&#xD;
             be submitted as soon as possible after the pre-registration magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
             (MRI) is obtained; turnaround time for this review will be =&lt; 72 business hours after&#xD;
             receipt of images by the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients at institutions that elect to confirm eligibility locally may be&#xD;
             pre-registered at the same time as they are randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
        Registration/Randomization Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A diagnosis of radionecrosis will be based on a clinical onset of symptoms and&#xD;
             radiological findings of radionecrosis at 3-24 months following radiosurgery, with or&#xD;
             without pathological confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.1 'Symptomatic' brain radionecrosis to at least one lesion following radiosurgery&#xD;
             treatment for brain metastases where 'symptomatic' is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.1.1 New or increasing headache associated with mass effect, sensory or motor&#xD;
             abnormality, cognitive changes, speech difficulty, balance or coordination difficulty,&#xD;
             cranial nerve deficits&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.1.2 Symptoms are persistent or worsening despite administration of at least&#xD;
             dexamethasone 4 mg (or equivalent corticosteroid) daily for 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.2 Clinical eligibility supported by central imaging real-time review. The presence&#xD;
             of at least the following conventional MR image characteristic:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.2.1 Conventional MR - Lesion quotient of &lt; 0.3, where lesion quotient is defined as&#xD;
             the proportional value of the maximum axial cross-sectional area of the T2-weighted&#xD;
             defined lesion over the maximum axial cross-sectional area of the contrast-enhancing&#xD;
             lesion on the T1-weighted post-gadolinium sequence on a comparable axial slice. If the&#xD;
             conventional MR findings are not seen, the following dynamic susceptibility-contrast&#xD;
             (DSC) MR characteristics may be used to meet eligibility for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.2.2 DSC MR - The cut-offs below will be based on GRE EPI DSC perfusion images,&#xD;
             acquired without using a gadolinium pre-load:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.2.2.1 Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) &lt;1.5 in the enhancing- lesion relative&#xD;
             to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.2.2.2. Percentage of signal recovery (PSR) &gt; 76%, where PSR is determined by&#xD;
             comparing the lower signal intensity during passage of the contrast bolus with the&#xD;
             post-contrast signal intensity on the signal intensity-time curve&#xD;
&#xD;
             1.2.3 Centers that standardly use PET or MRS to determine a diagnosis of radionecrosis&#xD;
             are permitted to use these modalities to assist in their patient selection; however&#xD;
             the criteria described for conventional MR and/or DSC should also be met for study&#xD;
             eligibility. Both PET and MRS are not mandatory for study eligibility.&#xD;

&#xD;
             2.1 Must have been taking a stable dose of corticosteroids for symptom management for&#xD;
             at least 1 week before baseline MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2.2 No systemic therapy within 2 weeks prior to registration or plan for systemic&#xD;
             therapy within the first 8 weeks after study registration. The protocol provides a&#xD;
             list of 'approved systemic' therapies that are allowed for concurrent use with&#xD;
             bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2.3 No bevacizumab ≤ 3 months of study registration.&#xD;

          <description>The patient will receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV given on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle for 4 cycles. Once the patient has started the study treatment, the dose of corticosteroids will be tapered every 5 days (e.g., dexamethasone 2 mg or prednisone 15 mg per taper), as tolerated, under the management of the treating MD. If patients deteriorate while tapering, dexamethasone will be increased up to a maximum of 16 mg per day, as per treating MD, to manage symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change in M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) Symptom Severity Score</title>
        <description>The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for brain tumor (MDASI-BT) is a 28-item multi-symptom patient-reported outcome measure assessing the severity of symptoms experienced by cancer patients and the interference with daily living caused by these symptoms, with 9 items specific to brain tumors. Each item ranges from 0 (best condition) to 10 (worst condition). A subscale score (Symptom Severity) is the average of the subscale items with 0 being &quot;not present&quot; and 10 being &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot;, given that a specified minimum numbers of items were completed. A negative change in score from baseline to given time point indicates a worsening score.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life Measure Using the Single Item Linear Analogue Scale (LASA)</title>
        <description>The Linear Analogue Scale used is a 5-question survey. Patients are asked to score the following questions on a 1(as bad as it can be) -10 (as good as it can be) scale: 1) your overall quality of life, 2) your overall (intellectual) well being, 3) your overall physical well being, 4) your overall emotional well being, and 5) your overall spiritual well being. The change in score was computed from baseline to 1.5 years post-treatment. A negative difference is thought of as a worsening score from baseline.</description>

        <description>The DSQ-C was developed for use in the brain tumor patient population. It consists of 18 questions rated on a 4-point scale (1 to 4, with 4 indicating a worse symptom) to indicate the presence and severity of symptoms. For each patient, the sum across all 18 questions were computed(18-72, with 18 being a score of 1 for each of the 18 questions and 72 being a score of 4 for each of the questions, refering to the previous sentence, a score of 18(a score of 1, 18 times) indicates the best possible score. A score of 72(a score of 4, 18 times) indicates the worst possible. The mean for total score across each week (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8) is reported.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life Measure Using the The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) Score.</title>
        <description>The MDASI-BT was developed and validated for use in the brain tumor patient population, including those with brain metastases and typically requires less than 4 minutes to complete. It consists of 23 symptoms rated on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) to indicate the presence and severity of the symptom, with 0 being &quot;not present&quot; and 10 being &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot; MDASI-BT Symptom Scoring: A global symptom score for the MDASI symptom severity scale is obtained by taking the average of the 23 items together. This puts the score on a 0-10 scalenumerical rating scale (NRS) to indicate the presence and severity of the symptom, with 0 being &quot;not present&quot; and 10 being &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The mean global symptom at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 were used in this analysis.</description>
