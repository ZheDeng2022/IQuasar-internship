  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is planned to determine the potential role for regular fat dairy products&#xD;
      in short-term metabolic control in younger and older adults and the metabolic flexibility in&#xD;
      response to food components, which are areas that have not yet been explored. Subjects would&#xD;
      be served with solid (cheese), semi-solid (yogurt) and liquid (milk) dairy products and skim&#xD;
      milk (control) and water (non-caloric control) in three separate studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last 30 years, overweight and obesity have become characteristic of the majority of&#xD;
      Canadians. Approximately 60% of adults in Canada are overweight or obese. The Canadian Health&#xD;
      Measures Survey, conducted during 2007-2009, estimated prevalence of metabolic syndrome at&#xD;
      19.1% in the adult population. In addition, according to the 2010 Canadian Community Health&#xD;
      Survey, 18.1% of Canadian adults have been reported obese. Along with the health burden, it&#xD;
      has also brought about an estimated economic burden of $ 4.3 billion annually in 2001, which&#xD;
      has likely doubled as of today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes occur concurrently with insulin resistance marked by&#xD;
      increased blood glucose levels at fasting and postprandial, glycosylated blood proteins&#xD;
      leading to arterial damage, inflammation and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Despite increased consumer interest in consuming foods that may help treat or prevent obesity&#xD;
      and diabetes, effective countermeasures against metabolic diseases have yet to be&#xD;
      established. Thus, food products that are capable of controlling parameters of metabolic&#xD;
      diseases including blood glucose, insulin levels and food intake are in urgent need of&#xD;
      investigation and identification. Dairy products are believed to hold this potential because&#xD;
      of their functional physiological properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been many observational and long-term clinical studies showing that regular&#xD;
      consumption of dairy products correlate with a better body composition and a lower incidence&#xD;
      of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Studies have also found that dairy proteins are more&#xD;
      satiating than other types of proteins, and that they are effective in lowering the increase&#xD;
      in glycemic response after high GI food intake, but most studies have been done in isolated&#xD;
      proteins. Hence, the role of dairy proteins, in their conventional food form reflecting usual&#xD;
      intake, on food intake and glycemia and their interactions with these metabolic diseases is&#xD;
      of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From short-term studies done in our lab, the investigators have shown that dairy products can&#xD;
      bring about benefits in glycemic control and food intake when consumed before or within ad&#xD;
      libitum meals, which can be achieved by both insulin dependent and independent mechanisms.&#xD;
      The investigators have shown that fluid milk products and yogurt improve post-meal glycemic&#xD;
      excursions when consumed before or within an ad libitum meal by healthy young adults. Except&#xD;
      the yogurt study conducted in our lab, there have been no other studies reporting the role of&#xD;
      solid or semi-solid dairy products consumed before a meal, within a meal, immediately&#xD;
      post-meal or as between meal snacks on glycemia and appetite control. Our study on yogurt&#xD;
      showed that yogurts, especially those with high protein to carbohydrate ratio, reduced&#xD;
      pre-meal glucose incremental areas under the curve. Further studies on solid and semi-solid&#xD;
      dairy need to be conducted because milk, like other caloric beverages, lead to calorie&#xD;
      accumulation if consumed before or with a meal even though it provides more nutrients, lowers&#xD;
      post-meal blood glucose excursions and leads to greater post-meal satiety in young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the evidence appears to be relatively consistent with respect to a beneficial role&#xD;
      of low-fat dairy products in the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D), however, the role of&#xD;
      regular/high-fat dairy is less clear. A number of cross-sectional and prospective&#xD;
      epidemiological studies have identified a positive association between the intake of dietary&#xD;
      fat and the risk for development of either insulin resistance or T2D20. More research is&#xD;
      needed to better understand the role of regular-fat dairy products on food intake as well as&#xD;
      of glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three studies are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 1 investigates the effects of 2-servings of pre-meal regular fat; cheese, yogurt&#xD;
           and milk on food intake at 2 hours, satiety and glycemia in normal weight young adults&#xD;
           (20-30 yrs) and normal weight/overweight older adults (60-70 yrs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 2 investigates the effects of 1-serving of pre-meal regular fat; cheese, yogurt&#xD;
           and milk on satiety and glycemia in normal weight young adults (20-30 yrs) and normal&#xD;
           weight/overweight older adults (60-70 yrs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 3 investigate the effects of 1 serving for pre-meal regular fat; cheese, yogurt&#xD;
           and milk on food intake at 15 min and 30 min, satiety and glycemia in normal&#xD;
           weight/overweight older adults (60-70 yrs).&#xD;
