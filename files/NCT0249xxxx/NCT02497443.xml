      â€¢ The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous MSC&#xD;
      application for the therapy of drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy. Adult (18-60 years old)&#xD;
      patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from refractory epilepsy with frequent (&gt;5 events per&#xD;
      month) seizures were included in this study. The pts were randomized to the standard&#xD;
      treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (control group, 30 pts) or anti-epileptic drugs plus&#xD;
      autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (study group, 30 pts). The pts in the study group&#xD;
      received one intravenous injection of ex vivo expanded MSCs (40-101 x 106 cells) and one&#xD;
      subsequent endolumbal injection of neuroinduced MSCs (2.7 - 8.0 x 106 cells). Both the&#xD;
      unfavorable reactions to MSC infusions and the clinical effects, including complications,&#xD;
      were examined. The unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or&#xD;
      hemorrhage at the site of injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS; i.e., hyperthermia, fatigue, and myalgia).The possible beneficial effects of therapy in&#xD;
      the two groups of pts were examined based on clinical observations and electroencephalography&#xD;
      measurements (prior and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy). To&#xD;
      determine potential changes in disease progression, the signs of cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      behavioral disorders, and particularly, changes in seizure character and frequency were&#xD;
      evaluated using the National Hospital Scale of Seizure Severity. The main points of disease&#xD;
      monitoring were &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; responses (to therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and&#xD;
      remission of disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were performed to evaluate&#xD;
      electrical alpha, beta, theta and delta waves based on standard and additional criteria. The&#xD;
      paroxismality index, the peak frequency of EEG activity, the index of slow activity, and the&#xD;
      summarized points of EEG pathology signs were calculated for each patient. All assessments&#xD;
      were performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were&#xD;
      compared to identify the potential differences between the two pts groups. Therapy was&#xD;
      terminated when immediate unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections were observed. The&#xD;
      final observation of each patient included clinical and EEG assessments at the time point of&#xD;
      12 months (or more) after the application of the MSC-based therapy.&#xD;

      The main goal of this phase 1 clinical trial was to evaluate the safety of an autologous&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) application as therapy for drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy in&#xD;
      a one-center study. It is well known that drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy is a&#xD;
      dramatically invalidating disorder for which applied stationary and outpatient therapies have&#xD;
      no real clinical effect. Therefore new approaches are needed to reach remission, to stop&#xD;
      disease progression, and to increase patient quality of life. For this study, adult (18-60&#xD;
      years old) patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy&#xD;
      with frequent (&gt;5 events per month) seizures were included into study. Drug-resistance was&#xD;
      defined by a lack of any evident clinical response (i.e., no decrease in seizure frequency or&#xD;
      reduction in disease progression) of the pts with symptomatic epilepsy to carbamazepine,&#xD;
      valproic acid, topiramate, lamotrigine, or phenobarbital (i.e., anti-epileptic drugs[AEDs])&#xD;
      as monotherapies and in different combinations over the previous one calendar year. The&#xD;
      criteria for exclusion were patient refusal to participate, unfavorable reactions to therapy,&#xD;
      CNS inflammatory conditions, chronic psychoses, CNS tumors, relapses of chronic somatic or&#xD;
      neurologic diseases, and blood positivity for hepatitis B or C or HIV. The plan included the&#xD;
      inclusion of 30 pts in the study group and 30 pts in the control group over a period of 5&#xD;
      years. The pts were randomized to standard treatment with AEDs (control group) or AEDs plus&#xD;
      autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, study group). The MSCs were obtained from bone&#xD;
      marrow samples of the same patient and were purified and expanded ex vivo in a specialized&#xD;
      cellular biotechnology laboratory. The MSCs were characterized by immunophenotyping as&#xD;
      CD90+CD105 +CD45-CD34-cells. After 3 weeks of cultivation in vitro, a portion of the MSC were&#xD;
      additionally cultured for 7 days in Neurocult-XF proliferation medium to obtain neuroinduced&#xD;
      MSCs. Neuroinduction was proved by the presence of the genetic markers nestin and&#xD;
      neuron-specific enolase. Finally, 40-101 x 106 autologous cultured MSCs and 2.7 - 8.0 x 106&#xD;
      autologous neuroinduced MSCs were harvested, resuspended in saline solution containing 5%&#xD;
      autologous blood serum for injection, and, following a measurement of the viability (98%&#xD;
      cells), transferred to the clinical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pts in the study group received one slowly delivered (over 5-10 minutes) intravenous&#xD;
      injection of ex vivo expanded autologous MSCs in a volume of 20 ml, and 5-7 days later, each&#xD;
      patient in the study group received an additional slowly delivered endolumbal injection of&#xD;
      the neuroinduced MSCs in a volume of 5 ml. Both unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections&#xD;
      (over one day following the performance of the procedures) and the early (up to one month)&#xD;
      and late (up to 6 months) clinical effects, including complications, were evaluated.&#xD;
      Unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or hemorrhage at the site of&#xD;
      injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system (CNS, i.e., hyperthermia,&#xD;
      fatigue, and myalgia). Later potential unfavorable systemic reactions of the CNS and vascular&#xD;
      system, including infectious and noninfectious complications of the progression of the&#xD;
      disease to be controlled, were examined. All of the events were documented in medical cards.&#xD;
      In cases in which these events exhibited dangerous characteristics, they were declared to&#xD;
      members of the monitoring board (the center's ethical committee) for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      exclusion of the patients from the study or the termination of the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also evaluated were the possible beneficial effects of MSC-based therapy in the pts of the&#xD;
      study group. These effects were detected via clinical observations at selected therapy time&#xD;
      points (i.e., 3 and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy) and&#xD;
      electroencephalography measurements prior to and one year after the therapy. To determine the&#xD;
      possible changes in disease progression, signs of cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders,&#xD;
      and changes in seizure characteristics and frequency were evaluated. For the evaluation of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, we used the Mini-Mental State Examination. The handicapping effect of&#xD;
      disease on daily life was scoring using the Subjective Handicap of Epilepsy Scale. State&#xD;
      anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital anxiety and depression scale .&#xD;
      Changes in seizure characteristics and frequency were evaluated using the National Hospital&#xD;
      Scale of Seizure Severity. The processes of voluntary attention and performance were studied&#xD;
      with Schulte tables according to the methods of Kraepelin. Schulte tables were used to study&#xD;
      sensorimotor reaction times and the distribution and stability of attention. The &quot;Account of&#xD;
      Kraepelin&quot; method was used to study health, fatigue and the stability of attention. The&#xD;
      assessment of short-term memory was performed via the method of memorizing 10 words; this&#xD;
      method aims to determine the volume and speed of oral-aural memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main clinical characteristics that are used for disease monitoring were &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;&#xD;
      responses (regarding therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and remission of disease at the&#xD;
      early (3 months) and late (12 month and more) time points after therapy. To evaluate partial&#xD;
      responses to therapy, the numbers of pts who exhibited 50% reductions in seizure frequency&#xD;
      were assessed. Seizure type (i.e., generalized tonic-clonic, partial complex, simple partial,&#xD;
      and multiple types of seizures) was also evaluated along with changes in seizure type during&#xD;
      the treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography recordings were performed at admission and across the monitoring&#xD;
      period using a Mizar EEG 201 encephalography system with biopotential registration from 16&#xD;
      body points according to the &quot;10-20&quot; scheme. The observed electrical alpha, beta, theta and&#xD;
      delta waves were analyzed in 3-min segments (with further recalculation for each 1-minute&#xD;
      segment) prior to (at admission) and 1 year after MSC application. The peak frequency of the&#xD;
      alpha waves was also calculated. Both the spontaneous state and the state after the loading&#xD;
      probe (hyperventilation and photostimulation) were evaluated for each patient. The&#xD;
      characteristics of the electroencephalographies (EEG) were attributed to local and diffuse&#xD;
      cortical alterations. We evaluated the paroxysmality index, quantities of local and&#xD;
      generalized spikes of epileptiform waves per minute, peak frequency of EEG activity, index of&#xD;
      slow activity, and summarized points of EEG pathology signs. EEGs with epileptiform activity&#xD;
      included spikes, spike-slow waves, and high-amplitude spikes. The EEG recordings were&#xD;
      performed based on standard and additionally proposed criteria . All of the assessments were&#xD;
      performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were compared to&#xD;
      determine the potential differences due to the additionally performed MSC-based therapy. A&#xD;
      patient's therapy was terminated at any time point if immediate unfavorable reactions to the&#xD;
      MSC injections were observed. The final observations of the patients included clinical and&#xD;
      EEG assessments at 12 months (or more) after the application of the MSC-based therapy. The&#xD;
      summarized data for the pts in the control and study groups were collected in an electronic&#xD;
      database for further analysis and interpretations.&#xD;
