  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40% of members with a positive fecal occult blood result do not continue to&#xD;
      followup colonoscopy in Meuhedet. The purpose of this study is to identify the structural,&#xD;
      process, carer and patient related causes of undertreatment and suggest appropriate&#xD;
      organisational interventions. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the&#xD;
      investigators will identify organisational and personal barriers to completion of followup of&#xD;
      positive FOBT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the second in incidence and mortality among malignant tumors. Early&#xD;
      detection of the disease is an effective means of reducing mortality and is possible through&#xD;
      a fecal occult blood test. In the case of a positive result colonoscopy is required. In&#xD;
      Israel, about 30% of people with a positive occult blood test do not perform a follow-up&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to identify existing barriers to undergoing colonoscopy in a&#xD;
      normal-risk population and improving adherence through different intervention mechanisms. At&#xD;
      the end of the study we will describe effective intervention models at three levels: the&#xD;
      patient, physicians and the organisation to improve early detection of colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will focus on the normal-risk population groups in Israel with a positive occult&#xD;
           blood that didn't undergo colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will identify the barriers in diverse populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will review the accessibility of diagnostic facilities forcolon cancer in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will propose intervention programs to improve adherence at all levels in the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods: A prospective study sing both both quantitative and qualitative methods in&#xD;
      Meuhedet Health Services Target Population: Health system managers, physicians, and patients&#xD;
      (a representative sample of 200 patients adhere colonoscopy and 600 that didn't adhere). Data&#xD;
      collection databases from Meuhedet. The study will include questionnaires, focus groups and&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the magnitude of the problem&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Map the barriers to adherence with colonoscopy recommendations among patients,&#xD;
           physicians and geographic availability of colonoscopies facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Suggest intervention models for physicians, patients and organisations according to the&#xD;
           information provided by data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recommendation to decision makers on the implementation of national policy intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing: will use SPSS statistical analysis with the types of variables.&#xD;
