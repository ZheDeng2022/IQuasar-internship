             non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the&#xD;
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following&#xD;
             approval by the sponsor. Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be&#xD;

             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any subject considered at risk of suicide or self harm based on investigator judgement&#xD;
