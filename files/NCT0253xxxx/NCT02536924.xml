      Crisis Teams are now a well established part of the mental health system. These teams are&#xD;
      effective in providing crisis management, treatment, referral, and educational services. We&#xD;
      are testing a waiting room intervention for the patients attending a Crisis Team. As far as&#xD;
      we are aware, no trial of a waiting room intervention has been reported in a psychiatric&#xD;
      setting. This is a preliminary study using a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) Design. Patients&#xD;
      (N =40) will be randomly allocated to either the treatment or the control group, and will be&#xD;
      selected from the local Crisis Team. The treatment group will receive a waiting room&#xD;
      intervention called, RESOLVE (Relaxation, SOLving problem and cognitiVe Errors), that is a&#xD;
      short film, Plus Treatment As Usual (TAU), and the control group will receive only TAU.&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will be assessed before and after the intervention, using the HADS&#xD;
      (Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale), CORE (Clinical Outcome in Routine Evaluation), (to&#xD;
      measure psychopathology) and WHODAS (World Health Organization Disability Assessment&#xD;
      Schedule) (for functioning). We hypothesize that the treatment group will demonstrate&#xD;
      significant improvement in mental health and functioning, compared to the control group.&#xD;
      Analyses will be conducted using SPSS v22, and will consist of a t-test or Chi Square test to&#xD;
      measure the baseline differences, and a linear regression to compare the differences between&#xD;
      the two groups at the end of the intervention. Results will be published in international&#xD;
      journals and will be presented in local and international conferences.&#xD;

      GRANT APPLICATION The mental health crisis teams are now a well established and vital part of&#xD;
      the mental health system. These teams are uniquely equipped to provide front-line mental&#xD;
      health care when and where it is most needed. It is able to provide on-site assessment,&#xD;
      crisis management, treatment, referral, and educational services to patients, families, law&#xD;
      enforcement officers, and the community at large. Mental health crisis teams provide access&#xD;
      to mental health care for even the most under-served populations efficiently and&#xD;
      cost-effectively. The cost-effectiveness of the team's services is defined by savings in both&#xD;
      monetary and human terms (Zealberg, Santos, &amp; Fisher, 1993) (Scott, 2000). However, no&#xD;
      interventions have been developed, that are specific to this service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending the crisis teams usually wait for their appointments, just like other&#xD;
      health settings. This can be a valuable time that can be used to deliver short term&#xD;
      educational interventions. This has been tried and tested in general health settings (Coyne,&#xD;
      Palmer, Shapiro, Thompson, &amp; DeMichele, 2004; Holmes-Garrett, 1990; Oermann, n.d.; Rhodes et&#xD;
      al., 2001; Wheeler et al., 2001). As far as we are aware no waiting room interventions have&#xD;
      been tried or tested in psychiatric setup. We have developed an intervention RESOLVE&#xD;
      (Relaxation Exercise, SOLving problem and cognitiVe Errors), that can be easily delivered&#xD;
      using eMedia (for example a tv screen) in waiting room. This intervention is short enough to&#xD;
      be given while patients are in a waiting room in a psychiatric clinic. A crisis team setting&#xD;
      might be ideal as most patients might find a problem solving approach helpful. We want to&#xD;
      conduct a pilot using a Randomised Controlled Trial design (RCT) to assess effectiveness of&#xD;
      this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Objectives The primary objective of this preliminary pilot study is to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a &quot;waiting room intervention&quot; for patients attending a crisis clinic. The&#xD;
      objectives of the study are to see if the intervention can reduce (1) symptoms of depression&#xD;
      and anxiety, (2) overall psychopathology, and (3) disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Participants (N =40) will be primarily recruited from the Crisis Clinic in&#xD;
      Kingston. Inclusion criteria are; All those who fulfill the diagnostic criteria of Depressive&#xD;
      episode (F32) or Recurrent depressive disorder (F33 except 33.4 ) using ICD10 RDC, are&#xD;
      between the ages of 18 to 65. Patients will be asked to attend a further appointment at the&#xD;
      end of study period and will be assessed again. The exclusion criteria include; excessive use&#xD;
      of alcohol or drugs (using ICD 10 RDC for alcohol or drug abuse or dependence) significant&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (for example learning disability or dementia) and active psychosis. Data&#xD;
      will be kept strictly confidential, available only to the primary investigators. Participants&#xD;
      may withdraw from the study at any time without penalties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This preliminary evaluation will use a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) design.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using www.randomization.com, from the list of all the&#xD;
      patients who consent. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either treatment or the&#xD;
      control arm. The treatment group will receive waiting room intervention plus TAU (Treatment&#xD;
      As Usual), while the control group will receive only TAU. Patients who have been referred for&#xD;
      the study will be provided brief information about the study. Those who meet the criteria and&#xD;
      consent will be then asked to join the study and will be allocated to one arm of the trial&#xD;
      after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Demographic information will be collected using a short questionnaire.&#xD;
      Assessments will be carried out by two research assistants independently. We will also&#xD;
      collect data on number of contacts with the Crisis Team, number of admissions and duration of&#xD;
      contact with the Crisis Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) is a 14 item,&#xD;
      self assessment scale designed to measure anxiety and depression. It has a high internal&#xD;
      consistency, face validity and concurrent validity. Even-numbered questions relate to&#xD;
      depression and odd-numbered questions relate to anxiety. Each question has 4 possible&#xD;
      responses. Responses are scored on a scale from 3 to 0. The maximum score is therefore 21 for&#xD;
      depression and 21 for anxiety. A score of 11 or higher indicates the probable presence of the&#xD;
      mood disorder with a score of 8 to 10 being just suggestive of the presence of the respective&#xD;
      state. The two subscales, anxiety and depression, have been found to be independent measures.&#xD;
      In its current form the HADS is now divided into four ranges: normal (0-7), mild (8-10),&#xD;
      moderate (11-15) and severe (16-21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Outcome in Routine Evaluatoin (CORE) is is a client self-report questionnaire&#xD;
      designed to be administered before and after therapy. The client is asked to respond to 34&#xD;
      questions about how they have been feeling over the last week, using a 5-point scale ranging&#xD;
      from 'not at all' to 'most or all of the time'. The 34 items of the measure cover four&#xD;
      dimensions: Subjective well-being, Problems/symptoms, Life functioning and Risk/harm. The&#xD;
      responses are designed to be averaged by the practitioner to produce a mean score to indicate&#xD;
      the level of current psychological global distress (from 'healthy' to 'severe'). The&#xD;
      questionnaire is repeated after the last session of treatment; comparison of the pre-and&#xD;
      post-therapy scores offers a measure of 'outcome' (i.e. whether or not the client's level of&#xD;
      distress has changed, and by how much) (Evans, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS) (Ust√ºn et al.,&#xD;
      2010) will be used to measure functioning. This scale assesses disability due to physical and&#xD;
      psychological problems, and has been used extensively in research settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be provided with information about&#xD;
      the study. Those who consent in writing will be randomly allocated to one arm of the trial.&#xD;
      All participants will complete the demographics questionnaire, HADS, WHO DAS &amp; CORE during an&#xD;
      interview with a primary investigator. Participants in the treatment arm will attend 1&#xD;
      session of the intervention in addition to the Treatment As Usual. Participants in the&#xD;
      control group will receive treatment as usual during this time. Participants in both groups&#xD;
      will be assessed at the end of 3 months wand then 6 months post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry and analysis Statistical analyses will be carried out using an Intention To Treat,&#xD;
      using SPSS v22. Both parametric and non-parametric tests will be carried out as appropriate&#xD;
      to compare groups. Treatment and control groups will be compared at the baseline, using Chi&#xD;
      square and t test. A linear regression will be used to compare the two groups at the end of&#xD;
      assessment period. This will be done, using group as the independent, and the end of&#xD;
      assessment scores as dependent variables. Baseline scores and variables that are not equally&#xD;
      distributed in two groups will be used as covariates. All the analyses will be carried out by&#xD;
      FN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results and Research Implications If effective, this innovative intervention will reduce&#xD;
      distress, psychopathology and disability in this group and will possibly improve functioning.&#xD;
      Success with this preliminary study could lead to subsequent research to further investigate&#xD;
      this novel intervention.&#xD;
