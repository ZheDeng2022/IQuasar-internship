  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HPV vaccine coverage among adolescents in the US is suboptimal. This is particularly true&#xD;
      among traditionally underserved adolescents. Few parent-targeted interventions have focused&#xD;
      on the parental decision-making process. Self-persuasion, generating one's own arguments for&#xD;
      engaging in a behavior, may be an effective means to influence parents' motivation to&#xD;
      vaccinate their children. In a three-phase study, investigators are using quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative research methods to develop and refine a tablet-based self-persuasion&#xD;
      intervention for parents who are undecided about the HPV vaccine. This clinical trial&#xD;
      submission focuses on the third phase of the study (the second stage is also registered in&#xD;
      clinical trials).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that HPV vaccination is recommended for male and female adolescents, HPV&#xD;
      vaccine coverage among adolescents age 13-17 is poor (60% for girls, 41.7% for boys).&#xD;
      HPV-related cancers are a significant burden on the US healthcare system and could be&#xD;
      prevented through adolescent vaccination. Rates of vaccination are suboptimal among&#xD;
      underserved populations (uninsured, low-income, racial and ethnic minorities) often seen in&#xD;
      safety-net clinics. Few interventions have been designed that target decision-making among&#xD;
      parents of unvaccinated adolescents. Self-persuasion, generating of one's own arguments for a&#xD;
      health behavior, may be an effective means of influencing HPV vaccination behaviors among&#xD;
      undecided or ambivalent parents. Through three stages, investigators will identify and&#xD;
      develop a self-persuasion intervention strategy to promote adolescent HPV vaccination in&#xD;
      safety-net clinics. In Stage 3, reported here, investigators will conduct a two-arm pilot&#xD;
      randomized control trial in the safety-net clinics to assess feasibility of testing the&#xD;
      self-persuasion intervention condition against standard of care (control group).&#xD;
      Investigators will also examine the impact of the intervention on parent-provider discussions&#xD;
      about HPV vaccination.&#xD;
