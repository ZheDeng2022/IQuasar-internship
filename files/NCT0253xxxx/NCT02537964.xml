  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled; crossover study of daily bathing with no-rinse, 2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) impregnated washcloths versus bathing with water/soap or water&#xD;
      according to gestational age and weight (e.g. standard bathing). The trial will take place in&#xD;
      the Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data ragarding bloodstream infections (BSI) and colonization with multidrug&#xD;
      resistant orgnisms (MDRO) will be collected for 3-6 months prior to patient enrollment. In&#xD;
      the preliminary phase of the study we will establish the safety of chlorhexidine bathing&#xD;
      using Clinell ® Chlorhexidine wash cloths on three groups of patients: term infants admitted&#xD;
      to the NICU; late preterm infants (34-37 weeks); preterm infants 30-34 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
      Interim analysis for adverse events will be performed after each group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the subsequent phases of the study, all infants admitted to the NICU and enrolled in the&#xD;
      study will be bathed three times a week with Chlorhexidine wash cloths during the initial&#xD;
      6-months study period (intervention), followed by standard bathing during the second 6-months&#xD;
      period, then again intervention period for 6 months and standard bathing for 6-months. Total&#xD;
      study period- 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will include all bloodstream infections as well as surveillance cultures&#xD;

      The study will take place in the Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Shaare-Zedek Medical&#xD;
      Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data ragarding bloodstream infections (BSI) and colonization with multidrug&#xD;
      resistant orgnisms (MDRO) will be collected for 3-6 months prior to patient enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to establish safety , we will enroll infants admitted to the NICU to three&#xD;
      successive treatment groups , as follows: the first group will include term infants admitted&#xD;
      to the NICU (gestational age 37+6 and &gt;7 days old), the second group will include near-term&#xD;
      infants (gestational age &gt; 34+0 to 36+6 weeks and &gt;7 days old) and the third group will&#xD;
      include premature infants (gestational age &gt;30+0 to 33+6 and &gt;=10 days old). We intend to&#xD;
      enroll up to 20 patients in each group, for a minimum of 200 patient days per group . All&#xD;
      infants will be assigned for bathing three times a week with washcloths impregnated with 2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate (Clinell ® Chlorhexidine wash cloths, GAMA healthcare) for the&#xD;
      duration of their NICU stay. The infant's skin will be monitored continuously as described&#xD;
      below . In case of grade 3 or 4 reactions, the study interventions will be temporarily&#xD;
      suspended, and the adverse event will be reported to the Helsinky committee and to the study&#xD;
      steering committee. If no grade 3 or 4 reactions will be encountered after at least 200&#xD;
      patient days per group, enrollment to the subsequent group will be performed (e.g if no grade&#xD;
      3-4 reaction will be encountered for 200 patient days in group 1, we will start enrolling&#xD;
      patients for group 2 etc.). If no grade 3-4 dermatitis is encountered in the preliminary&#xD;
      study, we will initiate enrollment as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the subsequent phases of the study, :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infants in the NICU eligible for the study will be assigned for bathing three times a&#xD;
      week with washcloths impregnated with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (Clinell ® Chlorhexidine&#xD;
      wash cloths, GAMA healthcare) during the initial 6-months study period (intervention),&#xD;
      followed by standard bathing during the second 6-months period, then again intervention&#xD;
      period for 6 months and standard bathing for 6-months. Total study period- 2.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: infants weighing ≥1500 grams and &gt;=10 days of age ; parents' informed&#xD;
      consent Exclusion criteria: infants weighing &lt;1500 grams or &lt;10 days of age; parents' refusal&#xD;
      to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For standard bathing procedure see appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study initiation, as well as at the beginning of each study period, nurses will be&#xD;
      instructed on the proper technique for bathing patients. Bathing will be performed according&#xD;
      to product brochure, three times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Number of bacteremia episodes per 1000 patient days during the intervention periods&#xD;
      compared with the control periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Number of new patients colonized with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),&#xD;
      vancomycin resitant enterococcus (VRE), carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumanii (CRAB) or&#xD;
      extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms per total number of patients,&#xD;
      monthly range and variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Number of new patients colonized with MRSA, VRE, CRAB or ESBL per 1000 eligible patient&#xD;
      days [ Total patient days - total patient days for patients identified with multidrug&#xD;
      resistant organisms (MDRO)]&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Time to colonization with MDRO during the intervention periods compared with the control&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient admitted to the NICU during the study periods and meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, will be recorded and assigned a specific study number. The dates of admission and&#xD;
      dates of discharge will be recorded and used to calculate length of stay and to determine the&#xD;
      incidence of nosocomial infections based on microbiological data. Clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      data, including the use of invasive device (intravascular devices, mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      feeding tubes) will be collected on standardized forms. The data will be coded under a&#xD;
      password protected database and linked only to study patient identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infections and MDRO acquisitions will be monitored during the study period. Events occurring&#xD;
      within 2 days after the transition will be assigned to the previous bathing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For infection surveillance, daily review of cultures and new orders for antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      will be performed for all study participants. Infectious events will be evaluated by an&#xD;
      independent investigator blinded to the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active surveillance testing for MDRO will be performed once every two weeks during the study&#xD;
      period. Swabs from the nasopharynx (for MRSA)] and from the rectal area (for ESBL producing&#xD;
      organisms, VRE and CRAB) will be obtained by unit staff and processed in the microbiology&#xD;
      laboratory of Shaare-Zedek Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial oversight:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steering committee of the study will include, except for the PI, an Infectious Disease&#xD;
      physician and a neonatologist . There will be biweekly discussions of the progress report,&#xD;
      reporting of compliance with active surveillance, reporting of compliance with bathing, and&#xD;
      any adverse reactions or other problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the rates of BSI and clinical sepsis will be compared between the intervention and&#xD;
      the control period. Continuous variables will be examined with the use of two-sample t-tests&#xD;
      and linear regression modeling, and categorical variables will be examined by means of&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. Cox proportional-hazards regression model will be used to compare the&#xD;
      time from admission until the first primary bloodstream infection , clinical sepsis or&#xD;
      acquisition of MDRO between the control and intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: based on our ongoing surveillance, there are 2-3 BSI events per 1000&#xD;
      patients -days in our NICU. In order to detect a 50% reduction in BSI rates , the&#xD;
      investigators will need 37,096 patient days (18,548 in each group) in order to have 80% power&#xD;
      to reject the null hypothesis, with 0.05 level of significance. Currently, our average annual&#xD;
      census is 45,000 patient days. therefore, a 2-year study will have &gt;80% power to reject the&#xD;
      null hypothesis (the BSI rates in the control period equal the rates in the intervention&#xD;
      period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study that evaluated the tolerability of 2% CHG for catheter insertion antisepsis among&#xD;
      infants ≥1500 grams and ≥7 days old found no significant dermatitis reactions . Seven of 48&#xD;
      infants had measurable CHG levels in the blood. In a trial that evaluated a multifactorial&#xD;
      approach to reduce the rates of CLABSI, Andersen et al. noted that 4 of 36 neonates &lt;1000g&#xD;
      developed contact dermatitis after a 2% CHG scrub. There were no episodes of contact&#xD;
      dermatitis in 49 study participants who were ≥1000g . The alternative for antisepsis in&#xD;
      neonates is povidone-iodine. However, iodine absorption that may compromise thyroid function&#xD;
      is one reason to explore the use of CHG. Although CHG was reported to be absorbed through&#xD;
      neonatal skin in several trials, no significant systemic side effects were reported ' .&#xD;
      Animal trials showed no significant toxicity from CHG . The US Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) states on the drug facts box of 2% CHG cloth:&quot; use with care in premature infants or&#xD;
      infants under 2 months of age. These products may cause irritation or chemical burns&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant's skin will be examined daily by nursing staff and twice a week by study&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin reactions will be graded and recorded on a standard report form (appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 3 and 4 skin reactions will be reported as serious adverse events.&#xD;
