  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of phase I trial is to determine the safest, most effective dose of MK-3475&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab), when used with radiotherapy and temozolomide for treating newly diagnosed&#xD;
      patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Temozolomide binds to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA),&#xD;
      changes it, and triggers the death of tumor cells. MK-3475 is an investigational drug, it is&#xD;
      not currently approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating GBM but&#xD;
      it is approved for treating melanoma. MK-3475 works by targets the local tumor&#xD;
      immune-protection in solid tumors. It is hoped the addition of MK-3475 to the usual treatment&#xD;
      for GBM will improve the current treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation therapy (RT) + temozolomide&#xD;
      (TMZ) + MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) followed by MK-3475 + TMZ x 6 cycles (1 cycle is 9 weeks),&#xD;
      MK-3475 can continue for an additional 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of MK-3475 in GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if there is a correlation of programmed cell death 1 (PD1) or programmed cell&#xD;
      death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) expression and T-cell infiltrate in pathology from first and, if&#xD;
      applicable, second surgical specimens with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess changes in peripheral T-cell activation and tryptophan metabolites. III. Correlate&#xD;
      o-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) status with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab, followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT PORTION: Patients undergo focal RT over 42 days, and receive concurrent temozolomide&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42 and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22,&#xD;
      and 43.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-RT: After completion of RT, patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5 and 29-34 of&#xD;
      course 1 and days 1-5 and 29-33 of subsequent courses, and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1, 22, and 43. Treatment repeats every 9 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 courses, patients deriving benefit may&#xD;
      continue to receive pembrolizumab for an additional 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-4 months.&#xD;
