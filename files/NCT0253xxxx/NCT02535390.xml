    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder places a tremendous burden on workplace disability each year. Its&#xD;
      diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic symptoms that include disturbances in&#xD;
      mood regulation, maladaptive beliefs, and behaviour. Impairment in neurocognitive functions&#xD;
      (e.g., information processing speed, attention, memory, problem solving skills) is absent&#xD;
      from current diagnostic criteria and off the radar in most clinical treatment settings, yet&#xD;
      increasingly recognized as a primary cause of poor work functioning and outcomes. This&#xD;
      disconnect between the root causes of poor vocational outcomes and targets of treatment has&#xD;
      resulted in a failure to return to work following illness, job underproductivity, and&#xD;
      work-related stress, which contribute to indirect costs to society each year. The&#xD;
      investigators seek to expand scientific support for treating neurocognitive impairments in&#xD;
      order to increase occupational productivity and reduce job-related stress associated with&#xD;
      depression. The investigators developed a novel group cognitive remediation (CR) treatment,&#xD;
      Action-Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR). It builds on procedural learning skills with&#xD;
      explicit work-related role-plays to facilitate immediate and salient abstraction of drill and&#xD;
      practice remediation techniques. The activities were developed in collaboration with a&#xD;
      community rehabilitation partner in this study through systematic interviews with job&#xD;
      placement specialists and supervisors from employment sites used by the agency. The props&#xD;
      match those used in work settings and include miniature versions of a cash register, filing&#xD;
      system, conveyer belt, cleaning closet, garden nursery, and secretarial station. The&#xD;
      activities capitalize on procedural learning skills through roleplays and props that simulate&#xD;
      a work environment. ABCR maintains important aspects of drill and practice, strategic&#xD;
      monitoring to enhance flexible problem solving approaches, and bridging. The role-plays&#xD;
      follow computerized drill and practice exercise and therapists facilitate group discussions&#xD;
      of how cognitive skills and flexibility in thinking from drill and practice can be effective&#xD;
      while directly engaged in an everyday work environment. Thus, bridging used in ABCR is a&#xD;
      tangible, procedural, and realistic. This approach to bridging differentiates the treatment&#xD;
      from standard CR, where the discussion-based approach is limited by the auditory learning,&#xD;
      memory, and abstraction deficits observed in depression.&#xD;

      Participants will meet with the PI or clinical graduate student to discuss components of&#xD;
      cognitive remediation, expectations, and client goals. Follow-up meetings will occur to&#xD;
      ensure client satisfaction and determine progress on goal achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to ABCR or standard CR will be done in groups of 8 to ensure an adequate number&#xD;
      of participants in each group. Twenty-four participants will be randomized to each group over&#xD;
      the course of the study. Several aspects of the treatments are matched for ideal comparison.&#xD;
      Both groups will meet two times per week, two hours per session, for 8 weeks. The same&#xD;
      computerized drill and practice, strategic monitoring, and verbal bridging approaches will be&#xD;
      used in both groups. The primary differences are the ratio of each aspect of treatment and&#xD;
      the manner in which they are bridged work environment. In the standard CR group 60% of the&#xD;
      sessions involve computerized drill and practice. In the ABCR group, only 20% of the group&#xD;
      sessions are devoted to computer drills, whereas 40% involve the simulated work skills that&#xD;
      are directly linked to those computer tasks (see Figure 1 for an example). The remaining 40%&#xD;
      of both of the groups involve a didactic component that introduces concepts for that session&#xD;
      (e.g., memory strategies, how to avoid distractors), review of homework, and group discussion&#xD;
      of bridging. Strategic monitoring occurs during all aspects of treatment, though in ABCR the&#xD;
      link between computerized drills and work is made explicit by moving back and forth from&#xD;
      computer drills to the role-play tasks. Graduate students in a clinical psychology program&#xD;
      who are trained and supervised by Dr. Bowie will conduct the treatment groups. These students&#xD;
      will be blind to study hypotheses, though it will not be possible to blind them to the group.&#xD;
      Video recordings of sessions are regularly reviewed with Dr. Bowie to ensure treatment&#xD;
      fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, participants are given the opportunity to engage in supplemental homework&#xD;
      exercises outside of the scheduled treatment groups. Scientific Brain Training Pro will be&#xD;
      used for computer drills in session and for homework, a program the investigators have used&#xD;
      in previous studies. The company provides its software for this research at no cost, but has&#xD;
      no input into the design or output of this study. Due to the online availability of the&#xD;
      exercises, participants are encouraged to login to the program one or two times per day for&#xD;
      20 minutes each session. Variability in homework completion is expected (and therefore&#xD;
      considering it as a treatment process variable and potential mediator of longer-term&#xD;
      durability and generalization), yet compliance with the sample is anticipated because they&#xD;
      will be engaged standard vocational services programs four days per week, giving them access&#xD;
      to an on-site computer room before or after attending their regular appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few previous studies have examined work stress as a function of supplemental treatments in&#xD;
      vocational rehabilitation and to the investigators' knowledge this project will be the first&#xD;
      to measure both self-reported and psychophysiological indicators of stress.&#xD;
