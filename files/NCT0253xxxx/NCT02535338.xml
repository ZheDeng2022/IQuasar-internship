    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of onalespib lactate when given&#xD;
      together with erlotinib hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer that has come back (recurrent) or has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic). Erlotinib hydrochloride and onalespib lactate may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of erlotinib hydrochloride (erlotinib) and&#xD;
      onalespib lactate (onalespib) in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC). (PHASE I) II. To preliminarily assess efficacy of combination erlotinib and&#xD;
      onalespib at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) determined in the phase I portion of the&#xD;
      study in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who have not had a complete or partial response by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 to frontline erlotinib after a&#xD;
      minimum of 12 weeks on erlotinib. (PHASE II, COHORT A) III. To preliminarily assess efficacy&#xD;
      of combination erlotinib and onalespib at the RP2D in NSCLC patients whose tumor harbors an&#xD;
      EGFR exon 20 insertion (an EGFR mutation not typically responsive to single agent erlotinib).&#xD;
      (PHASE II, COHORT B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity (primary aim phase II, secondary aim phase I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate in a preliminary manner the progression-free survival (PFS) and disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR) of patients treated with erlotinib/onalespib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the above drug combinations at the recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore plasma EGFR-mutant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a biomarker by detecting&#xD;
      changes in plasma EGFR-mutant DNA levels (including plasma EGFR-T790M) and new mutations that&#xD;
      may represent resistance to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To demonstrate knockdown of Hsp90 client oncoproteins via treatment with erlotinib and&#xD;
      onalespib by multiplexed immunofluorescence in serial tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To establish patient derived xenotransplant models in EGFR-mutated NSCLC with a focus on&#xD;
      tumors that lack response to single agent erlotinib and in patients with tumors harboring&#xD;
      EGFR exon 20 insertions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of onalespib lactate followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) daily and onalespib lactate&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at&#xD;
      least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year and&#xD;
      then annually thereafter.&#xD;
