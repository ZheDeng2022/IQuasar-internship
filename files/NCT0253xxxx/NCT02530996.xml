  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a multi-organ systemic disease characterized by&#xD;
      activation of immune cells, which results in vascular dysfunction (vasculopathy) and&#xD;
      subsequent scarring (fibrosis). SSc has a higher than expect prevalence in the US military.&#xD;
      On a national level there are 5,766 SSc patients (ICD-9 710.1) presently cared for in the&#xD;
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA). While there is no cure for SSc, studies of therapeutics&#xD;
      that can help slow disease progression are valuable to our Veterans. This proposal addresses&#xD;
      the solicitation for projects with attention to SSc requested by President Obama after&#xD;
      reviewing potential contamination of water at Camp Lejeune. This proposal is a&#xD;
      patient-centered outreach for our Veterans with SSc to inform and prevent catastrophic&#xD;
      endstage vascular abnormalities, including digital ulcers, pulmonary arterial hypertension&#xD;
      (PAH) and scleroderma renal crisis in SSc. The study proposes a novel application of a&#xD;
      therapeutic for this disease. A better understanding of the initiating insult and natural&#xD;
      progression of SSc vasculopathy is needed in order to develop therapeutics with a goal of&#xD;
      curing/treating the underlying disease. This project has the potential to impact not only&#xD;
      Veterans with SSc, but also those with vascular abnormalities including digital ulcers, PAH,&#xD;
      and renal crisis. This proposal represents a potential major therapeutic advance for our&#xD;
      Veterans with SSc.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although SSc is heterogeneous in the extent of organ involvement and prognosis, it is&#xD;
      accepted that all SSc cases have a progressive and usually devastating course. Since&#xD;
      vasculopathy precedes fibrosis in this disease, a focus on understanding its natural history&#xD;
      and preventative measures for vascular dysfunction has profound implications. This pilot work&#xD;
      suggests that measurement of endothelial dysfunction with flow mediated dilatation (FMD)&#xD;
      holds promise as novel method to assess disease progression as well as the therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy of the pharmacologic compound tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in SSc. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that BH4, which targets the endothelium, has great promise to reduce SSc-related&#xD;
      tissue hypoxia, end organ damage, and potentially may impact underlying disease progression.&#xD;
      The first aim will adopt an integrative approach and validate a novel, non-invasive&#xD;
      technique, FMD to define vasculopathy in SSc. The second aim and third aim (which is reported&#xD;
      in this PRS report) will examine if BH4 is effective in ameliorating vascular dysfunction in&#xD;
      patients with SSc and determine the role of oxidative stress in BH4-mediated improvements in&#xD;
      vascular function in patients with SSc. The overarching goal of these aims is to improve&#xD;
      vasculopathy detection and management in Veterans with SSc.&#xD;

All measurements were taken at the same time of day to eliminate any diurnal effects. All participants abstained from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise for ≥12 hours prior to the study. Additionally, vasodilatory medications were discontinued 12 hours prior to study visit. In premenopausal women, measurements were performed during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. All measurements were made under quiet, comfortable, ambient (~22°C) laboratory conditions.</description>

Oxidative stress was assessed by quantifying plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) (Oxis Research/Percipio Bioscience, Foster City, CA) and protein carbonyl levels (Northwest Life Science Specialties, LLC Vancouver, WA). Endogenous antioxidant capacity, assessed by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, were assayed in the plasma (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI). Additionally, total antioxidant capacity was assessed by measuring the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), using the method described by Benzie and Strain (17). Systemic inflammation was assessed by determining IL-6, TNF-α (18) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).</description>

            <description>Blood samples were obtained from the antecubital patients with SSc. Serum and plasma samples were stored at -80°C until analysis. Oxidative stress was assessed by quantifying plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) (Oxis Research/Percipio Bioscience, Foster City, CA) and protein carbonyl levels (Northwest Life Science Specialties, LLC Vancouver, WA). Endogenous antioxidant capacity, assessed by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, were assayed in the plasma (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI). Additionally, total antioxidant capacity was assessed by measuring the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), using the method described by Benzie and Strain (17). Systemic inflammation was assessed by determining IL-6, TNF-α (18) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This trial was initially intended to include 32 patients with SSc with and without clinical complications of SSc randomly assigned oral BH4 or placebo for 5 consecutive days in a double-blind randomized crossover design. Due to budget constraints, we adapted the design to studying 12 patients, 5 hours after oral BH4 administration (10 mg/kg body weight) or placebo on separate days using controlled, counterbalanced, double-blind, crossover experimental design and a five day wash-out period.</limitations_and_caveats>
