  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and bioactivity of an herbal supplement&#xD;
      called &quot;kansui,&quot; which contains several active ingredients such as ingenols that may have a&#xD;
      role in helping clear HIV from the body. Kansui has been used in traditional Chinese medicine&#xD;
      for centuries to treat various ailments such as for eliminating excess fluid in the abdomen&#xD;
      or lungs, loosening phlegm from the chest, and relieving constipation. Based on preliminary&#xD;
      in vitro data from our group, kansui extract powder is a potent activator of HIV&#xD;
      transpcription in latently infected Jurkat cells. The investigators' hypothesis is that&#xD;
      kansui extract powder prepared as tea will be safe and well-tolerated, elicit an in vivo&#xD;
      immunologic response, and at the doses administered, increase HIV transcription in&#xD;
      latently-infected cells among HIV-infected patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Millions HIV-infected individuals are now receiving life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART).&#xD;
      However, mortality remains high, particularly in resource-limited countries. Chronic&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals demonstrate evidence of persistent immune activation despite ART,&#xD;
      which is an independent predictor of mortality in this setting. Given the current absence of&#xD;
      an effective HIV vaccine, finding a cure for HIV will have a large impact on the long-term&#xD;
      health of treated HIV-infected individuals. The key challenge of HIV eradication strategies&#xD;
      is the persistence of a small pool of resting memory CD4+ T cells that harbor latent&#xD;
      replication-competent HIV, untouched by current ART. One potential strategy to eliminate this&#xD;
      reservoir in a &quot;shock and kill&quot; approach in which latency reactivating agents (LRAs) are used&#xD;
      to &quot;shock&quot; the virus out of these cells in order for the host immune response, ART, and/or&#xD;
      additional immunomodulatory agents to then kill the virus-expressing cells. The goal of the&#xD;
      current study is to evaluate the safety and in vivo biological response to an herbal&#xD;
      supplement used in traditional Chinese medicine (&quot;kansui)&quot; that has potent in vitro latency&#xD;
      reactivating capabilities. Kansui is an inexpensive, readily available herbal supplement&#xD;
      prescribed for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine and contains active&#xD;
      compounds such as ingenols that have been shown to reverse latency in an animal model. A&#xD;
      semi-synthetic form of ingenol has been shown to potently reactivate latent simian&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in rhesus macaques and is currently undergoing early drug&#xD;
      development. Though kansui has been studied extensively in traditional Chinese medicine, this&#xD;
      herbal supplement has never been evaluated for biologic activity in HIV disease using Western&#xD;
      scientific research methods. This pilot clinical trial will generate preliminary results&#xD;
      regarding the safety and in vivo biologic activity of kansui. Promising results from this&#xD;
      study may allow future larger studies which can evaluate the efficacy of this&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic agent in the treatment of HIV disease.&#xD;
