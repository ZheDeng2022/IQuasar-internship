  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical pilot trial designed to assess the feasibility of randomizing&#xD;
      obese women with GDM to lower glycemic thresholds compared to standard care. Maternal and&#xD;
      cord blood metabolic profiles, neonatal body composition, and maternal sleep quality and&#xD;
      duration will also be compared between groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize 60 obese pregnant women with a new diagnosis of gestational&#xD;
      diabetes using the Carpenter-Coustan criteria in a 1:1 fashion to either standard care or&#xD;
      intensive therapy. Subjects will be randomized to either standard care or intensive therapy&#xD;
      at the first study visit, which will occur between 12-32 weeks of gestation after they have&#xD;
      completed their gestational diabetes testing. Neither patients nor their providers will be&#xD;
      blinded to patient study group. All women will receive standard nutritional counseling at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis, and they will also be treated with either glyburide or insulin as dictated&#xD;
      by standard care. Women will return for a second study visit between 32-36 weeks of gestation&#xD;
      to assess the impact of their glycemic target groups on overall glycemic control. The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect information on the type and dose of each medication required&#xD;
      to maintain glycemic control in women randomized to either standard care or intensive&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to standard glucose monitoring 4x/day (fasting and one-hour post breakfast,&#xD;
      lunch, and dinner), the investigators will utilize blinded continuous glucose monitors (iPro,&#xD;
      Medtronic) at each study visit. Because women with GDM are receiving active management of&#xD;
      their blood sugars and dietary counseling, the investigators will assess CGM for 5&#xD;
      consecutive days both at study enrollment and again between 32-36 weeks. Study participants&#xD;
      will complete food diaries during their CGM monitoring to correlate food intake with glycemic&#xD;
      variation. The investigators will also compare maternal and cord blood metabolic profiles,&#xD;
      neonatal body composition, and maternal sleep quality and duration between groups.&#xD;

    <description>Women will undergo CGM for 5 days at both the first study visit (12-32 weeks) and again at the second study visit (32-36 weeks). Our primary outcome between women randomized to either SC or IT will compare mean 24-hour blood glucose levels as assessed by continuous glucose monitor at the 2nd study visit, which will occur between 32-36 weeks of gestation. Investigators hypothesize that women randomized to the IT group will have a 10 mg/dL lower mean 24-hour glucose as assessed by continuous glucose monitor when compared to women in the SC group. Investigators will also assess the prevalence of maternal hypoglycemia by comparing the amount of time with maternal blood glucose values &lt;60 mg/dL between groups.</description>

    <description>Investigators will utilize the Actiwatch Spectrum Pro (Phillips Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) for assessment of both sleep and physical activity in women .

The Actiwatch monitoring periods are designed to coincide with the periods of CGM monitoring.</description>
