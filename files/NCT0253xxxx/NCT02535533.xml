  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II trial for safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of axitinib&#xD;
      and selenomethionine (SLM) for adult patients with advanced metastatic clear cell renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (CCRCC). This will be a two part study consisting of a dose escalation and&#xD;
      expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a pilot group of 10 subjects will have SLM dose calculated based on patients'&#xD;
      body surface area (BSA) to characterize the dose-concentration relationship and estimate the&#xD;
      effective administered dose of selenium necessary to achieve the target blood concentration&#xD;
      range informed by preclinical data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial for safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of axitinib&#xD;
      and SLM for adult patients with advanced metastatic CCRCC. This will be a two part study&#xD;
      consisting of a dose escalation and expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-Escalation Part 1 (6-12 patients): THIS PHASE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. SLM will be given&#xD;
      twice daily for 14 days followed by once daily dosing in combination with axitinib 5 mg twice&#xD;
      daily with titration according to package insert in patients with advanced renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The&#xD;
      MTD was determined to be 4000 mcg SLM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Part 2: In this phase (approximately 19 patients), will be treated at the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of SLM determined in the Escalation Part 1. It will be given orally&#xD;
      twice daily for 14 days, followed by once daily dosing in combination with axitinib 5 mg&#xD;
      twice daily with titration according to package insert in patients with advanced renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot group of 10 subjects will have SLM dose calculated based on patients' BSA to&#xD;
      characterize the dose-concentration relationship and estimate the effective administered dose&#xD;
      of selenium necessary to achieve the target blood concentration range informed by preclinical&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

    <description>Dose escalation for this pilot study will be conducted using a CRM in which the probability of exceeding a blood selenium concentration of 45 µM on Day 14 is being modeled. Prior probabilities of exceeding a blood selenium concentration of 45 µM on Day 14 were estimated based on preclinical and preliminary data from the initial trial. A one parameter logistic model with intercept set at 3 and an initial value of 1 for the slope will be used to estimate the dose-concentration relationship through sequential recursive Bayesian assessment. The target probability of exceeding 45 µM is ≤20%.</description>
