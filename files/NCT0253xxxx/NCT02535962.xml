  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to see if adding probiotics to corticosteroid treatment for children&#xD;
      with PFAPA could improve the health and daily of patients through reduction in febrile period&#xD;
      frequency and length, along with concomitant reduction of associated symptoms. Current&#xD;
      standard of care incorporates the administration of corticosteroids; however, while limiting&#xD;
      the symptoms associated with PFAPA, corticosteroid use has been shown to increase the&#xD;
      frequency at which these symptoms occur. Investigators hypothesize that administration of&#xD;
      probiotics along with corticosteroids will work to decrease the frequency at which the&#xD;
      febrile episodes occur. Additionally, probiotics may decrease the maximal fever experienced&#xD;
      during these episodes, amount of corticosteroid needed to control the symptoms, average&#xD;
      length of the episodes, and the number of patients who ultimately undergo tonsillectomy due&#xD;
      to unsuccessful treatment with medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) was first&#xD;
      described in 1987 in a study of 12 pediatric patients. PFAPA is predominately considered a&#xD;
      pediatric illness with onset typically occurring under the age of 5. This syndrome is&#xD;
      characterized by periodic febrile episodes (39°C - 42°C) lasting an average of 4 days with&#xD;
      recurrence approximately every 21-30 days. Patients classically exhibit at least one of three&#xD;
      major associated symptoms; aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, or cervical adenitis. Between&#xD;
      periods of fever, patients are asymptomatic and do not experience long-term deleterious&#xD;
      effects on growth or development. Currently, the etiology of this syndrome is unknown but&#xD;
      does not appear to be heritable or target specific populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to a lack of applicable diagnostic tests, the identification of PFAPA is predominantly&#xD;
      dependent on patient history and physical examination. This methodology relies heavily upon&#xD;
      clinical presentation of the patient's illness to rule out other causes of periodic fever. As&#xD;
      a result of the unknown cause of PFAPA, there are several proposed treatment approaches&#xD;
      available. Corticosteroids are the current standard of care; typically a single dose of&#xD;
      prednisolone (1 mg/kg), given upon first signs of fever with a subsequent dose during the&#xD;
      febrile period if necessary. Several studies have shown that administration of prednisolone&#xD;
      was sufficient to abort the febrile episode. However, this treatment method typically results&#xD;
      in a decrease in the healthy interval between fever reoccurrence. The reduction in fever&#xD;
      allows for children to attend school and participate in other activates, but the increased&#xD;
      frequency provides additional complications for children and parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral cimetidine, a histamine H-2 receptor agonist that results in reduced production of&#xD;
      stomach acid, has also been used as possible treatment. This treatment has shown to inhibit&#xD;
      febrile episodes, it was only effective in &lt;30% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If medication therapy fails to resolve recurrent febrile episodes, the option of&#xD;
      tonsillectomy presents a possible alternative. PFAPA syndrome was shown to resolve in the&#xD;
      majority of patients, however this not preferred as a first line treatment due to the risks&#xD;
      associated with surgery and general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently published literature suggests a potential new treatment for PFAPA targeting&#xD;
      chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines. A possible method for the inhibition of cyclic&#xD;
      inflammatory responses in PFAPA would be the exposure of patients to a safe level of&#xD;
      continuous low-grade inflammation, resulting from an immune response. In previous studies&#xD;
      investigating allergy and eczema relief in pediatric populations, it was shown that&#xD;
      administration of probiotics induced elevated levels of inflammatory markers. These low level&#xD;
      inflammatory responses resulted in no adverse effects and provided an immunologic activation&#xD;
      benefit. Use of probiotics provides a previously unstudied approach to the treatment of&#xD;
      PFAPA. Dr. Nicholas Bennett has also observed anecdotal evidence that patients who&#xD;
      self-administered probiotics experienced relief of their PFAPA symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with the&#xD;
      randomization being done by the research pharmacist using an equal randomization process, no&#xD;
      stratification of patients. Dr. Bennett and other patient recruiters will remain blinded to&#xD;
      the participant group assignment. The standard of care consists of corticosteroid dosing of 1&#xD;
      mg/kg of body weight given once at the onset of the febrile period, repeated once within 24&#xD;
      hours if necessary, but no more than two doses per cycle. The second dose of corticosteroid&#xD;
      is only to be given within one day following the initial dosage if the fever persists. The&#xD;
      investigational product will be administered daily for the duration of the study. For the&#xD;
      investigational product patients will be instructed to take daily one sachet of the study&#xD;
      product mixed into a 60 ml of water that is not hot. On days 90±7, 180±7 and 270±7 patients&#xD;
      will come to the study site for re-supply of the probiotic and for evaluation of compliance.&#xD;
      Throughout the 1-year followup period, parents will be asked to keep a journal to track&#xD;
      corticosteroid usage, probiotic usage, additional medication usage, fever intensity, and&#xD;
      associated symptoms. Standardized thermometers will be provided to ensure consistency. These&#xD;
      journals will be collected and patient progress will be monitored at the standard care visits&#xD;
      every three months. In addition, follow-up phone calls will be made monthly to assess&#xD;
      progress and to address any concerns.&#xD;
