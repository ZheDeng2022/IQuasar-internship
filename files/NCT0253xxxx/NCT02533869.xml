      This study focuses on the use of contrast enhanced low-dose CT imaging as a modality to&#xD;
      differentiate between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis. Differentiation&#xD;
      between the two forms of acute appendicitis is important because according to recent studies&#xD;
      their treatment differs. Complicated forms are still treated operatively, while uncomplicated&#xD;
      forms can be treated conservatively with antibiotics. In the initial phase of the study,&#xD;
      several optimized CT protocols will be created with a phantom model. The two best performing&#xD;
      models will be selected for the second phase of the study, in which patients presenting with&#xD;
      suspected acute appendicitis will be imaged with the two protocols. All patients&#xD;
      participating in the study will be treated operatively, primarily with a laparoscopic&#xD;
      appendectomy. Thus histological confirmation for the diagnosis can be achieved and compared&#xD;
      with the CT images. The goal of this study is to optimize a well-performing low-dose CT&#xD;
      imaging protocol to use in the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain in emergency&#xD;
      departments as well as one of the most common indications for emergency abdominal surgery.&#xD;
      The clinical diagnosis has been based on patient history, physical examination and laboratory&#xD;
      findings as well as the &quot;clinical eye&quot; of the surgeon. Still the diagnosis remains&#xD;
      challenging. One of the main problems is that many other disorders can mimic the clinical&#xD;
      presentation of appendicitis, thus increasing the role of imaging techniques to aid in&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy. Now preoperative imaging in patients with suspected acute appendicitis&#xD;
      is currently widely accepted as the standard of practice, and CT has been shown to clearly&#xD;
      outperform US in terms of diagnostic performance. Nowadays, CT imaging is considered the&#xD;
      primary imaging modality in the diagnosis for acute appendicitis as it is appraised for its&#xD;
      high sensitivity and specificity. The main disadvantage of CT imaging is exposure to&#xD;
      radiation. Thus the favorable diagnostic performance of CT imaging has encouraged&#xD;
      optimization of protocols to minimize exposure to radiation through the development of&#xD;
      low-dose CT protocols. Initial studies have indicated that contrast enhanced low-dose CT was&#xD;
      not inferior to standard-dose contrast enhanced CT with no statistical significance in&#xD;
      negative appendectomy rates, appendiceal perforation rates or patients requiring additional&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on the use of contrast enhanced low-dose CT imaging as a modality to&#xD;
      differentiate between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis. Differentiation&#xD;
      between the two forms of acute appendicitis is important because according to recent studies&#xD;
      their treatment differs. Complicated forms are still treated operatively, while uncomplicated&#xD;
      forms can be treated conservatively with antibiotics. In the initial phase of the study,&#xD;
      several optimized CT protocols will be created with a phantom model. The two best performing&#xD;
      models will be selected for the second phase of the study, in which patients presenting with&#xD;
      suspected acute appendicitis will be imaged with the two protocols. All patients&#xD;
      participating in the study will be treated operatively, primarily with a laparoscopic&#xD;
      appendectomy. Thus histological confirmation for the diagnosis can be achieved and compared&#xD;

      imaging protocol to use in the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.&#xD;
