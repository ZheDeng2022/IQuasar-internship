    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common preventable and treatable disease&#xD;
      characterized by progressive airflow limitation that is associated with an inflammatory&#xD;
      response to noxious particles or gases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual therapy (MT) has been defined as a therapeutic intervention that uses the hands to&#xD;
      provide treatment to the musculoskeletal and/or visceral systems. It includes techniques such&#xD;
      as massage, myofascial release, muscle energy technique, ligament balance, joint mobilization&#xD;
      and joint manipulation. The suggestion that MT could deliver long-term benefits to people&#xD;
      with COPD was first put forward in 2009. Since then a number of small studies have reported&#xD;
      medium term improvements in lung function and exercise capacity following repeated&#xD;
      applications of MT intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to measure the immediate effect on lung function of a single application of soft&#xD;
      tissue manual therapy in patients with severe and very-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common preventable and treatable disease&#xD;
      characterized by progressive airflow limitation that is associated with an inflammatory&#xD;
      response to noxious particles or gases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the anatomy of the airways and lung parenchyma occur as the result of bronchial&#xD;
      hypersecretion and bronchoalveolar instability which cause expiratory flow limitation and air&#xD;
      trapping. This is known clinically as dynamic hyperinflation. The phenomenon leads to an&#xD;
      increase in expiratory reserve volume, residual volume and functional residual capacity, also&#xD;
      referred to as end expiratory lung volume. These increases limit tidal volume and inspiratory&#xD;
      reserve volume eventually affecting inspiratory capacity. They alter the position of the ribs&#xD;
      causing a state similar to sustained inspiration over time, often referred to as 'inspiratory&#xD;
      block'. This phenomenon is responsible for the characteristic 'barrel chest' commonly seen in&#xD;
      patients with more advanced stages of COPD. In this state the position of the diaphragm is&#xD;
      flattened and shortened reducing its ability to generate force. Accessory respiratory muscles&#xD;
      are recruited as a compensatory adaptation leading to shortening and over-activation of these&#xD;
      muscles over time (over-adaptation). The surrounding cervicothoracic fascia contracts&#xD;
      producing postural changes such as anterior projection of the head, neck hyperextension,&#xD;
      increased thoracic kyphosis and internal rotation of shoulders. These changes contribute to&#xD;
      an increase in chest tightness, a decrease in the ability to generate inspiratory pressures&#xD;
      and volumes and an increase in the amount of effort required to breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual therapy (MT) has been defined as a therapeutic intervention that uses the hands to&#xD;
      provide treatment to the musculoskeletal and/or visceral systems. It includes techniques such&#xD;
      as massage, myofascial release, muscle energy technique, ligament balance, joint mobilization&#xD;
      and joint manipulation. The suggestion that MT could deliver long-term benefits to people&#xD;
      with COPD was first put forward in 2009. Since then a number of small studies have reported&#xD;
      medium term improvements in lung function and exercise capacity following repeated&#xD;
      applications of MT intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to measure the immediate effect on lung function of a single application of soft&#xD;
      tissue manual therapy in patients with severe and very-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recruitment patients with COPD in Rehabilitation Program in Hospital San José de Santiago&#xD;
      de Chile, and we assessment: total lung capacity (TLC); vital capacity (VC); residual volume&#xD;
      (RV); expiratory reserve volume (ERV); inspiratory capacity (IC); and airway resistance&#xD;
      (Raw). Secondary: heart rate (HR); respiratory rate (RR); and oxygen saturation (SpO2).&#xD;

    <description>The STMTP consisted of a pre-determined set of seven (7) soft tissue techniques delivered as part of a single treatment session lasting approximately 30 minutes. The techniques and their respective durations were: suboccipital release (5 minutes), anterior thoracic myofascial and sternum release (5 minutes), anterior cervical myofascial release (5 minutes), costal ligament balance (5 minutes) and muscular energy technique (MET) to the following muscles - scalenes (1 minute and 40 seconds), pectoralis minor (1 minute and 40 seconds) and latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior (1 minute and 40 seconds)</description>
