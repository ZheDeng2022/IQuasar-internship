  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of [18F]-DOPA PET to provide&#xD;
      improved presurgical planning and distinguish between focal and diffuse forms of HI. The&#xD;
      investigators will perform descriptive analysis, relying on visual analysis to diagnose and&#xD;
      localize a focal lesion. Our findings will be compared to surgical histopathology to&#xD;
      determine sensitivity and specificity or this technique. The investigators will also track&#xD;
      patient surgical outcomes, specifically whether the patient is surgically &quot;cured&quot; or still&#xD;
      requires medical management to control residual hypoglycemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is caused by low glucose due to excessive insulin secretion and&#xD;
      remains difficult to treat because of the requirement for extensive amounts of glucose and&#xD;
      the lack of effective long-term medical therapy. Correct diagnosis, localization, and limited&#xD;
      excision of the focal lesion will result in a complete cure of the patient. In contrast,&#xD;
      medically unresponsive diffuse disease requires a near total pancreatectomy, greatly&#xD;
      increasing the risk of future diabetes mellitus. Fortunately, [18F]-DOPA PET has been shown&#xD;
      to be a useful noninvasive imaging method for distinguishing between focal and diffuse forms&#xD;
      of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. In this study, the investigators seek to validate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of using PET/MR and PET/CT with F-DOPA to accurately and reliably detect and&#xD;
      localize disease.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will undergo PET imaging with [18F]-DOPA. All PET imaging will be performed after administration of a single dose (0.08 - 0.16 mCurie/kg) of [18F]-DOPA. PET imaging can be performed on either Philips Ingenuity TF PET/MRI or PET/CT.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All Patients clinically diagnosed with Hyperinsulinemia of any age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in need of PET scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that require sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that do not require sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients without Hyperinsulinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are or may be pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious intercurrent medical illness other than hypoglycemia that precludes having the&#xD;
             scan either because of patient instability or concerns about potential toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's requiring emergency surgical intervention that would be inappropriately&#xD;
             delayed by [18F]-DOPA PET imaging.&#xD;
