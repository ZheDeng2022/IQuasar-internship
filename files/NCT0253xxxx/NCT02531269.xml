  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using European data from patients included in the Named Patient Program (NPP) and from the&#xD;
      early post-marketing authorization period, the present study aims to describe patient&#xD;
      characteristics and to describe the effectiveness of Daclatasvir (DCV)-based regimens in&#xD;
      Europe. This will be a retrospective cohort study of patients who received treatment with a&#xD;
      DCV-based regimen in the following context:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients enrolled within the European NPP in one of the following countries Austria,&#xD;
           Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In those countries where DCV is commercially available (ie, Sweden, Germany, United&#xD;
           Kingdom), patients who received DCV during the early post-marketing authorization period&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of effectiveness of&#xD;
      DCV-based regimens in a population that differs from population in the clinical trials, and&#xD;
      therefore will provide additional valuable information to inform clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to estimate primarily the effectiveness of DCV-based regimens as measured&#xD;
      by the sustained virologic response at post treatment follow-up visit week 12 (SVR12). As&#xD;
      well as estimate the effectiveness of DCV-based regimens as measured by SVR12 after the end&#xD;
      of Hepatitis C virus (HCV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends also to describe as secondary objectives the characteristics (ie,&#xD;
      demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment patterns of patients starting a new&#xD;
      DCV-based regimens) of patients receiving DCV as well as the effectiveness of DCV-based&#xD;
      regimens as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On-treatment virological response at post treatment follow-up visit Week 4; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Virological response at the end of treatment (EOT); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sustained viral response at post treatment follow-up visit Week 4 (SVR4) and post&#xD;
           treatment follow-up visit Week 24 (SVR24); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of virological failure (on-treatment and relapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory objective will be to assess the concordance between SVR4 and SVR12 among the&#xD;
      overall population treated with DCV.&#xD;

    <description>Virological failure is defined as virologic breakthrough, other on-treatment failure or relapse, where:&#xD;
Virologic breakthrough is defined as confirmed ≥ 1 log10 IU/mL HCV RNA on treatment increase from nadir, or confirmed increase in HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ if HCV RNA previously declined to &lt; LLOQ (TD/TND). (LLOQ: Lower limit of quantification)&#xD;
Relapse is defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ (TND) at End of Treatment followed by confirmed detectable HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ in any follow-up visit window.&#xD;
On-treatment failure is defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ at any time point not meeting the definition of virologic breakthrough or relapse.</description>

               -  The patient was ineligible to participate in a clinical trial, or there was no&#xD;
                  ongoing clinical trial in the patient´s country of residence to treat his/her&#xD;
                  HCV-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In countries where DCV is commercially available at time of study initiation(Sweden,&#xD;
             UK, and Germany), patients treated with DCV during the early post-marketing&#xD;
             authorization period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients initiating any DCV-based regimen during the inclusion periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recorded in one of the HCV data sources used for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients included in the DCV Compassionate use program (CUP) (AI444-237 Protocol) open&#xD;
             in 6 European countries (Germany, Austria, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway and UK) after&#xD;
             Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) opinion for the DCV CUP in&#xD;
             Europe will be excluded since these patients will be analyzed as part of separate&#xD;
