  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This planned pilot study is a monocentric, prospective, double-blind randomized and placebo&#xD;
      controlled clinical study. The SOS-LVAD Trial can be assigned to the clinical Phase III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present trial is to provide the scientific rationale for a large multicenter&#xD;
      clinical trial, investigating the effects of perioperative high dose selenium supplementation&#xD;
      in high-risk cardiac surgical patients undergoing complicated open heart surgery with&#xD;
      prolonged time on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and LVAD Implant. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the therapeutic strategy tested in this randomized trial may contribute to a&#xD;
      faster independency from life-sustaining technologies in the ICU and a decrease of&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality. Before proceeding to the large-scale, definitive&#xD;
      trial, the investigators propose to conduct a pilot study of the definitive randomized trial,&#xD;
      to determine the feasibility of the study protocol.&#xD;

    <time_frame>postoperative day 28</time_frame>
    <description>As primary outcome, the investigators have chosen a composite outcome. This allows to assess the postoperative process of the included patients irrespective of extrinsic sources of irritation (e.g. daily routine, clinic based processes). The independency from specific ICU procedures is taken as a primary target (time is taken from postoperative admission to ICU after implantation of LVAD until the end of the characteristic ICU procedures):&#xD;
