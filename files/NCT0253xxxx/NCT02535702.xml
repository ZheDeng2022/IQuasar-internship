      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abusing alcohol, drugs, and other substances can cause serious health problems. These&#xD;
      substances also can affect brain function. Researchers want to learn more about brain&#xD;
      function by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This uses a magnetic field and radio&#xD;
      waves to take pictures of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop new ways to use MRI to study the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will answer questions about their drug use and psychiatric history. They will be asked&#xD;
      about family history of alcoholism or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions to see if they can participate in MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have MRI scans. The scanner is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field.&#xD;
      Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the cylinder. A device called a&#xD;
      coil may be placed over the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each sub-study will include up to 3 different MRI visits. Participants can be in multiple&#xD;
      sub-studies. But they can have only 1 MRI per week and 20 per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During MRI visits, participants may have urine collected. They may get another MRI&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a clinical MRI brain scan. This may show physical problems in the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During some scans, participants may perform simple movement, memory, and thinking tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be connected to a machine to monitor brain activity during the scan. Small&#xD;
      metal electrodes will be placed on the scalp. A gel will be placed in the space between the&#xD;
      electrodes and the scalp.&#xD;

      -  Objectives: There are two main goals in this protocol, 1) to improve sensitivity as well&#xD;
           as spectral and spatiotemporal resolutions in magnetic resonance (MR) studies assessing&#xD;
           structural, neurochemical, hemodynamic and electrophysiological changes that occur in&#xD;
           the human brain during the resting state as well as those that occur in response to&#xD;
           novel sensory, motor, cognitive or emotional stimulation paradigms; and 2) to conduct&#xD;
           pilot sub-studies, which are exploratory in nature, in order to gather enough&#xD;
           information for hypothesis generation. The criterion for transition to a new full&#xD;
           protocol will be a sufficient amount of information to generate a power analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population: We intend to complete studies in a healthy volunteers of 120 males and&#xD;
           120 females, 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design: We will design small projects as ideas pertinent to the theme of Addiction and&#xD;
           conduct pilot sub-studies, each with up to 16 subjects, to optimize MR pulse sequences&#xD;
           and/or functional MR imaging (fMRI) task paradigms. MR pulse sequences and/or fMRI task&#xD;
           paradigms will be validated against appropriated gold-standard methods/tasks. These&#xD;
           studies are required in order to maximize the sensitivity of new imaging techniques and&#xD;
           fMRI tasks used for clinical and research applications that take advantage of 3T and 7T&#xD;
           MRI scanners in the MR center. If an exploratory sub-study leads to results of interest&#xD;
           and if a larger population is necessary to reach statistical significance, a separate&#xD;
           protocol will be submitted with a priori hypotheses, specific study design and power&#xD;
           analysis adapted from the pilot or exploratory sub-studies performed in the present&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome parameters: Although multiple measures will be collected, the primary outcome&#xD;
           will be amplitude and reliability of regional-specific BOLD fMRI signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MRI: we will analyze measures such as the amplitude and the reliability of the&#xD;
                test-retest measures of fMRI signals; functional connectivity metrics; tractography&#xD;
                between seed and target regions of interest (diffusion tensor imaging, DTI);&#xD;
                morphometry of brain regions (using automatic segmentation and voxel-brain&#xD;
                morphometry, VBM); and brain metabolite levels in regions of interest (using MR&#xD;
                spectroscopy, MRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EEG (electroencephalography): we will quantify measures such as event or&#xD;
                task-related potentials, and coherence between sensors or sources located close to&#xD;
                the brain areas of interest. We are also quantifying blink rates from the&#xD;
                electrooculogram (EOG).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Behavioral measures during fMRI tasks: we will quantify measures such as reaction&#xD;
                times and accuracy (using MRI compatible response pads) as well as eye movement&#xD;
                (using MRI compatible eye trackers) and self-reports of the study experience (i.e.&#xD;
                degree of interest and motivation and alertness).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We may measure autonomic data during the course of the fMRI experiment (such as&#xD;
                blood pressure, skin conductance, respiratory frequency and heart rate), which&#xD;
                would correlate to the outcome measures.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Self-control Task</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>During the MRI scan, subjects will do a task that requires close concentration. Subjects will be asked to respond quickly to images on the computer screen, during which they will hear distracting noises. The subject will be able to remove the distraction in order to complete the task. During some sub-study sessions, subjects will start with no money ($0) and may be able to earn up to $40 if they do not remove the distraction. At other sub-study sessions, subjects will start with $40 and may lose between 25 to $1 each time they remove the distraction. Subjects cannot lose more than $40 in these sessions. Compensation for this sub-study is up to $40 per session, depending on their performance.</description>
