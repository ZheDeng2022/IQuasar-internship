      Patients will be randomized to control and spinal cord stimulation arm (SCS) to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of SCS on the occurrence of post-operative atrial fibrillation in the five days&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;

      Pre market single center clinical research feasibility study. Non blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled study. 52 patients undergoing CABG procedure will be enrolled and randomized into&#xD;
      two different group (26 person each): the Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and the control&#xD;
      group. The first group will be implanted before the CABG procedure with a temporary SCS lead&#xD;
      (5 days) while the second one will not. The lead will be connected to an external stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the CABG surgery, before the scheduled procedure, the patients in the treatment&#xD;
      group will be implanted with the SCS lead. CABG procedure follows the SCS lead implantation.&#xD;
      SCS will be switched off before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the CABG procedure, all patients will be hospitalized for minimally five days at the&#xD;
      end of which they will be discharged. The Primary Endpoint data will be collected from the&#xD;
      day of CABG procedure (Day-0) until Day-5. SCS lead will be removed on Day-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-week follow up visit will be performed one week after discharge. End-points will be&#xD;
      evaluated at various time before, during and after surgery. In both groups arrhythmic&#xD;
      episodes for primary and secondary endpoints will be recorded via a Holter monitor (recording&#xD;
      5 days continuously).&#xD;
