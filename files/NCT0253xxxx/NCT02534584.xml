      This study is a service evaluation to assess the impact of compliance of Acute Kidney Injury&#xD;
      care bundle (AKI-CB) on clinical and renal outcomes. The AKI care bundle is coupled with an&#xD;
      interruptive electronic alert, which is triggered by the first attempt to order blood tests&#xD;
      or medications on patients who have been identified as having AKI by the electronic&#xD;
      recognition from serum creatinine results. The interruptive alert will warn the clinician&#xD;
      about AKI and request them to complete the AKI care bundle. Once the AKI care bundle is&#xD;
      completed, the clinician is able to request blood tests or medication. The clinician will be&#xD;
      able to override the alert only after stating the reason. Education with respect to&#xD;
      importance of AKI and the AKI-CB is provided every four months when junior doctors rotated&#xD;
      through different specialities and also at clinical governance days. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare AKI episodes, which have the AKI-CB completed early (defined as within 24 hours of&#xD;
      availability of the blood results) with those who either had the AKI-CB completed late&#xD;
      (defined as after 24 hours of availability of the blood results) or not completed at all. The&#xD;
      AKI patients who either had the AKI-CB completed late or not completed will be considered as&#xD;
      not having the AKI-CB completed for this analysis.&#xD;

      This single centre study will be conducted at the Royal Derby Hospital, a 1139-bed tertiary&#xD;
      care centre. Data will be collected from February 2013 to December 2013 on all adult patients&#xD;
      over the age of 18 years. An electronic recognition system for AKI has been in use since 2010&#xD;
      that allows prospective data collection for all cases of AKI. The electronic recognition&#xD;
      system was modified in December 2012, to incorporate the Kidney Diseases Improving Global&#xD;
      Outcomes (KDIGO) definitions for AKI. In an effort to improve the clinical outcomes, intranet&#xD;
      guidelines were introduced along with the electronic recognition and alerting system. In&#xD;
      December 2012, a one-page paper version of the AKI CB was devised, which was subsequently&#xD;
      incorporated into the hospital electronic patient record on 1st February 2013. During this&#xD;
      period, education on the AKI CB was given to all staff in acute areas of the hospital and a&#xD;
      poster explaining the AKI CB was displayed in all clinical areas. The hospital already has&#xD;
      electronic ordering of investigations and prescribing of medications in place. The CB&#xD;
      consists of simple standardized investigations and interventions, reminding clinicians of the&#xD;
      importance of thorough Assessment, Urinalysis, establishing a Diagnosis, planning&#xD;
      Investigations and Treatment and at the same time issuing guidance about Seeking advice from&#xD;
      nephrologist while caring for patients with AKI (AUDITS). All the steps in the CB are&#xD;
      objective and the clinicians are requested to click yes or no for each step of the CB. On 1st&#xD;
      August 2013, the AKI CB was coupled with an interruptive electronic alert, which was&#xD;
      triggered by the first attempt to order blood tests or medications on patients who had been&#xD;
      identified as having AKI. The interruptive alert would warn the clinician about AKI and&#xD;
      request them to complete the AKI CB. Once the AKI CB was completed, the clinician was able to&#xD;
      request blood tests or medication. The clinician would be able to override the alert only&#xD;
      after stating the reason. The location of patients was categorized into the following&#xD;
      divisions - Medical Assessment Unit, Medical wards, Surgical &amp; Orthopedic wards, Haematology&#xD;
      and Oncology wards, Intensive Care and Surgical Step Down (high dependency unit) and Other&#xD;
      wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A weekly report is automatically generated which captures patient location in the hospital,&#xD;
      age, date of admission, date of discharge, finished consultant episode and survival status at&#xD;
      the reporting date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will analyze all AKI episodes, which had the AKI CB&#xD;
      completed early (defined as within 24 hours of availability of the blood results) with those&#xD;
      who either had AKI CB completed late (defined as after 24 hours of availability of the blood&#xD;
      results) or not completed at all. The AKI episodes who either had AKI CB completed late or&#xD;
      not completed will be considered as not having AKI CB completed for this analysis. Community&#xD;
      acquired AKI will be defined as AKI within 24 hours of admission. Survival status of all&#xD;
      patients will be obtained in February 2015.&#xD;
