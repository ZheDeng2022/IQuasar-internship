      BE FIT (Behavioral Economics Framingham Incentive Trial) is a pilot study to test the&#xD;
      deployment of a social incentive intervention using the Framingham Heart Study (FHS)&#xD;
      Offspring, Generation 3, and Omni cohorts to increase physical activity (PA). The&#xD;
      investigators will leverage the strength of FHS by recruiting trios and nuclear families to&#xD;
      test whether social connectedness increases PA. The investigators will utilize a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial design. The investigators will test a social incentive intervention strategy&#xD;
      using a team-based design in which participants work together to jointly achieve their PA&#xD;
      goals, and a social connectedness intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including&#xD;
      obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and an increased risk for CVD and death.&#xD;
      In the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation (Gen 3) and multiethnic Omni 2 cohort&#xD;
      participants, objectively measured accelerometry physical activity (PA) data showed that&#xD;
      moderate to vigorous PA was associated with healthier CVD risk factor profiles.6 Despite the&#xD;
      health benefits of engaging in PA, only about half of FHS participants are achieving U.S.&#xD;
      recommended aerobic PA guidelines, consistent with the low rates observed in adults&#xD;
      nationally. Experts estimate that increasing PA by only 10% would annually save Â½ million&#xD;
      lives worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a lot of interest in using &quot;social&quot; or team-based designs to increase PA.&#xD;
      Prior evaluations of the FHS found that rates of smoking and obesity were associated with&#xD;
      social connectedness within social networks. Evidence from other industries has found that&#xD;
      interventions using social comparisons feedback to change electricity use were effective, but&#xD;
      only if paired with appropriate social approval or disapproval. PA interventions could&#xD;
      leverage such social incentives to design interventions that increase peer support,&#xD;
      accountability, and unity towards a common goal. In five pilot studies conducted in 2014 at&#xD;
      the University of Pennsylvania, the investigators have found that different incentive and&#xD;
      feedback designs resulted in differential effectiveness. These preliminary data support the&#xD;
      notion that careful testing of alternative social incentive combinations are important to&#xD;
      conduct before deciding which intervention to scale more broadly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapidly expanding availability of mobile technologies provides a resource effective way&#xD;
      to implement social incentive interventions to improve health. Many types of health devices&#xD;
      (e.g. glucometers, pedometers) provide individual feedback on performance (e.g. blood sugar&#xD;
      or step count). With wireless devices it is technologically feasible to provide relative&#xD;
      feedback at periodic intervals. However, utilizing mobile health (mHealth) devices is rarely&#xD;
      done and could represent a significant opportunity to improve health behavior at low cost.&#xD;
      For our study, the investigators will leverage the University of Pennsylvania's NIH-funded&#xD;
      Way to Health infrastructure. The platform incorporates automated inputs from wireless&#xD;
      devices to capture behavior and deliver automated feedback to participants. While conducting&#xD;
      the 5 pilot studies noted above, the investigators found that most smartphones and wearable&#xD;
      devices were accurate for tracking physical activity data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting a pilot study and leveraging information acquired through&#xD;
      our Digital Connectedness Survey to test the deployment of a social incentive intervention&#xD;
      using the FHS Offspring, Generation 3, and Omni cohorts to increase PA. The investigators&#xD;
      will leverage the strength of FHS by recruiting trios and nuclear families to test whether&#xD;
      social connectedness increases PA. The investigators will utilize a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial design. The investigators will test a social incentive intervention strategy using a&#xD;
      team-based design in which participants work together to jointly achieve their PA goals, and&#xD;
      a social connectedness intervention. The primary outcome of the intervention pilot study will&#xD;
      be the proportion of individual participant-days that the goal is achieved over a 12-week&#xD;
      intervention period. Individuals find PA maintenance challenging and PA sustainability has&#xD;
      not been studied systematically. As a secondary aim of the intervention study, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine PA goal achievement durability for 12 weeks after the intervention&#xD;
      ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To test the feasibility of using a team-based social incentive intervention to&#xD;
      increase PA in FHS participants. H1: The demographic and clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      individuals who agrees to be randomized are younger and healthier than those who do not agree&#xD;
      to participate. H2: FHS participants who elect the Fitbit in place of the Moves app will&#xD;
      differ based on demographic and clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of a team-based social incentive intervention to achieve&#xD;
      PA goals among connected individuals on a team compared to a control group of individuals.&#xD;
      H4: A team-based social incentive intervention comprised of connected individuals on a team&#xD;
      is more effective for achieving PA goals than a control group of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim. To evaluate whether differences in achieving PA goals between study arms&#xD;
      during the 12-week intervention are sustained during the 12-week follow-up period. H6: PA&#xD;
      levels in the 12-week follow-up will decline for all arms but remain different in a similar&#xD;
      fashion to that during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the potential to address the major public health problem of sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle, with its consequent increased risks of obesity and CVD risk factor progression.&#xD;
      The investigators bring together a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in PA, CVD&#xD;
      epidemiology, biostatistics, and behavioral economics. The investigators propose an&#xD;
      innovative linking of a classical randomized clinical trial (RCT) design with the many&#xD;
      strengths of the epidemiological FHS. This pilot RCT will examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      different approaches to leveraging social incentives to improve health behaviors, an area&#xD;
      with considerable promise for increasing the effectiveness of a variety of health&#xD;
      interventions. Ultimately the goal is to leverage this pilot study to implement a larger&#xD;
      study in the FHS. The investigators also anticipate ultimately linking these results with the&#xD;
      extant FHS genetics databases.&#xD;
