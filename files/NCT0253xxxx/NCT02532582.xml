      The purpose of this study is to ultimately prevent injuries to nerves during surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Living donor liver transplant or hepatectomy (removal of a piece of the liver)&#xD;
      patients will receive an arterial line as standard of care. The arterial line helps monitor&#xD;
      blood pressure along with the compression of important vessels during surgery. In addition,&#xD;
      research participants will undergo neuromuscular monitoring using Somato-Sensory Evoked&#xD;
      Potential (SSEP) or Evoked Potential Assessment Device (EPAD). During an operation,&#xD;
      neuromuscular monitoring can tell doctors if the nerves being studied are working normally or&#xD;
      if they are at risk for injury. This study will help investigators to understand what kind of&#xD;
      monitoring is best to prevent nerve injuries during a surgical procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As standard of care, research participants undergoing a living donor liver transplant or&#xD;
      other liver surgeries will receive a right-sided radial arterial line to monitor his/her&#xD;
      blood pressure along with the compression of important vessels during surgery. These&#xD;
      measurements will be captured throughout the surgical procedure. If blunting of the arterial&#xD;
      line wave form occurs, the anesthesiology team alerts the surgical team to release the&#xD;
      retractors until the wave form returns to baseline. Depression of the radial arterial line&#xD;
      wave form will be captured, time-stamped, and stored by the research transplant&#xD;
      anesthesiology team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally as part of research, participants will receive neuromuscular monitoring using&#xD;
      SSEP or EPAD to measure their nerve signals during the surgery (3-6 hours). SSEP or EPAD&#xD;
      measurements will occur at the median and ulnar nerve and will be captured throughout the&#xD;
      surgical procedure. The research neuromonitoring team will consists of highly skilled&#xD;
      technicians, who monitor patients during neurosurgical and orthopedic surgeries. SSEP or EPAD&#xD;
      output captured during the surgery will be time-stamped, stored, and interpreted by a&#xD;
      Neurologist. To investigate if a correlation exists, SSEP or EPAD abnormalities will be&#xD;
      correlated and analyzed with the arterial wave form depressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether a correlation exists with clinical outcomes, a prospective medical&#xD;
      record review will be conducted. Before performing the prospective medical record review,&#xD;
      authorized research personnel will obtain informed consent from each participant.&#xD;
