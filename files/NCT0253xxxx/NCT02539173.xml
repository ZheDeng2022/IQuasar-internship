      1. INTRODUCTION AND MAIN OBJECTIVES The incidence of diaphragmatic paralysis after an&#xD;
           inter-block scalénique varies between 30 and 100% in the literature. Its clinical impact&#xD;
           is mostly absent and paralysis regresses after the block lifted. When it is suspected,&#xD;
           it can be diagnosed by a chest radio, showing an elevation of the dome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of diaphragmatic paralysis by&#xD;
           measuring the thickness diaphragmatic as quantitative assessment of diaphragmatic&#xD;
           contraction noninvasive ultrasound scan and feasibility of this measure in SSPI unit&#xD;
           (post-interventional monitoring unit) with scan (ultrasound) in the usual way used for&#xD;
           the block under ultrasound scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY TYPE Prospective, single-center clinical study routine care involving 50&#xD;
           consecutive patients scheduled to undergo surgical procedures in the area of the&#xD;
           shoulder or arm for which locoregional analgesia inter-block type scalénique or&#xD;
           supraclavicular ultrasound scan is indicated below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. START OF THE STUDY February 2014 with an expected duration of six months.&#xD;

      1. TITLE OF STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis after interscalene block by measuring the&#xD;
           inspiratory diaphragmatic thickening incidence and observed clinical consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Primary Objective: To evaluate the incidence and clinical impact of diaphragmatic&#xD;
           paralysis after interscalene block under ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the clinical consequences of this paralysis. Quantify diaphragmatic&#xD;
           paralysis: paralysis if present is it always complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Secondary objective: Assess the feasibility of measuring the diaphragmatic&#xD;
           thickening as a means simple diagnostics, rapid, non-invasive and non-irradiating&#xD;
           bedside by the anesthetist in charge of the patient with the conventional ultrasound&#xD;
           equipment available in the operating room without staff intervention Outdoor (radio&#xD;
           manipulator, radiologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY TYPE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Single-center prospective study in routine care involving 50 consecutive patients&#xD;
           conducted from February 2014 for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. LOCATION OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will take place in recovery and in the operating theater of the hospital Saint&#xD;
           Joseph 185 Rue Raymond Losserand 75014 Paris.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The information and the collection of patient consent will be held in pre-anesthetic&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. RUNNING OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Study Population Major patients scheduled to undergo surgical procedures in the area of&#xD;
      the shoulder or arm for which locoregional analgesia inter-block type scalénique or&#xD;
      supraclavicular ultrasound is indicated below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 anesthetic Protocol Block design: as recommended by SFAR, usual procedure In immediate&#xD;
      preoperative patient monitored and infused, fractionated ultrasound-guided injection of 20 ml&#xD;
      of 7.5% Naropin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery is then performed under general anesthesia according to the usual anesthetic&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Recruitment Mode Preoperatively during the pre-anesthetic visit, patients are informed of&#xD;
      the purpose of the study. Written consent is collected after oral and written information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Data collection The collected data about the patient are ASA, weight, age, gender, block&#xD;
      type, type of surgery, the occurrence of complications of the ALR, the administration of&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics and dexamethasone , respiratory pathology history, renal function,&#xD;
      drug class premedication, the occurrence of respiratory complications. The data is then&#xD;
      entered in a EXCEL spreadsheet whose treatment will remain internal to GHPSJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Ultrasound examination of the diaphragm It is non-invasive and non-irradiating. The&#xD;
      diaphragmatic thickening in recovery is measured before and after the completion of the&#xD;
      anesthetic block using the ultrasound system, the ultrasound probe and of an aqueous gel by&#xD;
      trans-thoracic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It measures the thickness on deep inspiration and expiration in supine position. Each&#xD;
      measurement is repeated twice. This measurement series lasts 4 minutes, is repeated 15&#xD;
      minutes after completion of the engine block when a block is found and contralateral. The&#xD;
      total measurement time is about 12 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Diagnosis of diaphragmatic dysfunction Diaphragmatic paralysis is recognized when the&#xD;
      inspiratory diaphragmatic thickening fraction is less than 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. SCHEDULED DATE FOR START OF THE STUDY: FEBRUARY 2014&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. PLANNED DURATION OF THE STUDY: 6 MONTHS&#xD;
