      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of cavitation ultrasound focused on localized&#xD;
      adiposity and its effects associated with stereodynamic lymphatic drainage. The investigators&#xD;
      aim also to know if this procedure will influence the biochemical profile of the individuals&#xD;
      concerned, as well as whether it will be found difference between the group that will receive&#xD;
      focused ultrasound cavitation associated with stereodynamic drainage and the group will&#xD;
      receive only focused cavitation ultrasound.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be a double-blind randomized clinical trial, preceded by a pilot study due to&#xD;
      lack of data in the literature impossible to calculate the size of adequate sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of cavitation ultrasound&#xD;
      focadalizado in localized adiposity and its associated lymphatic drainage effects&#xD;
      stereodynamic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate and compare the effects of focused ultrasound cavitation in reducing hypodermic&#xD;
      layer and anthropometric measurements of women; To evaluate the acute and chronic effects of&#xD;
      the technique; To evaluate the reduction in adipose tissue layer from the ultrasound image;&#xD;
      Evaluate and compare the reduction of the fat layer through intergroup and intragroup&#xD;
      photographic image; Evaluating and comparing serum biochemical parameters (total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, glucose, urea and creatinine) of women&#xD;
      undergoing focused ultrasound cavitation; Evaluate and compare the technical efficiency in&#xD;
      group A (without stereodynamic drainage) and B (with stereodynamic drainage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted with 28 volunteers, respecting the criteria for inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion previously cited by reading and signing of the free and clear consent. Participants&#xD;
      will be divided into 02 groups randomly. Randomization will be performed by using the local&#xD;
      random distribution www.random.org tool, in order to prevent the researcher to identify which&#xD;
      intervention will be performed on each patient. The generation of sequence numbers shall be&#xD;
      made by the researcher &quot;blind&quot; to the study, after the selection of patients for inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. The sequence numbers to be used for randomization will be kept&#xD;
      confidential until such time as the intervention Participants will undergo a 4-week control&#xD;
      period between the first (base) and the second evaluation (pre-treatment), so each&#xD;
      participant It will be their own control, ensuring that the possible changes that may be&#xD;
      found at the end of the project will be related to the procedure and not influenced by&#xD;
      lifestyle habits. During the period the research subjects will be instructed not alterararem&#xD;
      their respective routine activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      08 sessions will be conducted Cavitational Focused Ultrasound in individual applications,&#xD;
      once per week, total of 08 weeks of treatment. The first collection (pre-treatment) will be&#xD;
      only to carry out the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire of habitual physical activity Baecke - in the base period will be asked&#xD;
           participants to answer this quiz to knowledge of their routine physical activity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perimetry - anthropometric measurements will be measured by a previously trained&#xD;
           evaluator. During the measurement of the circumference of the tape will be adjusted to&#xD;
           the body, directly on the skin in order to provide more reliable measurements possible,&#xD;
           without the occurrence of tape pressure on subcutaneous tissue causing deformity. These&#xD;
           data will be verified in four stages: pre-treatment, before the first session after the&#xD;
           first session and after the eighth treatment session. They will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height: will be determined by the balance rule coupled with a degree in 1 mm, with the&#xD;
      individual back to this, in an upright standing position, feet together, and trying to put&#xD;
      the posterior surface of heels, pelvic and shoulder girdle contact instrument; Body weight&#xD;
      will be measured through traditional mechanical scale with 100g graduation, with front man&#xD;
      for the same, in the upright position, feet together, wearing light clothes and without&#xD;
      shoes; Body Mass Index (BMI) - Based on height and weight will be held calculate BMI, kg ÷&#xD;
      height x height; Abdominal skin fold, used to estimate the percentage of body fat will be&#xD;
      taken using caliper. It will be measured abdominal crease, having as anatomical reference&#xD;
      umbilicus, plying up the region located 1 to 3 cm to the right of scar parallel to the&#xD;
      longitudinal axis of the body; Waist circumference will be measured using the measuring tape&#xD;
      positioned parallel to the ground, where the measurement is taken over previous iliac crests&#xD;
      5 cm above the previous iliac crests 10 cm above the iliac crest and waist earlier; Hip&#xD;
      circumference, the tape measure is parallel to the ground and positioned in terms of points&#xD;
      of trocantéricos right and left, while the individual will be assessed with feet together;&#xD;
      Thigh circumference will also feature the same principles described above, but will be used&#xD;
      as an indication of circumference changes that are unrelated to treatment, such as changes&#xD;
      induced by weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bioimpedance - Evaluations shall be performed by a professional with training and&#xD;
           experience in this type of analysis. Obtaining the bioimpedance will take place in two&#xD;
           stages: in the base period (pre-treatment) and after the end of treatment (after the&#xD;
           eighth session). For the examination, it will be used Maltron BF-900 model system and&#xD;
           will be adopted the protocol recommendations proposed by the European Society for&#xD;
           Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism: To assess body mass and height of the individual at&#xD;
           the time of examination; Fasting individual and not drink alcohol for at least 8 hours;&#xD;
           Urinate before the exam; Not perform physical exercise in the eight hours before the&#xD;
           test; No injury to the skin where the electrode will be; Clean the skin with alcohol;&#xD;
           Position the electrodes always on the same side of the body; Minimum 5 cm distance&#xD;
           between the electrodes; Separate arms of the trunk for 30 ° and 45 ° legs apart; The&#xD;
           environment duty will be neutral (no electric or magnetic field); It should be observed&#xD;
           body shape for the risk of any possible anomaly (edema, amputation, atrophy, scoliosis,&#xD;
           dystrophy); When prostheses or implants, is measured on the opposite side (KYLE et al,&#xD;
           2004); You can not use metal objects during the examination as earrings, bracelets,&#xD;
           watches and the like; There may be conducted in subjects who have pacemaker and who are&#xD;
           in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound diagnosis - will be used to analyze and measure the hypodermic layer of the&#xD;
           assessed region. This will be measured by a professional with training and experience in&#xD;
           this type of evaluation. The evaluator will collect the images in the basic period (4&#xD;
           weeks before the start of treatment) before the first and after the last login session.&#xD;
           The results will be examined by a software in order to assess the thickness and&#xD;
           statistics of the images defined by the image of ultrasound. To collect the individual&#xD;
           will be in the supine position, the head is positioned above the navel and the fat&#xD;
           thickness is measured from the inner layer of the skin to the aponeurosis of the rectus&#xD;
           abdominis muscle in the middle of the Alba line area. The fat thickness measurement is&#xD;
           performed with linear probe (7.5 MHz) with a depth of 4 to 5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood collection - The analyzes will be performed on serum obtained by venipuncture,&#xD;
           after an overnight fast of 12 hours. 02 will be held series of biochemical assessment by&#xD;
           patient, where each collection will last for a maximum of 30 seconds. The first sample&#xD;
           time is performed at baseline, i.e., before the control period. The second collection&#xD;
           will be held after the end of treatment Focused Ultrasound Cavitational. After&#xD;
           harvesting, the material is centrifuged at 3500 rpm / 10 minutes and then the analysis&#xD;
           will be performed. Samples will be collected by a person trained for this, with latex&#xD;
           glove use. They will be analyzed: total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL&#xD;
           cholesterol, glucose, urea and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photo documentation - To carry out the photos, there will be a standard procedure in&#xD;
           order to maintain quality, the angle and the light always the same, so that the observed&#xD;
           results can be compared reliably. Initially, patients using swimsuits, will be&#xD;
           photographed standing in front and lateral planes (both sides) parallel to the plane of&#xD;
           the camera sensor. The camera is mounted on the tripod, level and horizontal position,&#xD;
           with the 105mm lens will be placed in proper height for framing the abdominal region,&#xD;
           and at a distance of 1 meter. The flash is mounted on the hot shoe of the camera, set in&#xD;
           TTL mode with the driven diffuser and will have its head directed forward. The camera&#xD;
           will be displayed in manual mode, with f5.6 aperture, shutter speed to 1/60 second and&#xD;
           ISO 200. The images will be taken in the base period and after the treatment and will be&#xD;
           recorded in RAW format. The computational treatments on the images will be made in&#xD;
           batch, so that all images suffer the same treatment and will be transformed into shades&#xD;
           of gray. For image analysis, randomization of the resulting photographs will be held,&#xD;
           and they will be delivered to two blind evaluators (physiotherapists) who will be&#xD;
           invited to participate in the project to carry out this analysis. They will not know&#xD;
           which patient images belong, or what the correct order of application of images. The&#xD;
           evaluation will be as follows: both receive the photos in random order and will have to&#xD;
           put them in progression order of the sessions, in 2 times: before and after treatment.&#xD;
           After the correct organization, assess images qualitatively. Importantly, the designated&#xD;
           evaluator will be a person with extensive knowledge about the procedure. The&#xD;
           photographic analysis will be performed in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: The evaluators will receive slides with 6 photos for each patient, in random order&#xD;
      (will be photographs in black and white, not to interfere in the result). The evaluator will&#xD;
      classify the images in the order of 1 to 2, being 1 before treatment, after treatment and 2&#xD;
      referring to the reduction of localized fat deposits in the abdominal region (it is expected&#xD;
      that the treatment reduces the action of the abdominal region, so this sort order). They will&#xD;
      receive 3 slides for each patient, each containing images of the respective regions measured:&#xD;
      front, right profile and left profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: evaluators should classify the changes in the abdominal region, in one of the degrees&#xD;
      of the scale below: 0% = no change; 1% - 25% = little change; 25-50% = was no change in terms&#xD;
      of improvement, but nothing extremely significant; 50% or more = a change from the reduction&#xD;
      of localized fat in the abdominal area is visible / improved considerably.&#xD;
