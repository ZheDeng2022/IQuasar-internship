    <measure>Investigation of Neurological Deficit by National Institute of Health Scale Score (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0. Higher score is indicative of some level of impairment in neurological function.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Disability by Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability.&#xD;
The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.&#xD;
0 - No symptoms.&#xD;
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.&#xD;
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.&#xD;
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.&#xD;
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.&#xD;
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.&#xD;
- Dead.</description>

        <title>Investigation of Disability by Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)</title>
        <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability.&#xD;
The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.&#xD;
0 - No symptoms.&#xD;
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.&#xD;
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.&#xD;
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.&#xD;
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.&#xD;
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.&#xD;
- Dead.</description>

        <title>Investigation of Neurological Deficit by National Institute of Health Scale Score (NIHSS)</title>
        <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0. Higher score is indicative of some level of impairment in neurological function.</description>
