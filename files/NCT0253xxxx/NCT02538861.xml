      This is a prospective open label two arms clinical trial. ARM-A patients will receive the&#xD;
      standard of care diagnostic test at Baptist Hospital Main (BHM), which includes Single Photon&#xD;
      Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging, while ARM-B patients will be randomized&#xD;
      sequentially into two groups; Group-1 will receive CT Angiography and CT myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      with new Revolution CT scanner (General Electric Healthcare) while the Group-2 will receive&#xD;
      SPECT imaging test; both groups of ARM-B at West Kendall Baptist Hospital (WKBH). The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the combined evaluation of CT angiography with CT myocardial perfusion is&#xD;
      more efficient in detecting or excluding acute coronary syndrome resulting in early discharge&#xD;
      and decrease length of stay of patients from the Emergency Department (ED) compared to a&#xD;
      strategy with SPECT alone. The secondary hypothesis is that a strategy with CTA/CTP can&#xD;
      reduce direct patient care costs and potentially improve patient outcomes in the same patient&#xD;
      population when compared to a strategy with SPECT imaging alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to have a definite ED chest pain admission triage, which&#xD;
      will help to reduce the length of stay and direct patient cost. This approach will reduce the&#xD;
      economic burden in intermediate risk group patients as well. We had a Baptist statistician&#xD;
      run the numbers. This study will provide important preliminary data to guide clinical&#xD;
      implementation of CTP/CTA in clinical practice. We divided arm B into two groups as the CT&#xD;
      protocol might be different at each hospital, so we want to reduce bias as a result of&#xD;
      variation in clinical patterns in the different hospitals. Also, we kept 50 patients in arm A&#xD;
      (Baptist hospital) to have a control group at the hospital level.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the subjectivity of clinical symptoms and the indirect nature of established ischemia&#xD;
      tests, effective initial triage of patients in the ED with acute new onset chest pain is&#xD;
      difficult and leads to a high number of patients that are admitted to the hospital despite&#xD;
      not having obstructive coronary disease. In the subsequent work up, these patients require&#xD;
      extensive testing with significant resource consumption and sometimes delayed treatment. The&#xD;
      ability to obtain information on the presence of coronary artery stenoses and plaque early in&#xD;
      a noninvasive fashion could substantially enhance initial triage in the ED for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combined approach as proposed here using CT coronary angiography to assess the coronary&#xD;
      morphology together with CT myocardial perfusion assessment would address morphology and&#xD;
      function and help to more correctly characterize coronary lesions for decision making of a&#xD;
      potential coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary CTA Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDCT data sets are assessed qualitatively for the presence of coronary disease within all&#xD;
      coronary segments, including side branches. The assessment is performed on original axial&#xD;
      source images; thin slice (5mm) MIP's and MPR reconstructions orthogonal and perpendicular to&#xD;
      the vessel centerline, and short axis cross-sectional reconstructions (0.625-mm-thickness).&#xD;
      The analysis is performed per segment and per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Myocardial Perfusion Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial evaluation of perfusion is performed by reconstruction of short axis images&#xD;
      viewed in thick multiplanar reformation (MPR) with slice thickness between 5mm and 10mm.&#xD;
      Increasing slice thickness increases the voxel size and thus decrease image noise and&#xD;
      improves low contrast resolution. For scans with increased image noise, a smoother&#xD;
      reconstruction algorithm is also useful. A true perfusion defect will persist throughout&#xD;
      multiple different phases and will be visualized in both systole and diastole. On the other&#xD;
      hand, a potential defect that is only present in one phase (i.e. only in systole) and then&#xD;
      disappears is likely to represent an artifact due to motion (e.g. false positive). In order&#xD;
      to identify regions of myocardium that have minor discrepancies in tissue density, narrow&#xD;
      window width is preferred, as higher contrast will be achieved. Measuring the attenuation&#xD;
      value on first pass computed tomography (CT) perfusion images is helpful in identifying&#xD;
      perfusion defects (HU ~ 50) vs. normal (remote) myocardium (Hounsfield Units (HU) ~ 100). A&#xD;
      17-segment model as defined by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) / American Heart&#xD;
      Association (AHA) is used to determine perfusion defect in a particular myocardial segment&#xD;
      and coronary artery distribution. A score on a scale from 0-4 is graded for each myocardial&#xD;
      segment depending on the extent or area of perfusion defect within the segment. The sum of&#xD;
      all the segment scores is used to determine if the patient has a disease (e.g., if the&#xD;
      maximum score attainable is 68, so any sum score &gt; 3 correlates to a 5% volume ischemia in&#xD;
      the myocardium and is designated as disease at the patient level.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decision to do CT myocardial Perfusion will be made by the cardiac radiologist after the&#xD;
           acquisition of the calcium score or after identifying a moderate stenosis or&#xD;
           non-evaluable segment as described in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results of the coronary CT angiography and the CT myocardial Perfusion will be used&#xD;
           together to make the decision of whether to send the patient home or to cath. Patients&#xD;
           will be admitted for further cardiac investigation if: stenosis &gt; 70% by Coronary CT&#xD;
           angiography or intermediate stenosis (50-70%)/non-diagnostic resting coronary CT&#xD;
           angiography with CT myocardial perfusion defect. Patients will be considered negative&#xD;
           and excluded from acute coronary syndrome if stenosis by coronary CT angiography is &lt;&#xD;
           50% or an intermediate/non-diagnostic lesion is seen and no myocardial ischemia is&#xD;
           present by CT myocardial Perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective The main purpose of this study is to have a definite ED chest pain admission&#xD;
      triage, which will help to reduce the length of stay and direct patient cost. This approach&#xD;
      will reduce the economic burden in intermediate risk group patients as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study seeks to evaluate the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I- The combined evaluation of CT angiography with CT myocardial perfusion is more efficient&#xD;
      in correctly diagnosing the obstructive disease. This will reduce the length of hospital stay&#xD;
      (LOS), in the assessment of intermediate risk patients at detecting or excluding acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome, in patients presenting with chest pain to ED as compared to a strategy&#xD;
      with SPECT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II- To reduce the direct patient care costs in the same patient population. This study is&#xD;
      proposing a new chest pain algorithm in arm-B at West Kendall Baptist hospital (combined&#xD;
      approach of CT angiography and CT myocardial perfusion) that will reduce the length of stay&#xD;
      as well as the consumed resources in comparison with the current approach. The additional&#xD;
      value of CT myocardial perfusion is to avoid false positive results by CT angiography alone.&#xD;
      CT myocardial perfusion will also provide incremental diagnostic value over and above CT&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective open label two-arm clinical trial. Arm-A patients will receive the&#xD;
      standard of care diagnostic test at Baptist Hospital, which includes SPECT imaging, while&#xD;
      Arm-B patients will be randomized sequentially into two groups; Group-1 will receive CT&#xD;
      Angiography and CT myocardial perfusion with new Revolution CT scanner (General Electric&#xD;
      Healthcare) while the Group-2 will receive SPECT imaging test; both groups of ARM-B at West&#xD;
      Kendall Baptist Hospital. The study population will include a total of 250 patients&#xD;
      presenting at the ED with an episode of new onset chest pain. Both study arms will use the&#xD;
      5-Level Miami Baptist Chest Pain Protocol for triage in the ED. This chest pain protocol will&#xD;
      be used as previously published at Baptist Hospital and patients triaged there will serve as&#xD;
      a reference population (n=50), while patients (n=100) presenting at the West Kendall Baptist&#xD;
      Hospital will be triaged using a modified chest pain protocol which includes coronary CT&#xD;
      angiography and CT myocardial perfusion assessment at protocol Level 3 (and selected level 4)&#xD;
      instead of SPECT (Group-1) and patients (n=100) at West Kendall Baptist Hospital will receive&#xD;
      SPECT imaging test (Group-2). The same group of doctors will provide the interpretation for&#xD;
      both arms for SPECT images. All the CT scan data (including SPECT imaging, CT Angiography,&#xD;
      and CT myocardial perfusion) are transferred to PACS, which is a system of storing the data&#xD;
      electronically and can be accessed by the Radiologist. The Radiologist will be blinded to the&#xD;
      research patient data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will collect the study data including; patient length of stay, direct&#xD;
      cost and CT scan data related to chest pain episode. Those patients who are discharged from&#xD;
      the ED will be contacted by a telephone call after 30 days for a follow-up of MACE event. In&#xD;
      case the patient is not available and there is no source of contact information, their&#xD;
      medical records will be checked or their primary care doctor will be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient screening will occur at the time when a patient presents at the ED of either hospital&#xD;
      and is assigned a categorizing level based on the 5-Level Miami Baptist Chest Pain Protocol.&#xD;
      Patients with an assigned &quot;Level 3 and Level 4&quot;, who will meet all the inclusion and none of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria, will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the Investigator or study coordinator has determined the patient's eligibility for the&#xD;
      study, the background of the proposed study, the benefits and risks of the procedures will be&#xD;
      explained to the patient. All potential patients must agree and sign informed consent&#xD;
      documents prior to performing any study-specific procedures including any pre-medications.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled at Baptist Hospital will be treated according to the current standard of&#xD;
      care practice. They are being asked to consent simply according to privacy law to allow the&#xD;
      use of their data for further scientific evaluation. Patients enrolled at West Kendall&#xD;
      Baptist Hospital will consent to be treated according to a modified 5-Level Miami Baptist&#xD;
      Chest Pain Protocol, in which a SPECT nuclear perfusion scan is replaced by a coronary CT&#xD;
      angiography and a CT myocardial perfusion study for Level 3 patients, and a CT myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion study is added for Level 4 patients, with intermediate stenoses (40-70%), Agatston&#xD;
      Calcium Score &gt;400, or non-evaluable segments in CT angiography due to calcifications, motion&#xD;
      artifacts, or technical reasons. Patient in ARM-B will be randomized sequentially and divided&#xD;
      into two groups; group-1 will receive the CT Angiography and CT myocardial perfusion while&#xD;
      group-2 will receive the SPECT imaging test. Patients at West Kendall Baptist Hospital will&#xD;
      provide consent to share their de-identified data with General Electric Healthcare for&#xD;
      scientific evaluation, product development, and potential marketing use. Only the West&#xD;
      Kendall Baptist hospital revolution study data will be shared with General Electric&#xD;
      Healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the eligible patients will be assigned a study ID and their personal information will be&#xD;
      strictly kept confidential. All the data will be collected and analyzed for research&#xD;
      purposes. The General Electric heath care will have only access to the West Kendall Arm&#xD;
      Revolution Computed tomography patient de-identified data. For statistical analysis, the&#xD;
      investigator will do the interim analysis once the enrollment and follow-up call is complete.&#xD;
      A biostatistician will independently analyze the data of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience of undergoing computed tomography is not uncomfortable. Computed tomography&#xD;
      scanning results in a measurable radiation exposure. Volume coverage of the whole heart with&#xD;
      axial mode results in an effective radiation dose of approximately 1 to 10 mSv, comparable to&#xD;
      a standard chest multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) exam (typically 8 to 10 mSv) or&#xD;
      nuclear perfusion stress imaging. MDCT requires the injection of iodinated contrast agent.&#xD;
      This, in general, poses a risk of renal dysfunction and contrast allergy. The dose of&#xD;
      contrast is lower than in the majority of conventional contrast-enhanced computed tomography&#xD;
      studies and adequate measures will be taken to identify patients with known contrast allergy&#xD;
      or renal dysfunction and exclude them from participation in the study. Administration of&#xD;
      Metoprolol (heart beat lowering medication) might lower blood pressure and cause dizziness as&#xD;
      well as bronchospasm and allergic reaction. In this case, a physician will provide adequate&#xD;
      treatment. Patients that have known contraindications and allergy to Metoprolol are not&#xD;
      enrolled. The most common side effects of Regadenoson are shortness of breath, headache,&#xD;
      flushing, chest discomfort or chest pain, dizziness, nausea, abdominal discomfort, a metallic&#xD;
      taste in the mouth, and feeling hot. Most common side effects began soon after receiving&#xD;
      Regadenoson and went away within 15 minutes except for a headache, which is resolved in most&#xD;
      patients within 30 minutes&#xD;
