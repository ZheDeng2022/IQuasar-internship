  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-documented and effective method for the&#xD;
      treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Lately there has been an&#xD;
      increase in the development and use of internet-based CBT programs (ICBT), as a means to&#xD;
      reduce costs and enhance accessibility of psychological interventions. ICBT has proven&#xD;
      efficacious towards adults with anxiety disorders. Research in the field of ICBT with&#xD;
      children and adolescents is still in its infancy though and to date, no program targeting&#xD;
      anxiety disorders has been developed nor evaluated in Denmark. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the efficacy of a newly developed internet-based treatment program&#xD;
      for adolescents with anxiety disorders. The effect will be examined in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing ICBT to a wait-list control condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Within the context of a research and teaching clinic at the Department of Psychology and&#xD;
      Behavioral Sciences, Aarhus University, Denmark, 70 adolescents aged 13-17 with a primary&#xD;
      anxiety disorder as assessed by the ADIS C/P will be randomly allocated to either a 3 month&#xD;
      wait-list control condition or a treatment condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment consists of an internet-based self-help program for adolescents with anxiety&#xD;
      disorders called 'Chilled Out', based on material from the well-established manualised&#xD;
      group-treatment Cool Kids Program: Adolescent version. It consists of 8 CBT-inspired modules&#xD;
      of approximately 30 minutes each distributed over a 14-week period. The program is&#xD;
      interactive using a combination of different media (text, audio, illustrations, cartoons, and&#xD;
      videos) to deliver psychoeducation and CBT-inspired techniques, activities and exercises for&#xD;
      adolescents to manage their anxiety. In addition, the adolescent will receive a limited&#xD;
      amount of therapist support calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (youth and parents) are assessed with semi-structured diagnostic interviews and&#xD;
      self-report measures before treatment, after 14 weeks (post treatment) and 3 months after&#xD;
      treatment (follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are assessed at pre, post and 3-month follow up.&#xD;
