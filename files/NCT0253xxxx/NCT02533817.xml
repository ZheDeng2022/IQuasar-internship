  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, people of black West African and Caribbean's tend to have healthier blood&#xD;
      cholesterol and blood fat levels, as well as lower incidence of heart disease/heart attack.&#xD;
      But rates of heart disease are now rising in young African-American populations with&#xD;
      diabetes, for the first time exceeding the rate in their white European-American peers. One&#xD;
      possible culprit is the increasing consumption of fructose which can lead to high blood fat&#xD;
      levels. Fructose is a natural sugar found in fruits and table sugar but is also used the food&#xD;
      industry as an ingredient and sweetener. Because fructose intakes are lower in the UK than in&#xD;
      North America we are studying the effect of fructose intake in UK black West African and&#xD;
      Caribbean people, to understand if fructose intake is indeed a reason for these ethnic&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall nature of this study is to conduct an investigation into the metabolic effects of&#xD;
      acute high fructose versus high glucose feeding in people of Black African (BA) compared to&#xD;
      age and BMI-matched control subjects of White-European (WE) origin . The research question of&#xD;
      our study is: do people of BA metabolise fructose differently than people of WE when&#xD;
      challenged with a high sugar diet? Therefore, our specific aims are to determine the&#xD;
      following in both people of BA and WE consuming both high fructose and high glucose meals: 1)&#xD;
      the postprandial pattern of blood insulin, glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol&#xD;
      concentrations; 2) ambulatory blood pressure measures during the postprandial period and 4)&#xD;
      postprandial and 0-24-hour fasted serum and red blood cell membrane cholesterol and&#xD;
      non-cholesterol sterol concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will attend the scheduled screening session where the requirements of&#xD;
      participation will be described and the participants will be given an opportunity to ask any&#xD;
      questions they may have. Those still willing to participate will sign the informed consent&#xD;
      form before the screening assessment is performed. Screening will require a fasted blood&#xD;
      sample to be taken as well as a brief questionnaire to ascertain ethnicity (self-declared),&#xD;
      medications and health status. An assessment of weight, height and waist circumference will&#xD;
      also be taken to confirm they meet the inclusion criteria. It is expected that the results of&#xD;
      the screening blood sample will be available within 1-2 weeks. Those participants meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be contacted and scheduled for the first study visit. Those not&#xD;
      meeting the criteria will be notified by their preferred means of contact, a copy of their&#xD;
      results will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to attending participants treatment order will be randomized. Participants will report&#xD;
      to the Metabolic Research Unit (MRU) at 08.00 following an overnight fast. A catheter will be&#xD;
      inserted into an antecubital vein for collection of blood samples and a baseline blood sample&#xD;
      collected at this time. Participant will be asked to undertake minimal physical activity&#xD;
      during the remainder of the study period. A breakfast meal will be given at 0min, the lunch&#xD;
      meal at 240min and meals will be consumed within 15 minutes. Participants will be fitted with&#xD;
      a portable continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitor (arteriograph) and instructed on&#xD;
      what to expect as it functions. Further blood samples will be taken at -30, -15, 0, 15, 30,&#xD;
      45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420min and at 24hrs (1440min, fasted). The energy&#xD;
      content of the meals will be the estimated energy requirements of the participant (to the&#xD;
      nearest 100kcals), with 20% of total daily energy coming from glucose or fructose. The&#xD;
      glucose or fructose will be given dissolved water with added colour and orange/fruit flavours&#xD;
      and provided at breakfast, lunch and supper. The remaining daily caloric requirement for each&#xD;
      participant will be given a standardized evening meal to take away and consume at home.&#xD;
