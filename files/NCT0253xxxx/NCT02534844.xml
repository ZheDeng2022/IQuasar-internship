  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to different study designs, the sponsor separated Part C into a separate registration&#xD;
      (NCT04958642), leaving Parts A/B here in NCT02534844.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to find out how safe and effective VTS-270 is for patients with Niemann-Pick&#xD;
      Type C1 (NPC1) disease who have neurologic symptoms (listed under Keywords).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Parts A/B, two out of every three patients will receive the study drug. The third patient&#xD;
      will receive 1 to 2 small needle pricks at the location where the LP and IT injection is&#xD;
      normally made (sham control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part C, all participants will receive study drug, as described in the Part C registration&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start date for this record is the first day a participant was enrolled in Parts A/B. The&#xD;
      trial is actually continuing until the last primary outcome measure of safety data are&#xD;
      collected from Part C participants. The last primary outcome measure of safety, along with&#xD;
      final adverse events results will be posted in the separate Part C registration record.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-clinical studies and a Phase 1 clinical trial suggest that intrathecal administration of&#xD;
      VTS-270 in patients with neurologic manifestations of Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease has&#xD;
      the potential to slow the rate of progression of their neurologic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease is a rare, neurodegenerative, inherited, autosomal&#xD;
      recessive lysosomal lipid storage disorder primarily in children and teenagers. The disease&#xD;
      is characterized by the inability to properly metabolize cholesterol and other lipids within&#xD;
      the cell due to mutations in the NPC1 gene, causing unesterified cholesterol to accumulate in&#xD;
      the brain, liver and spleen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll about 51 participants with NPC1 disease. It will be conducted in&#xD;
      three parts: Parts A, B, and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A will evaluate 3 different dose levels of VTS-270 in 12 participants to determine&#xD;
           the dose level for Parts B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part B, 39 more participants will join the original 12 to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
           effectiveness of the dose selected from Part A compared to sham control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part C will be an open-label extension phase of the study for Part B participants who&#xD;
           either complete Part B or have met rescue therapy criteria, as well as participants&#xD;
           entering Part C from other trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Part C will receive treatment with VTS-270 until the product is licensed or&#xD;
      the program is terminated (anticipated within 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final results will be posted in the Part C registration record (NCT04958642).&#xD;
