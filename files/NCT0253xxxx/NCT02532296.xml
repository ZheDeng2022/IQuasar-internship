  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving hospital-to-home care transitions can produce improvements in patient safety and&#xD;
      health care outcomes, while decreasing medical costs. Most transitions research has examined&#xD;
      strategies for older patients. This project, however, focuses on younger, high-risk patients&#xD;
      within a safety net system. The proposed intervention is based on research that patient&#xD;
      activation, as measured by the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), is correlated with risk for&#xD;
      hospital readmission. The intervention seeks to increase PAM scores by employing a Transition&#xD;
      Coach to coach patients, prior to and for 30-days after discharge, to (1) improve&#xD;
      self-management skills through goal setting and goal attainment; (2) to enhance patient&#xD;
      capacity to engage in trusting relationships with the Primary Care Provider (PCP), other&#xD;
      medical specialists, family members of friends, and the Transition Coach; and (3) to improve&#xD;
      ability to navigate the medical system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to determine; (a) if PAM scores can be&#xD;
      increased in the 30-day after hospital discharge; (b) if increased PAM scores, in this&#xD;
      setting, are correlated with changes in healthcare utilization patterns; and (c) if the&#xD;
      intervention presents a viable strategy to change healthcare utilization patterns and reduce&#xD;
      rehospitalizations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient Activation is defined as the &quot;knowledge, skills, confidence, and inclination to&#xD;
      assume responsibility for managing one's health and healthcare needs.&quot; The 10-item version of&#xD;
      the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) has been demonstrated to be a valid tool for measuring&#xD;
      patient activation in a range of patient populations. Evidence demonstrates that PAM scores&#xD;
      are correlated with heath care outcomes and that targeted interventions can modify PAM scores&#xD;
      and improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly activated patients, based on their PAM scores, are less likely to experience 30-day&#xD;
      readmissions, while those with lower levels of activation have higher rates of&#xD;
      rehospitalization. The investigators propose an intervention to support younger adult&#xD;
      patients transitioning from hospital to home to assume increased self-care responsibility.&#xD;
      While hospitalization tends to promote the passive receipt of care, the intervention supports&#xD;
      patients to take on a more active role. A Transition Coach will assist patients to prepare&#xD;
      for discharge to enhance their ability to self-manage medications, follow-up appointments,&#xD;
      symptoms, community services, and personal goals. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      intensified pre-discharge involvement in improving self-management skills for younger&#xD;
      high-risk patients can; (a) improve PAM scores, (b) improve post-discharge engagement with&#xD;
      medical, psychiatric and community-based care; and (c) present a strategy for changing&#xD;
      healthcare utilization patterns that maximize outpatient care and reducing inpatient care,&#xD;
      including hospital readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) is a public safety-net system serving an ethnically diverse,&#xD;
      underserved patient population of whom 30% are non-English speaking and 87% are publically&#xD;
      insured. Our target group is high risk hospitalized medical patients age 60 and younger, who&#xD;
      are discharged to home and receive primary care within the CHA network. Patients are&#xD;
      considered high risk if they have had a previous inpatient admission or multiple Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) visits within the past year, which serves as a proxy for complicated medical&#xD;
      or psychosocial issues. Patients will be selected from the Medicine or Surgical Services at&#xD;
      Cambridge Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators anticipate enrolling 100 intervention patients and 100 control&#xD;
           patients over 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A research assistant (RA) administers the Patient Activation Measure to intervention&#xD;
           patients and control patients, immediately after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2- The intervention occurs with selected patients. 3- RA administers a post-discharge PAM to&#xD;
      all patients 31 days after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be extracted from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) on all study patients.&#xD;
      Baseline data will include age, sex, insurance status, Charlson comorbidity score, mental&#xD;
      health and substance abuse disorders, marital status, homelessness, and address changes,&#xD;
      admissions and ED visits in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modest sample sizes may limit our ability to observe statistically significant effects. The&#xD;
      PAM score is calculated with a scale of 0 to 100 (highest activation), with scores typically&#xD;
      converted to a four-category categorical scale. Based on previous work in safety net&#xD;
      settings,18 the investigators expect about 45% of control patients to have a PAM score of&#xD;
      Level 4 (highly activated). With 100 intervention and 100 control patients, assuming&#xD;
      two-sided alpha=0.05, the investigators would have 89% power to detect a 20% increase in the&#xD;
      percentage of highly activated patients in the intervention group, and 65% power to detect a&#xD;
      15% increase. A key outcome is having an outpatient visit within 7 days of discharge. Based&#xD;
      on our current work, only 15% of control patients in this group complete a 7-day visit. The&#xD;
      investigators would have 81% power to detect an increase of 15% in the visit rate in the&#xD;
      intervention group, and 50% power to detect a 10% increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to observe positive gains in PAM scores following the intervention,&#xD;
      increases in 7-day outpatient follow-up rates and reductions in 30-day readmissions.&#xD;

    <description>TC reviews patient's medical record to understand current admission and the medical/psycho-social history. TC makes introductory hospital visit(s) with patient to establish rapport and to define post-discharge needs.&#xD;
Starting in-house and continuing after discharge, TC helps patient set transition goals to maximize healthcare outcomes. Post-discharge, TC offers a voluntary face-to-face visit with patient along with weekly outreach calls, which are designed to assist patient with goal setting and attainment, medical system navigation; medication management; medical follow-up; transportation; use of community resources; and self-care.&#xD;
Intervention lasts 30 days post-discharge; afterwards TC seeks to handoff to an outpatient care team member, to ensure continuity of care.</description>
