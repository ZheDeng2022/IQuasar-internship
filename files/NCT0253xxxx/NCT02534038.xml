  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Disorder and&#xD;
      must exhibit disinhibition syndrome of sufficient severity to warrant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study&#xD;
      consisting of two 6-week treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 12 participants will be enrolled at approximately 2 centers in the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into the study.&#xD;

             illness, drug action, or substance use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disinhibition scale score of â‰¥4 on the 3 core disinhibition items of the Frontal&#xD;
             Behavioral Inventory (FBI) at Screening and Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with symptoms of disinhibition that is not secondary to Neurodegenerative&#xD;

          -  Participants with myasthenia gravis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with co-existent clinically significant or unstable systemic diseases&#xD;
