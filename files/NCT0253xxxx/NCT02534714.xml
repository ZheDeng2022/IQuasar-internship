      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is correlation between Vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency and spinal disease/spinal fusion surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone Health is becoming of great concern in the population &gt; 50 years old in the past several&#xD;
      decades. Literature review has detected a high incidence of patients with hypovitaminosis D&#xD;
      and back pain. Vitamin D Deficiency is in all races, age groups, and ethnic backgrounds&#xD;
      affecting greater than one billion people worldwide1. There is a higher incidence of Vitamin&#xD;
      D Deficiency noted in the northern states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate Vitamin D is essential in bone health and muscle function. It also has been reported&#xD;
      to have positive effects on decreasing myopathy and /or musculoskeletal pain. Vitamin D has&#xD;
      been shown to have a protective effect on fracture risk by providing increased bone matrix&#xD;
      and on fall prevention through improved muscle function. 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deficiency of this vitamin can lead to impaired bone mineralization and bone softening&#xD;
      diseases including osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults. Osteomalacia has significant risk&#xD;
      factors for vertebral fractures, and spinal instrumentation failure. Low-energy fractures or&#xD;
      fragility fractures have been found to be more common because of an increase in life&#xD;
      expectancy 3. The total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-VitD) level (the sum of 25-OH-vitamin D2&#xD;
      and 25-OH-vitamin D3) is the appropriate indicator of vitamin D body stores. Presently, there&#xD;
      is no universal consensus about a treatment cut point. Studies suggest &gt;30 ng/mL as the&#xD;
      minimal concentration of 25-OH-Vit D Total is needed to avoid the adverse effects of&#xD;
      deficiency4. Vitamin D insufficiency is considered at &lt;30ng/ml to 21 ng/ml and Vitamin D&#xD;
      Deficiency is &lt;20 ng/ml of 25-OH-Vit D Total. Several researches have indicated increasing&#xD;
      Vitamin D levels &gt;45 ng/ml will increase their immune system, bone health, lower risks of&#xD;
      neurological disorders and cancers. 3,4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influential pathophysiological changes in osteoporosis include the hyperactivity of&#xD;
      osteoclasts compared to the need for bone remodeling or a decreased activity of osteoblasts&#xD;
      compared to the need for bone cavity repair or laying down new bone.5 Osteoporosis has become&#xD;
      synonymous with decreased bone mineral density (BMD). Bone Marrow Density scans (DXA) allows&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis of osteoporosis, estimation of fracture risk, and monitoring of patients&#xD;
      undergoing treatment.5 In postmenopausal women and men age 50 years and older, the WHO&#xD;
      diagnostic T-score criteria categorizes a normal DXA scan of &lt;1.0 or above, low bone mass or&#xD;
      osteopenia has a T score between &lt;1.0 and -2.5, and osteoporosis is designated with a T-score&#xD;
      at -2.5 or below) are applied to BMD measurement by central DXA at the lumbar spine and&#xD;
      femoral neck. 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was done in two parts. Part 1 was the Retrospective Study from November 1, 2012 to&#xD;
      October 31, 2014 and Part 2 is the Prospective pilot from July 1, 2015-June 30, 2016. We are&#xD;
      anticipating to raise the awareness and identify the importance of evaluating for&#xD;
      hypovitaminosis D and bone marrow density preoperatively in Neurosurgery Clinic for 12&#xD;
      months. Our goal is to show treating bone health in spinal diseased patients preoperatively&#xD;
      will provide optimal bone health with better long term outcomes requiring less revision&#xD;
      surgeries for our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - Retrospective Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. What is the prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency in patients over 50 undergoing spinal&#xD;
      fusion surgery by Dr. Daniel Fassett, MD, MBA, Neurosurgeon?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2- Prospective Study (screening period July 1, 2015-June 30, 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency in patients over 50 undergoing spinal&#xD;
           fusion surgery by Dr. Daniel Fassett, MD, MBA, Neurosurgeon?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do patients with Hypovitaminosis D maintain therapeutic levels between 45 ng/ml to 75&#xD;
           ng/ml in approximately 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively with supplements of Vitamin&#xD;
           D3?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the incidences of osteopenia and osteoporosis in elective spinal fusion&#xD;
           patients based on a Dexascans in patients over 50 undergoing spinal fusion surgery by&#xD;
           Dr. Daniel Fassett, MD, MBA, Neurosurgeon?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do the patients' demographic information, such as age, sex, BMI, and family history&#xD;
           influence the outcome measures (Vitamin D deficiency, Osteopenia, and Osteoporosis)?&#xD;
