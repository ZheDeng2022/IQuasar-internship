  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare platform-switched implants to platform-matched implants for replacement of a&#xD;
      single missing tooth and their effect on: 1) Interproximal alveolar crest level in relation&#xD;
      to implant platform. 2) Buccal implant recession. 3) Presence or absence of black triangle&#xD;
      apical to the contact point. 4) Implant Success. 5) Adequate buccal tissue thickness.&#xD;

      Thirty patients will have a dental implant placed. Fifteen patients will be randomly selected&#xD;
      by a coin toss to receive a platform-switched implant while the other fifteen will receive&#xD;
      platform-matched implant. Each patient will receive a diagnostic work-up including&#xD;
      standardized radiographs (periapicals), study casts, clinical photographs, and a clinical&#xD;
      examination of teeth adjacent to the edentulous sites. Pre-surgical preparation will include&#xD;
      detailed oral hygiene instructions. Baseline data will be collected at initial exam, and at&#xD;
      2, 4, 6, and 12 months. Parameters measured will include: plaque index, gingival index,&#xD;
      probing depth, keratinized tissue, bleeding on probing, and digital radiographic examination.&#xD;
      Pre-surgical measurements will include: cemento-enamel junction to osseous crest on adjacent&#xD;
      teeth by direct measurement at surgery, and by radiograph at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months, periodontal form, periodontal biotype, tooth shape, and papilla harmony. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomly selected for treatment group assignment using a coin toss before surgery by&#xD;
      the mentor. One investigator who is unaware of group assignment will perform all baseline&#xD;
      examinations and all follow-up examinations. Means and standard deviations will be calculated&#xD;
      for all parameters. A paired t-test will be used to evaluate the statistical significance of&#xD;
      the differences between initial and final data. An unpaired t-test will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      statistical differences between the test and control groups. A sample size of 15 gives 80%&#xD;
      statistical power to detect a difference of 0.5 mm of implant bone loss between groups. All&#xD;
      surgical procedures will be completed by one operator under the direction of one mentor.&#xD;
      Pre-surgical measurements will be taken first. Local anesthesia will be administered. The&#xD;
      surgical procedure will consist of the reflection of full thickness flaps to expose the&#xD;
      alveolar crest. The implant platform will be placed 3 to 4 mm apical to the mid-facial&#xD;
      gingival margin using dental implant osteotomy drills for preparation of the site. The&#xD;
      surgical procedures will be documented with clinical photographs. Sutures will be used to&#xD;
      close the flap and bury the implant under the tissue. Records will be kept of healing&#xD;
      periodically for the first 8 weeks, then at 4, 6 and 12 months. The test group will use a&#xD;
      BioHorizons Tapered Internal Plus &quot;platform-switched&quot; implant. The control group will be&#xD;
      BioHorizons standard Internal &quot;platform-matched&quot; implant. All patients will be seen at 1-2,&#xD;
      4, 6 and 8 weeks to monitor healing. At week 8 the implant will be uncovered surgically and&#xD;
      provisionalized, and at the 4 month visit the final crown will be placed. Subsequent&#xD;
      examinations will take place at 6 and 12 months. Post-surgically, patients will take an&#xD;
      antibiotic (doxycycline hyclate 100 mg once a day for two weeks), an analgesic (Vicodin ES&#xD;
      every 4-6 hours as needed for pain), and an anti-inflammatory agent (Naproxen 375mg every 12&#xD;
      hours for one week). At post-operative visits plaque removal, and oral hygiene instruction,&#xD;
      as needed, will be performed along with clinical photographs and standardized radiographs as&#xD;
      scheduled. The results of this study will allow comparison of peri-implant soft and hard&#xD;
      tissue healing following placement of a BioHorizons &quot;platform-switched&quot; Tapered Internal Plus&#xD;
      implant versus a standard Internal &quot;platform-matched&quot; implant in terms of the effect on&#xD;
      marginal bone loss, buccal recession, and papilla fill.&#xD;
