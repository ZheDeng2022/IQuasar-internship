  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase IV Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) of CPX-351 in patients with secondary&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia who are suitable for treatment with intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis that CPX-351 treatment may be safe and efficacious in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed secondary AML comes from a single randomized Phase II study which observed&#xD;
      significant improvement in survival in a 52-patient subset of patients with secondary AML. A&#xD;
      Phase III confirmatory study has recently completed accrual and final results are not&#xD;
      expected until mid-2016. Therefore, the sponsor has chosen to make CPX-351 available to&#xD;
      secondary AML patients through this expanded access protocol until commercialization of&#xD;
      CPX-351 or more information about the clinical utility is known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase IV multicenter, single-arm open-label Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) of&#xD;
      CPX-351 in patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia who are suitable for treatment with&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy. Patients may receive up to two inductions and four consolidation&#xD;
      courses. Patients will be monitored for safety (early deaths, serious adverse events, grade 3&#xD;
      and 4 adverse events, etc.) while on the study and for SAEs for 30 days after the last dose&#xD;
      of CPX-351. Study enrollment will be available through commercialization of CPX-351.&#xD;

    <description>CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome for Injection is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of the antineoplastic drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin. The two drugs are present inside the liposome in a 5:1 molar ratio shown to act synergistically in pre-clinical studies. The liposome membrane is composed of distearoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylglycerol and cholesterol in a 7:2:1 molar ratio.&#xD;
CPX-351 is provided as a sterile, pyrogen-free, purple, lyophilized product in 50 mL glass, single-use vials. Each 50 mL vial after reconstitution contains 20 mL of CPX-351 (5 units/mL). Each unit (u) contains 1 mg cytarabine and 0.44 mg daunorubicin base in liposomes suspended in sucrose. Product is stored at 5˚ ± 3PoPC.</description>
