    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open label, study consisting of two cohorts. Cohort 2&#xD;
      explores the combination of copanlisib and pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory NKTCL, who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy. Cohort 2 will include&#xD;
      a phase 1 portion (cohort 2a) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) utilizing a&#xD;
      standard 3+3 design, followed by a phase II portion where patients will be treated at the&#xD;
      RP2D (cohort 2b). The primary endpoint for cohort 1 was progression-free survival; the&#xD;
      primary endpoint for cohort 2a will be to determine RP2D for the combination therapy; and&#xD;
      overall response rate at the end of 4 treatment cycles for cohort 2b. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed for response with PET CT or CT every 12 weeks using the revised Cheson criteria.&#xD;
      Correlative endpoints will be exploratory and assess PD-1 expression on peripheral blood&#xD;
      lymphocytes; peripheral blood T-cell and NK-cell functional assays; PD-1 and PD-L1 expression&#xD;
      on tumor tissue; tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and gene expression panels using the&#xD;
      nanostring technology as prognostic and predictive biomarkers, as well as monitoring of&#xD;
      minimal residual disease via high-throughput sequencing of cell free tumor DNA, and exosome&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

      Patients with relapsed or refractory (RR) NK and T-cell Lymphoma (NKTCL), who have received&#xD;
      at least 1 prior systemic therapy, were enrolled in cohort 1. The study design for cohort 1&#xD;
      was a single arm phase II 2-stage design, to explore monotherapy with the PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (or MK-3475) given intravenously at a fixed dose of 200mg every 3 weeks for up&#xD;
      to 36 cycles. Enrollment to this cohort has been completed.&#xD;

             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;

             within the first 100 days of having undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant will&#xD;
             be excluded. Otherwise, patients who have received an allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;

             (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism&#xD;
             within 3 months before the start of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Prior exposure to PI3K inhibitors, unless on PI3K inhibitor therapy more than 6 months&#xD;
             ago AND reason for discontinuation of prior PI3K inhibitor therapy was other than&#xD;
