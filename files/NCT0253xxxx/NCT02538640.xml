  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a laboratory-based research study conducted in two parts. Open cross-over design. 2&#xD;
      test sessions per subject included in the study. It aims at determining the postprandial&#xD;
      blood glucose and insulin responses to the ingestion of cereal product differing by their SDS&#xD;
      content and GI in 20 healthy non-smoking voluntary subjects, aged from 18 to 45 years.&#xD;
