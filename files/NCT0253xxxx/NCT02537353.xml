      The non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
      located proximal to the angle of Treitz, whose cause is not related to esophagogastric&#xD;
      varices or gastropathy of portal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies showed no absorption in the GIT and disposal within 48 hours of application,&#xD;
      and no reported cases of obstruction. Recently, a prospective study involving 20 patients&#xD;
      with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, showed that the application of hemospray 速 promoted&#xD;
      hemostasis in 95% of cases, confirmed by endoscopic revision 72h after application without&#xD;
      any complication.&#xD;

      The non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
      located proximal to the angle of Treitz, whose cause is not related to esophagogastric&#xD;
      varices or gastropathy of portal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite all therapeutic guidelines and innovations introduced in recent decades, the&#xD;
      incidence varies between 50 and 160 cases/100000 inhabitants / year and recent data show a&#xD;
      mortality rate of approximately 10% in hospitalized patients. In the United States the upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding (HDA) promotes 300,000 hospitalizations per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiologies of non-variceal, HDA remains virtually unchanged over the past 20 years,&#xD;
      peptic ulcer disease accounts for 40-50% of cases. Other less common causes are vascular&#xD;
      ectasia, Mallory-Weiss lacerations, acute gastroduodenal mucosal lesions, Dieulafoy lesions,&#xD;
      tumors and other rarer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HDA is manifested most often by hematemesis and / or melena. In a smaller proportion of&#xD;
      patients can only be observed a drop in hemoglobin levels, and hemodynamic instability&#xD;
      possible, without externalization of blood. There is also a smaller chance of rectal bleeding&#xD;
      occur, which should indicate a bleeding of major consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of patients with HDA should be systematized and as early as possible. Due to&#xD;
      the unpredictability of the evolution of bleeding, all patients should be kept in the&#xD;
      hospital environment and in the presence of hemodynamic and / or comorbidities should be&#xD;
      considered high risk instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic stabilization is the initial step in the management of patients with HDA. Recent&#xD;
      studies show that early and intensive resuscitation measures result in decreased length of&#xD;
      hospitalization and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the hemodynamic maintenance, you should evaluate the presence of active bleeding,&#xD;
      because when present, besides translating more severe, requiring a more rapid therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some findings predictive of severity of bleeding that can be evaluated from a&#xD;
      clinical standpoint, they are: hemodynamic instability, need for continued transfusion,&#xD;
      hematemesis with &quot;fresh blood&quot;, rectal bleeding, bleeding that began during hospitalization,&#xD;
      rebleeding during hospitalization in patients older than 60 years and presence of&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy (EDA) is the test of choice for the initial evaluation of bleeding of the upper&#xD;
      digestive tract. The goals of endoscopic examination is to recognize the point of bleeding,&#xD;
      hemostasis proceed when indicated and recognize stigma that suggest impending rebleeding. In&#xD;
      peptic ulcers, using the classification of Forrest, the following findings are relevant:&#xD;
      active arterial bleeding, visible vessel, and adherent clot. The risk of rebleeding these&#xD;
      three groups without endoscopic treatment is estimated at 90%, 50% and 25%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic treatment has modified the natural evolution of non-variceal upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding. Several studies have shown that performing endoscopic therapy&#xD;
      significantly reduces the risk of rebleeding and the length of hospital stay, need for&#xD;
      surgical intervention and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are risk factors for rebleeding: chronic renal failure, liver cirrhosis, low hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels, the need for high doses of epinephrine for hemostasis and inexperienced endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic techniques in the treatment of existing HDA can be divided into three major&#xD;
      groups: injection methods, thermal and mechanical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several clinical trials using two methods therapy (combination therapy) was more effective&#xD;
      than using only one method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection method is the use of sclerosing substances in the four quadrants of the lesion.&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of hemostasis associated with the local tamponade, vasoconstriction&#xD;
      and platelet aggregation. Among the available solutions for injection can be mentioned:&#xD;
      adrenaline, ethanolamine, polidocanol, absolute ethanol and sodium chloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the thermal heat production method causes protein denaturation tissue, collagen shrinkage&#xD;
      and therefore obstruction of the vessel perivascular contraction. Thermal methods are used:&#xD;
      Mono and bipolar electrocoagulation, argon plasma, laser and heater probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment with mechanical methods has been developed in recent decades with the&#xD;
      improvement of the devices used. In endoscopic practice who have proved effective are&#xD;
      endoclipes and ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoclip when compared to isolated therapeutic injection of adrenaline was superior in&#xD;
      reducing rebleeding in peptic ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, the use of argon plasma endoclip in ulcers with active bleeding were&#xD;
      compared. The result demonstrated efficacy in both methods, no significant difference&#xD;
      estastistica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new method developed for use in upper gastrointestinal bleeding and that proved to be safe&#xD;
      and effective in clinical trials already done is dust adsorption (Hemospray 速). This new&#xD;
      technology consists of a syringe containing the Hemospray 速 powder, inorganic property&#xD;
      comprises a group of minerals, highly adsorptive when in contact with blood, it becomes a&#xD;
      cohesive powder and form a stable mechanical cap that covers the bleeding site. The powder is&#xD;
      sprayed by means of a catheter connected to a container of carbon dioxide. The catheter tip&#xD;
      should be positioned 1-2 cm from the site of bleeding and then short bursts of 1 to 2 seconds&#xD;
      should be fired to stop the bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in animals showed no absorption in the GIT and elimination within 48 hours of&#xD;
      application, and no reported cases of obstruction. Recently, a prospective study involving 20&#xD;
      patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, showed that the application of hemospray 速&#xD;
      promoted hemostasis in 95% of cases, confirmed by endoscopic revision 72h after application&#xD;
      without any complication.&#xD;
