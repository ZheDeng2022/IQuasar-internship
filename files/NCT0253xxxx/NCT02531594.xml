  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the efficacy of a cessation intervention for caregivers in a large,&#xD;
      inner-city Pediatric Emergency Department. The investigators will randomize 750 caregivers&#xD;
      who smoke who present to our Pediatric Emergency Department with their child who has a Second&#xD;
      Hand Smoke exposure-related illness to either one of two conditions: 1) Screening, Brief&#xD;
      Intervention, and Assisted Referral to Treatment (SBIRT); or 2) Healthy Habits Control (HHC).&#xD;
      The Screening, Brief Intervention, and Assisted Referral to Treatment condition will include&#xD;
      a brief form of the Clinical Practice Guideline: Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence,&#xD;
      motivational interviewing, engaging and personalized materials on the effects of smoking and&#xD;
      Second Hand Smoke exposure, immediate access to caregivers' choice of cessation resources&#xD;
      (e.g., Quitline, smokefree.gov, or txt2quit), a 12-week supply of nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy and weekly booster materials for 12 weeks. The Healthy Habits Control program will be&#xD;
      used as an attention control in which caregivers will receive instruction on healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle choices to improve the child's health.&#xD;

      This study will test the efficacy of a cessation intervention for caregivers in a large,&#xD;
      inner-city Pediatric Emergency Department. The proposed Screening, Brief Intervention, and&#xD;
      Assisted Referral to Treatment will highlight the effects of Second Hand Smoke exposure on&#xD;
      the child's health. the investigators will randomize 750 caregivers who smoke who present to&#xD;
      our Pediatric Emergency Department with their child who has a Second Hand Smoke exposure&#xD;
      related illness to either one of two conditions: 1) Screening, Brief Intervention, and&#xD;
      Assisted Referral to Treatment; or 2) Healthy Habits Control. The Screening, Brief&#xD;
      Intervention, and Assisted Referral to Treatment condition will use components shown to be&#xD;
      effective in the out-patient setting but not yet tested in the Pediatric Emergency Department&#xD;
      setting. It will include a brief form of the Clinical Practice Guideline: Treating Tobacco&#xD;
      Use and Dependence, motivational interviewing, engaging and personalized materials on the&#xD;
      effects of smoking and Second Hand Smoke exposure, immediate access to caregivers' choice of&#xD;
      cessation resources (e.g., Quitline, smokefree.gov, or txt2quit), a 12-week supply of&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy and weekly booster materials for 12 weeks. The Healthy Habits&#xD;
      Control program has been previously developed and used in the out-patient setting, and will&#xD;
      be used as an attention control in which caregivers will receive instruction on healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle choices to improve their child's health. Cessation assistance will be offered at&#xD;
      the study's conclusion. If effective, the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Assisted&#xD;
      Referral to Treatment model could be routinely used in the Pediatric Emergency Department&#xD;
      setting, which could reach at least one million smokers a year, and could result in&#xD;
      significant reductions in caregivers' tobacco use, Second Hand Smoke exposure related&#xD;
      pediatric illness, and costs in this population. In addition, the investigators' results will&#xD;
      inform the conduct of public health research efforts aimed at adults via the Pediatric&#xD;
      Emergency Department.&#xD;
