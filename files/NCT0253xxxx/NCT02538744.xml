      The investigators will assess the impact of treatment with doxazosin and modafinil, alone and&#xD;
      in combination, on the subjective and reinforcing effects of cocaine in&#xD;
      non-treatment-seeking, cocaine-dependent volunteers. The investigators will use a hybrid&#xD;
      design in which participants will be randomized into two groups: placebo and doxazosin 8&#xD;
      mg/d. They will remain in their assigned group for the duration of the study. After titrating&#xD;
      doxazosin to the target dose, study procedures will be completed three times, once during&#xD;
      treatment with each dose of modafinil (0, 200, and 300 mg/d), in pseudo-random order such&#xD;
      that 200 mg precedes 300 mg).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a screening session participants will provide buccal swab for genetics testing, as&#xD;
      preliminary data shows that effects of cocaine and of doxazosin are impacted significantly by&#xD;
      the genotype at ADRA1A, in that those with the CC genotype respond robustly to both cocaine&#xD;
      and doxazosin whereas those with the CT genotype do not. Participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      regardless of genotype, though the investigators plan to retrospectively exclude those with&#xD;
      the rare TT genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During screening, the investigators will collect participants' demographic and medical&#xD;
      histories, conduct a physical exam, and record an ECG. A trained assistant will administer&#xD;
      the MINI to collect diagnostic data. The investigators will draw blood and for CBC and a&#xD;
      comprehensive metabolic panel including electrolytes, liver function tests (total bilirubin,&#xD;
      ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) and renal function tests (creatinine and BUN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All applicants for study participation will receive counseling as part of their&#xD;
      participation, and will be advised that treatment for drug abuse is indicated and available.&#xD;
      Applicants not participating in the study will receive treatment referral information as&#xD;
      appropriate. At completion of their participation, study subjects will again be advised that&#xD;
      treatment is indicated and available, and will be given treatment referral information and&#xD;
      assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Procedures Participants will report to the research commons three-times-weekly during&#xD;
      the 11 day doxazosin titration period. They will be allowed to miss up to 3 visits but will&#xD;
      be discontinued if they miss more that 3 visits. At the initial screening visit, restrictions&#xD;
      on use of alcohol, drugs of abuse, and medications will be reviewed. All subjects will be&#xD;
      required to sign a written statement that they will abstain from all psychostimulants&#xD;
      throughout the duration of their participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determining that volunteers meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants will&#xD;
      receive screening doses of cocaine (0, 20, 40 mg, IV, constrained such that 20 mg precedes 40&#xD;
      mg). To be retained in the study participants must report a change in ratings of &quot;high&quot; of at&#xD;
      least 20 points from before to following the 40 mg dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remaining participants will be randomized into the two treatment groups (placebo and&#xD;
      doxazosin 8 mg/d). Doxazosin will be titrated to the target dose over 11 days to minimize&#xD;
      side-effects. Participants will complete the doxazosin titration phase of the study as&#xD;
      outpatients because doxazosin alone is known to be safe when combined with cocaine.&#xD;
      Participants will report to research commons every 4 days. The titration schedule is attached&#xD;
      in Table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use standard riboflavin labeling to monitor treatment adherence&#xD;
      throughout the study. Riboflavin (25mg) will be encapsulated with the study medication and&#xD;
      adherence will be monitored by measuring riboflavin in urine using quantitative fluorescence&#xD;
      39,40. Because riboflavin is contained in many vitamin preparations, positive riboflavin&#xD;
      tests may not truly reflect adherence to study medication treatment. To confirm adherence,&#xD;
      the investigators will add 15 mg acetazolamide (ACZ) to the doxazosin capsules. ACZ will be&#xD;
      included in doxazosin study medication from the beginning of the study until day 6 when&#xD;
      capsules not containing ACZ will be substituted. The team will continue monitoring urine for&#xD;
      several days after day 6 to characterize how long it takes for ACZ to become undetectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must test cocaine negative on day 1 or they will be discontinued from the study,&#xD;
      though they may reenter later if the investigators agree. After dose titration investigators&#xD;
      will initiate treatment with the target doses of study medications. As shown below in Table 3&#xD;
      (attached), participants remain in their original doxazosin treatment group for the duration&#xD;
      of the study (the two groups are listed to emphasize this point). Participants will complete&#xD;
      non-contingent cocaine dosing and cocaine self-administration procedures three times, once&#xD;
      during treatment with each dose of modafinil. Non-contingent dosing and self-administration&#xD;
      will be done on the same day, with non-contingent dosing occuring in the am and&#xD;
      self-administration in the pm. One treatment order is illustrated (0, 200, 300 mg/d), but in&#xD;
      practice the order in which participants receive the three modafinil doses (placebo, 200&#xD;
      mg/d, and 300 mg/d) will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed as outpatients for most of the study. They report to the clinic&#xD;
      about every 4 days as shown in Table 3 for observed dosing and urine testing for adherence&#xD;
      monitoring. Participants must test cocaine-negative on days 1, 4, 9, and 14 to remain in the&#xD;
      study. This is so that participants are not enrolled in the study or admitted to research&#xD;
      commons with unknown amounts of cocaine in their bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take three capsules daily at 7:00 am. The capsules will contain placebo,&#xD;
      doxazosin 8 mg, or modafinil 200 or 300 mg, depending on their randomization group and&#xD;
      modafinil dose. On the 4th day of study medication treatment they will be admitted to&#xD;
      research commons to ensure that procedures the following day occur under fairly standard&#xD;
      conditions. On the 5th day of study medication treatment they will receive non-contingent&#xD;
      doses of cocaine and participate in cocaine self-administration sessions. After completing&#xD;
      these study activities, modafinil will be discontinued and there will be a modafinil wash-out&#xD;
      period of 4 days during which time they will continue to take their assigned dose of&#xD;
      doxazosin. They will then complete the study procedures during treatment with their next&#xD;
      assigned modafinil dose. This will be repeated until participants have completed the study&#xD;
      three times, once at each modafinil dose. As noted above, participants remain in their&#xD;
      original doxazosin treatment group and participants continue to receive their assigned&#xD;
      doxazosin dose throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily activities for the non-contingent cocaine dosing days are shown in Table 4 and daily&#xD;
      activities for the cocaine self-administration days are shown in Table 5 (see section S for&#xD;
      all tables). Non-contingent doses of cocaine (placebo, 20, 40 mg, IV) will be administered at&#xD;
      hourly intervals in random order. The following day there will be two self-administration&#xD;
      sessions. In one session doses placebo saline will be available and in another session doses&#xD;
      of 20 mg cocaine will be available with the order counterbalanced across participants. At the&#xD;
      beginning of each session participants will receive a sample of the drug available in that&#xD;
      session, saline or cocaine. The will then make a series of 10 choices between receiving the&#xD;
      drug available in that session and monetary alternatives of increasing value. The value of&#xD;
      the money choices will increase over the 10 choices: $.05, $.05, $.05, $.05, $1, $4, $7, $10,&#xD;
      $13, $16. Choices will occur at 15 min intervals. The investigators have previously found&#xD;
      that this arrangement produces choice behavior that reflects the magnitude of reinforcing&#xD;
      effects and that is sensitive to pharmacologic manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Withholding Cocaine Cocaine will not be administered if there are behavioral&#xD;
      manifestations of cocaine toxicity (agitation, psychosis, inability to cooperate with study&#xD;
      procedures), though this has not been observed with the small doses of cocaine administered&#xD;
      in human laboratory studies. To ensure that subjects will not be at risk from cocaine, the&#xD;
      resting pulse must be less than 90 bpm and the blood pressure must be less than 150 mmHg&#xD;
      systolic and less than 90 mmHg diastolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Participant Discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Positive urine drug screen or breath test indicating illicit use of abused drugs not&#xD;
           delivered as part of this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inability to comply with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Have exaggerated response to cocaine (5 min or more of systolic BP greater than 180&#xD;
           mmHg, diastolic BP greater than 120 mmHg, or heart rate greater than [(220 - age) ×&#xD;
           0.85] bpm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cocaine Administration and Medical Monitoring Participants will remain seated during&#xD;
      experimental sessions except for brief visits to the lavatory. An IV will be placed for&#xD;
      cocaine dosing. On days involving non-contingent cocaine dosing, after first confirming that&#xD;
      vital signs are within allowed limits, the physician will administer solution by slow IV&#xD;
      push. An ACLS-certified physician will be present from 15 min before drug administration&#xD;
      until at least 1 hour after drug administration. The physician will be available in house and&#xD;
      on pager for at least 4 hours after drug administration. Heart rate will be measured using&#xD;
      continuous ECG from 15 min prior to cocaine or placebo dosing until 1 hour after dosing.&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be assessed at frequent intervals from 15 min prior to cocaine or placebo&#xD;
      dosing assessment for 1 hour after dosing or until baseline levels reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days involving choice sessions, an IV will be placed and patient-controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (PCA) pump will be loaded with saline or 20mg cocaine doses depending on the session.&#xD;
      Participants will receive one non-contingent sample dose of the drug available that session.&#xD;
      Participants will then have 10 opportunities to choose between receiving repeated doses of&#xD;
      the drug available that session (which will be the same as the sample dose) or receiving&#xD;
      monetary alternatives of increasing value ($.05, $.05, $.05, $.05, $1, $4, $7, $10, $13,&#xD;
      $16). Choices will begin 15 min after the sample dose and subsequent choices will be&#xD;
      available at 15 min intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cocaine dosing will be delayed if necessary due to elevated cardiovascular indices based on&#xD;
      the stopping criteria above. Investigators selected the 15 min inter-dose interval for use in&#xD;
      the self-administration sessions based on published data showing that this arrangement is&#xD;
      safe and yields interpretable data 44. Heart rate will be monitored continuously and blood&#xD;
      pressure will be measured prior to dosing at 15 min intervals until 45 min after the final&#xD;
      cocaine dose. The physician will halt cocaine administration if stopping criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments Substance Use Inventory (SUI). This instrument collects data on the type,&#xD;
      frequency, and amounts of drugs used, as well as routes of administration. Participants will&#xD;
      complete this measure during screening before each of the inpatient episodes. DSM-IV&#xD;
      Diagnosis. The MINI will be administered during the initial screening and serves to determine&#xD;
      whether the participant meets the DSM-IV criteria for drug dependence and to rule out any&#xD;
      major psychiatric disorders (e.g., affective disorders, schizophrenia). Data from the SUI can&#xD;
      be used to augment the ability of the MINI to determine if participants meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). The BDI-II is the third-generation BDI,&#xD;
      revised in 1996, and based on the original. The instrument retains its original 21-item&#xD;
      questionnaire format that requires approximately 10 min to complete. This indicator is used&#xD;
      in the trials to monitor participants' mood during the study, making it also a measure for&#xD;
      participants' safety. Participants will complete this measure during screening and daily&#xD;
      during inpatient episodes. Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Subjective effects produced by&#xD;
      cocaine or placebo will be measured using a VAS consisting of a continuous 10-cm line marked&#xD;
      from 0 to 100. Participants will be required to rate their drug craving, dysphoria, and&#xD;
      euphoria on a scale from 0 to 100. Ratings include &quot;High,&quot; &quot;Good Effects,&quot; &quot;Bad Effects,&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;Like Drug,&quot; &quot;Dislike Drug,&quot; &quot;Crave Cocaine,&quot; &quot;Likely to Use Cocaine if Available&quot;, and&#xD;
      &quot;Desire Cocaine.&quot;&#xD;
