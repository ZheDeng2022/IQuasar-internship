      The goal of this proposed research is to assess the preliminary efficacy of dietary&#xD;
      interventions that change dietary fats in improving clinical outcomes related to lumbar&#xD;
      radicular pain. After a two-week baseline, consented participants are randomized to one of&#xD;
      two diets. Key foods consistent with the diet are provided for 12 weeks along with extensive&#xD;
      dietary counseling and support from the study-provided materials. Participants are encouraged&#xD;
      to follow the assigned diet for another 6 weeks without provision of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete questionnaires at baseline, randomization, and after 6 weeks, 12 weeks,&#xD;
      and 18 weeks on the diet. They provide blood samples at randomization (2 weeks) and after 12&#xD;
      and 18 weeks on the diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar radiculopathy is a fairly common pain syndrome which may result in chronic, severe&#xD;
      disability. There are few successful treatment options for patients with persistent&#xD;
      lumbosacral radicular pain (LRP) that does not respond to conventional approaches. A&#xD;
      fundamental biologic mechanism of chronic LRP, as well as other chronic pain syndromes, may&#xD;
      involve failure of inflammation-resolution, an active process driven by lipid mediators&#xD;
      derived from fatty acids (resolvins, protectins, maresins). The investigators' preliminary&#xD;
      studies indicate that dietary modifications, specifically increasing some dietary fatty&#xD;
      acids, while reducing others, result in large, statistically significant and clinically&#xD;
      relevant improvement in headache frequency, intensity, and other clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      community dwelling persons with chronic headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial represents a promising approach to treatment of a disabling condition,&#xD;
      lumbar radiculopathy. The previous headache trial by the investigators' interdisciplinary&#xD;
      UNC/NIH team demonstrated that specific dietary manipulations can produce marked biochemical&#xD;
      changes and have a major positive clinical impact. This project promises to enhance the&#xD;
      generalizability of the investigators' approach by expanding from chronic headaches to&#xD;
      another common chronic pain condition, and also by using a more cost-effective intervention.&#xD;
      Because dietary modification is a relatively safe and low-cost health-improvement strategy,&#xD;
      the long-term outcome of this research may be to empower individuals to take a more active&#xD;
      role in their own health through dietary changes that reduce dependence on medical&#xD;
      treatments, while providing significant clinical benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Phase. Medical records will be obtained for the participant's history and physical&#xD;
      examination (performed by referring physician at the Spine Center). The baseline visit will&#xD;
      consist of review of inclusion/exclusion criteria and the components of the study prior to&#xD;
      consenting. Those who wish to sign the consents will complete baseline assessment instruments&#xD;
      that measure lumbosacral radiculopathy characteristics and their impact on quality-of-life.&#xD;
      Through electronic diaries, participants will provide daily data on pain intensity, duration,&#xD;
      function, sleep quality, and medication use over a 2-week baseline phase. Participants who&#xD;
      are compliant with all aspects of data collection, and who experience daily radicular pain,&#xD;
      will be eligible for study intervention participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. At the end of the 2-week baseline phase, participants who qualify will be&#xD;
      randomized (computer-generated variable permuted block) to: 1) the High n-3, Low n-6 Diet&#xD;
      (Analgesic Diet); or 2) the Control Diet. Blood will be collected for baseline biomarker&#xD;
      assessment prior to beginning study diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Randomization. After randomization, participants will attend an initial, in-depth&#xD;
      dietary counseling session administered by the registered dietitian. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to provide a dietary history and will receive detailed instruction in the specific&#xD;
      dietary intervention per group assignment. Participants in each group will attend a total of&#xD;
      3 in-person follow-up sessions with the dietitian, for review of their dietary experiences,&#xD;
      to receive encouragement, to clarify issues, and to have questions answered. At each visit,&#xD;
      the dietitian will obtain a dietary history and assessment, provide tailored counseling, and&#xD;
      record data for evaluation of participant variability in order to guide future sessions.&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit with the dietitian at randomization, two weeks later, 4 weeks&#xD;
      after that, and 6 weeks after that (at the end of the intervention). In addition, individuals&#xD;
      will participate in brief (15-20 minute) check-in telephone calls with the dietitian every&#xD;
      2-3 weeks. Participants will have contact with the research assistant twice weekly to&#xD;
      encourage diary completion and to invite adverse event reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 12-week intervention phase (weeks 2-14), participants will be provided with&#xD;
      essential foods to enable them to follow diet recommendations, including study oils, salad&#xD;
      dressings, and unprepared protein sources (meat, beans, fish). For the remainder of their&#xD;
      meals, participants will choose food products consistent with their assigned diet. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the post-intervention phase (Week 20, Diet week 18), participants will complete&#xD;
      on-line questionnaires and provide blood samples. The purpose of this post-intervention phase&#xD;
      is: 1) to obtain pilot data on the ability of participants to continue to achieve nutrient&#xD;
      intake targets without counseling and food provision; and 2) to obtain pilot data on the&#xD;
      post-intervention trajectory of biochemical and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the 12-week active intervention and the 6-week post-intervention phases,&#xD;
      participants will have access to detailed intervention materials. Diet education materials&#xD;
      include the diet guidelines, allowed food list, how to read food labels, grocery shopping&#xD;
      guides for 9 local grocery stores, dining out guide, 7-day meal plan and 75 recipes with the&#xD;
      ability for the dietitian to add more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food Supply. Participants will visit the dietitian 3 times during the 12-week active&#xD;
      intervention to obtain specific food items with targeted nutrient compositions. Food items&#xD;
      will include: cooking oils, salad dressings, mayonnaise, portable dressing packets,&#xD;
      unprepared frozen food items, and key ingredients for home preparation of meals and snacks.&#xD;
      All foods have been specifically selected to ensure that participants meet specific nutrient&#xD;
      intake targets. Prior nutrient analyses of more than 80 relevant food items was performed as&#xD;
      part of the investigators' previous dietary intervention study in participants with chronic&#xD;
      daily headache, by the National Institutes of Health-National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and&#xD;
      Alcoholism Section of Nutritional Neurosciences (SNN). The SNN has agreed to provide further&#xD;
      nutrient analysis as needed for the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments. Throughout the 2-week baseline, the 12-week active intervention, and 6-week&#xD;
      post-intervention phases, all participants will record pain intensity, pain interference,&#xD;
      medication use, activity, and stress using a daily pain diary accessed by mobile device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected during three visits at the end of the baseline phase (Week 2,&#xD;
      Diet week 0) and then at study Weeks 14 and 20 (at the end of the active intervention and at&#xD;
      the end of the post-intervention period) for nutritional and metabolic biomarker measurement.&#xD;
      At each sample collection visit (and after 6 weeks on the diet), participants will also&#xD;
      complete the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and NIH PROMIS-29 battery (physical function,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, satisfaction with social role, pain&#xD;
      interference, pain intensity). Every 6 weeks, participants will also be asked about their use&#xD;
      of other modalities for pain control, including physical therapy, spinal manipulation,&#xD;
      epidural corticosteroid injections, acupuncture, and yoga.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions. All participants will receive: 1) tailored dietitian-administered counseling&#xD;
      consistent with the group assignment; 2) access to intervention-specific informational&#xD;
      materials and daily outcome assessments; and 3) critical food items with precisely quantified&#xD;
      fatty acid composition, selected to meet nutrient intake targets specific for each of the&#xD;
      assignment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random Allocation. At the first intervention visit, At Week 2, the research dietitian will&#xD;
      enter the participant's assigned ID into an online computer program that will determine&#xD;
      assignment to one of the two diets. Using a random number sequence to generate a permuted&#xD;
      block of 2-4, the program ensures equal numbers of participants in each arm. The program&#xD;
      documents treatment assignment in an un-editable form including a date stamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking. The research staff, masked to treatment assignment, will schedule all study-related&#xD;
      visits in the Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) or other appropriate site in&#xD;
      the University of North Carolina (UNC) Healthcare system or medical school. Only the&#xD;
      dietitian will, of necessity, be unmasked. All investigators and laboratory personnel will be&#xD;
      masked to dietary assignment. Masking will be maintained in the random allocation procedure.&#xD;
      The research dietitian will not indicate to participants which diets are considered to be&#xD;
      treatment diets vs. the control diet.&#xD;
