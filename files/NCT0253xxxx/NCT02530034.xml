      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-PR1/HLA-A2 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody Hu8F4 (Hu8F4) in treating patients with malignancies related to the blood&#xD;
      (hematologic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as Hu8F4, may interfere with the ability of cancer&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and minimum safe and biologically-effective&#xD;
      dose of Hu8F4 when administered intravenously in patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Hu8F4 following study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe the anti-leukemia effects of Hu8F4 in patients with leukemias and MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the overall survival, disease-free survival and event-free survival of&#xD;
      patients with leukemias or MDS treated with Hu8F4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anti-PR1/HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody Hu8F4 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
