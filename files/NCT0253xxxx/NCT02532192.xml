    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of belinostat&#xD;
      that can be combined with standard chemotherapy drugs (rituximab, cisplatin, cytarabine, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone) in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are eligible for an&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant (a transplant of the patient's own stem cells). The safety of&#xD;
      the study drug will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a&#xD;
      dose level of belinostat based on when they join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of&#xD;
      belinostat will be tested. Between 3-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The&#xD;
      first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will&#xD;
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of belinostat is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of the standard chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive belinostat with standard chemotherapy for up to two 21-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive belinostat by vein on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. The infusions will&#xD;
      last 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive rituximab and cisplatin by vein on Day 2 of each cycle. Participant&#xD;
      will receive cytarabine by vein on Day 2 or 3 of each cycle, depending on when they join this&#xD;
      study. Rituximab will be given over 4-5 hours, cisplatin will be given over 3-4 hours, and&#xD;
      cytarabine will be given over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take dexamethasone once a day by mouth on Days 2-5 of both study cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 5 tablespoons) and bone marrow will be collected about 10 business days&#xD;
      (Monday-Friday) before participant begins receiving belinostat. The blood and bone marrow&#xD;
      will be used for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) testing. This testing is designed&#xD;
      to learn if participant will respond to treatment. To collect a bone marrow biopsy, an area&#xD;
      of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is&#xD;
      withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will also receive filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, SMX, valacyclovir, ciprofloxacin and&#xD;
      fluconazole to reduce side effects. Participant's study doctor will discuss with them when&#xD;
      and how they will take these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant's doctor thinks it is necessary, they will also have a bone marrow biopsy and&#xD;
      aspirate performed to check the status of the disease within 4 weeks before they begin&#xD;
      receiving belinostat. To collect a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, an area of the hip or other&#xD;
      site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn&#xD;
      through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 5 working/business days before the start of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4-6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time a week after the completion of therapy during each cycle, blood (about 4-6&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn on Days 1,2, 3, and 21 (+/- 72 hours) of Cycles 1&#xD;
      and 2 for PBMC testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may continue taking belinostat combined with chemotherapy for up to 3 cycles.&#xD;
      Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 weeks after the start of the last cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4-6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and PBMC testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant's doctor thinks it is necessary, they may have a bone marrow biopsy and&#xD;
           aspirate to check the status of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant's doctor thinks it is necessary, they may have a core needle biopsy to&#xD;
           check the status of the disease. To perform a core biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed&#xD;
           using a hollow core needle that has a cutting edge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Belinostat is FDA approved to treat T-cell lymphoma. Its&#xD;
      use in this study is investigational. The standard chemotherapy drugs are commercially&#xD;
      available and FDA approved to treat DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
