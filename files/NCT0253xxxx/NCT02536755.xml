      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate long term skeletal response to eliglustat in adult patients who successfully&#xD;
      completed one of the Phase 2 or Phase 3 eliglustat studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the safety of eliglustat (by [serious] adverse event [AE] continuous monitoring),&#xD;
      the quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey [SF-36]) and biomarkers of Gaucher disease&#xD;
      type 1 (GD1) (chitotriosidase, plasma glucosylceramide [GL-1] and lyso glucosylceramide&#xD;
      [lyso-GL-1]) in adult patients who successfully completed one of the Phase 2 or Phase 3&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

      Study duration will be of minimum 2 years and up to 4 years. If after 4 years since the&#xD;
      beginning of the study eliglustat is not approved and available to patients in participating&#xD;
      country, patients in this country may continue to receive study treatment until eliglustat is&#xD;
      available to patients through the compassionate use (expanded access) program or is approved&#xD;
      and available through reimbursement, whichever comes first.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have successfully completed the Phase 2 (GZGD00304) or a Phase 3&#xD;
             study (GZGD02507, GZGD02607 or GZGD03109). Successful completion is defined as&#xD;
             patients enrolled in one of the above mentioned studies who received eliglustat&#xD;
             through the end of the study and completed the end-of-study visit without having&#xD;
             discontinued or been withdrawn prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is willing and able to provide signed informed consent prior to any&#xD;
             protocol-required procedures being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test prior to enrollment and while they are receiving eliglustat treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to practice true abstinence&#xD;
             in line with their preferred and usual lifestyle, or use a medically accepted form of&#xD;
             contraception (either a barrier method, such as condom or diaphragm + spermicide, or a&#xD;
             non-barrier method such as oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods, or an&#xD;
             intra-uterine device or system ) while receiving eliglustat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

             days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received miglustat within the 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has documented prior esophageal varices or liver infarction or current&#xD;
             liver enzymes (alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase) or total bilirubin &gt;2&#xD;

             Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has any clinically significant disease, other than Gaucher disease,&#xD;
             including cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic,&#xD;
             endocrine, metabolic (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), or psychiatric disease, other&#xD;
             medical conditions, or serious intercurrent illnesses that may preclude participation&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is known to have any of the following: cardiac disease (congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, heart block, ventricular&#xD;
             arrhythmia), long QT syndrome, or current treatment with Class IA or Class III&#xD;
             antiarrhythmic medicinal products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody,&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody, or hepatitis B surface antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a history of cancer within 6 months of enrolment, with the exception&#xD;
             of basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a CYP2D6 intermediate (IMs), extensive (EMs) or ultra-rapid (URM)&#xD;
             metabolizer and is taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a&#xD;
             strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a CYP2D6 poor metaboliser (PM) having taken a strong CYP3A inhibitor within&#xD;
             2 weeks prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a female patient of childbearing potential has a positive pregnancy test (blood&#xD;
             β-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin [β-HCG]) or is breast feeding prior to first dosing of&#xD;
             eliglustat in this study, the patient cannot enroll in the study at this time, but may&#xD;
             be rescreened after the end of the pregnancy, and/or when she is no longer breast&#xD;
             feeding, provided rescreening takes place before the end of the enrollment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to be tested for&#xD;
             pregnancy.&#xD;
