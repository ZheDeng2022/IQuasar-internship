  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events.&#xD;
      Importantly, DM is a key risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD),&#xD;
      which further enhances atherothrombotic risk. Clopidogrel is the most widely used platelet&#xD;
      P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. However, despite its clinical benefit, patients with DM and CKD&#xD;
      frequently experience recurrent atherothrombotic events. Ticagrelor is an oral, reversible,&#xD;
      non-competitive P2Y12 receptor inhibitor with more potent and consistent platelet inhibition&#xD;
      than clopidogrel. In large-scale clinical investigation, ticagrelor significantly reduced&#xD;
      ischemic events to a greater extent than clopidogrel, a finding that was consistent also&#xD;
      among DM patients. To date there has been no analysis on the efficacy of ticagrelor in DM&#xD;
      patients according to CKD status. Moreover, although PD studies showed enhanced platelet&#xD;
      inhibition associated with ticagrelor, it is unknown how this may be affected by CKD status.&#xD;
      Ultimately, how PK/PD profiles of different ticagrelor dosing regimens may be affected by DM&#xD;
      and CKD status is also unknown. The proposed study is aimed to show the impact of CKD status&#xD;
      among patients with DM and CAD on PD and PK profiles of ticagrelor used at 2 doses (90mg bid&#xD;
      and 60mg bid) in the setting of a prospective, randomized, cross-over trial.&#xD;

      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events.&#xD;
      Importantly, DM is a key risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD),&#xD;
      which further enhances atherothrombotic risk. These observations underscore the importance of&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy for prevention of atherothrombotic recurrences in these high-risk&#xD;
      patients. Clopidogrel is the most widely used platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. However,&#xD;
      despite its clinical benefit, patients with DM and CKD frequently experience recurrent&#xD;
      atherothrombotic events. This may be in part due to the impaired pharmacokinetic (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of clopidogrel in patients with DM and CKD. Since both DM and&#xD;
      CKD represent pandemic public health problems, the prevalence of which will double over the&#xD;
      next 20 years, identifying antiplatelet agents with more favorable PK/PD profiles is of key&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ticagrelor is an oral, reversible, non-competitive P2Y12 receptor inhibitor with more potent&#xD;
      and consistent platelet inhibition than clopidogrel. In large-scale clinical investigation,&#xD;
      ticagrelor significantly reduced ischemic events to a greater extent than clopidogrel, a&#xD;
      finding that was consistent also among DM patients. In patients with CKD, ticagrelor led to&#xD;
      an even greater relative risk reduction of ischemic events, including cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality, compared to patients without CKD. However, to date there has been no analysis on&#xD;
      the efficacy of ticagrelor in DM patients according to CKD status. Moreover, although PD&#xD;
      studies showed enhanced platelet inhibition associated with ticagrelor, it is unknown how&#xD;
      this may be affected by CKD status. Ultimately, how PK/PD profiles of different ticagrelor&#xD;
      dosing regimens may be affected by DM and CKD status is also unknown. The proposed study is&#xD;
      aimed to show the impact of CKD status among patients with DM and CAD on PD and PK profiles&#xD;
      of ticagrelor used at 2 doses (90mg bid and 60mg bid) in the setting of a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, cross-over trial.&#xD;
