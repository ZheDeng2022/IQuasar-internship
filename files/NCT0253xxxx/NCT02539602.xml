      This trial evaluated the impact of N2K, a three-year quasi-experimental study to delay sexual&#xD;
      initiation and increase condom and contraception use among high school students. The program&#xD;
      was administered to treatment students beginning in the fall of 2012 (9th grade) and&#xD;
      continued through the spring of 2015 (11th grade). The purpose of this study was to measure:&#xD;
      1) the impact of N2K on sexual initiation at the end of the three-year program and 2) the&#xD;
      impact of N2K on condom or contraception non-use at the end of the program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Need to Know is based on a framework of positive youth development intended to delay sexual&#xD;
      initiation and reduce the rate of teenage pregnancy. The N2K curriculum is designed to&#xD;
      support the treatment participants throughout their high school career with consecutive&#xD;
      dosage for three years from 9th through 11th grade. The intended dosage for treatment&#xD;
      participants is 16 lessons (25 minutes each) each year of the program (8 in the fall and 8 in&#xD;
      the spring). The program consists of 3 years (48 lessons) of curriculum to be delivered in a&#xD;
      group or classroom setting of up to 32 students. There are 16 lessons in each year of the&#xD;
      curriculum. Eight lessons are intended to be taught in the fall semester and eight in the&#xD;
      spring. Each lesson is 25 minutes long, and can be taught in any class period that allows for&#xD;
      25 minutes of content instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 9th grade course is N2K: Basics and consists of lessons that encourage self-discovery and&#xD;
      goal setting, discuss human growth and development, adolescent risk behaviors, communication,&#xD;
      STDs, abstinence, contraceptives, teen dating violence, legal issues, responsible media use,&#xD;
      refusal skills, and role-playing. The 10th grade N2K: Decisions consists of lessons that&#xD;
      increase decision making skills, clarify values, promote healthy relationships and the&#xD;
      benefits of delaying sex, and review of anatomy, contraceptives, STDs, and legal issues. It&#xD;
      promotes the development of critical thinking skills and application of the facts to real&#xD;
      life situations. N2K: Decisions includes an original webisode series of 11 episodes, the&#xD;
      first of which is viewed in class, and the others can be viewed online outside of class. The&#xD;
      webisode series adds narrative to the basic facts being presented in class. The series runs,&#xD;
      in conjunction with the 10th grade curriculum lessons 3-8. The 11th grade N2K: Relationships&#xD;
      reinforces basic themes taught in prior years. It emphasizes healthy relationships, healthy&#xD;
      living, and taking responsibility for personal health as an adolescent matures into adult&#xD;
      life. The last three lessons are a culminating activity that allows participants to express&#xD;
      what they have learned and present it to others. About 35% of the 48 sessions focuses on&#xD;
      abstinence, 27% highlight positive youth development (PYD), 13% discuss risky behaviors, 12%&#xD;
      address STDs, 8% cover contraceptives, and 5% discuss anatomy and puberty in the cumulative&#xD;
      three years of the N2K Curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paper and pencil survey was administered in school to assess program impacts. Treatment and&#xD;
      comparison students were surveyed at baseline (fall 2011 for comparison and fall 2012 for&#xD;
      treatment), and for the treatment group, surveying took place before the intervention began.&#xD;
      Surveys were administered at the end of each year of programming (end of 9th grade, end of&#xD;
      10th grade, and end of 11th grade), which for the treatment students was after the N2K&#xD;
      programming was completed for the year.&#xD;
