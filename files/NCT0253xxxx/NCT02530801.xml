  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium is a common eye disease. Its mechanism remains unknown but studies suggest that it&#xD;
      is related to exposure to ultraviolet rays and ocular dryness. Pterygium affects vision by&#xD;
      causing astigmatism and may encroach on cornea (transparent part of the eye) affecting&#xD;
      vision. It could cause ocular irritation and can be cosmetically unacceptable especially when&#xD;
      inflamed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence is the most common outcome of pterygium excision. Recurrence rates of pterygium&#xD;
      vary from 10 to more than 80%. Recurrence can be detected first in the conjunctiva(skin of&#xD;
      your eye), before advancing on to the cornea. Treating the recurrent pterygium before the&#xD;
      cornea gets involved avoids repeat surgery, which is difficult and is associated with more&#xD;
      scarring. To avoid repeated surgeries, the activity of a recurrent pterygium should be&#xD;
      stopped before it progresses to true recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies attributed the recurrence pf pterygium to the increase of substances as&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor. Avastin (Anti-VEGF)&#xD;
      and 5 fluorouracil(5FU) (antimetabolite) are medications that suppress the formation of VEGF&#xD;
      and fibroblast growth factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the subconjunctival injection of 5 F and Avastin into the recurring&#xD;
      pterygium has been both safe and effective in treatment of recurrent pterygium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many cases, vascularization and inflammation were controlled by subconjunctival Avastin,&#xD;
      providing evidence for a role of VEGF in pterygium formation. 5FU is widely used in&#xD;
      ophthalmology because of its anti-scarring properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other option for treatment of recurrent pterygium is surgery. Recurrent pterygium is a&#xD;
      challenging condition that usually resists conventional surgery and its rate of recurrence&#xD;
      after surgery is high. Moreover, recurrent pterygium surgery is usually accompanied by&#xD;
      scarring, more risk of intra and post- complications This study aims to generate data to&#xD;
      inform further studies towards establishing Avastin and 5 fluouracil as treatment modality&#xD;
      for recurrent pterygium.&#xD;

      Purpose To assess the efficacy of combined 5FU and Avastin injections in the treatment of&#xD;
      recurrent pterygium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Pilot study. The patients will receive combined 5FU and Avastin injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Patients for inclusion in the study will be identified in the specialist corneal&#xD;
      clinics at Queens Medical Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 FU injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose: 0.15 ml of 5FU (3.75mg) will be administered into the body of the recurring pterygium&#xD;
      up to 5 injections as determined by response. The 5FU solution is prepared locally in the&#xD;
      pharmacy for ophthalmic use. It will be delivered preloaded in a 1ml syringe containing 0.3&#xD;
      ml of 2.5mg 5FU per 0.1ml. The injection will be given under topical anaesthesia. One to two&#xD;
      drops of 5% povidone iodine will be instilled in the conjunctival sac 5min before the&#xD;
      injection. All injections will be given in the outpatient clinic using a slit lamp. The&#xD;
      needle (27Gauge) will be advanced in a zigzag manner into the subconjunctival space, avoiding&#xD;
      any large blood vessels, until the middle of the lesion is reached. The solution will be then&#xD;
      injected and the needle withdrawn. After the injection, 1-2 drops of chloramphenicol 0.5%&#xD;
      preservative free minims will be instilled topically and continued four times a day for 3&#xD;
      days after each injection. Injections will be carried out every two weeks as described above.&#xD;
      Patients will have the ability to access the 24 hour on call emergency eye service, and at&#xD;
      the same time be provided with contact numbers for investigators for any queries during the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avastin injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose: 0.15 ml of Avastin (2.5 mg/0.1 ml) will be administered in the body of the recurrent&#xD;
      lesion. Up to 5 injections could be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection will be given under topical anaesthesia. One to two drops of 5% povidone iodine&#xD;
      will be instilled in the conjunctival sac 5min before the injection. All injections will be&#xD;
      given in the outpatient clinic using a slit lamp. The needle (27Gauge) will be advanced in a&#xD;
      zigzag manner into the subconjunctival space, avoiding any large blood vessels, until the&#xD;
      middle of the lesion is reached. The solution will be then injected and the needle withdrawn.&#xD;
      After the injection, 1-2 drops of chloramphenicol 0.5% preservativefree minims will be&#xD;
      instilled topically and continued four times a day for 3 days after each injection.&#xD;
      Injections will be carried out every two weeks as described above. Patients will have the&#xD;
      ability to access the 24 hour on call emergency eye service, and at the same time be provided&#xD;
      with contact numbers for investigators for any queries during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescein angiography (FFA) will be done to characterise the conjunctival vessels. It is a&#xD;
      safe routine investigation that is done on daily basis in eye clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
