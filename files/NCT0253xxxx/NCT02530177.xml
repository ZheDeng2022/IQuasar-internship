  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how many patients develop hair, skin and nail changes due&#xD;
      to cancer treatments. The investigators would like to study the clinical factors, genetic&#xD;
      markers, and impact on patients' health-related quality of life to learn more about who is at&#xD;
      greater risk. We trust that the study will improve our understanding of how cancer patients&#xD;
      feel about their skin, hair, and nail conditions. This information will help us determine the&#xD;
      burden on breast cancer patients and survivors. It will also help us learn how to prevent&#xD;
      these conditions and it may improve the way we treat them and counsel patients.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo study related assessments and the appropriate HRQoL questionnaires will be administered. Baseline and follow-up clinical assessments will be performed, preferably when the patient presents to the clinic for (clinically indicated) standard-of-care visits. Initially, these visits will be coinciding with the appropriate chemotherapy dosing cycles (as applicable to select study cohorts), and subsequently they will be performed during the standard-of-care follow-up visits.</description>

Baseline and follow-up clinical assessments will be performed, preferably when the patient presents to the clinic for standard-of-care visits.
