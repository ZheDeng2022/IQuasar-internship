      Aim: Use an ibuprofen mouthwash 2% irrigate subgingival in improving the progression of&#xD;
      periodontal diseases can be evaluated. Materials and Methods: 22 patients with chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis without any systemic disease who have had periodontal disease, and 2 molars&#xD;
      that have periodontal pockets deeper than 4 mm on either side of the lower jaw have the&#xD;
      clinical examinations. Interventions: For patients who participated in this study, subjects&#xD;
      who received oral hygiene instruction and scaling root planing (SRP), After 2 weeks, They&#xD;
      were divided into two groups as determined by randomization in this study, Experimental&#xD;
      group: ibuprofen 2% mouthwash (made from the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Islamic Azad&#xD;
      University, Tehran), Control group: placebo, Subgingival Irrigation of ibuprofen 2% mouthwash&#xD;
      with an insulin syringe 0.5 ml were rinsed, Clinical measurements including probing depth&#xD;
      (PD), clinical attachment levels (CAL), Plaque Index (PI), and Bleeding Index (BI) were&#xD;
      recorded and the patients were recalled per once every 2 weeks for 3 months is repetitive,&#xD;
      and at the end of 3 months, were evaluated changes in clinical periodontal parameters. ®&#xD;

      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants were 22 adult patients treated for chronic periodontitis and&#xD;
      participating in a supportive periodontal therapy program at the Department of Periodontology&#xD;
      of the Dental Clinic of the Islamic Azad University, Dental Branch of Tehran were included in&#xD;
      the current study; Recruitment of participants started November 2013 and ended September&#xD;
      2014. The study met the criteria of the Helsinki Declaration of1975, revised in 2008. The&#xD;
      survey plan was reviewed and sanctioned, approved by the ethics commission of the&#xD;
      Institutional Ethical Committee and Review Board of the Deputy of Research, School of&#xD;
      Dentistry. All subjects received the oral and written explanation of the intent of the survey&#xD;
      and signed an informed consent after receiving detailed information about the purpose, the&#xD;
      benefits, and the possible risks associated with the trial. Individuals satisfying the&#xD;
      following entry criteria were recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed suffering from initial (early) to moderate chronic periodontitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients, more than 28 years old with at least 20 remaining teeth and at least&#xD;
           three teeth in each quadrant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of at least two residual sites with a probing pocket depth (PPD≥4 mm in two&#xD;
           opposite quadrants, which showed bleeding upon probing, radiographically comparable&#xD;
           amount of periodontal breakdown and good matching in tooth type, also clinical and&#xD;
           minimal radiographic signs of initial (early) to moderate (clinical attachment level of&#xD;
           1 to 3mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal treatment (non-surgical) the previous six months Systemic diseases;&#xD;
      Hypersensitive to Ibuprofen; Systemic antibiotic or anti-inflammatory drugs within the three&#xD;
      months preceding the beginning of the study; Pregnant or nursing females; Smoking; No acute&#xD;
      periodontal conditions, such as necrotizing periodontal diseases or periodontal abscesses.&#xD;
      Mouth rinses during the entire period of the study orthodontic treatments, Use of removable&#xD;
      dentures, Extensive dental restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following clinical outcome variables were recorded at baseline, within 7 days to 3 months&#xD;
      at the selected teeth, at six sites per tooth, by means of a periodontal probe (William's®&#xD;
      probe, Hu-Friedy, USA) by two calibrated blinded examiners:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque index (PI) using a Silness &amp; Loe index (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding on probing (BOP), through the visual inspection 30 s after probing, (Score 0:&#xD;
           No bleeding after probing. Score 1: A single discrete bleeding point appears after&#xD;
           probing) (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probing pocket depth (PPD) in millimeters, measured from the gingival margin to the&#xD;
           deepest stop of the periodontal pocket at the standardized force.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical attachment level (CAL), calculated by adding PPD at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examiner calibration and reproducibility were ensured by duplicating measurements of four&#xD;
      periodontitis patients, not included in the study, with a one-day interval, prior to the&#xD;
      start of the survey. Repetitive measurements were within a 1mm difference in 91.5 % of the&#xD;
      recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and interventions the study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel,&#xD;
      split-mouth designed 3-months clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase I: instruction on oral hygiene procedures after having entered the study, all&#xD;
      patients received the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individualized oral hygiene instructions together with the provision of a new&#xD;
           toothbrush, dental floss, and a fluoridated dentifrice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full-mouth periodontal examination ultrasonic instruments and supragingival professional&#xD;
           prophylaxis using.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase II: After patient selection; using blocked randomization with a block size of&#xD;
      4 and an allocation ratio of 1:1 Block randomization was chosen to prevent too much&#xD;
      variability in the number of patients randomized and ensure a reasonably steady flow of&#xD;
      patients to each treatment group, Allocation cover was ensured by using container and&#xD;
      labeling that did not reveal the content of the trial drug packages who was blind to the&#xD;
      therapist and the clinical examiner. Also, the test and placebo mouthwashes had a similar&#xD;
      color. Patients were randomly assigned to either the A or B group, while mandibular arches&#xD;
      are each divided into two parts (left and right sections);about 60 sites in both groups;&#xD;
      individuals received scaling and root planing on the first visit in accordance with the&#xD;
      one-stage full-mouth debridement protocol (scaled by means of an ultrasonic device) +&#xD;
      professional cleaning; The therapeutic endpoint was defined as a clean root surface without&#xD;
      visible or clinically detectable remnants of biofilm or calculus, since two weeks, the&#xD;
      mouthwashes were applied into the periodontal pockets with PD ≥4 mm using a syringe with a&#xD;
      blunt cannula; and After isolating and drying the selected sites, the assigned ibuprofen&#xD;
      mouthwash 2% formulation (made by Islamic Azad university pharmaceutical sciences branch) was&#xD;
      subgingivally applied using a needle with a blunt tip and a lateral opening for avoiding any&#xD;
      trauma to the tissues. Follow-up visits were scheduled after 0, 7, 14 days, within three&#xD;
      months. At these visits, the following clinical outcome variables were recorded at baseline&#xD;
      and within seven days to three months at the selected teeth by William's periodontal probe;&#xD;
      at six sites per tooth. Oral hygiene was reinforced at each visit, but no further treatment&#xD;
      was provided. Within any visit, patients were provided with a full-mouth professional&#xD;
      prophylaxis. At every visit, the occurrence of any undesirable side effects or adverse events&#xD;
      that could be related to the treatment was recorded, including changing of both teeth and&#xD;
      oral mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses the sample size is calculated using the following formula: α=00.05 and&#xD;
      the power (1-β) =80%. For the variability (σ = SD), the value of 0.5 mm was used, considering&#xD;
      PPD change from baseline to three months as the main outcome variable, with a desired&#xD;
      difference of 1.8 mm. On the basis of these data, the number of enrolled patients to conduct&#xD;
      this study was calculated as 12 patients per arm. However, considering the possibility of&#xD;
      having a certain amount of drop outpatients (10%), the total number of requests patients was&#xD;
      14 per treatment group. Statistical methods only the data from the selected sites were&#xD;
      processed, but the patient was considered the statistical unit. The obtained clinical outcome&#xD;
      variables were calculated by the patient, and then by treatment group. For the evaluation of&#xD;
      the intragroup changes between baseline and 7, 14, within three months the ANOVA test was&#xD;
      used (once the normality of the distribution was proven). Statistical significance was&#xD;
      defined as P &lt;0.001. All data were analyzed using a software program (SPSS 19).&#xD;
