      This prospective double-blinded clinical trial is intended to compare three nerve stimulator-&#xD;
      guided paravertebral block injections versus five injections for elderly patients undergoing&#xD;
      hernia repair regarding intraoperative hemodynamic stability and postoperative pain.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most effective anesthetic technique for inguinal hernia repair remains a controversial&#xD;
      issue; however, paravertebral block (PVB) has resulted in significant postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia, less postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and short hospital stay compared to&#xD;
      general anesthesia (GA), spinal anesthesia (SA) and ilioinguinal nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly patients usually have higher risk for developing mental disturbances and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary complications following GA. Hence, elderly patients may benefit from PVB.&#xD;
      Although PVB has shown satisfactory outcome; nevertheless, there is no standardized PVB&#xD;
      regarding the technique and number of injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this background, the objective of this prospective double-blinded study is to&#xD;
      compare three nerve stimulator- guided PVB injections versus five injections for elderly&#xD;
      patients undergoing hernia repair regarding intraoperative hemodynamic stability and&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Following approval of the Institutional Review Board, written informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from 200 patients aged above 65 years with ASA II, III or IV admitted to undergo&#xD;
      elective unilateral inguinal hernia repair between September 2015 and September 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sealed envelope technique is used to divide the patients into two groups. Group III (100&#xD;
      patients) will receive three PVB injections from T12 to L2 and placebo at T11 and L3. Group V&#xD;
      (100 patients) will receive five PVB injections between T11 and L3. The anesthetist, surgeon,&#xD;
      patient and data collector are all blind to the patients' group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG leads, pulse oximetry and non-invasive oscillometric arterial pressure are attached.&#xD;
      Patients will be given 1 µg/kg intravenous (IV) fentanyl (Fentanyl Hameln 10 ml, 0.05 mg/ml,&#xD;
      Hameln Pharmaceuticals, Germany) as premedication. Unilateral PVB will be performed while the&#xD;
      patient is in the lateral decubitus position with the side to be operated being upwards.&#xD;
      Sites of injection are marked 2.5-3 cm lateral to the midline of the vertebral column.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block technique Following aseptic preparation of the skin, the injection sites&#xD;
      are infiltrated with 0.1 ml of lidocaine 1% each using an 8 mm, 30 G needle (BD Micro-Fine&#xD;
      Plus, Becton Dickinson and company, USA). PVB injections are done using a 100 mm 22 G nerve&#xD;
      stimulator needle (Stimuplex, B.Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The injections begin at L3 and&#xD;
      proceed upwards reaching to T11. The needle is introduced perpendicularly to the skin at the&#xD;
      site of the injection point using the following nerve stimulator settings: 5mA, 9V and 2Hz.&#xD;
      The stimulating needle is gently manipulated into a position to allow for an adequate&#xD;
      muscular response with a stimulating current of 0.4-0.8 mA. Then, the injection is performed.&#xD;
      Block onset is determined by cold test and pinprick test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to preserve the double blindness of this clinical trial, two syringes will be used&#xD;
      for both groups. The first syringe labeled (A) (20 ml) is filled with 15 mL of solution and&#xD;
      used to perform equal injections at the levels T12, L1, and L2 (5mL each). The second syringe&#xD;
      labeled (B) (10 ml) is used to inject the solution at the levels T11 and L3 (5 ml each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure equal anesthetic dose of 75 mg of bupivacaine for each patient, the syringes are&#xD;
      prepared as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group V, both syringes (A) and (B) contain 3mg of bupivacaine/ml whereas for group III,&#xD;
      the syringe (A) is prepared with 5 mg bupivacaine/ml while syringe (B) contains placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow for adequate blinding, the solution used for injection (saline or local anesthetic&#xD;
      mixture) is prepared by an independent nurse outside the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient feels pain during the surgery, 50 - 100 µg IV fentanyl will be given and&#xD;
      followed by 0.4-0.5 mg/kg propofol if needed while keeping the patient responsive to verbal&#xD;
      stimulation. If the latter is not sufficient, the patient is converted to GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Demographic and preoperative variables are collected. Time to perform the&#xD;
      block, intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring (MAP and HR) are noted during the entire surgery&#xD;
      and recorded pre-incision, at skin incision, at inguinal hernia sac traction, and upon wound&#xD;
      closure. Supplemental intraoperative fentanyl and propofol is recorded. Surgery duration,&#xD;
      incidence of PONV and numbness are noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' satisfaction is also assessed based on their comfort and activity during the&#xD;
      procedure, intra- and postoperatively. Patient's comfort is determined by: feeling of pain,&#xD;
      PONV, and negative memory of the procedural experience. The patient's activity is based on&#xD;
      the ability to sit, move and walk. Patients rate these on a scale of one to three ranging&#xD;
      from satisfied, partially satisfied, and unsatisfied. Surgeon's satisfaction is based on the&#xD;
      overall intra- and postoperative status of the patient. It is measured based on the&#xD;
      following: patient's movement or feeling pain during the operation, self-transportation from&#xD;
      the surgical table to stretcher, and postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain is assessed during the first five postoperative days (0 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr,&#xD;
      and day 1 till day 5) using the Verbal Numeric Rating Scale (VNRS) (0 no pain and 10 worst&#xD;
      possible pain). Patients will be discharged the same day once they had urinated and&#xD;
      demonstrated ability to tolerate oral diet. Data will be collected during the hospital stay&#xD;
      by residents blind to the patient's group. Patients will be contacted by the same resident&#xD;
      during the follow-up period through daily phone calls.&#xD;
