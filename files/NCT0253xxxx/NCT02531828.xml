      The aim of this study is validate the use of biopolymer from sugar cane molasses film&#xD;
      (POLYSHAFT®) a product developed in Experimental Station research laboratories (UFRPE)&#xD;
      comparing to polyurethane film, or similar, used as a bandage after surgical correction of&#xD;
      hypospadias, as well as other procedures. The main objective of the study is to prove the&#xD;
      hypothesis the POLYSHAFT® presents similar or better outcomes in terms of biocompatibility,&#xD;
      when compared to the polyurethane film when used as a bandage.&#xD;

      Randomized controlled clinical trial. The target study population will comprise of the&#xD;
      patients Unified Health System (SUS), the Outpatient Surgery and Pediatric Urology, Clinical&#xD;
      Hospital of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), including children (from 01 years),&#xD;
      adolescents and adults regardless of age, with lesions arising from the treatment of&#xD;
      hypospadias, as well as other surgical injuries, according to the ethical principles outlined&#xD;
      in Resolution 466 of the 2012 National Health Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyurethane films - Tegaderm ®&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The polyurethane films of sizes, 4.4 and 6.0 X 4.4 X 7.0 log National Agency of Sanitary&#xD;
      Surveillance (ANVISA) / Health Ministry (MS) 10,002,070,019 manufactured by Minnesota Mining&#xD;
      and Manufacturing Company (3M), with the following features: versatile and waterproof barrier&#xD;
      against external contaminants, wraps to body contours promoting patient comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopolymer film of sugarcane (POLYSHAFT ®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The biopolymer films of sugarcane will be provided by the research group biopolymer&#xD;
      Sugarcane and the Experimental Station research laboratories (UFRPE). The biopolymer films&#xD;
      have similar dimensions to the polyurethane film, which can be cut and adapted to the&#xD;
      dimensions of the body of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to an interview being asked about previous surgery. The&#xD;
      researcher will conduct physical and urological examination in determining the degree of&#xD;
      hypospadias and / or other assessment procedure necessary for observation of the need (and&#xD;
      display) the dressing with polyurethane film or biopolymer from sugar cane (POLYSHAFT®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated to the groups: Biopolymer films with molasses sugar and&#xD;
      polyurethane, using sealed, opaque, numbered envelopes containing computer-generated random&#xD;
      distributions in 1:1 ratio in blocks of 10's envelopes will be opened in the operating room&#xD;
      by a nurse while before starting the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers will be patients admitted to the pediatric surgery ward of the Clinical&#xD;
      Hospital/UFPE and surgical procedures are carried out by the researchers. All patients will&#xD;
      receive intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis at the beginning of the surgery as routine&#xD;
      hospital clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment and data analysis arising from the research will take place between&#xD;
      August 2014 and August 2015, with the publication of the results expected in October 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up evaluations of patients will be performed daily until removal of the bandage on&#xD;
      the eighth postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables together:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate Biocompatibility: Assessment of adverse reactions such as irritation of the skin.&#xD;
           The researcher through observation will issue a concept: how: No skin irritability,&#xD;
           limited to the foreskin irritability and extended to other areas irritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degree of adherence: Assessed by the researcher through observation that deliver a&#xD;
           concept as grip areas with detachment, grip without detachment or adhesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degree of annoyance: Patients or their caregivers respond to the questionnaire with the&#xD;
           concept of &quot;very upset,&quot; &quot;little disturbed&quot; or &quot;not bothered&quot; with the dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade adhesion and permanence &quot;in situ&quot; after being subjected to the action of water for&#xD;
           cleaning three times a day. All observations from patient or their guardian who must be&#xD;
           communicated to the researcher.&#xD;
