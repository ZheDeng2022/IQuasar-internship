  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platinum-based chemotherapy is now regarded a standard first-line treatment for patients with&#xD;
      advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, patients who failed to response or experienced&#xD;
      progression after platinum-based chemotherapy have a grim prognosis and a standard salvage&#xD;
      treatment is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UC is known to harbor multiple mutations. In the investigators' own high-throughput molecular&#xD;
      profiling study, the most commonly observed mutations included TP53, FGFR3(fibroblast growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 3 ) and HRAS. Since RAS signaling can be attenuated using selective farnesyl&#xD;
      transferase (FTase) inhibitors, tipifarnib, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of FTase,&#xD;
      was proposed to be an effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of UC.&#xD;
