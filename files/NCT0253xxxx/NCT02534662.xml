      Objectives: Study to evaluate safety and feasibility of an endoluminal vertical gastroplasty&#xD;
      (EVG) using an endoluminal-suturing device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, Vertical gastric plication is a novel surgical approach for reducing the stomach&#xD;
      capacity. Anterior surface plication and greater curvature plication are variations of&#xD;
      vertical gastric plication that reduce the gastric capacity through infolding of the anterior&#xD;
      surface or greater curvature of the stomach, respectively. These approaches have been tested,&#xD;
      with positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A transoral or endoluminal approach (ie, a procedure that requires no incision, because&#xD;
      access is granted through the mouth) offers the potential for additional benefit to the&#xD;
      patient, because the procedures continue to become more and more minimally invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in endoluminal devices are now allowing clinicians the ability to begin exploring&#xD;
      bariatric procedures performed via flexible endoscopy. Although these procedures may not be&#xD;
      as effective as their surgical counterparts, these less-invasive options may relieve patients&#xD;
      of the significant risks associated with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration and number of subjects A period of approximately 6 months is anticipated form&#xD;
      the time the time the first patient is enrolled to the completion of the last patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day (0): Procedure Day (+1): Clinical Follow up and discharge (i.e. if no adverse effects&#xD;
      observed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 month: Follow up endoscopy, Clinical assessment 3 month: Follow up endoscopy, Clinical&#xD;
      assessment 6 month: Final assessment (Endoscopically and Clinical) On Parallel a nutritional&#xD;
      specialist will monitor the patient on quarterly basis (1,3,6,12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures The intervention will be performed under general anesthesia with tracheal&#xD;
      intubation. Endomina will be introduced into the stomach over guide wires and then fixed to&#xD;
      the endoscope. The procedure will include the placement of 4-6 transmural anterior-posterior&#xD;
      sutures after argon plasma coagulation of the tissue opposition areas in order to ensure&#xD;
      persistence of the pouch reduction. Patient will be kept overnight after the procedure.&#xD;

      Surgery is the only effective treatment for morbid obesity and can be divided into&#xD;
      restrictive surgeries (Lap Band and Sleeve gastrectomy), malabsorptive surgeries (Biliary&#xD;
      pancreatic deviation and duodenal switch) or a combination of both (RYGBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This later technique is the most common and most effective surgical procedure performed&#xD;
      worldwide and has been processed to be an effective treatment of morbid obesity and its&#xD;
      complications, achieving excess weight loss of 65 to 80 % ; 1-2 years after surgery.1&#xD;
      Vertical gastric plication is a novel surgical approach for reducing the stomach capacity.&#xD;
      Anterior surface plication and greater curvature plication are variations of vertical gastric&#xD;
      plication that reduce the gastric capacity through infolding of the anterior surface or&#xD;
      greater curvature of the stomach, respectively. These approaches have been tested, with&#xD;
      positive results. 3 A transoral or endoluminal approach (ie, a procedure that requires no&#xD;
      incision, because access is granted through the mouth) offers the potential for additional&#xD;
      benefit to the patient, because the procedures continue to become more and more minimally&#xD;
      invasive.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Endomina (Endo Tools Therapeutics, Nivelles, Belgium) is CE mark robot driven device that may&#xD;
      be attached to an endoscope inside the body and allows remote manipulation of the arms of&#xD;
      devices during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibilities of making transoral&#xD;
      surgical full thickness sutures and may allow performing, via a transoral route.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>Safety will be characterized by the incidence of all Adverse Device Effects (ADEs), non-serious and serious, possibly related to or related to the procedure and/or device that are experienced by study participants.&#xD;
In addition, safety assessments will be determined based on physical examination (vital signs) and laboratory tests during scheduled visits. Safety evaluations will also be performed to ensure no subsequent adverse events have occurred and to ensure any adverse events during the trial that are considered on-going are stable or have resolved. Safety will be assessed at 1 and 6 month following the intervention.</description>
