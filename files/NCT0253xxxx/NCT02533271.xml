      The purpose of this study is to compare effectiveness of short-term radiotherapy with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy(TNT group) with preoperative long-term chemoradiotherapy(CRT group)&#xD;
      in locally advanced rectal cancer. The hypothesis is 3-year disease-free survival in TNT&#xD;
      group was non-inferior to that in CRT group.&#xD;

      The study is a prospective phase III randomized multicenter trial. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to compare short-term radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy(TNT group) with&#xD;
      preoperative long-term chemoradiotherapy(CRT group) for middle-lower locally advanced rectal&#xD;
      cancer. The primary endpoint is 3-year disease-free survival,defined as the interval from&#xD;
      randomization to the first occurrence of local-regional failure, distant metastasis, second&#xD;
      primary tumor or death from any cause. The primary hypothesis was that DFS in the TNT group&#xD;
      would be non-inferior to that in the CRT group. After preoperative radiotherapy and surgery,&#xD;
      the DFS rate of LARC fluctuated from 50% to 65%. Assuming a 3-year DFS rate in CRT group is&#xD;
      65%, we consider the 3-year DFS rate in the TNT group is not lower than 54% (e.g., a margin&#xD;
      of 11% or equivalently, hazard ratio (HR) &lt; 1.43). Guarding against a 5% ineligibility or&#xD;
      drop-out rate, the accrual target was 600 patients, with the final analysis to occur after at&#xD;
      least 194 DFS events to provide at least 80% power at 1-sided type 1 error of 0.05. The&#xD;
      choices of type 1 error and power were made to provide an appropriate comprise between&#xD;
      feasibility, timeliness and statistical rigor of evidence generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to compare outcomes between two groups with respect to rates of overall&#xD;
      survival(OS), distance metastasis free survival (DMFS), and locoregional recurrence free&#xD;
      survival (LRRFS).In addition, acute and late toxicity profile, completion of preoperative&#xD;
      treatment, the proportion of patients with radical resection (R0), surgical complication&#xD;
      profile, the rate of pathological complete response (pCR), and quality of life (QoL) are also&#xD;
      secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STELLAR-trial has been designed by National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese&#xD;
      Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, and the hypothesis is 3-year&#xD;
      disease-free survival in TNT group was non-inferior to that in CRT group.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention of TNT group is Short-course radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which consists of a short-course radiotherapy (SCRT, 5 Gy x 5 alone), then after 7-10 days of radiotherapy completed, patients will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, given in 3 week cycle of capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily, day 1-14 combined with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 once. In total, 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are prescribed preoperatively, then followed by a total mesorectal excision(TME) and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. If patients are eligible for postoperative chemotherapy this should consist of at least 2 cycles, which are the same as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>The intervention of CRT group is long-term chemoradiotherapy(CRT), which consists of a long-term chemoradiation (2 Gy x 25 with capecitabine) preoperatively, followed by a total mesorectal excision(TME) and then postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The radiotherapy is given in combination with capecitabine in a dose of 825 mg/m2 twice daily on days when radiotherapy, excluding weekends. If patients are eligible for postoperative chemotherapy this should consist of at least 6 cycles of capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily, day 1-14 combined with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks.</description>
