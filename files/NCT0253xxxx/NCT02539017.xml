  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a special type of breast cancer, the triple negative breast cancer has the characteristics&#xD;
      of high recurrence rate (2 years after surgery), high distant metastasis rate, poor prognosis&#xD;
      and short survival time. No matter at home or abroad, the clinical researches of the triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer are mainly focused on finding new drugs and new treatment strategies&#xD;
      in order to reduce its recurrence and distant metastasis rate. The DC/CIK cell immunotherapy&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy in the clinical study of metastatic triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
      has already confirmed benefit. This study is based on the theory that the optimal timing of&#xD;
      cellular immunity is while the host tumor load is under the smallest state. Put forward the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the DC/CIK cell immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy may improve the&#xD;
      disease-free survival and overall surviva after the triple negative breast cancer operation.&#xD;
      The investigators intends to use the RCT, observing the clinical significance of cellular&#xD;
      immune adjuvant therapy of triple negative breast cancer in 340 patients with TNBC. Do the&#xD;
      safety evaluation of cellular immunity in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer treatment,&#xD;
      explore the clinical strategies for breast cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
