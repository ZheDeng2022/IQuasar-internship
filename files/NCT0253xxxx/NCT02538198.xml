    <description>Subjects will receive lenalidomide 10 mg by mouth daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. Subjects may continue lenalidomide until disease progression, diagnosis of new malignancy, unacceptable toxicity, investigator discretion, voluntary withdrawal, or the end of the study (5 years); whatever comes first. Patients who complete at least four cycles of treatment will be considered evaluable.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with plasma cell myeloma treated with induction therapy or re-induction&#xD;
             therapy, who at the time of study enrollment have documented evidence of stable&#xD;
             disease response or better according to International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of lenalidomide in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study, but may be eligible for future pediatric trials&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic, and as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0K /μL (growth factor support is permissible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets ≥ 75K/μL (transfusions are permissible)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) of greater than or equal to 40 mL/min. using the CKD-EPI&#xD;
             formula (see Appendix C). If the CrCl based on the CKD-EPI formula is &lt;40 mL/min, the&#xD;
             patient will have a 24 hr urine collection to measure CrCl. The measured CrCl must&#xD;
             also be ≥ 40 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program,&#xD;
             and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the REMS® program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential* must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days and again within24 hours&#xD;
             prior to prescribing lenalidomide for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7&#xD;
             days as required by Revlimid REMS®) and must either commit to continued abstinence&#xD;
             from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one&#xD;
             highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least&#xD;
             28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not&#xD;
             undergone a hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been naturally&#xD;
             postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing&#xD;
             potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time during&#xD;
             the preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as&#xD;
             required in the Revlimid REMS® program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a female of&#xD;
             childbearing potential even if they have had a successful vasectomy. See Appendix B:&#xD;
             Lenalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable&#xD;
             Birth Control Methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to take daily prophylactic anticoagulation medication, such as:&#xD;
             aspirin (81 or 325 mg) warfarin low molecular weight heparin or other medications as&#xD;
             clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form, with the&#xD;
             understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice to&#xD;
             future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Plasma cell leukemia&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active hepatitis B or C infection&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to uncontrolled infection&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Significant neuropathy ≥Grade 3 at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to concomitant anticoagulation prophylaxis&#xD;
