  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The abacavir (ABC)/dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC) 600 milligrams (mg)/50 mg/300 mg&#xD;
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet is currently approved in the United States (US) and&#xD;
      Europe. Although the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of ABC/DTG/3TC FDC&#xD;
      tablets have been extensively studied in subjects not of Japanese heritage, these parameters&#xD;
      have not been exclusively assessed in Japanese subjects. To support the marketing application&#xD;
      in Japan, this single-dose, open-label study will characterize the PK, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ABC/DTG/3TC FDC tablet in adult Japanese healthy subjects. A maximum of 12&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled such that approximately 10 evaluable subjects complete the study.&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening, treatment phase (single oral dose under the fasted&#xD;
      state) and follow-up visit (within 7-14 days of the last PK sample collected). The total&#xD;
      duration of the study for each subject will be approximately up to 48 days.&#xD;

             following: Documented tubal ligation Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion&#xD;
             procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion Hysterectomy&#xD;

             amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause). Females on&#xD;
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be&#xD;
             required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to&#xD;
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow&#xD;
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the&#xD;
             modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in females of&#xD;
             reproductive potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication&#xD;
             and until 2 weeks after dosing with study medication and completion of the follow-up&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use&#xD;
        these methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in the protocol which includes&#xD;
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in&#xD;
             the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation that the subject is negative for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities&#xD;

        over-read.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an&#xD;
        individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words,&#xD;
        several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject&#xD;
        and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For purposes of data analysis, QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula&#xD;
        (QTcB), QTcF, another QT correction formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will&#xD;
        be used as specified in the reporting and analysis plan (RAP).&#xD;

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) medical monitor the medication will not&#xD;

             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical&#xD;

             excess of 500 mL within 56 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
