  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability of an investigational drug&#xD;
      known as LY3023414 in Japanese participants with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      another part(s) of the body. The study will also explore the safety of the drug. It will&#xD;
      measure how much of the drug gets into the blood steam and how long the body takes to get rid&#xD;
      of it. It will investigate anti-cancer activity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of solid tumor that is&#xD;
             advanced and/or metastatic and must be, in the judgment of the investigator, an&#xD;
             appropriate candidate for experimental therapy after available standard therapies have&#xD;
             failed or for whom standard therapy would not be appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have the presence of measurable or non-measurable disease as defined by Response&#xD;
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate organ and coagulation function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have discontinued all previous cancer therapies, and any agents that have not received&#xD;
             regulatory approval for any indication, for at least 21 days or 5 half-lives prior to&#xD;
             study treatment, whichever is shorter, and recovered from the acute effects of&#xD;
             therapy. Participants must have discontinued mitomycin-C or nitrosourea therapy for at&#xD;
             least 42 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are able to swallow capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males must agree to use medically approved barrier contraceptive precautions during&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Females with childbearing potential: Must agree to use medically approved&#xD;
             contraceptive precautions during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug, must have had a negative serum or urine pregnancy test ≤7 days before the&#xD;
             first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A breastfeeding woman must not be breastfeeding. If a female who stops breastfeeding&#xD;
             enters the study, breastfeeding must cease from the day of the first study drug&#xD;

             prior to first study drug administration, whichever is shorter, and participants must&#xD;
             have recovered from the acute effects of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a second primary malignancy that, in the judgment of the investigator, and&#xD;
             sponsor may affect the interpretation of results.&#xD;

          -  Participants with active alcohol abuse, as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of heart failure according to New York Heart Association Class ≥3.&#xD;
