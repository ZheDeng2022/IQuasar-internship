      Retrospective/Prospective, open-label study using sofosbuvir based DAA therapy to treat&#xD;
      HIV/HCV coinfected pre or post liver transplant participants&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately fifty HIV/HCV coinfected patients with decompensated liver disease will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Ten (up to twenty) subjects will be treated with FDC SOF/LDV pre or&#xD;
      post liver transplant and followed prospectively. Forty + subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      retrospectively with the intent to capture all patients who have been exposed to sofosbuvir&#xD;
      based DAA therapies at participating sites since 1/2014, and to mirror the population being&#xD;
      enrolled prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants in the retrospective arm will be contacted to consent to one&#xD;
      prospective study visit for liver staging to determine rates of reversal of decompensation,&#xD;
      reversal of cirrhosis and improvements in graft survival post treatment, and for future&#xD;
      contact by the NIH Clinical Center to assess longer term outcomes when this study ends.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>STOP-CO is a multi-center prospective and retrospective, open-label study using sofosbuvir-based DAA therapy to treat HIV/HCV coinfected participants pre- or post-LT.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study was designed to prospectively assign ledipasvir-sofosbuvir to participants awaiting transplant or ≥1 month post-transplant. During the course of the trials, DAAs became widely available and the standard of care for the target study population. Only 7 participants could be enrolled in the prospective arm of this study with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir. Therefore in 2017 the study was amended to include retrospective participants treated with any sofosbuvir-based therapy after 2014.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Adults With HIV and Chronic HCV and End-stage Liver Disease (ESLD) Pre-liver Transplant</title>
          <description>The study was implemented at 7 designated sites across the United States. Participants were HIV-positive on a stable antiretroviral (ART) regimen for at least 4 weeks pre-treatment. The retrospective portion of the study enrolled participants treated with sofosbuvir-based DAAs for any duration since 2014 were eligible. HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5 or 6 were included with at least one serum HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL prior to treatment. Pre-LT participants had a pre-treatment Child's Pugh Turcotte (CPT) score ≥ 7 and a pre-treatment laboratory MELD ≥ 6 and ≤ 30 and included both listed LT candidates and participants who had decompensated cirrhosis not listed for LT. Inclusion criteria for post-LT participants were a LT after 2000 and DAA treatment initiated ≥ 1 month after LT. Prospective participants were accrued from 12/2016-11/2018. Additional exclusion criteria for prospective participants were chronic hepatitis B infection, a history of any other clinically active chronic liver disease, and prior treatment for HCV within one month of screening. Retrospective participants were enrolled between 4/2018 and 6/2019. Information about type of SOF-based therapy in the retrospective participants was not collected for this study.</description>

Participants were HIV-positive on a stable antiretroviral (ART) regimen for at least 4 weeks pre-treatment. The retrospective portion of the study enrolled participants treated with sofosbuvir-based DAAs for any duration since 2014 were eligible. HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5 or 6 were included with at least one serum HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL prior to treatment. Pre-LT participants had a pre-treatment Child's Pugh Turcotte (CPT) score ≥ 7 and a pre-treatment laboratory MELD ≥ 6 and ≤ 30 and included both listed LT candidates and participants who had decompensated cirrhosis not listed for LT. Inclusion criteria for post-LT participants were a LT after 2000 and DAA treatment initiated ≥ 1 month after LT. Prospective participants were accrued from 12/2016-11/2018. Additional exclusion criteria for prospective participants were chronic hepatitis B infection, a history of any other clinically active chronic liver disease, and prior treatment for HCV within one month of screening. Retrospective participants were enrolled between 4/2018 and 6/2019. Information about type of SOF-based therapy in the retrospective participants was not collected for this study.</description>

          <description>The study was implemented at 7 designated sites across the United States. Participants were HIV-positive on a stable antiretroviral (ART) regimen for at least 4 weeks pre-treatment. The retrospective portion of the study enrolled participants treated with sofosbuvir-based DAAs for any duration since 2014 were eligible. HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5 or 6 were included with at least one serum HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL prior to treatment. Pre-LT participants had a pre-treatment Child's Pugh Turcotte (CPT) score ≥ 7 and a pre-treatment laboratory MELD ≥ 6 and ≤ 30 and included both listed LT candidates and participants who had decompensated cirrhosis not listed for LT. Inclusion criteria for post-LT participants were a LT after 2000 and DAA treatment initiated ≥ 1 month after LT. Prospective participants were accrued from 12/2016-11/2018. Additional exclusion criteria for prospective participants were chronic hepatitis B infection, a history of any other clinically active chronic liver disease, and prior treatment for HCV within one month of screening. Retrospective participants were enrolled between 4/2018 and 6/2019. Information about type of SOF-based therapy in the retrospective participants was not collected for this study.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was limited by the necessity to change the design from a prospective to a retrospective/prospective analysis. This change in study design resulted from the urgency in treating the HIV/HCV coinfected liver transplant candidate with DAAs, based on the dismal survival outcome in this cohort. By the time this trial was approved, many of the DAAs for HCV were approved, and centers immediately treated their decompensated HIV/HCV recipients.</limitations_and_caveats>
