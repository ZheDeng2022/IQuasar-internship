  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current post-operative monitoring of patient recovery consists measuring two blood markers&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and White Blood Cell Count (WBC). However, these are slow to respond&#xD;
      to the onset of infection. However, monitoring the absolute levels of the proteins in the&#xD;
      three pathways of the complement cascade should provide a faster and better predictor of&#xD;
      patient recovery. The investigators propose a pilot trial to measure concentrations of&#xD;
      Complement Cascade (CC) activation biomarkers in the blood over a time course around&#xD;
      operations of major abdomino-pelvic surgery involving a bowel resection. Further, analysis of&#xD;
      the differential CC pathway activation should identify the onset of recovery complications&#xD;
      before clinical symptoms present and potentially identify the causes allowing the clinicians&#xD;
      to target therapies.&#xD;

      The proposed study is a pilot study on a cohort of participants recruited from routine&#xD;
      elective colorectal surgery at RD&amp;E. The pilot trial will collect blood over a time course&#xD;
      for a patient to record blood plasma levels of Complement proteins peri-operatively from&#xD;
      admission to discharge. The assay schedule is detailed in Table 1 below. The trial will&#xD;
      perform additional CC activation tests on routine blood samples taken during the patient's&#xD;
      stay in hospital. In addition 4 trial samples will be taken at time intervals that will&#xD;
      capture the impulse response of the patient's CC. Sample analysis will be performed in&#xD;
      parallel in the clinical chemistry laboratory for laboratory for assays of CRP and the&#xD;
      complement proteins C3 and C4. The additional trial assays will be performed on the MSD&#xD;
      platform on loan for the period of the trial.&#xD;

      The assays deployed for the pilot trial the current biomarkers of C activation panel are&#xD;
      C3dg, C4d, Bb, TCC and the acute phase marker, CRP. The TCC assay has been designed in&#xD;
      Cardiff (by Prof Morgan a collaborator of Prof Shaw) and the investigators have extensive&#xD;
      experience in the design of C protein assays. For the target biomarkers antibodies to&#xD;
      neo-antigens that are revealed post enzymatic cleavage or complex formation will be used as&#xD;
      capture antibodies on the surface of the MSD platform. The C proteins are then detected with&#xD;
      polyclonal antibodies provided by Prof Morgan in Cardiff and labelled with a ruthenium tagged&#xD;
      antibody. Whole EDTA-stabilised plasma is then incubated in the 96-well format; all 5 assays,&#xD;
      including calibration curves, are run simultaneously. Electroluminescence from the ruthenium&#xD;
      complex is collected and quantified automatically. Absolute measurements of C proteins will&#xD;
      be performed using standardised fully activated serum which contains a constant amount of&#xD;
      activation products from all complement pathways. The serum is available through Prof&#xD;
      Morgan's collaboration with the 'Complement Standardization Group'. C activation relative to&#xD;
      this standard can then be determined. This work will lead to an array of C activation markers&#xD;
      that will be tested against the patient cohort. This array including some of the other&#xD;
      pathway markers may ultimately become the basis of a routine clinical test.&#xD;
