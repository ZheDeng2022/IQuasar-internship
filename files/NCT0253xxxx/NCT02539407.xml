  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concentrations and effects of anti-infectives in critically ill children are unpredictable&#xD;
      and the risk of under-exposure may be associated with poor clinical outcomes. In addition,&#xD;
      between-subject variability (BSV) is known to be substantial in critically ill children.&#xD;
      Rationalisation of anti-infectives in children is therefore desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to investigate, using a population approach, the pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of anti-infectives including PK/PD targets (fT(%) &gt; minimal&#xD;
      inhibitory concentration (MIC)) and PD endpoints (clinical outcomes) in critically ill&#xD;
      children. Covariates The effects of covariates on anti-infectives PK and PK/PDs are&#xD;
      investigated in order to better explain the BSV and to ultimately suggest individualized&#xD;
      dosage regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a prospective PK study including 11 anti-infectives antibiotics. Six blood samples&#xD;
      were taken from each patient during dosing interval. The primary PK/ PD targets were&#xD;
      anti-infectives concentrations above the MIC of the pathogen at both 50% (50% f T&gt;MIC) and&#xD;
      100% (100% f T&gt;MIC) of the dosing interval. The investigators used skewed logistic regression&#xD;
      to describe the effect of anti-infectives exposure on patient outcome.&#xD;

      Background and aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have suggested a risk of under-exposure to anti-infectives in critically ill&#xD;
      adults. This under-exposure may be associated with poor clinical outcomes as well as a delay&#xD;
      or incomplete clinical resolution of infection; The dosing regimen of anti-infectives in&#xD;
      critically ill children is usually based on weight (i.e. mg per Kg). However, between-subject&#xD;
      variability is known to be substantial in children and even more so in critical illness; As a&#xD;
      result, concentrations and effects of anti-infectives are unpredictable and the risk of&#xD;
      under- or over-exposure is thus genuine and considerable. Rationalisation of anti-infectives&#xD;
      in children is therefore desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate, using a population approach, the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of intravenous anti-infectives including&#xD;
      usual PK/PD targets (fT(%) &gt; minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)) and PD endpoints&#xD;
      (clinical outcomes) in critically ill children. The effects of developmental and other&#xD;
      factors related to critical illness on anti-infectives PK and PK/PDs are investigated in&#xD;
      order to better explain the observed between-subject variabilities and to ultimately suggest&#xD;
      individualized dosage regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will be conducted in six paediatric services of Public Hospitals in&#xD;
      Paris, France&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection will take place in the 6 paediatric services. The senior physician proposes&#xD;
      the study to holders of parental authority whose child receives or will receive&#xD;
      anti-infectives during its follow-up or hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The senior physician will give a briefing note to the holders of parental authority, and if&#xD;
      the child is able to understand the information. The non-oral opposition for the retrieval&#xD;
      and analysis of data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intervention or no charge will be made for this study.&#xD;
