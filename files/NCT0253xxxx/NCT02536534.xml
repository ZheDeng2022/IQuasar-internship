      Evaluate the correlation between activity level (monitored by Fitbit Flex remote activity&#xD;
      tracker) and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) (performed by investigator) in patients with&#xD;
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) or Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension&#xD;
      (CTEPH) over 6 months in routine clinical practice settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remote patient monitoring can lead to improved patient outcomes, including improved quality&#xD;
      of life, reduced readmissions, earlier treatment for symptoms detected prior to schedule&#xD;
      in-office follow-up visits, improved communications with care providers, increased&#xD;
      participation in self-management of disease, and an improved knowledge of their medical&#xD;
      conditions . In patients with PAH, daily activity level, as measured using a physical&#xD;
      activity monitor for seven consecutive days, correlated with 6-minute walk distance (6MWD).&#xD;
      The monitor used in the aforementioned PAH study was positioned on the patients' right upper&#xD;
      arm with an armband, as opposed to the more popular and more comfortable wristbands used&#xD;
      today, such as the Fitbit Flex. Although the aforementioned PAH study did show a correlation&#xD;
      between activity level monitoring and 6MWD, the patients were monitored for only seven days.&#xD;
      It is still unknown whether this correlation would exist over a longer trial period and&#xD;
      whether patients, their caregivers, and clinicians would find activity level monitoring&#xD;
      useful in helping manage PH.&#xD;
