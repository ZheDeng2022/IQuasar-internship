      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the FDA-approved Radio Frequency Surgical Detection&#xD;
      System (RFDS) as a non-radiological means to ease the process of detecting retained sponges&#xD;
      and reconciling sponge counts in the labor and delivery room (following vaginal birth).&#xD;

      This study proposes to evaluate the FDA-approved Radio Frequency Surgical Detection System&#xD;
      (RFDS) as a non-radiological means to ease the process of detecting retained sponges and&#xD;
      reconciling sponge counts in the labor and delivery room (following vaginal birth). It would&#xD;
      not replace any of the current standard-of-care safety mechanisms already in place at the&#xD;
      study site to prevent retained sponges. All safeguards remain enforced: counting, visual&#xD;
      inspection, and x-rays if indicated by standard protocol. The system being studied involves&#xD;
      the surgeon scanning the subject's vaginal area using a spherical device placed 1cm above the&#xD;
      symphysis pubis. This static scan will serve to detect any retained cotton textiles within&#xD;
      the vaginal cavity after birth. This Verisphere, a reusable device, is encased in a sterile&#xD;
      sheath during use. It does not come into direct contact with the subject's vagina, but hovers&#xD;
      above the pelvic/vaginal region. If any radio-frequency tagged sponges remain inside the&#xD;
      subject, a signal alerts the surgical team to remove them. The visible console displays a&#xD;
      confirmation code once the scan is complete. This confirmation code is kept as part of the&#xD;
      medical record once absence of retained textiles is confirmed. Once the provider is assured&#xD;
      there is no retained item, the same device may be used to scan trash receptacles to locate a&#xD;
      missing textile if the pre- and post-delivery sponge/gauze count remains incongruent. This&#xD;
      alleviates the need for the assistant personnel to manually &quot;dig&quot; through soiled materials&#xD;
      for sponge localization.&#xD;
