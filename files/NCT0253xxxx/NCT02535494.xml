      This investigation is one of the first large-scale, prospective attempts to obtain data on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of naloxone distribution among opioid-abusing populations at high risk of&#xD;
      unintentional opioid poisoning. Specifically, opioid abusers will be recruited from drug&#xD;
      detoxification sites as well as those accessing services at needle exchange programs. All&#xD;
      participants (N=700) will receive the standard opioid overdose education and naloxone. One&#xD;
      third of the participants will be randomized to receive additional in-depth psychosocial&#xD;
      education focusing on recognition and prevention of opioid overdose, and appropriate use of&#xD;
      naloxone. Another third of the participants will receive the extensive training and be&#xD;
      required to engage a spouse, partner, relative, or friend in this supplementary intervention.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to randomize individuals to each group [Treatment as Usual (TAU) vs.&#xD;
      Extensively Trained (ET) vs. Extensively Trained with a Significant Other (ETwSO)] and,&#xD;
      through continued follow up over one year, the investigators will compare self-reported&#xD;
      overdose reversal attempts (with and without naloxone use), naloxone-related adverse events,&#xD;
      and changes in patterns of heroin and other drug use.&#xD;

      Study Design A significant cause of mortality among opioid users is overdose, which commonly&#xD;
      occurs following voluntary (opioid detoxification) or involuntary (incarceration) opioid&#xD;
      abstinence. For the purposes of the current application, opioid overdose is defined as use of&#xD;
      an opioid in an amount that results in over-sedation and/or respiratory depression requiring&#xD;
      intervention by medical or non-medical persons. Nearly 85% of overdoses occur in the presence&#xD;
      of a witness. Common methods of intervention by individuals without medical training are&#xD;
      ineffective techniques such as shaking the victim or injecting salt water. Naloxone is an&#xD;
      opioid antagonist that has long been used successfully by trained medical personnel during&#xD;
      emergency resuscitation following opioid overdose. In an effort to reduce fatal and non-fatal&#xD;
      opioid overdose, a number of states are implementing programs in which non-medical personnel&#xD;
      are provided brief instruction in recognizing the signs of opioid overdose and administering&#xD;
      naloxone. However, most of the existing programs are not designed to collect empirical data&#xD;
      on the safety and effectiveness of this intervention. Reporting of naloxone use is voluntary&#xD;
      and without incentive, and the experience of those who have been trained and prescribed&#xD;
      naloxone is not followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed investigation will be one of the first large-scale, prospective attempts to&#xD;
      obtain data on the effectiveness of naloxone distribution among opioid-abusing populations at&#xD;
      high risk of unintentional opioid poisoning. Specifically, opioid abusers will be recruited&#xD;
      from drug detoxification sites as well as those accessing services at needle exchange&#xD;
      programs. All participants (N=700) will receive the standard opioid overdose education and&#xD;
      naloxone. One third of the participants will be randomized to receive additional in-depth&#xD;
      psychosocial education focusing on recognition and prevention of opioid overdose, and&#xD;
      appropriate use of naloxone. Another third of the participants will receive the extensive&#xD;
      training and be required to engage a spouse, partner, relative, or friend in this&#xD;
      supplementary intervention. We plan to randomize individuals to each group [Treatment as&#xD;
      Usual (TAU) vs. Extensively Trained (ET) vs. Extensively Trained with a Significant Other&#xD;
      (ETwSO)] and, through continued follow up over one year, we will compare self-reported&#xD;
      overdose reversal attempts (with and without naloxone use), naloxone-related adverse events,&#xD;
      and changes in patterns of heroin and other drug use. In addition to comparing outcome&#xD;
      variables in the TAU, ET and ETwSO groups prospectively, we will analyze data collected&#xD;
      before study initiation to compare fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in neighborhoods&#xD;
      with facilities that offer overdose prevention training and naloxone to those that do not,&#xD;
      using data provided by our collaborators at the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and&#xD;
      Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Aim (Prospective Study): Determine the extent to which additional psychosocial&#xD;
           intervention can improve the effectiveness of current overdose prevention training as&#xD;
           measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increased frequency of naloxone use (ETwSO &gt; ET &gt; TAU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decreased number of opioid overdoses (ETwSO &lt; ET &lt; TAU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improved recognition of opioid overdose and naloxone indication knowledge (increased&#xD;
           BORRA scores; ETwSO &gt; ET &gt; TAU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Aim (Prospective Study): Determine the potential harms of this novel&#xD;
           naloxone-prescribing practice as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proportion of participants calling 911 in response to an overdose, compared to&#xD;
           participants' recent history of calling 911 in response to an overdose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  risky drug use behavior (e.g. increased heroin/prescription opioid use, increased use of&#xD;
           illicit drug combinations) following training, compared to pre-training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures (Prospective Study): Determine the extent to which additional&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention can improve upon the effectiveness of current overdose prevention&#xD;
      training by: 1) increasing the frequency of naloxone use among ET participants (continuous&#xD;
      variable); 2) decreasing the number of lethal opioid overdoses witnessed and experienced by&#xD;
      the ET group (continuous variable); 3) improving accurate recognition of opioid overdose and&#xD;
      naloxone indication knowledge (increased Brief Overdose Recognition and Response Assessment&#xD;
      (BORRA) score among ET participants (continuous variable). These variables will be assessed&#xD;
      repeatedly over the course of 1 year at: baseline (BL), immediately post-training (T0), 1-,&#xD;
      3-, 6- and 12-months (T1, T3, T6, and T12). The frequency of naloxone use and outcomes of the&#xD;
      overdose reversal attempts will be measured at T1, T3, T6, and T12 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures (Prospective Study): Evaluate the potential harms of this novel&#xD;
      naloxone-prescribing practice as assessed by: 1) decreased proportion of 911 calls in&#xD;
      response to an overdose, compared to participants' previous history of calling 911 while&#xD;
      witnessing an overdose (continuous variable); 2) changes in the use of illicit opioids, other&#xD;
      illegal drugs, or drug combinations following training (longitudinal continuous variable); 3)&#xD;
      prevalence of adverse events related to naloxone administration by non-medical personnel&#xD;
      (continuous variable).&#xD;
