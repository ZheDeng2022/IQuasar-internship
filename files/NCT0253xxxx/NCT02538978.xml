  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, pivotal&#xD;
      clinical study in which subjects are evaluated for prevention of major limb amputation in the&#xD;
      treatment of non-reconstructable Rutherford Category 5 critical limb ischemia (CLI). Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized in 3:1 ratio (device treatment: placebo-control).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Device arm subjects will receive an intra-operative point of care aspiration, preparation and&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of autologous bone marrow cell concentrate (aBMC) into the afflicted&#xD;
      lower index limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow will be collected bilaterally from the patient's iliac crests using the&#xD;
      SurgWerks-CLI Kit aspiration trocar under local anesthesia with mild to moderate sedation or&#xD;
      general anesthesia, processed through the VXP System device to yield a rich cell and plasma&#xD;
      concentrate (&quot;aBMC&quot;). Additionally, 10 mL of autologous peripheral blood will be aspirated&#xD;
      for the placebo preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Arm will receive the aBMC, which will be intramuscularly injected at multiple&#xD;
      mapped sites/angiosomes into the ischemic index limb using the SurgWerks-CLI Kit supplied&#xD;
      Therapeutic Infusion Needles and standard hypodermic needles. The procedure will be performed&#xD;
      in a surgical suite and will take approximately 1.5-2.0 hours to complete. The subjects will&#xD;
      be observed for 24 hours following the procedure for observation and control as necessary of&#xD;
      post-operative pain, bleeding, and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo Arm subjects will undergo an intra-operative point of care aspiration and preparation&#xD;
      of bone marrow via the investigational device exactly as the Treatment Arm. However, instead&#xD;
      of receiving the dosing with the aBMC device output, they will receive an intramuscular&#xD;
      injection of diluted autologous peripheral blood into the afflicted lower index limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At pre-specified follow-up intervals, all subjects in each arm will be evaluated for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major limb amputation free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound healing: Quantitative evaluation of wound(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life assessment (VascuQoL and SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP) - Quantitative evaluation of blood flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rest pain assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachial Index (ABI)&#xD;
