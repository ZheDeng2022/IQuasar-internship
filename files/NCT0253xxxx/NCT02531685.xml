      This study is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an Enterotoxigenic Escherichia&#xD;
      coli (ETEC) candidate vaccine, attenuated recombinant Double Mutant Heat-Labile Toxin (dmLT)&#xD;
      from ETEC, administered by the Intradermal (ID) route. The sample size has been determined&#xD;
      based on the historic sample, not on power calculations.The study will involve 99 subjects&#xD;
      (83 vaccinees and 16 placebo controls) in 4 consecutive cohorts of 16 individuals each (13&#xD;
      vaccinees and 3 placebo controls) and the final cohort of 35 (31 vaccinees and 4 placebos)&#xD;
      subjects. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of dmLT vaccine when&#xD;
      administered in three doses intradermally over a range of dosages in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, single site outpatient Phase 1 study in healthy adults&#xD;
      to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)&#xD;
      candidate vaccine, attenuated recombinant Double Mutant Heat-Labile Toxin (dmLT) from ETEC,&#xD;
      administered by the Intradermal (ID) route. The sample size has been determined based on the&#xD;
      historic sample, not on power calculations.The study will involve 99 subjects (83 vaccinees&#xD;
      and 16 placebo controls) in 4 consecutive cohorts of 16 individuals each (13 vaccinees and 3&#xD;
      placebo controls) and the final cohort of 35 (31 vaccinees and 4 placebos) subjects. A total&#xD;
      of 16 subjects (to retain 10 vaccinees and 1 placebo evaluable subjects) in each cohort 1-4&#xD;
      will initially be recruited, 13 subjects each will receive three separate doses of dmLT&#xD;
      intradermally at 1, 22 and 43-day, and 3 subjects in each cohort will receive three doses of&#xD;
      a placebo (saline) in a blinded fashion. Because of concerns of local reactogencity in cohort&#xD;
      3, cohort 4 will include a sentinel group of 6 subjects that is assessed prior to dosing the&#xD;
      remaining 10 subjects. Proceeding to the remaining subjects will be based on review of safety&#xD;
      data obtained from days 1-14 after the first dose in the sentinel subjects by the ISM, PI and&#xD;
      MM. As this is an outpatient study, subjects will receive their vaccinations and remain in&#xD;
      clinic for observation for a minimum of 30 minutes. Safety data will be reviewed by Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Team or Committee. Subjects may be replaced to ensure 10 evaluable subjects in&#xD;
      each single cohort, as defined by receiving all 3 vaccine doses. If replacement subjects will&#xD;
      be included if needed and they will be randomized per cohort as a single group to include 1&#xD;
      subject to receive placebo to maintain the blind and ensure there are one placebos in each&#xD;
      cohort. Final confirmatory cohort will include up to 35 vaccinees randomly selected to&#xD;
      receive either 1, 2 or 3 vaccine doses or placebo. The study duration is approximately 1.5-2&#xD;
      years, including 6 months of follow-up and approximately 9 months for subject duration. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of dmLT vaccine when administered&#xD;
      in three intradermal doses over a range of dosages levels in healthy adult subjects. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are: 1. To assess long-term safety follow-up from immunization through 6&#xD;
      months post last vaccination; 2. Following ID administration of dmLT vaccine over a range of&#xD;
      dosages levels evaluate dmLT-specific immune response by assays.&#xD;
