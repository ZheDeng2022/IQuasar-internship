      Study reported that providing Oil Palm Phenolics to Nile rats blocked diabetes progression in&#xD;
      this spontaneous diabetes model. The present study aims to determine the beneficial effects&#xD;
      of Oil Palm Phenolics in subjects with pre-diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest the potential of polyphenols as a supplementary treatment to delay or&#xD;
      prevent the onset of diabetes owing to their biological properties. Polyphenols are natural&#xD;
      phytochemical compounds found in fruits and vegetables. The most common group of phenolic&#xD;
      compounds in our diet are phenolic acids and flavonoids. The two main classes are&#xD;
      hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The anti-hyperglycemic&#xD;
      property of polyphenols is mainly contributed by the reduction of dietary carbohydrate&#xD;
      absorption through intestines, improvement of β-cell function and insulin action, stimulation&#xD;
      of insulin secretion, modulation of the enzymes involved in glucose metabolism,&#xD;
      anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key enzymes responsible for the digestion of dietary carbohydrates to glucose are&#xD;
      α-glucosidase and α-amylase. One of the most well-known properties of polyphenols especially&#xD;
      phenolic acids on carbohydrate metabolism is the inhibition of these enzymes. Some&#xD;
      investigations have shown that polyphenols are also able to regulate postprandial glycemia&#xD;
      and inhibit the development of glucose intolerance by a facilitated insulin response and&#xD;
      increased secretion of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagonlike&#xD;
      polypeptide-1 (GLP-1). In addition, polyphenols are able to regulate the key pathways&#xD;
      involved in carbohydrate metabolism and hepatic glucose homeostasis. These include&#xD;
      glycolysis, glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis, which are usually impaired in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study focuses on the glucose-controlling properties of phenolic compounds&#xD;
      extracted from oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), a high oil-producing tropical plant that also&#xD;
      rich in phytochemicals. The major phenolic components in OPP are identified as&#xD;
      caffeoylshikimic acid, protocatechuic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid. OPP has been found to&#xD;
      exert various positive health effects parallel to the well-established physiological benefits&#xD;
      of polyphenols. It has been shown that OPP protects against early type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      encouraging results suggest its role in modulating the development of diabetes. The current&#xD;
      study aims to investigate and determine the effects of oil palm phenolics (OPP) on the blood&#xD;
      glucose control in pre-diabetics.&#xD;
