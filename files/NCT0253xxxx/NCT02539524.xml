      Introduction According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease (GOLD), chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease,&#xD;
      characterized by a persistent not totally reversible limitation of air flow, with a&#xD;
      progressively characteristic associated to the increase of inflammatory lungs and air&#xD;
      pathways reactions to gas and harmful particles. It is one of the main morbid-mortality&#xD;
      causes world wide and, thus, a social health matter. Dyspnoea is a recurrent stressful&#xD;
      symptom of COPD, and is usually followed by anxiety, depression, and decreased quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have addressed the tolerance of yoga breathing exercises by COPD patients, and&#xD;
      some have indeed found a decreased functional load of dyspnoea in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the regular practice (training)&#xD;
      of respiratory Yoga exercises (pranayamas) on the clinical impact and psychosocial aspects:&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and quality of life in COPD patients as a complementary therapy to&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Participants Diagnosed COPD patients will be recruited from the Pulmonary&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Ambulatory of the Clinical Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of the&#xD;
      University of SÃ£o Paulo (HC-FMUSP). All participants will give written consent to participate&#xD;
      of the study, and will be able to exit the study at any point without having to explain the&#xD;
      reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation Based on effect expected proportion in controls of 0.05, assuming an&#xD;
      odds ratio of 25, in a confidence level of 0.95, and a power of 0.8, the sample size for each&#xD;
      group was 9, in a total sample size (both groups) of 18 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design This is a randomized controlled prospective clinical trial, with two&#xD;
      groups: pulmonary rehabilitation for control group (PRG) and pulmonary rehabilitation plus&#xD;
      Yoga group (YG).Randomization was carried out by numbered paper draw: 20 papers numbered from&#xD;
      1-20 were put in a bag from which participants took 1 paper each. Even numbers indicated PRG&#xD;
      and odd ones indicated YG. Medication will not altered during study. Both groups will perform&#xD;
      a 12-week pulmonary rehabilitation program, besides that, YG will perform 24 Yoga breathing&#xD;
      sessions (2 times a week). Participants of both groups will answer questionnaires to evaluate&#xD;
      clinical impact, anxiety, depression and quality of life at study entry and after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga Breathing Exercises Breathing exercises will be based on traditional Hatha Yoga texts&#xD;
      (Hathapradipika and Gheranda Samhita). The chosen exercise was bhastrika pranayama&#xD;
      (kapalabhati followed by surya bedhana). Kapalabhhati consists basically of 20 fast and&#xD;
      vigorous abdominal contractions for expiration, followed by immediate and maximal relaxation&#xD;
      of these muscles for inspiration, and surya bedhana is a slow inspiration through the right&#xD;
      nostril, followed by a comfortable apnoea for the same time of air intake, and a slower yet&#xD;
      comfortable expiration through the left nostril. During training, participants will be&#xD;
      considered at peak training when they are able to perform 10 sets of bhastrika.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation will consist of 30 minutes of aerobic training (cycloergometer or&#xD;
      treadmill) followed by resistance exercises for lower and upper limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations Clinical impact of COPD will be accessed by the COPD Assessment Test; anxiety&#xD;
      will be evaluated by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Quality of Life will be accessed&#xD;
      by the self-reported Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Intra-group comparisons between moments (pre vs. post treatment) will be&#xD;
      done using a paired Student T-test (repeated measures). While inter-groups comparisons (PRG&#xD;
      vs. YG) will be done using the independent measures Student T-test. Significance will be&#xD;
      accepted when p&lt;0.05. SPSS v.21 software will be used to process analysis.&#xD;
