    <textblock>
      Clinics will be randomized to the use of the care pathway for obese pregnant women or&#xD;
      standard care. Women who are (1) up to 20 weeks + 6 days gestation into their pregnancy, (2)&#xD;
      are carrying one baby (not twins) that is healthy (no life threatening anomalies) and (3)&#xD;
      have a Body Mass Index ≥ 30 kg/m², will be included. Data will be obtained from the Ministry&#xD;
      of Health's Antenatal Records, charts, and for those in the intervention group, the care path&#xD;
      (filled out by the practitioners - the participants' obstetrician, midwife, or family&#xD;
      doctor). At the end of the study, practitioners will complete a survey, participate in&#xD;
      structured interviews to understand barriers, facilitators, and motivators of using the care&#xD;
      path.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the feasibility of implementing and testing a clinical care pathway for obese&#xD;
      pregnant women in a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain pilot data on A) process outcomes (steps of the pathway, e.g. what % of obese women&#xD;
      receive a screen for diabetes) B) clinical outcomes (e.g. what % of obese women receive a&#xD;
      diagnosis of diabetes), C) provider outcomes (e.g. Is the intervention acceptable, feasible &amp;&#xD;
      efficient? Barriers &amp; facilitators to use, effectiveness? [Structured interviews])&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose a pilot cluster RCT with a 1:1 allocation ratio of clinics randomized&#xD;
      to the clinical care pathway for obese pregnant women (intervention group) versus standard&#xD;
      care (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have followed the SPIRIT statement (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations&#xD;
      for Interventional Trials)&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of randomization will be the clinic providing pregnancy care. All pregnant women who&#xD;
      meet inclusion criteria at a clinic randomized to the intervention will receive the&#xD;
      intervention, while all pregnant women who meet the inclusion criteria at a clinic randomized&#xD;
      to usual care will receive usual care. Investigators used a 1:1 allocation between the&#xD;
      intervention and the control groups, with paired randomization by type of clinic&#xD;
      (obstetrician-lead versus midwife-lead, since they likely differ regarding patient&#xD;
      characteristics and health care, and pairing will aid in providing a reasonable balance of&#xD;
      characteristics with a small sample size.) Investigators generated the randomization sequence&#xD;
      using www.randomization.com. The randomization seed for obstetrical clinics was &quot;21262&quot; and&#xD;
      the randomization seed for midwifery clinics was &quot;23340&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCESS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinics will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group, in a paired fashion&#xD;
      (so that one of the two midwifery clinics is randomized to the intervention group and the&#xD;
      other to the control, given that both the clinical care and the women in the clinics are more&#xD;
      likely to be similar between these two clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study involves a minimal/no-risk intervention, the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics&#xD;
      Board (HiREB) has approved clinics to be randomized and all eligible women at intervention&#xD;
      clinics to receive the intervention (and all eligible women at control clinics to receive&#xD;
      routine care); given that the intervention is standard of care, individual participant&#xD;
      consent is not required. Informed, written consent of staff at the clinics which will be&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention will be obtained prior to semi-structured interviews at the&#xD;
      end of the study. Investigators do not plan an interim analysis given the minimal/no-risk&#xD;
      nature of the intervention, and the pilot nature of the study, and hence investigators will&#xD;
      not have a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), but will have a Steering Commitee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at the end of pregnancy from the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 2-page Antenatal Records mandated by the Ministry of Health: baseline characteristics*,&#xD;
           clinical and process outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. clinical care path (in intervention group): feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. clinic and hospital charts: process and clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. care provider survey and structured interviews (in intervention group): provider&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baseline characteristics will include: maternal age, education level, pre-existing&#xD;
                diabetes or hypertension or other co-morbidities, gestational age upon first visit&#xD;
                to randomized clinic, pre-pregnancy body mass index, gravidity, and parity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have provided a sample size justification, rather than a calculation for the&#xD;
      following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 'In general, sample size calculations may not be required for some pilot studies'&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Given that this is a feasibility study, it was not designed to have statistical power to&#xD;
           detect a difference between the 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The size of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) required for a sample size&#xD;
           calculation is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was based on feasibility considerations as follows: Investigators&#xD;
      conservatively estimate there would be a total of 142 participants available (71 per group)&#xD;
      over 10 months of recruitment, at 8 clinics, with 80% of women in the intervention clinics&#xD;
      receiving the intervention, (and 100% of women in the control group receiving usual care), a&#xD;
      variable rate of obesity from 20-30% depending on the clinic, and a variable proportion of&#xD;
      women presenting to the clinic for prenatal care at &lt;20 weeks+6 days gestation ranging from&#xD;
      15% in obstetrician-lead clinics to 85% in midwifery-lead clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This number of patients, 71 per group, exceeds one common number for a sample size for a&#xD;
      pilot study, the &quot;of at least 50 per group&quot;, since additional power is required for cluster&#xD;
      designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics and co-morbid conditions will be compared between women receiving&#xD;
      the intervention versus those in the control group. Since the design of the study involves&#xD;
      paired randomization, hence paired analysis will be performed. Continuous data will be&#xD;
      compared using a paired t test for means (standard deviations) or Wilcoxon test for paired&#xD;
      medians (interquartile range), as appropriate. Paired proportions for categorical variables&#xD;
      will be compared using a McNemar's test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the primary outcome, feasibility, will be based on descriptive statistics of&#xD;
      the proportions (%) of women in the intervention group who have the care path completed, and&#xD;
      for whom care providers would recommend it. Analysis will be done at the patient level with&#xD;
      the exception of care provider outcomes. Investigators will use intention to treat analysis,&#xD;
      i.e. outcomes of all eligible women at the intervention clinic will be evaluated within the&#xD;
      intervention group whether she received the intervention or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the secondary outcomes (process outcomes and clinical outcomes) will be done&#xD;
      using McNemar's test to compare paired proportions of women in the intervention group who&#xD;
      receive the recommended care to the proportion of women in the control group who do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform sensitivity analyses: 1) &quot;per-protocol analysis&quot;, i.e.&#xD;
      per-clinical care path and comparing the women in the intervention clinics for whom the&#xD;
      clinical care path was actually used to all other women (both those who were at an&#xD;
      intervention clinic but did not receive the clinical care path and those in the control&#xD;
      group); 2) comparing results in women with and without complete data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform subgroup analysis to examine the outcomes at obstetrician clinics&#xD;
      separately from those at midwifery clinics. Potential covariates which may not be evenly&#xD;
      distributed between the intervention and control groups will be controlled for (e.g. age,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, etc). Since observations within each participating clinic will be&#xD;
      assumed more likely to be similar than observations between clinics, a logistic model using a&#xD;
      conditional (for paired data) generalized estimating equation (GEE) method will be performed&#xD;
      to account for this clustering effect within clinics, incorporating both within-clinic and&#xD;
      between-clinic variations. An intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and variance&#xD;
      inflation factor (VIF) will also be calculated to assess the impact of the clustering effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be considered statistically significant at two-sided alpha=0.05 . A modified&#xD;
      Bonferroni correction will be used given the multiple secondary outcomes. Analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using SAS-PC statistical software (version 9.2; SAS institute Inc, Cary, NC).&#xD;
