  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if melatonin administration to end-of-life patients&#xD;
      is effective in preventing the development of delirium compared with those who do not receive&#xD;
      this treatment. Delirium is a difficult to control symptom commonly seen in patients at the&#xD;
      end-of-life. A person who is delirious is unable to think clearly and cannot make sense of&#xD;
      what is going on around him/her.&#xD;

      All patients over the age of 19 admitted to the tertiary palliative care unit and hospice&#xD;
      residence who could meet the study requirements will be asked within 48 hours of admission&#xD;
      for their interest in participating in the study. All those who interested in taking part&#xD;
      will be referred to a research nurse for initial assessment for eligibility. For eligible&#xD;
      patients who have consented to participate in the study, a research nurse who is not directly&#xD;
      involved in the patient's care will approach the patient. A detailed subject information&#xD;
      containing pertinent information on the study will be provided and ample time (up to 24&#xD;
      hours) will be given for consideration. The research nurse will explain the consent form to&#xD;
      the patient and obtain consent signature if he/she agrees to participate. Once formal consent&#xD;
      obtained, the eligible patient will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned randomly to one of the two arms of the study and receive nightly&#xD;
      doses of melatonin 0.5 mg or placebo. Patients will be monitored for 14 days or until the&#xD;
      development of delirium or the occurrence of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed twice a day for delirium, around the end of each nursing shift,&#xD;
      i.e. every 12 hours (at 0330 &amp; 1530h) for fourteen consecutive days or until the development&#xD;
      of delirium. The diagnostic tool used to detect delirium is the Confusion Assessment Method&#xD;
      (CAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is incidence of delirium, defined according to the Confusion&#xD;
      Assessment Method (CAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on harm will be collected. For example, adverse effects from melatonin such as excessive&#xD;
      daytime drowsiness, headaches, nausea , transient depression have been reported in the&#xD;
      medical literature. Patients will also be monitored closely for the development any of these&#xD;
      adverse effects during the treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>The CAM diagnostic scale is a diagnostic instrument for identification of delirium for use in alert, non-intubated patients . It is a widely accepted and reliable tool for the detection of delirium in multiple clinical and research settings. The CAM method detects delirium using four key delirium criteria: (a) acute mental status change, (b) inattention, (c) disorganized thinking, and (d) altered level of consciousness. Delirium is diagnosed when criteria (a) and (b) plus either (c) or (d) are present.</description>
