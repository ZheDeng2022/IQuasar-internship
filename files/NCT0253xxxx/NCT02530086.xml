      A prospective randomized trial comparing non-operative management of small bowel obstruction&#xD;
      due to adhesions with or without a naso-gastric tube (NGT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in a prospective randomized design using the patient population&#xD;
      admitted to any of the general surgery services at Yale New Haven Hospital and presenting&#xD;
      with the presumed diagnosis of adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) to Yale New Haven&#xD;
      Hospital. All patients will be at least 30 days from any prior abdominal operative procedure.&#xD;
      Diagnosis of SBO will be by CT scan of the abdomen thereby excluding patients with&#xD;
      obstruction due to incarcerated hernias and minimizing the possibility the obstruction is due&#xD;
      to malignancy, volvulus or other cause. All patients selected for non-operative management by&#xD;
      the attending physician will be eligible for randomization to either the &quot;Nasogastric Tube&#xD;
      Decompression&quot; or &quot;No Decompression&quot; groups. Eligible patients will be within 6 hours of&#xD;
      hospital admission and not have had a naso-gastric tube (NGT) placed. Patients who have a NGT&#xD;
      placed by emergency physicians prior to consultation to the emergency general surgery will be&#xD;
      excluded. Patients who require NGT placement prior to being approached for enrollment or&#xD;
      prior to randomization will, if agreeable, be enrolled in a prospective observational group&#xD;
      of patients that will have the same data elements collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent from the patient or his/her surrogate has been obtained, eligible patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to either the &quot;Nasogastric Tube Decompression&quot; or the &quot;No Decompression&quot; group.&#xD;
      Sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes will be maintained in the locked office of the&#xD;
      surgical critical care fellow in the surgical intensive care unit. The grouping assignment&#xD;
      within these envelopes will be generated from computerized random number tables. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to nasogastric decompression will have a NGT placed within one hour of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients in the &quot;No Decompression&quot; group develop recurrent or intractable emesis&#xD;
      unresponsive to anti-emetic medication or are deemed unsafe to be trialed with anti-emetic&#xD;
      medication due to a change in mental status by the attending physician they will have an NGT&#xD;
      placed and they will be followed as a third group of patients that failed management without&#xD;
      NGT decompression. Recurrent and/or intractable emesis will be defined as two or more&#xD;
      episodes of emesis of at least 50cc within a twelve hour period or a single large volume&#xD;
      emesis of 300cc or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these patients NGT placement will not be mandatory however if patients do develop this&#xD;
      volume of emesis NGT placement will be considered consistent with the protocol. Change in&#xD;
      mental status will be loosely defined as the deterioration of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) to&#xD;
      less than 14, however this will remain at the discretion of the attending physician. For&#xD;
      patients that have failure of NGT placement they will be managed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending surgeon but analyzed using an intention to treat methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other standard care for patients with SBO including intravenous fluids, correction of&#xD;
      electrolytes and management of chronic medical problems will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending surgeon. All patients will be monitored daily with clinical examination for the&#xD;
      development of complications (vomiting, worsening abdominal pain, abnormal vital signs,&#xD;
      leukocytosis, fevers). Patients' subjective comfort levels will also be assessed daily in&#xD;
      each group using a visual analog scale. Pain will be managed will be with IV morphine unless&#xD;
      an allergy is present or develops in which case an alternative narcotic will be used based on&#xD;
      the decision of the treating physician. Improvement will be followed by return of bowel&#xD;
      function, improving abdominal pain and resolution of symptoms. The time taken to resolution&#xD;
      of symptoms in each group will be followed, as well as the relative number of patients&#xD;
      improving and deteriorating. All care decisions beyond the initial NGT placement, choice of&#xD;
      anti-emetic and choice of analgesic will be at the discretion of the attending surgeon. These&#xD;
      decisions may include but are not limited to NGT placement and removal, laboratory testing,&#xD;
      imaging (Abdominal X-rays and/or CT scan), diet advancement, and need for operative&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should a patient chose to withdraw from the study at any point after randomization management&#xD;
      of the NGT will then also come within the purview of the attending physician. This may&#xD;
      include placement of a NGT if the patient had been randomized to the no NGT arm or removal&#xD;
      even if in the NGT was placed as part of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Hospital length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain level, as measured by the visual analog scale and documented by the treating nurse.&#xD;
           The maximum and mean score for each day will be recorded. Pain will also be assessed by&#xD;
           the amount of used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of NGT use in hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The number of abdominal and chest imaging tests prior to discharge or operation&#xD;
           whichever comes first.&#xD;
