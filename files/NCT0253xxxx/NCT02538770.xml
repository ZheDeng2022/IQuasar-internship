  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral respiratory infections are common and often require use of health care resources.&#xD;
      Patients receive inappropriate bacterial antibiotics, which has many problems including&#xD;
      side-effects, development of resistance and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small portion of the infections leads to severe clinical manifestations including&#xD;
      hospitalisations and deaths. The significance of influenza virus is well known and it is&#xD;
      actively detected in all age groups. However, the benefits of detecting other respiratory&#xD;
      viruses have mainly been studied among children but not among adults. The development of&#xD;
      multiplex PCR technique has provided a new and sensitive method for diagnosing a large panel&#xD;
      of viruses. To convince the economical benefits of the rapid viral diagnostic in adult&#xD;
      infectious patient, more evidence is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our randomized study, nasal and pharyngeal samples from the patients evaluated at the&#xD;
      emergency clinic of internal medicine in the University Hospital of Oulu because of any&#xD;
      respiratory symptom, chest pain or fever, will be collected. The samples will be tested for&#xD;
      16 different respiratory viruses by using Anyplex TMII RV16 Detection. The adult participants&#xD;
      will be randomized in two groups. In one group the results of the testing will be reported&#xD;
      for the attending physician as soon as possible, and in the other group 7 days after&#xD;
      sampling. The effect of this delay to patient care is monitored. Also the results of children&#xD;
      and adults are compared as well as results of men and women. The hypothesis is that rapid&#xD;
      viral diagnostics shortens the length of admission and diminishes the use of bacterial&#xD;
      antibiotics. New information on the viral epidemiology among children and adults is provided&#xD;
      and clinical manifestations of specific viral infections in adults are described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated 1500 samples are also tested for 5 different respiratory bacteria by Anyplex TM&#xD;
      II RB5 Detection. These results will be examined after completion of the study period. The&#xD;
      benefits of rapid bacterial detection are evaluated in respect to the clinical course of the&#xD;
      disease and considering the infection control aspects as well.&#xD;

      Aim and Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To find out how the modern rapid multiplex-PCR based respiratory virus detection method&#xD;
           affects the patient care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine does it shorten the length of admission and reduce antibiotic consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the seasonality of different viruses in children and adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate the development and progress of an epidemic&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study the differences in the prevalence and severity of infections between genders&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Describe clinical manifestations of different viral infections in adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. View more closely certain subgroups such as patients with chest pain in respect to&#xD;
           different viral epidemics and their effect on the hospital admission rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Evaluate the information provided by the bacterial detection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Our hospital is both a regional and a university hospital at the same time. Patients&#xD;
      come to our clinic from a quite large area surrounding the city of Oulu and they represent&#xD;
      the general population of the area well. The study population will be recruited 2014-2015 in&#xD;
      the emergency clinics for pediatric and internal medicine patients in the Oulu University&#xD;
      Hospital. Participants are patients with respiratory infection symptoms, chest pain or fever.&#xD;
      Fever is determined as body temperature of 38 degrees centigrade or more measured either in&#xD;
      the hospital or at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a randomized clinical trial evaluating the impact of modern multiplex&#xD;
      PCR based respiratory virus diagnostics on treatment and outcome of adult patients.&#xD;
      Participants are randomized in two groups with results being reported either immediately or&#xD;
      after a week (Picture 1). In children the viral PCR diagnostics is already routinely used and&#xD;
      collection of nasal and pharyngeal samples continues normally. All pediatric results are&#xD;
      reported immediately. Approval of the ethical review board of the Northern Ostrobothnia&#xD;
      Hospital District has been acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course of the study Data collection All patients entering the internal medicine emergency&#xD;
      clinics because of respiratory infection symptoms (cough, rhinitis, shortness of breath, sore&#xD;
      throat), chest pain or fever will be given the opportunity to participate in the study. After&#xD;
      signing an informed consent a nasal and a pharyngeal swab will be taken for viral&#xD;
      examination. Adult patients are randomized in two different groups. In one group the results&#xD;
      of the viral detection are reported immediately and in the other group they are reported 7&#xD;
      days after sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be analyzed in the microbiological laboratory by real time PCR method Anyplex&#xD;
      TMII to detect genome of 16 different respiratory viruses and of 5 different bacterial&#xD;
      pathogen (Table 1). Results in the delayed group will be given earlier in the case the&#xD;
      clinician is requesting them. The results of the bacterial findings will be analyzed after&#xD;
      completion of the study since the clinical relevance of them is not clear yet. The&#xD;
      bacteriological diagnostic of the patients during the study relies on the routinely used&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attending clinician decides the treatment and care of the patient independently.&#xD;
      Patient's chart will be reviewed for the course of disease, antibiotic use, ICU care and&#xD;
      length of hospital stay. The results of key laboratory tests and microbiological findings&#xD;
      will be collected. Radiological findings will be registered. At discharge, the participants&#xD;
      are asked to report the duration of the symptoms, absence from work and the date of a&#xD;
      possible doctors follow up. The population register centre will be used at the end of the&#xD;
      study to find out the number of deceased, and their time and cause of the death will be&#xD;
      recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Table 1. Microbes detected from the study samples Viruses (AnyplexTMII RV16 Detection)&#xD;
      Adenovirus Influenza A/B virus Parainfluenza virus1/2/3/4 Rhinovirus A/B/C Respiratory&#xD;
      syncytial virus A/B Bocavirus 1/2/3/4 Metapneumovirus Coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43 Enterovirus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The length of hospital admission and the use of bacterial antibiotics is&#xD;
      compared between the randomized groups. Viral findings of children and adults will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The emergence of viruses in different areas of the district as well as in&#xD;
      different age groups is examined. The differences in clinical picture and in microbiological&#xD;
      findings between genders are viewed. The symptoms and clinical findings in adults with&#xD;
      detected RSV or metapneumovirus are described. The bacterial findings are evaluated and&#xD;
      compared with clinical data to determine the significance of the information provided by the&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of the study In our hospital major part of the viral respiratory infection diagnostics&#xD;
      in adults has been accomplished by influenza virus antigen detection. Now a more sensitive&#xD;
      measure for detecting 16 different respiratory pathogens from nasopharyngeal sample is&#xD;
      available. We will determine whether more specific identification of the etiological agent&#xD;
      affects the patient care. If the accurate diagnostics diminishes inappropriate antibiotic use&#xD;
      it saves the patient from potential side effects and the society from unnecessary costs.&#xD;
      Importantly it also saves the microbial flora from the antibiotic selection pressure which is&#xD;
      considered to facilitate the emergence of antibiotic resistance. In children the benefits of&#xD;
      accurate diagnostics have been recognized but in adults this is still under progress. This&#xD;
      study is designed to demonstrate these advantages in adults.&#xD;
