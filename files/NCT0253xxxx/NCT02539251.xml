  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection and intervention for developmental delays are crucial in promoting healthy&#xD;
      child development, hence the need for formal screening. In the Arabic speaking population&#xD;
      developmental screening tools are scarce in the native language and there is a need for such&#xD;
      a tool for pediatricians and health care workers to use routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to translate, adapt and validate the newest version of ASQ (ASQ-3) to Arabic&#xD;
      (A-ASQ-3) based on the previously published study showing that ASQ-2 was culturally&#xD;
      sensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previously translated A-ASQ-2 will be revised and updated to match the new ASQ-3, then&#xD;
      revised by experts in child development. Questionnaires will be adapted and field-tested on&#xD;
      15 subjects per age group (total of 75). For validity, the revised version will be tested on&#xD;
      500 Lebanese children (100 children per age group) selected from all Lebanese governates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to generate a culturally adapted and validated Arabic tool for screening&#xD;
      children for any developmental delay up to 3 years of age. This tool once published will be&#xD;
      available for use by primary care providers and caregivers in Arabic speaking countries. It&#xD;
      may be used to screen children for developmental delay as early as 7 months therefore&#xD;
      prompting prevention of further delay by starting early intervention and promoting child&#xD;
      development.&#xD;

      The Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ) is a developmental screening questionnaire for&#xD;
      parents to answer regarding their children's level of growth and development between the ages&#xD;
      of 7 months and 3 years. This questionnaire was translated into Arabic in order to adapt it&#xD;
      for the Arab speaking culture. For the first phase of this study, aiming to adapt and&#xD;
      field-test this translated version, parents of eligible children will be recruited from the&#xD;
      AUBMC outpatient clinics (OPD and Private Clinics). Interested parents of eligible children&#xD;
      will be invited to a private meeting in private settings where the study will be thoroughly&#xD;
      explained. 75 parents (fathers or mothers) will be interviewed and asked to answer the ASQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a later stage, 500 parents will be interviewed and asked to answer the ASQ in order to&#xD;
      test its validity. A list of all day care centers in Lebanon will be retrieved from the&#xD;
      ministry of public health website and a list of all Lebanese pediatricians will be sought&#xD;
      from the both Lebanese Order of Physicians (Beirut and Tripoli). Eligible day cares are the&#xD;
      ones with at least 15 children between 7 and 36 months. Eligible physicians are those who are&#xD;
      actively seeing patients aged between 7 and 36 months with a patient load of at least 10 per&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize selection bias and to include different socioeconomic groups, a random sample of&#xD;
      eligible day care centers and pediatricians from across the Lebanese governorates (Beirut,&#xD;
      Mount Lebanon, South Lebanon, North Lebanon and Beqaa) will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining the permission of the selected day care centers and pediatricians, flyers&#xD;
      explaining the study and inviting parents to participate will be distributed and posted at&#xD;
      those centers. Parents of eligible children who contact us and show interest in participating&#xD;
      will be invited for a meeting in private settings. Construct validation will be done using&#xD;
      varimax rotation, concurrent validity will be done by correlating ASQ-3 scores with Bayley&#xD;
      scale for infant development scores. Sensitivity and specificity will also be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be asked some questions regarding their child's growth in order to evaluate&#xD;
      several aspects of his/her developmental skills. It takes 10-15 minutes to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaires. After completing the questionnaire, the child's developmental status will be&#xD;
      evaluated and any risk of delay will be detected.&#xD;
