    <textblock>
      A double blinded randomized controlled study comparing pre-procedural IV Paracetamol versus&#xD;
      IV placebo (normal saline). The patients will be randomized to either receiving IV&#xD;
      paracetamol or saline infusions before undergoing radiofrequency lesioning of two levels of&#xD;
      medial branch nerves of the lumbar facets. The primary outcome will be potential differences&#xD;
      in pain control. The secondary outcomes will be changes in quality of life (QoL) and&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADLs). We will also be comparing potential differences in the&#xD;
      amounts of post-procedure pain medications taken by the patients in each wing of the study&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experiment will take place in the Chaim Sheba TelHashomer Medical Center, Tel Aviv,&#xD;
      Israel. Patients will be recruited from the hospital's Pain Management outpatient facility&#xD;
      from those appropriate for the procedure involving Radiofrequency Ablation of the Medial&#xD;
      Branch of the Facet Nerve. After receiving the hospital's Helsinki approval, the P.I. and/or&#xD;
      other designated staff in the department will approach relevant patients (in line with the&#xD;
      mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria), describe the procedure, and collect informed&#xD;
      consent if the patient is interested in participating. Consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      patient during the patient visit when the option of RF is agreed upon and scheduled for the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not receive any monetary compensation. It will be stressed to prospective&#xD;
      subjects that participation in the research will not have any implications on their treatment&#xD;
      in the hospital, or the relationship with their current healthcare providers. The patients&#xD;
      will be advised that they may unconditionally revoke their consent at any given time during&#xD;
      participation without repercussion on future care. Pt will be advised that they may withdraw&#xD;
      from participation at any time. Data collected during the experiment will be kept in a secure&#xD;
      location and will be shredded after the project's completion. All information regarding&#xD;
      patient treatment both inside and outside of the project will be kept in the utmost of&#xD;
      confidentiality, respecting both legal and ethical constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be double-blindedly assigned to either IV Paracetamol or Placebo group when&#xD;
      they arrive for their normally scheduled appointment for Radiofrequency ablation of the&#xD;
      Median Branch Facet Nerve. Both randomization and the blinding will be done by the pharmacy&#xD;
      of Tel Hashomer. Paracetamol will also be stored and procured from the Tel Hashomer pharmacy.&#xD;
      Patients will be advised that neither the medical staff nor they themselves will know which&#xD;
      they are receiving. Patients will receive a slow-infusion of either Placebo ( normal saline)&#xD;
      or IV Paracetamol 1 g/100 ml solution over a period of 15 minutes prior to the start of the&#xD;
      procedure. During this stage the patient will be monitored, initial VAS score recorded, and&#xD;
      pre-operative vital signs assessed (e.g.- B/P, HR, SO2.) The same parameters will be recorded&#xD;
      during the RF as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All saline bags will be numbered, mixed, and hung by one of the nurses working in the&#xD;
      preprocedure/admission area of the pain department. The nursing staff will hold the log book&#xD;
      containing the numbered IV infusion which each patient receives, to be recorded on the&#xD;
      patients record for future reference. The treating physician, circulating nurse, and the&#xD;
      patient will not have any knowledge as to whether the patient is receiving Paracetamol or&#xD;
      Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will enter the procedure room to undergo radiofrequency ablation once the&#xD;
      infusion of IV Paracetamol/Placebo is completed. The patient will sign consent for the&#xD;
      procedure. The patient will be placed in the prone position. The area of skin over which the&#xD;
      procedure will be performed will be prepared and draped in standard sterile fashion. 1.5cc of&#xD;
      Midazolam will be given for lite anesthesia. Fluoroscopy will be used to identify the&#xD;
      specific site of the injections and radiofrequency. Lidocaine 1% will be inject to the site&#xD;
      of the procedure to provide local anesthesia. Radiofrequency probe needles will be place to&#xD;
      the determined medial branches under fluoroscopic guidance, with confirmation of placement&#xD;
      established by electrical parameters. The a dilution of 2cc Lidocaine 1% 1cc and Depomedrol&#xD;
      40mg will be injected prior to ablation of each nerve. Ablation of the nerve will be&#xD;
      conducted with thermal heat of 80 degrees Celsius for one minute for each nerve. 3cc solution&#xD;
      of Lidocaine 1% + Depomedrol 40mg will be injected around each nerve after the ablation has&#xD;
      been performed. A sterile bandage will be placed over the needle entry points, and the&#xD;
      patient will be transferred to the recovery area for further monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure the patient will be taken to the recovery room in the pain clinic and&#xD;
      will be monitored for 30 minutes. Vitals will be assessed immediately post-op in the recovery&#xD;
      room and again after 30 minutes, just prior to discharge. They will be asked when they get to&#xD;
      the recovery room and again after 30 minutes, prior to discharge, to assess their level of&#xD;
      pain. Requests for additional analgesia (Optalgin, etc) will be assessed. Pt will be asked at&#xD;
      0 minutes and at 30 minutes following entry to recovery room if they are experiencing any of&#xD;
      a number of side effects and there responses noted in their records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with a packet containing copies of the Oswestry and Roland&#xD;
      Disability Questionaires. The patients will complete both questionaires daily (at noon) for&#xD;
      the first week and then weekly for the remaining 5 weeks of follow up. The questionnaire&#xD;
      evaluate the patients' pain level, level of functioning, and measures of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be seen for follow up appointment with their treating pain physician in the&#xD;
      Pain Department of Tel HaShomer 6 weeks following the procedure. Patients will return with&#xD;
      their journals and will have their vitals, pain assessment score, and other symptoms (if any)&#xD;
      assessed once more at the final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results A comprehensive review and statistical analysis of data will be conducted at the&#xD;
      completion of the study. Changes in pain scores, as reported by the patients via the VAS&#xD;
      scores, will be analyzed as change in pain score over time. Cumulative VAS scores for each&#xD;
      group will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test and the t-test. Changes in ADL and QoL&#xD;
      will be measure using the Roland Disability Questionnaire and the Oswestry low back pain&#xD;
      disability scales. Both the Roland Disability Questionnaire and the Oswestry scores will be&#xD;
      completed by the patients both before the procedure and at the six week completion. Results&#xD;
      from both will be statistically analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U-test and by t-test.&#xD;
