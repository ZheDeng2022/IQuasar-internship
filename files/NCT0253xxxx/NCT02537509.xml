    <textblock>
      Spaced phototherapy sessions during winter as add-on therapy in combination with vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation or not, could be beneficial to improve disease LTC in AD patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major therapeutic challenge in patient with Atopic Dermatitis is long-term control of&#xD;
      disease activity (LTC), for which the current TAT-based pro-active strategy does not meet all&#xD;
      the needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phototherapy is a good candidate: it is widely used as a second-line treatment in AD with&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy. However, only short-term control has been evaluated; and only 2-3&#xD;
      times a week intensive schedules have been tested and are used in current practice. A novel&#xD;
      phototherapy regimen would be required for disease LTC, allowing a trade-off between disease&#xD;
      control, UV-induced risks, and patient adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D supplementation is another good candidate: several studies have shown lower serum&#xD;
      levels of vitamin D to be correlated with more severe AD; and three short-term, low-power&#xD;
      low-quality, placebo-controlled randomised trials testing vitamin D supplementation yielded&#xD;
      conflicting results, leaving its therapeutic efficacy undecided for short-term control, and&#xD;
      unknown for LTC.&#xD;
