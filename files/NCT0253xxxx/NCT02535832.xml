  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle strength helps determine a person's quality of life and functional independence.&#xD;
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often suffer from muscle weakness and a pre-diabetic&#xD;
      condition called insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn why patients with rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA) suffer from muscle weakness.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator plans to enroll 80 participants with RA and 30 non-RA controls between the&#xD;
      ages of 35 and 65 between August 2015 and December 2018 (arm-1). The investigator plan to&#xD;
      perform a needle muscle biopsy in a subset of participants who agree to undergo this&#xD;
      procedure. From the total cohort number of enrolled participants, 36 participants will be&#xD;
      identified as having insulin resistance and recruit them to participate in the pioglitazone&#xD;
      study (arm-2). Those patients who elect to participate further in the pioglitazone/ placebo&#xD;
      study will sign separate consent document during Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since RA is more common in women, it is anticipated that 2/3 of the participants will be&#xD;
      women. Children, pregnant or breast-feeding women, adults with impaired consent capacity, or&#xD;
      vulnerable populations will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cross-sectional study, after having provided informed consent, participants will&#xD;
      undergo a history and physical exam by a rheumatologist to verify diagnosis of RA or that&#xD;
      they are a healthy volunteer. All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified by the&#xD;
      examining physician. During this visit, the participants will complete questionnaires&#xD;
      including the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaire and SF-36.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning to assess muscle&#xD;
      mass of the upper leg (dominant and non-dominant sides), as well as computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      to assess body composition. Women of child bearing age will undergo urine pregnancy testing.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo strength testing and a fatiguing bout of knee extension exercise.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for glucose, insulin, liver function tests (LFT), lipid profile,&#xD;
      rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), insulin like growth&#xD;
      factor (IGF-1), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), insulin like growth factor binding protein-1&#xD;
      (IGFBP-1) and insulin like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). All participants will&#xD;
      be asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 day to measure physical activity. The participants&#xD;
      will be scheduled to return to Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) within 7&#xD;
      days for biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pioglitazone clinical trial study, 36 participants who have insulin resistance will be&#xD;
      recruited to receive pioglitazone. After the participants have provided informed consent,&#xD;
      women of childbearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test at visits 1, 3 and 6.&#xD;
      The investigator will review participant eligibility and participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either pioglitazone 45 mg daily or matching placebo for 15 weeks. Below is the dosing&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will start by taking increasing doses for three weeks as follows: 1 capsule&#xD;
      (15mg) per day for 7 days, 1 capsule per day (30 mg) for 7 days, and 1 capsule (45mg), if&#xD;
      tolerated. Participants will continue this dose (45 mg) throughout the 10 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      The placebo or non-pioglitazone capsules will look identical to the pioglitazone capsules,&#xD;
      but will contain inert substances, and the escalating dose schedule will be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants experience difficulty with the drug, the investigators will slow the pace of&#xD;
      dose escalation. If they cannot take 45 mg/day, then they may be dropped from the study. The&#xD;
      placebo capsules will look identical to the pioglitazone capsules, but will contain inert&#xD;
      substances. Drug compounding and dispensing (including blinding) will be handled by the&#xD;
      University of Kentucky's Investigational Drug Service, which routinely serves this function.&#xD;
      All participants in the pioglitazone study will undergo a second round of assessments. During&#xD;
      the 15-week drug trial, participants will receive monthly phone calls to monitor for adverse&#xD;
      effects. Additionally, participants will be asked to fill out a daily medication diary to&#xD;
      monitor compliance and adverse effects. A skeletal muscle biopsy will be performed after&#xD;
      treatment with pioglitazone/ placebo, which will take place within 1-2 weeks after the second&#xD;
      round of assessments following pioglitazone treatment.&#xD;
