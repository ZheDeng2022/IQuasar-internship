  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase Ib/II, multi-center, open-label study of IMCgp100 as a single agent and&#xD;
      in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and/or tremelimumab in metastatic cutaneous&#xD;
      melanoma. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of IMCgp100&#xD;
      in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736, programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] inhibitor),&#xD;
      tremelimumab (CLTA-4 inhibitor), and the combination of durvalumab with tremelimumab compared&#xD;
      to single-agent IMCgp100 alone. The study will enroll patients who have metastatic melanoma&#xD;
      that is refractory to treatment with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor in the metastatic setting. This&#xD;
      study will also evaluate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of IMCgp100&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with advanced non-uveal melanoma who progressed on prior PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitors approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma; patients with BRAF mutations must&#xD;
      be refractory to approved BRAF-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent biologic evidence indicates that optimal responses to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)&#xD;
      directed therapy require the presence of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment and thus&#xD;
      therapies such as IMCgp100 that recruit these effector cells to the tumor may overcome&#xD;
      pre-existing resistance to checkpoint blockade. This emerging biology of checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      resistance suggests the combination of IMCgp100 with checkpoint inhibition may have enhanced&#xD;
      activity in patients with pre-existing resistance.&#xD;

    <description>The number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) observed during the DLT observation period. DLT observation period for the Arms 1 to 3 Phase Ib cohorts will be the first 2 cycles of treatment (C1D1 until C2D28). The DLT observation period for Arm 4 Phase Ib will be from C1D22 to C2D14. A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value that occurs during the relevant DLT period which is assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications, occurs during the DLT Observation Period or is Grade 3 or higher per NCI CTCAE version 4.03, or as specified in the protocol.</description>
