    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Aneurysm Occlusion (RCAO) Without Retreatment at 12-Month Post Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months Post Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Raymond-Roy Grading scale used for judging intracranial aneurysm (IA) endosaccular embolization success ranges from Grade I to III where, Grade I is completion occlusion with no flow of contrast seen in the aneurysm sac, Grade II is partial occlusion with some flow or eddy flow in the aneurysm sac and Grade III is residual aneurysm or Incomplete occlusion with apparent flow in the aneurysm sac. RCAO was assessed by the Independent Core Laboratory, complete aneurysm occlusion is defined as an aneurysm in which a Grade I (completion occlusion), is achieved on the Raymond Scale at the relevant post-procedure angiogram, without additional procedures for treatment of the aneurysm since the index procedure. Participants who were retreated (retreatment includes staged procedures) prior to the 12-month were considered not to have achieved complete aneurysm occlusion.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Major Ipsilateral Stroke and/or Death Due to Ipsilateral Stroke at 12 Months Post Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 Months Post Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of a major ipsilateral stroke and/or death due to ipsilateral stroke was evaluated from the start of the index procedure until completion of the 12-month follow-up. A major ipsilateral stroke is defined as a new neurological event which is ipsilateral and in the vascular distribution territory of the stenting procedure and that results in an increase of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 4 on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) as compared to baseline and persists for greater than 24 hours. The NIHSS is a systematic assessment tool that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. The scores range from 0 to 42 with a score of 0 indicates no stroke; 1-4 as minor stroke; 5-15 as moderate stroke; 15-20 as moderate/severe stroke; 21-42 as severe stroke. NIHSS worsening is defined as an increase from baseline of &gt;= 4.</description>

RCAO was assessed by the Independent Core Laboratory, complete aneurysm occlusion is defined as an aneurysm in which a Grade I (completion occlusion), is achieved on the Raymond Scale at the relevant post-procedure angiogram, without additional procedures for treatment of the aneurysm since the index procedure. Participants who were retreated (retreatment includes staged procedures) prior to the 12-month were considered not to have achieved complete aneurysm occlusion.</description>

        <description>The incidence of a major ipsilateral stroke and/or death due to ipsilateral stroke was evaluated from the start of the index procedure until completion of the 12-month follow-up. A major ipsilateral stroke is defined as a new neurological event which is ipsilateral and in the vascular distribution territory of the stenting procedure and that results in an increase of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 4 on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) as compared to baseline and persists for greater than 24 hours. The NIHSS is a systematic assessment tool that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. The scores range from 0 to 42 with a score of 0 indicates no stroke; 1-4 as minor stroke; 5-15 as moderate stroke; 15-20 as moderate/severe stroke; 21-42 as severe stroke. NIHSS worsening is defined as an increase from baseline of &gt;= 4.</description>

        <description>The Raymond-Roy Grading scale used for judging intracranial aneurysm (IA) endosaccular embolization success ranges from Grade I to III where, Grade I is completion occlusion with no flow of contrast seen in the aneurysm sac, Grade II is partial occlusion with some flow or eddy flow in the aneurysm sac and Grade III is residual aneurysm or Incomplete occlusion with apparent flow in the aneurysm sac. RCAO was assessed by the Independent Core Laboratory, complete aneurysm occlusion is defined as an aneurysm in which a Grade I (completion occlusion), is achieved on the Raymond Scale at the relevant post-procedure angiogram, without additional procedures for treatment of the aneurysm since the index procedure. Participants who are retreated (retreatment includes staged procedures) prior to the 12-month were considered not to have achieved complete aneurysm occlusion.</description>

        <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a systematic assessment tool that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. The scores range from 0 to 42 with a score of 0 indicates no stroke; 1-4 as minor stroke; 5-15 as moderate stroke; 15-20 as moderate/severe stroke; 21-42 as severe stroke. NIHSS worsening is defined as an increase from baseline of &gt;= 4.</description>
