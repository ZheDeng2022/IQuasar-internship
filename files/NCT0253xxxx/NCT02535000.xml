      Duloxetine as an analgesic agent in patients undergoing elective spine surgery: evaluation&#xD;
      with fentanyl demand controlled by the patient. The primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of duloxetine in fentanyl consumption during the postoperative period of patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective spine surgery by intervertebral disc degeneration . Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      were pain scores and the presence or absence of adverse effects such as headache, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, itching, dizziness and drowsiness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multimodal analgesia is widely advocated for the control of perioperative pain in an attempt&#xD;
      to reduce the use of opioids and their side effects. Duloxetine is a selective inhibitor of&#xD;
      serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake with demonstrated efficacy in chronic pain such as&#xD;
      painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. The primary objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of duloxetine in fentanyl consumption during the postoperative period of&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective spine surgery by intervertebral disc degeneration . Duloxetine&#xD;
      as an analgesic agent in patients undergoing elective spine surgery: evaluation with fentanyl&#xD;
      demand controlled by the patient. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      duloxetine in fentanyl consumption during the postoperative period of patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective spine surgery by degenerative disc disease. Secondary endpoints were pain scores and&#xD;
      the presence or absence of adverse effects such as headache, nausea, vomiting, itching,&#xD;
      dizziness and drowsiness.&#xD;

    <measure>Total Consumption of Fentanyl (in Micrograms) Self-administered by the Patient and Accessed at 24 and 48 Hours After Spine Surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The main evaluation parameter was the total consumption of fentanyl (in micrograms) self-administered by the patient and accessed at 24 and 48 hours after surgery. At the beginning of the study, Group C (placebo) would have 30 patients and D (duloxetine) would also have 30 patients. However, 1 patient in Group C and 2 patients in Group D were excluded due to the cancellation of the proposed surgery, after the patient had received 60 milligrams of duloxetine. The lower the consumption of fentanyl, the better the analgesic effect of duloxetine.</description>

However, 1 patient in Group C and 2 patients in Group D were excluded due to the cancellation of the proposed surgery, after the patient had received 60 milligrams of duloxetine. Self reported pain score range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) 2, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after surgery. Higher scores mean a worse score and low scores mean a better score.</description>

        <description>The main evaluation parameter was the total consumption of fentanyl (in micrograms) self-administered by the patient and accessed at 24 and 48 hours after surgery. At the beginning of the study, Group C (placebo) would have 30 patients and D (duloxetine) would also have 30 patients. However, 1 patient in Group C and 2 patients in Group D were excluded due to the cancellation of the proposed surgery, after the patient had received 60 milligrams of duloxetine. The lower the consumption of fentanyl, the better the analgesic effect of duloxetine.</description>
