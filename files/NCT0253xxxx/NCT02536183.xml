      This study is looking to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD) administered in combination&#xD;
      with MR-HIFU in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors, which may include but are not&#xD;
      limited to rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors,&#xD;
      osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, hepatic tumors, and germ cell tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is phase 1 trial of LTLD with MR-HIFU induced heating in children and young adults with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of the trial will be a traditional dose escalation study to determine the pediatric&#xD;
      MTD/RP2D of LTLD combined with MR-HIFU ablation which allows for release of doxorubicin in&#xD;
      the ablation zone and peri-ablation margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B of the trial will combine LTLD at the MTD/RP2D with MR-HIFU induced mild hyperthermia&#xD;
      (MHT) in an expanded cohort.&#xD;
