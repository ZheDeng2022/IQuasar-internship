  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, non-interventional, research registry is designed to study the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness and comparative safety of approved treatments for PsA-SpA in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients cared for by rheumatologists across North America. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      analyzing the epidemiology and natural history of the disease, its comorbidities, and current&#xD;
      treatment practices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant unmet need to develop clinical registry data on the presentation,&#xD;
      natural history, management, and outcomes of PsA-SpA. There is no large clinical registry of&#xD;
      PsA-SpA patients seen in general rheumatology practices. It is anticipated that Corrona's&#xD;
      registry will supplement information gathered in other programs and potentially represent a&#xD;
      more general rheumatology spectrum of PsA-SpA patients representative of the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the registry is to prospectively study the comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      and comparative safety of therapies in a national cohort of PsA-SpA patients being cared for&#xD;
      by rheumatologists. Secondary objectives include analyzing the epidemiology and natural&#xD;
      history of the disease group, comorbidities, and current treatment practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a prospective, non-interventional, observational registry for patients with PsA&#xD;
      or SpA under the care of a licensed rheumatologist. Longitudinal follow-up data is collected&#xD;
      from both patients and their treating rheumatologists during routine clinical encounters&#xD;
      using Corrona registry questionnaires. These questionnaires collect data on patient&#xD;
      demographics, disease duration, medical history (including all prior and current treatments&#xD;
      for PsA-SpA), smoking status, alcohol use, disease severity, pain, activity, and other&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness measures, patient reported outcomes, comorbidities, hospitalizations,&#xD;
      and other targeted safety outcomes, including pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the enrollment visit, SpA patients and physicians will complete follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to collect data&#xD;
      from patients and providers at six month intervals, not to exceed 2 visits in any 12 month&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result&#xD;
      of general questioning by the Principal Investigator. During all Corrona related visits with&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

        Patients are enrolled in the Psoriatic Arthritis and Spondyloarthritis Registry during&#xD;
        regularly scheduled office visits. Selected rheumatologists are invited to participate as&#xD;
        investigators in the Registry.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        To be eligible for enrollment into the Corrona PsA-SpA Registry, a patient must satisfy all&#xD;
        of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. One of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and initiating (prescribed or starting)&#xD;
                  an eligible medication† for the treatment of PsA at the enrollment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Meet the ASAS criteria for axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), including&#xD;
                  radiographic or non-radiographic, and initiating (prescribed or starting) an&#xD;
                  eligible biologic for the treatment of AxSpA at the enrollment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Meet the modified New York classification criteria for ankylosing spondylitis&#xD;
                  (AS) and initiating (prescribed or starting) an eligible biologic for the&#xD;
                  treatment of AS at the enrollment visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able and willing to provide written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must not be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or any other form&#xD;
             of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participating in or planning to participate in a clinical trial with an interventional&#xD;
             research study of a non-marketed or marketed investigational drug (e.g. phase I-IV&#xD;
             clinical drug trial, post marketing study or registry study where drug is being&#xD;
             provided). Of note, concurrent participation in another observational registry study&#xD;
             is not excluded. ∆&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Once clinical trial participation has ended, a patient is permitted to enroll in&#xD;
                  the registry if they satisfy the eligibility requirements at the time of&#xD;
                  enrollment. If the patient participated in the PsA-SpA registry and was exited to&#xD;
                  join a clinical trial, the patient cannot be re-enrolled in the PsA-SpA registry&#xD;
                  after clinical trial participation has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients switching from an originator biologic to a biosimilar satisfy the enrollment&#xD;
        eligibility requirement.&#xD;
