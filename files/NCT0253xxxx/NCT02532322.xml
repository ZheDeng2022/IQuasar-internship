    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled pain after posterior fossa surgery and associated negative side effects of&#xD;
      conventional opioid therapy causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants and&#xD;
      children. Intravenous (IV) acetaminophen has been shown to be effective in treating mild to&#xD;
      moderate pain, and moderate to severe pain in conjunction with adjuvant opioids in children.&#xD;
      However, it is unknown if IV acetaminophen is effective as analgesic adjuvant therapy in&#xD;
      children undergoing posterior fossa surgery. In this prospective, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial, the investigators aim to determine whether the addition of IV acetaminophen for 24&#xD;
      hours can lead to reduction in postoperative pain and opioid requirement after neurosurgical&#xD;
      procedures of the posterior fossa compared with conventional therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of IV acetaminophen to placebo in&#xD;
      pediatric patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery, with the primary outcome measure being&#xD;
      postoperative opioid requirements (morphine equivalent mg/kg). This will be a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, double blind control trial. The patient, research team, surgeon, and&#xD;
      anesthesiologist will all be blinded to the patient's treatment group. Patients will receive&#xD;
      either IV acetaminophen or equal volume normal saline (placebo) in the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventional component of this study involves the intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      administration of IV acetaminophen. Intraoperative and postoperative data pertaining to&#xD;
      adverse events would be collected for safety monitoring purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive either IV acetaminophen or equal volume&#xD;
      saline placebo during surgery and for 24 hours postoperatively. According to a&#xD;
      computer-generated table of random number assignments, each patient will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive one of the following two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV acetaminophen 15 mg/kg (1.5 mL/kg) IV loading dose prior to incision, followed by a 15&#xD;
      mg/kg (1.5 mL/kg) dose given every 6 hours for the first 24 hours after surgery (total of 4&#xD;
      doses postoperatively). This dosing regimen was chosen based on pharmacokinetic data and&#xD;
      recommended dosing guidelines for IV acetaminophen in children 2 to 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equal volume of normal saline (placebo control) at the same dose and frequency as treatment&#xD;
      group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loading dose volumes and subsequent doses every 6 hours will be determined based on weight of&#xD;
      the patient such that they will receive equal volumes of either IV acetaminophen or saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of anesthesia, including opioid administration, and perioperative management will&#xD;
      proceed as per routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSTOPERATIVE ANALGESIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of surgery, the anesthetic agents will be discontinued as per routine care.&#xD;
      Per routine care, after tracheal extubation, morphine (0.05 mg/kg/dose) will be administered&#xD;
      as needed by the blinded assessor until the patient appears comfortable, defined as the&#xD;
      absence of any verbal or behavioral expression of pain. Patients will then be transferred to&#xD;
      the intensive care unit (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of entry into the intensive care unit will be recorded. The following assessments will&#xD;
      be recorded at time of admission to the ICU:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oxygen saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pain score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sedation score&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of routine care for postoperative analgesia, patients will receive morphine sulfate&#xD;
      at standard doses (0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg/dose every 3 hours as needed for pain). The frequency and&#xD;
      dose of morphine will be adjusted according to the patient's pain score, with a goal to&#xD;
      maintain a pain score of &lt; 6. In addition, patients will transition to oral opioids as soon&#xD;
      as their diet allows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be used to measure short-term postoperative analgesia and side&#xD;
      effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily opioid consumption (mg/kg/24h in morphine equivalent using the conversion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain scores at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sedation score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) will be assessed by the need&#xD;
           for rescue antiemetics: i.e. ondansetron or promethazine given as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence and severity of pruritus will be assessed by the need for rescue&#xD;
           anti-pruritic: i.e. diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine given as needed for pruritus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of pyrexia (defined as core temperature ≥ 38º Celsius). Ketorolac will be&#xD;
           administered 0.5 mg/kg q6h prn as needed for pyrexia as per routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will continue for up to 72 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed to determine the decrease in postoperative opioid requirements with or&#xD;
      without IV acetaminophen after posterior fossa surgery as the primary outcome. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that IV acetaminophen will decrease postoperative opioid&#xD;
      requirements, pain and sedation scores, and opioid-induced side effects in children&#xD;
      undergoing posterior fossa surgery.&#xD;
