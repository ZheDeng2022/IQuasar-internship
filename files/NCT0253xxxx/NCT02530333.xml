      Anterior cruciate ligament injury programs are less successful in women's basketball than&#xD;
      soccer players, yet the reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Thus, this study will recruit&#xD;
      high school aged girl's basketball and soccer players, randomized teams into control and&#xD;
      experimental groups, administer an ACL injury prevention program in the experimental group&#xD;
      and compare the two groups on their lower extremity biomechanics before and after completion&#xD;
      of the program. Biomechanical analyses will help determine the extent to which women's&#xD;
      basketball and soccer players respond differently to a uniform injury prevention program, and&#xD;
      whether this prevention program provides an adequate stimulus to improve lower extremity&#xD;
      biomechanics during basketball-specific tasks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention programs are considerably less successful&#xD;
      in women's basketball than women's soccer. Women's basketball and soccer are each&#xD;
      characterized by distinct sport-specific demands, where women's basketball players perform&#xD;
      significantly more frequent jumping (2- and 1-legged landings) and frontal plane movements&#xD;
      than women's soccer players. Despite varying sport-specific demands, ACL injury prevention&#xD;
      programs have been uniformly administered in both sports, and emphasize improving high-risk&#xD;
      biomechanics during 2-legged sagittal plane tasks. As such, they may not provide the&#xD;
      appropriate stimulus to reduce ACL injury risk during the high-risk demands associated with&#xD;
      women's basketball. To date, the differential biomechanical adaptations that result from ACL&#xD;
      injury prevention programs in women's basketball and soccer have never been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a cluster randomized controlled trial using a repeated measures design.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized (by team) in to control and intervention groups. Participants&#xD;
      in the control group will be asked to continue their normal daily and athletic activities&#xD;
      (practices, games) without participating any distinct injury prevention training.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will complete at 6 week ACL injury prevention program&#xD;
      previously described in the literature as being effective at reducing ACL injury risk. The&#xD;
      prevention program lasts 20-25 minutes in duration and will take place as a warm-up prior to&#xD;
      any practice. The frequency will depend solely on the number of practices each team holds&#xD;
      throughout the given 6-week time period. A member of the research team plans to be at each&#xD;
      intervention session. All participants will complete pre- and post-testing approximately 1&#xD;
      week before the onset and after the completion of the prevention program, respectively. As&#xD;
      stated previously, all pre- and post-testing will be performed at the High Point University&#xD;
      Human Biomechanics and Physiology Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are Specific Aims and Hypotheses. Specific Aim 1. To determine the extent to&#xD;
      which women's basketball and soccer players employ distinct lower extremity movement&#xD;
      strategies during sagittal and frontal plane jump landing tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. Prior to training, women's basketball athletes will exhibit no significant&#xD;
      differences in high-risk hip and knee kinematics, but will generate higher hip and knee joint&#xD;
      moments during jump landing activities than women's soccer players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To determine the response of women's basketball and soccer athletes to a&#xD;
      6-week ACL injury prevention program, as measured by changes in multi-planar hip and knee&#xD;
      biomechanics of jump landings during sagittal and frontal plane jump landing tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. After 6 weeks of training, high-risk biomechanics will improve to a larger&#xD;
      extent during sagittal plane than frontal plane jump landing tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. After 6 weeks of training, there will be no significant differences in&#xD;
      biomechanical changes in women's basketball compared to women's soccer players.&#xD;
