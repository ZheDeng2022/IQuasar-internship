  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are a leading cause of serious complications and&#xD;
      death following major noncardiac surgery. The heart biomarkers brain-type natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      (BNP) and high-sensitivity troponin I/T (hs-TnI/T), may aid in estimating the risk of surgery&#xD;
      - low values may permit identifying patients at a very low risk of postoperative&#xD;
      complications, potentially helping to avoid unnecessary tests and delays prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that the manner in which an anesthetic is conducted may have an&#xD;
      important impact on postoperative outcomes. The combination of low blood pressure (BP) and a&#xD;
      deep level of anesthesia despite a low dose of anesthetic - also known as a &quot;triple low&quot; -&#xD;
      has been linked to increased complications and death following surgery. However, it is&#xD;
      unclear whether triple lows actually cause postoperative complications or whether they are&#xD;
      merely an indicator of a sick patient, who is in general more likely to suffer from&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in the near future. To answer this question, in this study patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to groups with lower and higher blood pressures, and the&#xD;
      postoperative rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and of relevant increases in&#xD;
      hs-TnI (a marker of cardiac injury) compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important question is that of the optimal blood pressure target during surgery.&#xD;
      Currently there are no established methods of tailoring blood pressure management to the&#xD;
      individual patient. In the study the investigators will perform ambulatory 24h BP&#xD;
      measurements prior to surgery to measure the patients' average BP during sleep. In the&#xD;
      analysis of the study data, the investigators will try to determine the relationship of&#xD;
      preoperative biomarker levels, intraoperative BP (both in relation to fixed targets and to&#xD;
      the patient's own night-time BP) and of anesthetic depth with the occurrence of major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events after surgery.&#xD;

      1. Hypothesis and purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is based on the hypothesis that normal preoperative cardiac biomarkers, lack&#xD;
           of intraoperative hypotension and BIS values between 45-60 are associated with better&#xD;
           outcomes compared with elevated biomarkers, intraoperative hypotension and/or BIS values&#xD;
           below 45. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that tight blood pressure&#xD;
           management reduces the incidence of adverse outcomes compared to liberal blood pressure&#xD;
           management (see below for definitions). Lastly, the investigators will test the&#xD;
           hypothesis that individualized, relative lower limits of blood pressure are a better&#xD;
           predictor of adverse outcomes than absolute, non-individualized limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be comprised of a cohort study (RISK) and a nested randomized controlled&#xD;
           trial (RCT) [HEMODYNAMICS]. In the period between September 2015 and August 2018 all&#xD;
           patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be included in the cohort study to assess&#xD;
           the association of perioperative biomarkers, intraoperative blood pressure and BIS&#xD;
           values with the occurrence of MACE. A smaller subset of patients will additionally be&#xD;
           included in the RCT to assess the effect of tight versus liberal blood pressure&#xD;
           management on MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cardiac risk assessment and optimization will be performed according to clinical&#xD;
           practice in the investigators' institution, following internal guidelines (based on the&#xD;
           2007 ACC/AHA guidelines. In addition, preoperative cardiac biomarkers (BNP and hsTnI)&#xD;
           will be measured. Intraoperative blood pressure management will be based on an internal&#xD;
           hemodynamic management algorithm, however in the cohort study the intervention threshold&#xD;
           will be left at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. The occurrence of MACE will be&#xD;
           assessed 30 days and one year after surgery. The association of preoperative biomarker&#xD;
           levels and the occurrence of intraoperative hypotension will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the RCT, patients will be assessed similarly to the protocol of the cohort study,&#xD;
           however these patients will be randomly assigned to either tight (mean arterial pressure&#xD;
           [MAP] &gt; 75 mmHg) or liberal (MAP at the discretion of the anesthesiologist, but not &lt;&#xD;
           60mmHg) blood pressure management using the same hemodynamic management algorithm as in&#xD;
           the whole cohort. In a subset of the RCT patients, a nighttime blood pressure profile&#xD;
           will be obtained additionally to define a presumed individual lower blood pressure limit&#xD;
           (i.e. the mean MAP during natural sleep). The association of intraoperative time spent&#xD;
           below the individual lower blood pressure limit with the occurrence of adverse outcomes&#xD;
           will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additionally, the association of postoperative parameters (e.g. the time spent below a&#xD;
           given blood pressure threshold) with the occurrence of MACE will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Further, the association of perioperative levels of the biomarkers midregional&#xD;
           proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-TnT) with the&#xD;
           occurrence of MACE will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lastly, fully anonymised patient data from the BBB-Study may be included in multicenter&#xD;
           cohort studies investigating perioperative myocardial ischemia and hemodynamic&#xD;
           stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size calculation of the Clinical Trials Unit St. Gallen indicates that in the&#xD;
           RCT, assuming a 10% drop-out rate, 458 patients will be necessary to detect an a&#xD;
           difference of 33% between the liberal and tight BP groups in our primary composite&#xD;
           endpoint of MACE (α=0.05, β=0.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the RCT, potential differences between the incidence of the primary endpoint in the tight&#xD;
      and liberal BP groups will be assessed using χ2 statistics. In the cohort study, the&#xD;
      investigators will generate logistic regression models using the primary (or secondary)&#xD;
      outcome as a dependent variable. The investigators will model the preoperative level of&#xD;
      cardiac biomarkers (in quartiles and dichotomized), time spent below a prespecified mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (&lt; 75 mmHg, &lt; 60 and below the individual average mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      during natural sleep) and time spent below a BIS &lt; 45. The model will be adjusted for the&#xD;
      following prespecified independent variables: Charlson Comorbidity Index, Lee Revised Cardiac&#xD;
      Risk Index, age and sex. The number of independent variables will be limited to avoid&#xD;
      overfitting of the model. For dichotomization of BNP, the investigators will define the&#xD;
      optimal cut-off value using receiver operating characteristics curves for the primary outcome&#xD;
      under assumption of equal weight sensitivity and specificity. The null hypothesis will be&#xD;
      considered refuted if the 2-sided p-value is &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous experience in similar studies, the investigators expect a very small number&#xD;
      of loss of follow up (&lt; 2%). If the number exceeds 5% a Cox regression model using time to&#xD;
      the composite endpoint (or time to last contact, if loss of follow up has occurred) as a&#xD;
      dependent variable will be calculated. Missing perioperative BNP values will be handled as&#xD;
      normal (&lt; 50 pg/ml). Any other missing perioperative laboratory values shall also be assumed&#xD;
      to be normal.&#xD;
