  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is researching managing postsurgical pain by injecting both short-acting local&#xD;
      anesthetics and EXPAREL® at the time of surgery and reviewing if it could reduce or eliminate&#xD;
      the need for postsurgical opioids and improve clinical outcomes following the FAST dental&#xD;
      implant surgery procedure. This approach is being compared to the current standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postsurgical pain following the Full Arch Surgical Therapy (FAST) dental implant surgery&#xD;
      procedure is commonly managed with a variety of interventions, including local infiltration&#xD;
      with short-acting local anesthetics during surgery and the use of postsurgical opioid and&#xD;
      non-opioid analgesics. Although this approach to managing postsurgical pain is considered the&#xD;
      current standard of care, its reliance on opioid analgesics to provide analgesia beyond the&#xD;
      duration of short-acting local anesthetics exposes patients to opioid-related adverse events&#xD;
      (ORAEs) that may delay their recovery and have other deleterious clinical consequences. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of local infiltration&#xD;
      of EXPAREL for the FAST dental implant surgery procedure compared to standard of care.&#xD;
