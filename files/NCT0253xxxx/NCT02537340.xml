      The hypothesis to be proven with this study is that the use of PET/MR on the initial staging&#xD;
      of rectal cancers in patients with extramural vascular invasion detected by MR will detect&#xD;
      more lesions than conventional work-up and will significantly impact on therapeutic decision,&#xD;
      improving disease free and overall survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The accurate staging of rectal cancer is essential to define therapy and for prognosis&#xD;
      assessment. Imaging modalities usually provide useful information for pre-operative planning&#xD;
      of primary tumour resection and may indicate the need of neoadjuvant treatment. It is&#xD;
      recommended the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for local staging and computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis for detection of distant metastasis. Patients&#xD;
      with rectal cancer and vascular invasion might benefit from an intensive pre-operative&#xD;
      staging in order to early detect distant metastasis, favouring a better therapeutic planning.&#xD;
      There is no consensus regarding the use of PET/MR for initial staging of patients with rectal&#xD;
      cancer. It has been shown that although changing pattern's in patients' stage, the use of&#xD;
      PET/MR for colorectal cancers did not impact disease management. New studies are required for&#xD;
      identifying the subgroup of patients with changes in the pre-operative MR that might benefit&#xD;
      from the use of PET/MR for initial staging of rectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with rectal cancer will undergo pelvic MR, whole-body CT and whole-body PET/MR.&#xD;
      According to the tumour characteristics on MR, there will be defined two group of patients:&#xD;
      with EMVI-RM (group A) and without EMVI-MR (group B). The whole-body CT and PET/MR will be&#xD;
      evaluated for the detection of loco-regional lymph nodes disease and distant metastasis. The&#xD;
      total number of lesions and their respective sites will be recorded and compared for each&#xD;
      method. The PET/MR management impact will be determined from the medical record or by direct&#xD;
      contact with the treating clinician. The impact of PET/MR on management will be defined as&#xD;
      high (the treatment modality or intent was changed), medium (the treatment modality or intent&#xD;
      remained unchanged, although the method of treatment delivery or planned diagnostic procedure&#xD;
      was changed), low (PET/MR results were consistent with planned management, and treatment&#xD;
      modality or intent was unchanged), or none (the management plan was not changed, despite&#xD;
      being inconsistent with the PET/MR stage-that is, PET/MR results were ignored). Overall&#xD;
      survival will be used to evaluate prognostic significance. Clinical follow-up will be&#xD;
      performed 3 monthly for 2 years. Imaging and, eventually biopsy, will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate symptoms or signs suggestive of residual or recurrent disease.&#xD;
