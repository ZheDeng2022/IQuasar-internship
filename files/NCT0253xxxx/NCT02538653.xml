      This study aimed at determining the 4-hours postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses&#xD;
      to the ingestion of cereal product differing by their SDS content. It is a laboratory-based&#xD;
      research study with an open cross-over design, including 20 healthy non-smoking voluntary&#xD;
      subjects, aged from 18 to 45 years. 2 test sessions per subject are included in the study.&#xD;
      Foods are consumed in a random order according to a randomisation list.&#xD;
