    <textblock>
      This is open-label, single-arm, two-stage phase II trial of olaparib in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory metastatic germ cell cancer. The primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      preliminary activity of Olaparib in GCT tumors. The secondary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of Olaparib in patients with cisplatin-refractory GCT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of principle open-label, single-arm, two-stage phase II trial of olaparib 300&#xD;
      mg twice daily in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic germ cell cancer. The study&#xD;
      will recruit 10 patients, if no response is seen the study is terminated. If one or more&#xD;
      responses are observed, further 19 patients (for a total of 29 patients) will be enrolled. If&#xD;
      4 or more of the first 29 evaluable patients have achieved objective response, further&#xD;
      studies in patients with metastatic germ cell cancer are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with metastatic gonadal GCT or extragonadal GCT originating from retroperitoneum&#xD;
           or mediastinum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease progression during cisplatin-based chemotherapy or disease progression or&#xD;
           relapse after high-dose chemotherapy or disease progression or relapse after at least 2&#xD;
           different cisplatin-based regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed by CT/MRI/plain x-ray) at&#xD;
           baseline and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Secondary parameters will be analyzed&#xD;
      exploratively for the intent-to-treat population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations between with biomarkers (PAR, poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase&#xD;
      (PARP-1), PTEN, XPA, ERCC1-3, XPF, FanD2, γ-H2AX) expression in paraffin-embedded tumor&#xD;
      samples and clinical outcome will be performed in an exploratory intent. Plasma samples will&#xD;
      be collected at baseline and at response/progression for possible retrospective biomarkers&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
