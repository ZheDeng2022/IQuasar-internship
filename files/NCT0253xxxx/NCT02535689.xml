      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is an autoimmune disease that often involves many&#xD;
      systems and organs of the body. Symptoms can include fever, joint pains, and rashes. Serious&#xD;
      lupus can also damage organs like the kidneys, lungs, or brain. Drugs used for lupus can have&#xD;
      serious side effects. Also, the drugs don t help some people. Researchers want to find new,&#xD;
      more effective and safe treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug tofacitinib (study drug) in people with&#xD;
      lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have mild to moderate lupus and are not currently or haven t&#xD;
      recently had certain lupus treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 7 five-hour visits over about 3 months. They will fill out multiple&#xD;
      questionnaires. They will have tests, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG/EKG: Soft electrodes are stuck to the skin to monitor the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional SphygmoCor: Cuffs are attached to the arm and thigh to measure blood pressure&#xD;
           and flow speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional Endopat: A thimble-shaped cup is placed on the finger to measure blood flow. A&#xD;
           cuff is put on the arm to measure blood pressure and flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional CAVI: ECG electrodes are placed on both wrists, a microphone placed on the&#xD;
           chest, and a blood pressure cuff placed on each arm and leg to measure blood pressure&#xD;
           and velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive either the study drug or a placebo. They will take this twice a day&#xD;
      by mouth for 56 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by phone 4 times....&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with variegated clinical&#xD;
      presentation resulting from involvement of multiple biologic pathways. The pathways that lead&#xD;
      to loss of tolerance in SLE include: multiple autoreactive cell types (B, T, dendritic, Th17&#xD;
      and regulatory T cells) and abnormal cytokine milieus, genetic factors, environmental and&#xD;
      hormonal influences, all of which can influence cell differentiation patterns and reset&#xD;
      tolerance checkpoints. In addition, recent studies indicate a putative role for neutrophils&#xD;
      in lupus pathogenesis and associated end-organ damage. Currently available therapeutics are&#xD;
      frequently inadequate to treat disease flares and simultaneously expose patients to&#xD;
      potentially serious toxicities. Further, premature cardiovascular disease not explained by&#xD;
      the Framingham risk equation has become one of the most important causes of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in this patient population. To date, no treatment used in lupus appears to&#xD;
      significantly decrease cardiovascular risk. Identifying a drug that has immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects and is also vasculoprotective is an unmet need in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tofacitinib is an orally administered Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that has recently been&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The JAKs are a family of intracellular enzymes (JAK1, 2 and 3 and TYK2) that mediate&#xD;
      signaling via a broad range of cytokine receptors. Targeting JAKs is an attractive&#xD;
      therapeutic possibility for SLE for many reasons. Many of the inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE signal via the JAK-STAT pathways. JAK inhibitors have&#xD;
      been found to have efficacy in various murine models of lupus. Mice treated with a JAK2&#xD;
      inhibitor exhibited reduced serum levels of IL-6, and IL-17 along with reduced numbers of&#xD;
      long-lived autoantibody producing plasma cells in the spleen and bone marrow. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      have found that administration of tofacitinib reduced serum levels of ANA, IL-6, and&#xD;
      IFN-gamma; and ameliorated glomerulonephritis (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore represents an innovative investigative measure of the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of JAK inhibition in SLE that is predicted by genetic predisposition. We will also&#xD;
      investigate effects of tofacitinib on vascular function in SLE subjects and identify&#xD;
      biomarkers that may be useful as endpoints in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and tolerability of tofacitinib in patients with SLE and mild to&#xD;
      moderate disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase Ib, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial of orally&#xD;
      administered tofacitinib, 5 mg twice daily, for the treatment of SLE subjects with mild to&#xD;
      moderate disease activity stratified by the presence or absence of STAT4 risk alleles.&#xD;
