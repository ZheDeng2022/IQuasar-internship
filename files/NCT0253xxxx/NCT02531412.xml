      Acute kidney injury frequently affects cancer patients. The main cause of acute kidney injury&#xD;
      is ischemic damage caused by transient decrease in renal blood flow, followed by blood flow&#xD;
      restoration and accompanying reperfusion injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury. Several&#xD;
      studies, mainly in animal models have tried to establish spironolactone role on kidney injury&#xD;
      induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury. It has been demonstrated in renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients that the administration of spironolactone can prevent oxidative stress and is&#xD;
      safe. The group of cancer patients with states capable of producing tissue hypoperfusion&#xD;
      (hypovolemic shock, heart failure, major surgery, use of anesthetics) are at increased risk&#xD;
      of developing acute renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that spironolactone may be useful in preventing acute renal&#xD;
      injury when administered during the first six hour of renal ischemia-reperfusion insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of spironolactone administered after an&#xD;
      ischemic renal insult (major surgery) to prevent acute kidney injury in critically cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose a pilot study, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial,&#xD;
      approved by the local ethical committee, to compare the efficacy of spironolactone to prevent&#xD;
      acute kidney injury in patients after major surgery. Investigators will include 12 patients&#xD;
      in spironolactone group (25mg daily for three days) and 12 patients in placebo group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury frequently affects cancer patients, with an estimated annual risk of&#xD;
      17.5% after cancer diagnosis. In critically ill cancer patients, acute kidney injury&#xD;
      incidence varies between 12 to 49%, and between 9 and 32% need renal replacement therapy. In&#xD;
      this last group of patients, acute kidney injury frequently occurs as part of multiple&#xD;
      organic failure and is associated with a mortality rate of 53 to 93%, as well as an increment&#xD;
      in costs and days of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cause of acute kidney injury is ischemic damage caused by transient decrease in&#xD;
      renal blood flow, followed by blood flow restoration and accompanying reperfusion injury&#xD;
      (ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decrease on renal blood flow is followed by an increment of aldosterone, this hormone&#xD;
      acts on epithelial cells through mineralocorticoid receptors in several tissues, including&#xD;
      heart and kidneys. In kidneys, aldosterone promotes sodium absorption and potassium&#xD;
      excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decrease in renal blood flow is a strong stimulus for aldosterone secretion. This hormone&#xD;
      has non-genomic actions on smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelium, causing&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, interleukin and oxygen reactive species generation, and beta-transforming&#xD;
      growth factor (TGF BETA) mediated fibrosis, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At renal level, it has been demonstrated that mineralocorticoid receptor blockade can prevent&#xD;
      proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis development in animal models of chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
      Moreover, in chronic kidney disease patients with proteinuria, spironolactone addition to&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), reduces proteinuria in 42% without a higher&#xD;
      risk of hyperkalemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies, mainly in animal models have tried to establish spironolactone role on&#xD;
      kidney injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an acute and chronic cyclosporine (CyA) nephrotoxicity rat model, spironolactone&#xD;
      administration prevented kidney injury associated to afferent arteriole vasoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an animal ischemia-reperfusion model produced by renal artery clipping, spironolactone&#xD;
      administration one (Sp1), two (Sp2) or three (Sp3) days before ischemic insult resulted in&#xD;
      better renal plasmatic flow and creatinine clearance, and prevented histopathological&#xD;
      ischemic lesions. Spironolactone administration stimulated nitric oxide production and&#xD;
      prevented lipid peroxidation and caspase 3 mediated apoptotic injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine aldosterone blockade effects after ischemic injury, a new group of animals&#xD;
      received spironolactone at 0, 3, 6 and 9 hours after IR insult. Spironolactone administration&#xD;
      up to 6 hours after IR insult prevented histologic kidney tubular damage. KIM-1 mRNA levels&#xD;
      did not augmented in 0 and 3 hour groups, suggesting that spironolactone administration up to&#xD;
      three hours after renal ischemic injury prevented kidney damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that IR injury is the principal etiologic agent on acute kidney injury in renal&#xD;
      transplant patients, in 2013, a pilot double blinded clinical trial included 20 living kidney&#xD;
      transplants divided in spironolactone (25mg per day) or placebo groups, receiving the drug&#xD;
      one day before and three days after renal transplant surgery. It was observed that in&#xD;
      spironolactone prophylactically treated patients, urinary levels of hydrogen peroxide were&#xD;
      inferior at the fifth day compared to placebo group, however, there were no differences in&#xD;
      serum creatinine levels nor in other urinary biomarkers (KIM-1, IL-18, HSP-72). In this&#xD;
      trial, no patient developed potassium levels higher than 6mEq/dL and there was only one&#xD;
      patient in each group with serum potassium higher than 5mEq/L, demonstrating that&#xD;
      spironolactone administration was safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of cancer patients with states capable of producing tissue hypoperfusion&#xD;
      (hypovolemic shock, heart failure, major surgery, use of anesthetics) are at increased risk&#xD;
      of developing acute renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that spironolactone may be useful in preventing acute renal&#xD;
      injury when administered during the first six hour of renal ischemia-reperfusion insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of spironolactone administered after an&#xD;
      ischemic renal insult (major surgery) to prevent acute kidney injury in critically cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose a pilot study, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial,&#xD;
      approved by the local ethical committee, to compare the efficacy of spironolactone to prevent&#xD;
      acute kidney injury in patients after major surgery. Investigators will include 12 patients&#xD;
      in spironolactone group (25mg daily for three days) and 12 patients in placebo group. During&#xD;
      five days investigators will collect values of plasma creatinine, sodium, potassium, blood&#xD;
      ureic nitrogen, vital signs and urinary output.&#xD;
