  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of human&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells with interferon beta (MSC-INFb) that can be given to patients with&#xD;
      ovarian cancer and to test the safety of the MSC-INFb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. MSC-INFb infusions for ovarian cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 21 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow samples and grown into many&#xD;
      different cell types that can be used to treat cancer. The MSCs used in this study were&#xD;
      collected from healthy male donors and are stored in a laboratory at MD Anderson. The use of&#xD;
      male cells will help us to detect the cells that are infused versus your own female cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSCs have been genetically changed in a laboratory at MD Anderson to add proteins called&#xD;
      interferons. The MSCs will have genetic material introduced to them by a molecule called a&#xD;
      plasmid that will help produce interferon beta. Interferons (IFNs) are proteins that may&#xD;
      interfere with the growth of tumors. The MSCs will be grown in the laboratory and tested&#xD;
      before they are given to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSC-INFb Dose Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of&#xD;
      MSC-INFb based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of MSC-INFb will be tested.&#xD;
      Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants&#xD;
      will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group&#xD;
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose of MSC-INFb is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your dose level may be lowered if you are not tolerating the MSC-INFb infusions. Your study&#xD;
      doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSC-INFb Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1-2 weeks before your first MSC-INFb infusion, you will have an intraperitoneal (IP)&#xD;
      catheter placed in your abdomen. A catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed&#xD;
      into your abdomen while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this&#xD;
      procedure to you in more detail, and you will receive a Patient Information Sheet that&#xD;
      includes the definition of intraperitoneal therapy and information about the placement of the&#xD;
      catheter and care of the catheter during the study. You will also be provided with a specific&#xD;
      separate informed consent for the IP catheter placement by Interventional Radiology staff at&#xD;
      MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One time a week for up to 4 weeks (up to 4 times total), you will receive the MSC-INFb&#xD;
      infusions through the IP catheter. The length of time for the infusion will depend on the&#xD;
      size of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain in the clinic for about 30 minutes for observation after each MSC-INFb&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 week before your first MSC-INFb infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs&#xD;
           (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your&#xD;
           kidney and liver function, to check the status of the disease, and for INFb testing for&#xD;
           comparison purposes. Blood tests may be repeated more frequently during the study if&#xD;
           your doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a symptom questionnaire. It should take about 10-15 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1-2 weeks before your first MSC-INFb infusion, during the same procedure as the IP&#xD;
      catheter placement, you will have a tumor biopsy to check the status of the disease. To&#xD;
      collect a tumor biopsy, the affected area is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of&#xD;
      tissue is withdrawn with a large needle. A day or two before your tumor biopsy, blood (about&#xD;
      1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test clotting factors in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week for 4 weeks, before each MSC-INFb infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your&#xD;
           kidney and liver function, to check the status of the disease and response to the&#xD;
           infusion. Â°Blood tests may be repeated more frequently during the study if your doctor&#xD;
           thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood or urine pregnancy test. If blood, it&#xD;
           will be included in the routine blood draw listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd MSC-INFb infusion, you will complete a symptom&#xD;
           questionnaire. It should take about 10-15 minutes each time to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each MSC-INFb infusion, up to 2 teaspoons of peritoneal fluid (if present) will&#xD;
           be drawn through the catheter and stored in a laboratory at MD Anderson for future&#xD;
           research related to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your peritoneal fluid can be used for research, the researchers must get approval from&#xD;
      the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD Anderson. The IRB is a committee of doctors,&#xD;
      researchers, and community members. The IRB is responsible for protecting study participants&#xD;
      and making sure all research is safe and ethical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your samples will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked&#xD;
      to your samples. Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code&#xD;
      numbers and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the&#xD;
      samples to be updated as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 22-26 days after your last MSC-INFb infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test clotting factors in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a tumor biopsy and the IP catheter will be removed. The tumor biopsy will&#xD;
           be tested to determine if the MSC-INFb infusions had any effect on the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease. This may be repeated every 2 months for up to 12 months starting about 22-26&#xD;
           days after the last MSC-INFb infusion, if you doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 week after the last MSC-INFb infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn about 1 week after the last MSC-INFb infusion&#xD;
           for routine tests, to check your kidney and liver function, and to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease and the response to the infusion. If your doctor thinks it is needed, blood&#xD;
           (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be drawn at 44 days after the last MSC-INFb&#xD;
           infusion and then once a month for 2 months to check the response to the infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a symptom questionnaire. It should take about 10-15 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or&#xD;
      your study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that patients who&#xD;
      receive infusions of stem cells treated with a gene transfer procedure must be followed have&#xD;
      long-term follow-up for at least up to 15 years after receiving the gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year for Years 1-5 after the last MSC-INFb infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire that asks about your medical history (your general&#xD;
           health, the status of any medical conditions, and any illnesses or hospitalizations that&#xD;
           may have occurred). It should take about 15-30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if there have been any changes in your contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If necessary to check the status of the disease, you will have computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
           scans and/or additional routine blood tests (about 1-2 tablespoons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year during Years 6-15 after the last MSC-INFb infusion, the research staff will&#xD;
      contact you. Either over the phone, by email, or mail, you will fill out a questionnaire that&#xD;
      asks about your medical history (your general health, the status of any medical conditions,&#xD;
      and any illnesses or hospitalizations that may have occurred). The phone calls and&#xD;
      questionnaires should take about 15-30 minutes each time.&#xD;
