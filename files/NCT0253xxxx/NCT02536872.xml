  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of organisms living on or in the human body without causing overt signs of an&#xD;
      infection is common in medicine and has been termed a microbiome. Urine from patients with&#xD;
      Overactive bladder (OAB) grows different organisms from controls without OAB. However, it is&#xD;
      not known if the bacteria that have been identified are innocent commensals or pathogenic&#xD;
      organism responsible for the symptoms of OAB. Previous data suggests that treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics does lead to an improvement in overactive bladder symptoms in a large number of&#xD;
      patients. On this basis the investigators now treat are patients with similar antibiotic&#xD;
      regimes. If antibiotics improve symptoms it would be expected that they would return the&#xD;
      microbiome back to how it is in patients without OAB. This study aims to identify the effects&#xD;
      of antibiotics on the urinary microbiome and to identify/confirm if antibiotic treatments&#xD;
      cause improvement in OAB.&#xD;

      This study is a consecutive cohort study. Subjects will be recruited from Urogynaecology&#xD;
      clinics at Medway NHS Foundation Trust. Patients will be identified from previous records and&#xD;
      also prospectively from new patients. They will be sent information regarding the trial&#xD;
      before attending their first appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending urogynaecology clinics will provide a fresh clean catch specimen of urine.&#xD;
      A conventional hospital Mid stream speciemn of urine (MSU) will be sent. Urine will be&#xD;
      dipsticked for nitrites and leucocyte esterase. The urine will then be spun and undergo&#xD;
      microscopy using a special stain (looking for intracellular organisms in shed urothelial&#xD;
      cells). The urothelial cells will be cleaned with antibiotics. The cells will then be lysed&#xD;
      and their contents cultured. The contents will undergo Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)&#xD;
      sequencing to identify bacteria. Sensitivity testing will be used to assess and deliver the&#xD;
      appropriate antibiotic regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be treated with a 6 week course of antibiotics as per their usual treatment. Broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotics will be prescribed to all women based on the previous successful&#xD;
      therapeutic regime as described by Vijaya. Six weeks after the end of antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      patients will be reviewed and their urine retested.&#xD;
