  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The InterGraft™ Venous Anastomotic Connector provides a minimally invasive, sutureless method&#xD;
      for attachment of an arteriovenous graft to a vein in the upper extremity. The InterGraft™&#xD;
      Venous Anastomotic Connector facilitates creation of the arteriovenous graft connection to a&#xD;
      vein in support of hemodialysis in subjects with End Stage Renal Disease. The InterGraft™&#xD;
      Venous Anastomotic Connector is used together with conventional suturing of the arterial&#xD;
      anastomosis to facilitate creation of an arteriovenous graft in support of hemodialysis in&#xD;
      subjects with End Stage Renal Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The InterGraft™ Venous Anastomotic Connector (VIG) was developed for minimally invasive&#xD;
      venous anastomosis of a standard hemodialysis graft. This study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the VIG for anastomosis of a commercially available, 6 mm diameter, ePTFE&#xD;
      hemodialysis graft. Anastomoses with the VIG may potentially reduce venous vessel trauma,&#xD;
      improve the local vessel wall shear stresses and promote laminar flow, thereby improving&#xD;
      patency. The available InterGraft™ Arterial Anastomotic Connector (AIG) will also be used&#xD;
      during the study in a subgroup of suitably qualified subjects for purposes of additional data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While recognizing that a native fistula is the recommended access for hemodialysis, AV grafts&#xD;
      remain a frequently used access type. This study focuses on subjects who have a failed&#xD;
      fistula, cannot have a fistula or are better suited for an AV graft, as determined by the&#xD;
      physician. The graft implant procedural outcomes, the number and type of major adverse&#xD;
      events, and patency throughout a six (6) month follow-up period will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      6-month patency rate will be compared with a pre-specified patency performance goal that is&#xD;
      drawn from prior surgical AV graft literature and published performance standards.10, 14-20&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the Investigational Plan, Investigational&#xD;
      Device Exemption (IDE) regulations, Good Clinical Practice guidelines (GCP), and other&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pivotal multicenter, prospective, non-randomized adaptive design study. The planned&#xD;
      study enrollment is 104 evaluable subjects who require AV graft placement for hemodialysis&#xD;
      and who meet the entry criteria. The subjects will receive the VIG device and will have&#xD;
      either a standard sutured arterial anastomosis or have received an AIG device for the&#xD;
      arterial anastomosis (VIG-AIG subgroup). This number may be expanded following a planned&#xD;
      interim analysis to up to 185 evaluable subjects for the primary study evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will allow for a maximum enrollment of 227 subjects, including a provision for 12&#xD;
      subjects lost to follow-up and up to 30 roll-in cases. Roll-in subjects will not be included&#xD;
      in the primary analysis but will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include up to 15 participating clinical centers. Study site investigators will&#xD;
      be physicians skilled in AV access graft placement and interventional techniques. Study data&#xD;
      will be collected up to the point at which each subject has completed the 6-month endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIG-AIG Subgroup All study subjects will receive the VIG device. A subgroup of previously&#xD;
      enrolled subjects receiving the VIG device will also have received an AIG device for the&#xD;
      arterial anastomosis, rather than a sutured arterial anastomosis. This group is referred to&#xD;
      as the &quot;VIG-AIG Subgroup.&quot;&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject requires the creation of a vascular access graft for hemodialysis, secondary&#xD;
             to a diagnosis of End Stage Renal Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is able to have the vascular access graft placed in an upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Baseline imaging shows suitable vascular anatomy/ vessel size for the InterGraft™&#xD;
             Venous Connector and an artery at least 3.5 mm in diameter that is suitable for&#xD;
             creating the arterial anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a reasonable expectation of remaining on hemodialysis for at least 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject or his/her legal guardian understands the study and is willing and able to&#xD;
             comply with the dialysis schedule and follow-up requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject or his/her legal guardian provides written informed consent. NOTE: In&#xD;
             accordance with the requirements of some Institutional Review Boards, where&#xD;
             applicable, only those subjects with capacity to consent for themselves will be&#xD;
             included. Thus, where required by the Institutional Review Board, adult individuals&#xD;
             who lack capacity to consent for themselves will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Physician's examination at time of surgery shows no significant vessel lesions,&#xD;
             calcification(s), anatomic structures or abnormalities that may limit ability to&#xD;
             safely deploy the InterGraft Connectors or create a sutured arterial anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has a documented and unsuccessfully treated ipsilateral central venous&#xD;
             stenosis as determined by imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject currently has a known or suspected bacterial, fungal, or HIV infection. NOTE:&#xD;
             Patients with hepatitis B or C may be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a known hypercoagulable or bleeding disorder or requires treatment with&#xD;
             warfarin or heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: The intent of this criterion is to exclude patients with high risk for bleeding&#xD;
             or clotting complications. As such, patients who are taking oral anticoagulants (blood&#xD;
             thinners) including, but not limited to, Xarelto® (rivaroxaban) or Eliquis® (apixaban)&#xD;
             should also be excluded from the study. Patients may receive anticoagulation therapy&#xD;
             any time after the study AV graft implant procedure, at their physician's discretion.&#xD;
             This should be driven by an indication unrelated to the vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has had a previous instance of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2 (HIT-2)&#xD;
             or has known sensitivity to heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has co-morbid conditions that may limit their ability to comply with study and&#xD;
             follow-up requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has had &gt;2 previous arteriovenous accesses in treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is currently taking Aggrenox®.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is in need of, or is scheduled for any major surgery within 30 days of the&#xD;
             study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is currently taking maintenance immunosuppressant medication such as&#xD;
             rapamycin, mycophenolate or mycophenolic acid, prednisone (&gt;10 mg), cyclosporine,&#xD;
             tacrolimus or cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Life expectancy is less than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject is pregnant. NOTE: A negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of the&#xD;
             study procedure is required in all female subjects with reproductive capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject is a poor compliance risk (i.e. history of IV or oral drug abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject is enrolled in another dialysis or vascular investigational study.&#xD;
