    <measure>Change in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) (Paired Segments) From Baseline at Week 12 as Determined by a Blinded Central Reader.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The simple endoscopy score (SES-CD) assesses the degree of inflammation. The SES-CD assesses the following 4 components: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowing. Each of these components are scored on a scale of 0 to 3. In the SES-CD, each of these 4 components are assessed in the five segments of the ileum and colon: ileum, right, transverse, left (descending and sigmoid), and rectum. The SES-CD is the sum of the individual scores of each of the components across the five segments. The range of SES-CD scores is 0 - 12 for each segment, and 0 - 56 for the overall SES-CD score, with larger scores indicating greater severity of disease.</description>

    <description>A TEAE = any event with an onset date on or after the first dose date, or any ongoing event on the first dose date that worsens in severity or after the first dose date and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug treatment. An AE = untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product, which that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product.&#xD;
A serious AE (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose&#xD;
Results in death&#xD;
Is life-threatening&#xD;
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or&#xD;

The CDAI includes uses 8 components: Number of liquid or soft stools for 7 days, Abdominal pain for 7 days, General well-being for 7 days, Presence of complications, Taking diarrhea medication, Abdominal mass, Hematocrit and Percentage deviation from standard weight. Scores range from 0 to approximately 600, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing record on or before the first dose of study drug.</description>
          <population>The ITT included all enrolled participants and received at least one dose of ozanimod. Analysis for change from baseline includes participants with data available at baseline and visit.</population>

        <description>Endoscopic remission is defined as SES-CD ≤ 4 points and a SES-CD decrease ≥ 2 points with no SES-CD sub-score &gt;1point. The SES-CD assesses the degree of inflammation. The SES-CD assesses the following 4 components: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowing. Each of these components are scored on a scale of 0 to 3. In the SES-CD, each of these 4 components are assessed in the five segments of the ileum and colon: ileum, right, transverse, left (descending and sigmoid), and rectum. The SES-CD is the sum of the individual scores of each of the components across the five segments. The range of SES-CD scores is 0 - 12 for each segment, and 0 - 56 for the overall SES-CD score, with larger scores indicating greater severity of disease. 95% confidence interval (CI) was created using the Clopper-Pearson Exact Method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Endoscopic Response-50 (Paired Segment) Based on Based on Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) Definitions at Week 12</title>
        <description>Endoscopic Response is defined as a SES-CD decrease from baseline of ≥ 50%. The SES-CD assesses the degree of inflammation. The SES-CD assesses the following 4 components: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowing. Each of these components are scored on a scale of 0 to 3. In the SES-CD, each of these 4 components are assessed in the five segments of the ileum and colon: ileum, right, transverse, left (descending and sigmoid), and rectum. The SES-CD is the sum of the individual scores of each of the components across the five segments. The range of SES-CD scores is 0 - 12 for each segment, and 0 - 56 for the overall SES-CD score, with larger scores indicating greater severity of disease. 95% confidence interval (CI) was created using the Clopper-Pearson Exact Method.</description>

          <description>Clinical Response is defined as a CDAI reduction from baseline of ≥ 100 points. The CDAI includes uses 8 components: Number of liquid or soft stools for 7 days, Abdominal pain for 7 days, General well-being for 7 days, Presence of complications, Taking diarrhea medication, Abdominal mass, Hematocrit and Percentage deviation from standard weight. Scores range from 0 to approximately 600, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity. 95% CI was created using the Clopper-Pearson Exact Method.</description>
          <population>The ITT population included all enrolled participants who received at least one dose of ozanimod. If CDAI score was missing, then non-responder imputation was applied.</population>

          <description>Participants received ozanimod 1 mg capsules daily for the first 12 weeks of the induction period (an initial 7-day dose escalation regimen that consisted of 4 days of ozanimod HCl 0.25 mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.23 mg) daily followed by 3 days of ozanimod HCl 0.5 mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.46 mg) daily, with the final dose of ozanimod HCl 1 mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.92 mg) daily dose reached on Day 8. Participants who completed the induction period had the opportunity at Week 12 to continue to receive ozanimod 1 mg capsules daily during the extension period up to an additional 148 weeks, provided that the investigator determined that the participant should continue. Participants in the extension period continued to receive ozanimod 1 mg capsules daily through Week 160. Participants who completed the Week 160 visit had the option to continue open-label ozanimod 1 mg capsules by immediately entering the open-label extension Phase 3 Crohn's Disease Study RPC01-3204.</description>
