  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of durvalumab or of durvalumab with&#xD;
      tremelimumab that can be tolerated without causing very severe side effects when receiving&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy and to see what effects the study drugs has on this type of cancer.&#xD;
      Patients may receive durvalumab alone or in combination with tremelimumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers doing this study are also interested in looking for markers that will help&#xD;
      predict which patients are most likely to be helped by the study drugs, durvalumab and&#xD;
      tremelimumab. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the one that does not cause side&#xD;
      effects in animals. Participants are given durvalumab alone or durvalumab together with&#xD;
      tremelimumab and are watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure&#xD;
      the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then new participants&#xD;
      will be given a higher dose of durvalumab together with tremelimumab. Participants joining&#xD;
      this study later on will get higher doses of durvalumab together with tremelimumab than&#xD;
      participants who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe&#xD;
      but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second purpose is to see if there are any differences in the side effects and the way&#xD;
      durvalumab and tremelimumab are handled in your body when durvalumab is given together at the&#xD;
      same time with tremelimumab compared to when durvalumab is given after tremelimumab. This is&#xD;
      called dose level five.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed cancer that is&#xD;

             exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must be considered suitable candidates for and eligible to receive one&#xD;
                  of the regimens (including durvalumab and tremelimumab alone (dose level 5)&#xD;
                  included in this protocol and which is open to accrual. For each regimen,&#xD;
                  specific criteria for registration may be applicable to the cohort/dose level to&#xD;
                  ensure tolerability in the planned phase II or III trials. Centres must confirm&#xD;
                  that the planned cohort is open to accrual and whether there are any restrictions&#xD;
                  on tumour types prior to approaching patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For etoposide/carboplatin regimen, patients must have untreated small cell lung&#xD;
                  cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from their primary or&#xD;
                  metastatic tumour) is available, patients must have provided informed consent for&#xD;
                  the release of the block. All patients must have provided informed consent for&#xD;
                  correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. All radiology&#xD;
                  studies must be performed within 28 days prior to registration (within 35 days if&#xD;
                  negative). Patients ideally should have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 (0 or 1 for untreated&#xD;
                  SCLC enrolled to etoposide/carboplatin). Patients with PS 2 must be considered&#xD;
                  fit for first line cytotoxic or immune based therapy and discussed with CCTG&#xD;
                  prior to enrolment.&#xD;

&#xD;
        All Cohorts Except Etoposide-Carboplatin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Patients should not have received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Exceptions may&#xD;
        be made for selected patients and regimens. Patients planned for dose level 5 may have&#xD;
        received one line or prior chemotherapy. Consult CCTG before approaching patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Notes: Patients planned for cisplatin regimens should have received no more than 250mg&#xD;
        mg/m2 prior to cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Etoposide-Carboplatin Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • For dose levels 0-3, patients with untreated SCLC must have received two cycles of their&#xD;
        first etoposide carboplatin regimen prior to registration to that chemotherapy cohort. For&#xD;
        dose level 4, SCLC patients planned for the etoposide/carboplatin cohort may not have had&#xD;
        prior chemotherapy regimens and do not have to have their first two cycles of&#xD;
        etoposide-platinum prior to study entry.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received other prior therapies including immunotherapy, angiogenesis&#xD;
             inhibitors, PARP inhibitors or signal transduction inhibitors. Patients who have&#xD;
             received other treatment with PD-L1 / PD-1, CTLA4 or other antibodies must not have&#xD;
             had intolerable toxicity or required steroids to manage toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from all reversible toxicity related to prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy or systemic therapy and have adequate washout as follows:&#xD;

&#xD;
        • Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have&#xD;
        elapsed between the last dose of radiation and date of registration. Exceptions may be made&#xD;
        for low-dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy after consultation with CCTG. Concurrent&#xD;
        radiotherapy is not permitted. Patients planned for concurrent chemotherapy-radiation are&#xD;
        not eligible. Patients with curative doses of radiation to marrow-bearing areas may not be&#xD;
        eligible. Consult CCTG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have elapsed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from any treatment related toxicities prior to&#xD;
             registration (unless grade 1, irreversible, or considered by investigator as not&#xD;
             clinically significant).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and&#xD;
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to registration&#xD;
             in the trial and prior to tests which are considered to be study specific to document&#xD;
             their willingness to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or those&#xD;
        physically incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into the study.&#xD;
        Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have the document&#xD;
        signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be provided with a&#xD;
        full explanation of the study before consent is requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non&#xD;
             sterilized male partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
             while on study and for 6 months after the last dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab or&#xD;
             for 3 months after the last dose of durvalumab alone and consult product monograph for&#xD;
             standard chemotherapy. Male partners of a female subject and non-sterilized male&#xD;
             patients who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             use male condom plus spermicide while on study and for 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             durvalumab and tremelimumab or for 3 months after the last dose of durvalumab alone&#xD;
             and consult product monograph for standard chemotherapy. Female partners of a male&#xD;
             subject must use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period.&#xD;
             Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients should also refrain from donating sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this&#xD;

             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure&#xD;
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete&#xD;
             documentation of the treatment, response assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.&#xD;
