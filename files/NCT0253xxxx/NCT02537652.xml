  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who experience a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are at heightened&#xD;
      risk of subsequent vascular events, including heart attacks and secondary stroke/TIA. Blood&#xD;
      pressure control is considered the most important contributor to positive health outcomes in&#xD;
      stroke patients. The measurement of central blood pressure (cSBP) (the blood pressure which&#xD;
      is being exerted at the heart), may provide clinicians with important diagnostic and&#xD;
      prognostic information over and above that typically obtained from a peripheral blood&#xD;
      pressure measure (the blood pressure in the arm). Central blood pressures may be better than&#xD;
      traditional peripheral blood pressure measures as: i) peripheral blood pressure may not&#xD;
      accurately reflect the effects of peak arterial blood pressure on centrally located organs,&#xD;
      ii) central blood pressures may be 50 % superior to peripheral blood pressures when&#xD;
      predicting cardiovascular events, and iii) information pertaining to central blood pressures&#xD;
      may be more effective in the management of hypertension. While the validity of oscillometric&#xD;
      devices which measure central blood pressures has been demonstrated, further study is&#xD;
      required to determine precision under normal clinical operating conditions (i.e., reflective&#xD;
      of the Hospital/GP practice setting). As such, this study will assess central and peripheral&#xD;
      blood pressures of stroke patients when fasted and nonfasted, and when seated and supine. The&#xD;
      study is interested in identifying the effect of the above parameters (fasted vs. unfasted,&#xD;
      seated vs. supine) on central and peripheral blood pressures in stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in three separate assessment sessions, on three separate days,&#xD;
      with a minimum 24 hour recovery between each session. Each assessment is expected to last 90&#xD;
      minutes, with a minimum of eight blood pressures being taken from the left upper arm. As&#xD;
      such, participants will be asked to give up 4.5 hours of their time to the study. During each&#xD;
      assessment participants will be tested in a fasted and non-fasted state, and in a supine&#xD;
      (lying) and seated position. All assessments will take place between 7 and 10am and will be&#xD;
      undertaken following written informed consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide, and is a prominent cause of chronic disability,&#xD;
      causing significant physical, cognitive and social impairment. In the United Kingdom, there&#xD;
      are 150,000 strokes each year, with ~900,000 people living with the debilitating effects of&#xD;
      stroke.Individuals who experience a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIAÍ¾ minor stroke)&#xD;
      are at heightened risk of experiencing vascular events in the future, such as myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, stroke and secondary TIAs, and death. Of all the measures of interest, greater&#xD;
      blood pressure control is the most important contributor to positive health outcomes in&#xD;
      stroke patients. However, clinical practice, and research to date concentrate on the&#xD;
      assessment of peripheral blood pressure assessments (the blood pressure as identified from&#xD;
      the arm). The measurement of central haemodynamic parameters, including central systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (cSBP) and arterial wave reflection (i.e., augmentation index, AIx), hold the&#xD;
      potential to provide clinicians with important diagnostic and prognostic information beyond&#xD;
      that provided by traditional peripheral blood pressure readings. The assessment of central&#xD;
      blood pressure is important as it reflects the stress and loading on the left ventricle and&#xD;
      coronary arteries. Considering the marked differences in pulse pressure between the central&#xD;
      aorta and peripheral limbs, peripheral blood pressure may not accurately reflect the effects&#xD;
      of peak arterial blood pressure on centrally located organs. Previous research has&#xD;
      demonstrated central blood pressures to be 50 % superior to peripheral blood pressures when&#xD;
      predicting cardiovascular events, while in comparison to peripheral blood pressure, central&#xD;
      blood pressure may improve the management of hypertension. Owing to recent technological&#xD;
      advances, central haemodynamic parameters can be obtained quickly and noninvasively using an&#xD;
      automated blood pressure cuff (oscillometer).While the validity of these devices which&#xD;
      measure central haemodynamic parameters has been demonstrated, further study is required to&#xD;
      determine measurement precision (reliability) under normal clinical operating conditions&#xD;
      (i.e. , in the hospital or general practioner setting). As such, this study will assess the&#xD;
      influence of fasting status (fasted vs. nonfasted) and posture (seated vs. supine) on central&#xD;
      and peripheral blood pressure measures in patients diagnosed with stroke. The study will&#xD;
      determine whether these parameters can be reliably assessed and whether stroke severity&#xD;
      (major stroke, minor stroke, TIA) influences the reported results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single centre observational study. All stroke/TIA patients will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Royal Hampshire County Hospital within the Hampshire Hospital NHS Foundation Trust&#xD;
      (HHFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the inpatient and outpatient setting. For patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with a major or minor stroke and who have not been discharged from the hospital, recruitment&#xD;
      will take place on the acute stroke ward at the hospital. For these patients, all assessments&#xD;
      will also be undertaken within the hospital as patients will be based in the acute stroke&#xD;
      ward. For those patients identified with minor stroke or TIA within the emergency department&#xD;
      or outpatient setting (i.e., stroke clinics), and who not be staying in the acute stroke&#xD;
      ward, will be recruited from these settings. All assessments with these patients will take&#xD;
      place in the Physiology Laboratory at the University of Winchester. Written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All stroke (minor and major) patients will be assessed using the National Institute of Health&#xD;
      Stroke Severity Scale (NIHSS). All patients with suspected TIA with be assessed with the&#xD;
      ABCD2. Participants will comply with pharmacological treatment as recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in three separate assessment sessions, on three separate days,&#xD;
      with a minimum 24 hour recovery between each session. Before each assessment participants&#xD;
      will undertake an overnight fast (only water is allowed to be consumed prior to the&#xD;
      assessment). Participants will take their medication the morning of each assessment in&#xD;
      accordance with the normal pharmacological management procedures which are used on the acute&#xD;
      stroke ward at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital. Following this, participants will rest&#xD;
      supine for a minimum of 15 minutes. Oscillometric pressure waveforms (using the SphygmoCor&#xD;
      XCEL), recorded on the left upper arm, will assess haemodynamic parameters including central&#xD;
      and peripheral blood pressure, pulse pressure, and augmentation index. Two measurements will&#xD;
      be taken with a three-minute interval. If peripheral blood pressure is &gt; 5 mmHg or&#xD;
      augmentation index is &gt; 4 %, a third measure will be taken. Following this, participants will&#xD;
      be moved to a seated position and remain rested for a further 15 minutes. Identical&#xD;
      procedures to those outlined above will then be used to assess central and peripheral blood&#xD;
      pressure responses. Thereafter, patients will consume their normal breakfast. However,&#xD;
      caffeine cannot be consumed during this time. Thirty-minutes after food consumption&#xD;
      participants will undertake identical procedures as those outlined above in both a&#xD;
      non-fasted-supine and non-fasted-seated conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identical procedures to those outlined in the first assessment session will be used to assess&#xD;
      central and peripheral blood pressure measures during the second and third assessment day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oscillometric pressure waveforms will be recorded on the left upper arm using the SphygmoCor&#xD;
      XCEL device during all assessments, following standard manufacturer guidelines. Each&#xD;
      measurement cycle lasts approximately 60 sec, consisting of a brachial blood pressure&#xD;
      recording and then a 10 sec sub-systolic recording. A corresponding aortic pressure waveform&#xD;
      will then be generated using a validated transfer function, from which central systolic,&#xD;
      diastolic, pulse pressure (cSBP, cDBP, cPP), augmentation pressure (AP), and augmentation&#xD;
      index (AIx) will be derived. The AP is defined as cSBP minus the pressure at the inflection&#xD;
      point, whereby the inflection point is the merging of the forward and reflected waves. The&#xD;
      AIx is defined as the AP expressed as a percentage of cPP. AIx is influenced by heart rate,&#xD;
      and thus an index corrected for a heart rate at 75 beats per minute (AIx@75) will also be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central and peripheral blood pressures will be assessed in the following four conditions&#xD;
      during each of the three assessment sessions: i) fasted, supine, ii) fasted, seated, iii)&#xD;
      non-fasted supine, and iv) non-fasted seated. During each of the above conditions two&#xD;
      measurements will be taken, separated by a three-minute interval. If blood pressure differ by&#xD;
      &gt; 5mmHG a third recording will be taken and the closest recordings will be averaged. Each of&#xD;
      the above conditions will be undertaken following a minimum 15 minutes quite rest.&#xD;
