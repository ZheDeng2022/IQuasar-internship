    <textblock>
      The objective of this non-interventional study is to explore the safety, effectiveness and&#xD;
      quality of life of lenalidomide / dexamethasone as first line treatment for&#xD;
      transplant-ineligible patients with multiple myeloma in a real life setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of new drugs that can be differently combined with conventional chemotherapy&#xD;
      or low-dose dexamethasone has changed substantially the treatment paradigm for patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. A variety of treatment options is now available for elderly patients. To&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of continuous lenalidomide in combination with low-dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone (Rd) until progression vs. Rd for 18 cycles/72 weeks (Rd18) vs. melphalan,&#xD;
      prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) for 12 cycles/72 weeks a multicenter, open-label phase III&#xD;
      study (MM-020/IFM 07-01, FIRST trial) was performed in transplant ineligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After market approval of lenalidomide for previously untreated transplant-ineligible patients&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma, the purpose of the FIRST-NIS is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness&#xD;
      and quality of life of lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone as first line treatment&#xD;
      of multiple myeloma in a real life setting.&#xD;
