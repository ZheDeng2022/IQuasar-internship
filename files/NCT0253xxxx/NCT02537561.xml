  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed study the investigators will combine gemcitabine and cisplatin with&#xD;
      talazoparib to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of this combination regimen.&#xD;
      After determination of the RP2D patients with lung cancer whose tumors carry molecular&#xD;
      alterations in DNA repair pathway genes will be enrolled to an expansion cohort to determine&#xD;
      anti-tumor efficacy. Tissue samples of patients with confirmed partial response, complete&#xD;
      response, and non-responders will be obtained for whole exome, and transcriptome sequencing&#xD;
      to characterize the genetic alterations associated with response to therapy.&#xD;
