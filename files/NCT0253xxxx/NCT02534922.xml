    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase I open-label safety study of Prolanta™, a recombinant analog of the&#xD;
      human prolactin protein with a single amino acid substitution to create an antagonist of the&#xD;
      prolactin receptor. The Sponsor believes that blocking the prolactin receptor in patients&#xD;
      with ovarian and other cancers will be effective as a monotherapy or in combination with&#xD;
      other chemotherapies. This Phase I study will be conducted in Subjects with recurrent or&#xD;
      persistent epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human study designed to establish preliminary human safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters of Prolanta monotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
      In addition, biomarkers related to the activity of human prolactin will be examined in tumor&#xD;
      samples obtained prior to treatment and at the end of study treatment to determine the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of the dose levels of Prolanta administered. Three dosing levels will be&#xD;
      evaluated, and the dose at which no dose-limiting toxicities are observed will be the&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of its antagonist effect and the expected lower toxicity, Sponsor believes that&#xD;
      Prolanta may be administered continuously as a monotherapy or in conjunction with the&#xD;
      periodic administration of chemotherapy (i.e., a dual therapy). The dosing schedule to be&#xD;
      used in this trial is designed to evaluate, in increments, the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Prolanta over this 90 day cycle. Subjects will be assessed for antibody presence throughout&#xD;
      the study, initially on a weekly basis and then bi-weekly. Subjects will be initially dosed&#xD;
      for 28 days followed by a safety assessment period, and then continue for an additional 56&#xD;
      days if no toxicities are observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the safety and tolerability of Prolanta&#xD;
      in women with recurrent ovarian cancer and to determine the optimal dose of Prolanta to use&#xD;
      in Phase II studies. The safety evaluation will be determined by assessing treatment-emergent&#xD;
      adverse events, physical examination, ECG, changes in clinical laboratory results including&#xD;
      clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis, changes in pituitary hormone levels, and vital&#xD;
      signs including blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate. The optimal dose of Prolanta will&#xD;
      be determined by evaluating both the safety profile and blood levels of Prolanta. If&#xD;
      possible, the effect of the Prolanta dose on tumor biomarkers and tumor burden will also be&#xD;
      used to determine the optimally bioactive Phase II dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are (i) to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      Prolanta including Cmax, Tmax, half-life and area under the curve (AUC); (ii) to determine&#xD;
      the effect of treatment with Prolanta on tumor markers; (iii) to determine clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of Prolanta by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1&#xD;

             peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer. Histologic confirmation of the original&#xD;
             primary tumor is required.&#xD;
