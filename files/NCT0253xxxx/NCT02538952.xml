  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In Botswana, as in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, undiagnosed TB or TB diagnosed&#xD;
      late in the course of disease is thought to be the most common cause of death among&#xD;
      HIV-infected persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions for Evaluation: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the GeneXpert platform (Xpert) has&#xD;
      a TB diagnostic sensitivity of 82.4%, significantly superior to that of smear microscopy&#xD;
      (44.6%). In line with WHO guidelines, the Botswana Ministry of Health (MOH) and CDC rapidly&#xD;
      rolled out the Xpert device and a new Xpert-based diagnostic algorithm in service of 22 HIV&#xD;
      care and treatment clinics. To maximize impact of the Xpert device in improving detection of&#xD;
      active TB, Xpert rollout was preceded by strengthening of TB screening procedures by: (1)&#xD;
      adopting the WHO-recommended 4-symptom TB screen for adults; (2) situating trained TB&#xD;
      case-finding nurses in facilities; and (3) training health facility personnel in TB&#xD;
      diagnostic algorithms. The combination of these strengthened TB screening procedures and&#xD;
      rollout of the Xpert device is referred to as the &quot;Xpert package&quot; in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Evaluation Objectives: The protocol has two key objectives: (1) to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      new MOH-recommended Xpert-based TB diagnostic algorithm for new adult HIV clinic enrollees is&#xD;
      more sensitive than the pre-Xpert smear-microscopy-based algorithm in diagnosing&#xD;
      culture-positive TB disease; and (2) to evaluate the impact of the whole &quot;Xpert package&quot; on&#xD;
      all-cause mortality during the first 6 months of ART, among adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial. Sample Size: 6,136 patients were&#xD;
      prospectively enrolled to meet the first primary objective. A retrospective cohort of 10,131&#xD;
      persons was also enrolled to meet the second objective. Projected power to meet both&#xD;
      objectives is &gt;80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time line: Prospective cohort enrollment started in July 2012 and was complete by March 2014.&#xD;
      Retrospective cohort enrollment was complete by March 2015. Patient follow-up and data entry&#xD;
      will be complete in March 2016 at which time analysis to answer the first two primary study&#xD;
      questions will be possible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In Botswana, as in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
      or TB diagnosed late in the course of disease is thought to be the most common cause of death&#xD;
      among HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) as well as those not yet on&#xD;
      ART. Common reasons for failure to diagnose TB early, include: (1) failure to appropriately&#xD;
      screen HIV-infected patients for TB; and (2) difficulty in diagnosing TB with traditional&#xD;
      diagnostic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public Health Intervention: The recent development of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the&#xD;
      GeneXpert platform (Xpert) has revolutionized TB diagnostic capability for clinicians&#xD;
      managing HIV-infected patients. Among HIV-infected adults, TB diagnostic sensitivity of Xpert&#xD;
      (82.4%) has been proven superior to that of smear microscopy (44.6%). In line with World&#xD;
      Health organization (WHO) guidelines, the Botswana Ministry of Health (MOH) and the United&#xD;
      States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), initiated a project in July 2012 to&#xD;
      rapidly rollout 13 Xpert devices in service of 22 HIV care and treatment clinics while&#xD;
      simultaneously initiating an evaluation to answer important operational research questions&#xD;
      that can inform future national scale-up. To maximize the impact of the Xpert device in&#xD;
      improving detection of active TB, the Xpert rollout was preceded by strengthening of TB&#xD;
      screening procedures by: (1) ensuring the 22 HIV care and treatment clinics adopted the&#xD;
      WHO-recommended four-symptom TB screen for adults; (2) situating trained TB case-finding&#xD;
      nurses in all 22 facilities; and (3) training health facility personnel in both&#xD;
      smear-microscopy-based and Xpert-based TB diagnostic algorithms. The combination of these&#xD;
      strengthened TB screening procedures and rollout of the Xpert device is referred to as the&#xD;
      &quot;Xpert package&quot; in this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Evaluation Objectives: The evaluation component of this project has two key objectives:&#xD;
      (1) to evaluate whether the new MOH-recommended Xpert-based pulmonary TB diagnostic algorithm&#xD;
      (including Xpert testing of sputum samples for all TB suspects and chest x-ray for&#xD;
      Xpert-negative TB suspects) is more sensitive than the pre-Xpert smear-microscopy-based&#xD;
      algorithm (smear microscopy and chest x-ray for smear-negative TB suspects) in diagnosing&#xD;
      culture-positive TB disease; and (2) to evaluate the impact of the whole &quot;Xpert package&quot; on&#xD;
      all-cause mortality during the first six months of ART, among adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the First Evaluation Objective: Although it is expected that the Xpert-based TB&#xD;
      diagnostic algorithm will be both more sensitive and more specific than the pre-Xpert&#xD;
      algorithm, superiority of the Xpert- over the microscopy-based algorithm in Botswana has not&#xD;
      yet been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Second Evaluation Objective: In Botswana, undiagnosed TB or TB diagnosed&#xD;
      late in the course of disease is thought to be the most common cause of death among&#xD;
      HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The Xpert package could&#xD;
      conceivably reduce TB-related mortality by ensuring all patients are screened for TB and&#xD;
      ensuring TB suspects have access to a sensitive TB test (Xpert). Since the start of our&#xD;
      Botswana stepped wedge trial in 2012, two separate but related randomized trials in Africa,&#xD;
      the TB-NEAT study and the XTEND trial, have fallen short of demonstrating an association&#xD;
      between use of Xpert for patients with symptoms of TB and reduced TB mortality. However,&#xD;
      limitations in both these trials mean that the question of whether Xpert can reduce early ART&#xD;
      mortality has not been definitively answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Because the Xpert package is expected to have a beneficial effect for patients&#xD;
      enrolling in the 22 study clinics, a phased rollout of the Xpert device using a stepped wedge&#xD;
      design was chosen. Prior to Xpert device rollout, all 22 facilities initiated the intensified&#xD;
      TB screening procedures simultaneously. Subsequently, 13 Xpert devices were activated in a&#xD;
      step-wise manner over nine months with either one or two Xpert devices activated per month&#xD;
      and the order of Xpert device rollout randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This step-wedge design involved enrollment of three cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective cohort A (enrolled pre-Xpert device rollout): All patients who attended one&#xD;
           of the 22 HIV clinics for the first time after study start (July 31, 2012), but before&#xD;
           Xpert device rollout, were eligible for this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prospective cohort B (enrolled post-Xpert device rollout): All patients who attend one&#xD;
           of the 22 HIV clinics for the first time after Xpert device rollout were eligible for&#xD;
           this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retrospective cohort: All patients who initiated ART at one of the 22 HIV clinics for&#xD;
           the first time in the 24 months before study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the first primary study question, sensitivity of the pre- Xpert TB diagnostic&#xD;
      algorithm in prospective cohort A will be compared with the post- Xpert algorithm sensitivity&#xD;
      in prospective cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the second primary study question, the investigators will compare 6-month ART&#xD;
      mortality rates of ART enrollees in the retrospective cohort with 6-month ART mortality rates&#xD;
      in prospective cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power to Answer First Primary Study Question: Fisher's Exact Test sample size formula for&#xD;
      comparing two proportions and Proc Power features in SAS version 9.2. software, were used to&#xD;
      estimate study power. Power estimates were adjusted for the expected design effect to account&#xD;
      for intra-cluster correlation. For design effect calculations, an intra-class correlation of&#xD;
      0.05 was assumed. With an anticipated sample size of 6,136 prospective enrollees (1,878&#xD;
      pre-Xpert and 4,258 post-Xpert), the study is estimated to have &gt;80% power to detect pre-&#xD;
      versus post-Xpert TB diagnostic sensitivities, assuming a culture-positive TB prevalence of&#xD;
      4% among prospective cohort enrollees, if pre-Xpert sensitivity is ≤52.5% and post-Xpert&#xD;
      sensitivity is ≥82.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power to Answer Second Primary Study Question: As of August 2015, 10,131 ART patient medical&#xD;
      records had been abstracted for the retrospective cohort. Published literature suggests&#xD;
      pre-Xpert 6-month ART mortality rates should be about 15 per 100 person years (PY). Using&#xD;
      published cluster randomized trial (CRT) power formulae adapted for stepped wedge trials and&#xD;
      anticipated study sample sizes, the study has &gt;80% power to detect a difference in 6-month&#xD;
      all-cause ART mortality between cohorts R and B of 50% if cohort R mortality is ≥6/100 PY and&#xD;
      of 40% if cohort R mortality is ≥13/100 PY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: All 22 health facilities were assessed prior to training to troubleshoot&#xD;
      potential logistical barriers to successful study implementation. All personnel involved in&#xD;
      study procedures were trained before study start and closely supervised during&#xD;
      implementation. Patients enrolled in the prospective cohorts are being followed for six&#xD;
      months after HIV clinic enrollment, or through the end of TB treatment, whichever is later.&#xD;
      Tracing of ART patients in retrospective and prospective cohorts, who are documented as late&#xD;
      for appointments or lost to follow-up (missed last scheduled appointment by &gt;60 days) has&#xD;
      been performed according to national guidelines to facilitate estimation of true 6-month ART&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time line: Prospective cohort enrollment started in July 2012 and was complete by March 2014.&#xD;
      Retrospective cohort enrollment was complete by March 2015. Patient follow-up and data entry&#xD;
      will be complete in March 2016 at which time analysis to answer the first two primary study&#xD;
      questions will be possible.&#xD;
