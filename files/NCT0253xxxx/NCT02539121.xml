    <textblock>
      In this study, a single blind randomized trial with third party evaluation is carried out in&#xD;
      order to compare the postpartum blood loss when Ren Mai 6 point is stimulated and when this&#xD;
      point is not stimulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators focus on measuring the volume of postpartum blood during the third stage of&#xD;
      labor and during the first two hours after birth. A significant reduction in the volume of&#xD;
      bleeding would imply a reduction in the rate of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (more than 500&#xD;
      ml) and the rate of severe PPH (more than 1000 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal outcome of the study is the volume of postpartum blood, this volume is measured&#xD;
      by the midwife who is responsible of the birth. Collection of lost blood is initiated&#xD;
      immediately after birth of the baby by passing a blood collection drape under the woman's&#xD;
      buttocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are the influence of acupuncture in the placental expulsion time, and&#xD;
      the influence of the predictor variables in the bleeding volume and in the placental&#xD;
      expulsion time: primiparity or multiparity, number of gestation including abortions, doses of&#xD;
      oxytocin during labor, maternal age, maternal weight in the beginning of the gestation,&#xD;
      maternal ponderal gain during pregnancy, date of the last blood test during pregnancy and&#xD;
      value of hemoglobin and hematocrit, spontaneous labor or induction by means of oxytocin or&#xD;
      prostaglandins, spontaneous or artificial rupture of membranes, first stage of labor&#xD;
      duration, second stage of labor duration, hours since rupture of membranes, hours since&#xD;
      epidural analgesia, volume of serotherapy during labor, and newborn weight. Possible&#xD;
      puerperal complications or security problems, the degree of Satisfaction of the Mother and&#xD;
      the degree of ease with which the acupuncturist administered the treatment are also secondary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a single-blind randomized clinical trial with parallel design, and&#xD;
      third party evaluation at the Hospital Universitario Príncipe de Asturias in Alcalá de&#xD;
      Henares (Madrid, Spain). The study will be carry out with pregnant women who were in labor at&#xD;
      this hospital. Information sheets about the study will be distributed by the different health&#xD;
      care centers coordinated by the hospital. The midwives will give the information sheets to&#xD;
      pregnant women during the pregnancy's attendances. The objective is to let pregnant women&#xD;
      know about the study before their labor date in order to encourage them to participate in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in the experiment. These requirements includes pregnant women from&#xD;
      18 to 40 years old, with eutectic delivery, gestation between 37 and 42 weeks, labors with&#xD;
      epidural analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the procedure and data collection, the acupuncturist will request permission to&#xD;
      midwife responsible of the mother for their collaboration in the study in the pre-labor room.&#xD;
      The acupuncturist will explain the study to the mother and her partner and will apply for her&#xD;
      voluntary participation being the informed consent offered then. All information will be&#xD;
      given when the pregnant woman is without pain of labor, preferably when the woman is under&#xD;
      the epidural analgesia effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding to the selection of patients, a randomization scheme will be performed using an&#xD;
      envelope based method. The researches will have opaque envelopes with a number outside, this&#xD;
      number being the code of the patient in the study. After the approval of the pregnant woman&#xD;
      and informed consent, the acupuncturist opens the envelop which will indicate the treatment&#xD;
      to follow, either control or intervention group. So, investigators guarantee randomization,&#xD;
      blindness and unpredictable selection of the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the labor ward, after delivery, the baby is placed on the abdomen of the puerperal mother&#xD;
      to facilitate maternal link. Collection of lost blood is initiated immediately after birth of&#xD;
      the baby by passing a blood collection bag under the woman's buttocks. The birth attendant&#xD;
      clamps the umbilical cord at first minute after birth and the acupuncturist midwife performed&#xD;
      the acupuncture procedure depending on the group assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group with real acupuncture, after the umbilical cord is clamped, the&#xD;
      acupuncturist disinfects the abdominal area with antiseptic and pricks the needle in the&#xD;
      point Ren Mai 6. In the control group the puncture of the Ren Mai 6 is not performed. In both&#xD;
      cases, the needle is covered with a opaque plastic cup and the cup is set with adhesive tape,&#xD;
      guaranteeing that both the midwife responsible of the birth and the puerperal woman do not&#xD;
      know if the Ren Mai 6 acupuncture point has been punctured or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, the midwife responsible of the birth expects to note the signs of placental&#xD;
      separation such as a gush of blood, uterine contraction, lengthening of the umbilical cord,&#xD;
      and visualization of the placenta in the vagina, and then encourage the woman to cough of&#xD;
      push. When the placental has been expelled, the midwife pays attention to the time passed&#xD;
      from the delivery to the placental expulsion, and she changes the collected bleeding drape&#xD;
      for another one if the puerperal women has to be sutured. Finally, a nappy is settled to the&#xD;
      puerperal woman until the first two hours after birth. This procedure is routinely used at&#xD;
      this hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The midwife responsible of the birth weights one or both blood collection drapes, gauzes used&#xD;
      and nappy, and registers the data in a specific record. Taking into account the total weight&#xD;
      and the amount of material used, the volume of blood loss is estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey will be fulfilled by the acupuncturist no more than 2 hours after the intervention.&#xD;
      In this survey, the midwife takes notes on the level of ease with which the technique was&#xD;
      performed with four possible answers (high, moderate, medium and low ease level).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the acupuncturist will ask to the puerperal woman if she would recommend this&#xD;
      technique to any of her friends with two possibles answers (yes or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placental expulsion time will be measured after the childbirth is occurred. The weight of&#xD;
      the blood collected drapes, gauzes and nappy is registered in the first two hours after&#xD;
      birth, so too, the satisfaction of professionals and participants is noted in this time.&#xD;
      After this period of time, the puerperal woman is moved to the obstetrics plant which is out&#xD;
      of the labor room. Participants will be followed-up during the hospital stay, an expected&#xD;
      average of 2 days. The physician in charge of evaluation of the welfare of the puerperal&#xD;
      woman will annotate the existence or not of complications during the hospital stay in the&#xD;
      medical record of the woman, as it is routinely done at hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the study will be performed in conditions of respect for individual rights and ethical&#xD;
      principles affecting biomedical research involving human. Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      fulfilled by all participants. In particular, the physical and mental integrity of women will&#xD;
      be safeguarded, as well as privacy and data protection in accordance to the Spanish Organic&#xD;
      Law 15/1999, of December 13, Protection of Personal Data. All the participants will give&#xD;
      their informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki assuring&#xD;
      confidentiality and freedom to withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
