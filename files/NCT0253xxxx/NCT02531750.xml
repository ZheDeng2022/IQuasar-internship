      Introduction This study will evaluate the effect on glucose, lipid and bone metabolism&#xD;
      following conservative orthopaedic procedures in patients who suffered from acute Achilles&#xD;
      tendon rupture. The sedentary rehabilitation period following these procedures may impact&#xD;
      negatively upon glucose, lipid and bone metabolic pathways whereas the more physically active&#xD;
      rehabilitation period instituted 8 weeks after the injury is hypothesized to impose positive&#xD;
      metabolic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is addition to the on-going clinical trial, Non-operative Treatment of Acute&#xD;
      Achilles Tendon Rupture: Early Controlled Mobilization Compared With Immobilization,&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02015364.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective This study will establish whether the well-known effects on glucose, lipid and&#xD;
      bone metabolism of a sedentary lifestyle can be observed already following 8 weeks of almost&#xD;
      total abstain from physical activity in non-diabetic individuals, who suffered an acute&#xD;
      Achilles tendon rupture. Thereby, we will add knowledge to the previous findings following&#xD;
      strict bed-rest in healthy individuals on glucose and lipid metabolism and bone turnover. In&#xD;
      a clinical perspective it is important to examine the extent to which individuals deteriorate&#xD;
      in various metabolic pathways to better understand the pathophysiology behind these defects&#xD;
      both in healthy individuals and in patients, who undergo bed rest or an equal reduction in&#xD;
      physical activity as part of their rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The present study includes 50 cases, who are examined early following injury (&lt;&#xD;
      2 weeks) (baseline), 8 weeks (6 - 10 weeks) after injury and 52 weeks (40 - 64 weeks) after&#xD;
      injury, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with ingestion of 75 g of glucose during a maximum of 3&#xD;
      min from baseline (0 min). Plasma for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, NEFA will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual will bring in morning spot urine for measurement of suPAR, creatinine, albumin&#xD;
      and orosomucoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual will have drawn blood for measurement of HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, Na, K, creatinine, HgB, CRP, leukocytes, ALAT,&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase, Ca++, D vitamin, TSH, albumine and amylase. Also blood for BTM and&#xD;
      plasma suPAR, IL6, TNFa and hsCRP will be drawn. Finally blood for lipid density profiling&#xD;
      and lipid particle size will be drawn DXA of hip and lumbar spine including abdominal&#xD;
      visceral and subcutaneous fat is done on a Hologic Discovery scanner.&#xD;

      Introduction This study will evaluate the effect on glucose, lipid and bone metabolism&#xD;
      following conservative orthopaedic procedures in patients who suffered from acute Achilles&#xD;
      tendon rupture. The sedentary rehabilitation period following these procedures may impact&#xD;
      negatively upon glucose, lipid and bone metabolic pathways whereas the more physically active&#xD;
      rehabilitation period instituted 8 weeks after the injury is hypothesized to impose positive&#xD;
      metabolic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An on-going clinical trial, Non-operative Treatment of Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture: Early&#xD;
      Controlled Mobilization Compared With Immobilization, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:&#xD;
      NCT02015364 is already addressing as primary endpoints the Achilles tendon total rupture&#xD;
      score and patient reported validation score developed to assess symptoms and physical&#xD;
      activity after treatment for Achilles tendon rupture. The present study is an&#xD;
      amendment/extension of that ongoing clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with frequent measurements of glucose, insulin,&#xD;
      C-peptide and plasma free fatty acids can provide detailed information on insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, glucose tolerance, beta cell function, lipolysis and lipid oxidation as well as&#xD;
      metabolic clearance of insulin(11-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern DXA scanners exhibit high performance and sensitivity to distinguish small changes in&#xD;
      BMD. Also sensitive markers of changes in bone metabolism have recently been available. In&#xD;
      particular two bone mass turnover markers (BTM) have been suggested to monitor bone&#xD;
      resorption (CTX, carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptides of type 1 collagen) and bone&#xD;
      formation ( P1NP, procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide(14), but also osteocalcin (OC)&#xD;
      is suggested as a marker of bone formation. DXA scanners have recently been validated to&#xD;
      measure visceral adiposity, which is strongly associated with insulin sensitivity(15). A DXA&#xD;
      scan exposes the individual to an X-ray radiation equal to only one day of background&#xD;
      radiation, which makes this scanning modality much less harmful in terms of radiation dose&#xD;
      compared to traditional CT scans (a 100-fold less radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional markers of low grade inflammation (LGI) include TNFa and IL6 and hsCRP. New&#xD;
      promising markers include suPAR in plasma and urine and urine orosomucoid. suPAR has shown to&#xD;
      predict CVD in non-diabetic community resting individuals(16). Urine orosomucoid is a strong&#xD;
      predictor of major events in T2D and might be an early marker of glucose metabolic&#xD;
      derangement(17). Low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and especially those with a low&#xD;
      particle size are atherogenic(18). Thus increased levels of LGI markers and immune markers&#xD;
      including small LDL particles exhibit a particular at herogenic cocktail. A sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle is associated with an increase in these markers of LGI, impaired immune response&#xD;
      and dyslipidaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present setting we want to investigate the putative negative impact on glucose, lipid,&#xD;
      and bone metabolism during a period of restrain from exercise secondary to immobilization&#xD;
      following Achilles tendon rupture. We also want to study these patients during their physical&#xD;
      active rehabilitation (at week 8 - 52), to establish whether they succeed in improving the&#xD;
      metabolic impairments they suffered during the early post-injury period, during which period&#xD;
      strong limitations in physical activity is prescribed (week 0 - 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective This study will establish whether the well-known effects on glucose, lipid and&#xD;
      bone metabolism of a sedentary lifestyle can be observed already following 8 weeks of almost&#xD;
      total abstain from physical activity in non-diabetic individuals, who suffered an acute&#xD;
      Achilles tendon rupture. Thereby, we will add knowledge to the previous findings following&#xD;
      strict bed-rest in healthy individuals on glucose and lipid metabolism and bone turnover. In&#xD;
      a clinical perspective it is important to examine the extent to which individuals deteriorate&#xD;
      in various metabolic pathways to better understand the pathophysiology behind these defects&#xD;
      both in healthy individuals and in patients, who undergo bed rest or an equal reduction in&#xD;
      physical activity as part of their rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Implementation of a sedentary lifestyle with almost no physical activity in&#xD;
      non-diabetic individuals undergoing non-operative treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture&#xD;
      will during 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impair insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decrease disposition index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compensatory decrease in insulin clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decrease lipid oxidation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase visceral adipose tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase number of low density lipoprotein particles and a decrease the particle size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase immune and low grade inflammatory response as measured in plasma and urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  induce bone loss in hip as measured by BMD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase bone resorption and decrease bone formation as measured by selected bone&#xD;
           turnover markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the following physical active rehabilitation from week 8 to week 52 the above proposed&#xD;
      negative impact upon glucose, lipid and bone metabolism is thought to reverse at least partly&#xD;
      so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relative positive effect on metabolic performance is hypothesized to be associated with&#xD;
      duration from immobilization to full mobilization, which will be monitored by use of&#xD;
      validated tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Fifty non-diabetic individuals of age 18 to 70 years who should undergo&#xD;
      non-operative treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture and who are included to the&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial: Non-operative Treatment of Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture: Early&#xD;
      Controlled Mobilization Compared With Immobilization, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:&#xD;
      NCT02015364 at the department of orthopaedics, Hvidovre Hospital are recruited as cases for&#xD;
      this study. That study examines the effect on functional outcome measures of early controlled&#xD;
      mobilization of the ankle from the beginning of week 3 following injury versus full&#xD;
      immobilization during the initial 8 weeks post injury. Both groups are allowed full&#xD;
      weight-bearing from the beginning of week 3 and physical activity level is expected to be the&#xD;
      same in the two groups. As such randomization regime is unlikely to influence metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study includes 50 cases, who are examined early following injury (&lt; 2 weeks)&#xD;
      (baseline), 8 weeks (6 - 10 weeks) after injury and 52 weeks (40 - 64 weeks) after injury,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with ingestion of 75 g of glucose during a&#xD;
      maximum of 3 min from baseline (0 min). Plasma for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, NEFA will be&#xD;
      drawn at time -10, -5, -1, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, 180, 240 min. This&#xD;
      test will be performed in the morning starting at approximately 8 am. The tests are done&#xD;
      after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual will bring in morning spot urine for measurement of suPAR, creatinine, albumin&#xD;
      and orosomucoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the OGTT the individual will have drawn blood for measurement of HbA1c, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, Na, K, creatinine, HgB, CRP,&#xD;
      leukocytes, ALAT, alkaline phosphatase, Ca++, D vitamin, TSH, albumine and amylase. Also&#xD;
      blood for BTM and plasma suPAR, IL6, TNFa and hsCRP will be drawn. Finally blood for lipid&#xD;
      density profiling and lipid particle size will be drawn before the OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight and height and waist and hip circumference will be measured. DXA of hip and&#xD;
      lumbar columna including abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat is done on a Hologic&#xD;
      Discovery scanner by use of updated software. DXA will be carried out approximately at 12 am.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition of glucose and lipid metabolism will be done by use of the MinModel and the NEFA&#xD;
      MinModel as described (11;12) All blood and urine samples will be destroyed after analysis.&#xD;
      However a research biobank will be established since the period of time from most blood and&#xD;
      urine sampling until analysis exceeds 1 week. This study will store all urine and blood&#xD;
      samples in a freezer until all case subjects and controls have finished examinations. The&#xD;
      duration of this period will be maximum 2 years from last patient last visit. Thus the&#xD;
      research biobank will be established for storage only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urine and blood samples will be destroyed after analysis at Hvidovre and Glostrup&#xD;
      Hospitals. Analysis results will all be anonymous and some will be sent abroad to our&#xD;
      researcher Prof. Raymond Boston in USA, who will perform statistical calculations from&#xD;
      analysis data. Permission for establishment of a research biobank is obtained from the Danish&#xD;
      Data protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of physical activity are acquired from the Primary Investigators ongoing trial&#xD;
      &quot;Non-operative Treatment of Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture: Early Controlled Mobilization&#xD;
      Compared With Immobilization&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Ten days of bed rest in 13 healthy young individuals showed a 20% (P&lt;0.05)&#xD;
      significant decrease in insulin sensitivity and a 50% (P&lt;0.05) reduction in lipid&#xD;
      oxidation(2). Thirty-one days of bed rest in 8 healthy women was significantly associated&#xD;
      with bone loss in total hip (2.07%, P&lt;0.001)(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study does not imply strict bed rest but exhibits a longer sedentary period of&#xD;
      following up compared to the above studies and include a larger number of participants, also.&#xD;
      During the initial 8 weeks of strictly sedentary immobilization following the injury of the&#xD;
      Achilles tendon we suggest that the patients will decrease their insulin sensitivity by at&#xD;
      least 20%, the estimate of SD of the endpoint is 20%. Thus, using the MIREDIF statistics&#xD;
      (Douglas Altman, Practical statistics for Medical research, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1999), we can&#xD;
      calculate that a population of 22 patients will generate a power &gt;90% at significance level&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05 to investigate that primary endpoint. Similarly, the SD on lipidoxidation is 30% and&#xD;
      the estimate is that the change during the sedentary period is at least 30%, thus by n=22&#xD;
      patients the power will be &gt; 90%. Finally the change in BMD is likely 1% and the SD is 1%,&#xD;
      thus n=22 patients will provide a statistical power of at least 90%. During the period of&#xD;
      physical restitution we estimate a fully reversion of the deficit in endpoints during the&#xD;
      sedentary period, i.e. similar calculation on power is valid during the restitution period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the present study are included from the randomized clinical trial:&#xD;
      Non-operative Treatment of Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture: Early Controlled Mobilization&#xD;
      Compared with Immobilization. Randomization regime is unlikely to influence metabolism,&#xD;
      however, it will be considered as a variable in the statistical analyses of the endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues The study adheres to the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data and, Danish&#xD;
      Act on Health and the Helsinki II convention of clinical trials. All participants are&#xD;
      informed about the purpose of the study and all ethical issues and a written consent is&#xD;
      obtained before participation. At any given time, the participants can withdraw their&#xD;
      acceptant for participation in the study. Personal data concerning demographic relations such&#xD;
      as gender and age will be accessed as well to ensure the case subjects meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and for statistically use. To make assessments on study participation, the principal&#xD;
      investigator will also gain access to relevant data from the patients medical files&#xD;
      concerning illnesses or conditions the case subject might report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of blood drawn during the 52 weeks of participation in the study is less than 500&#xD;
      ml, which is the standard amount of blood drawn at a single donation of blood from a blood&#xD;
      donor. The use of intravenous cannula can cause irritation or infection of vein or insertion&#xD;
      site. All procedures will be performed as described in SOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The X-ray radiation from DXA during the study period equals 3 days of background radiation in&#xD;
      Denmark and this amount of radiation is 30-fold less than that of a standard CT-scan of&#xD;
      abdomen. In other words the dose of radiation is so low that a calculation of risk is not&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
