    <textblock>
      The Keystone Heart TriGuard™ HDH is an aortic embolism deflection device intended to reduce&#xD;
      the amount of embolic material that may enter the carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries&#xD;
      during transcatheter heart valve implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the TriGuard™ HDH embolic&#xD;
      deflection device in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), in&#xD;
      comparison with an active control group of patients undergoing unprotected TAVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with indications for TAVI and who meet study eligibility criteria will be randomized&#xD;
      2:1 to one of two treatment arms: 1) Intervention: Embolic protection device (TriGuard™) with&#xD;
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation or 2) Control: Unprotected transcatheter aortic valve&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;

      This prospective, single-blind, three arm, randomized, (2 device: 1 control), multicenter&#xD;
      safety and efficacy trial is designed to enroll up to 603 total subjects in two consecutive&#xD;
      phases: Phase I enrolled 258 subjects (including 54 Roll-Ins) and utilized the TriGuard HDH&#xD;
      and Phase II will enroll up to 345 subjects (including 40-50 Roll-Ins) and will utilize the&#xD;
      TriGUARD 3 (Figure 3b shows the patient flow/disposition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I In phase I, a total of 204 evaluable subjects and 54 roll-in subjects were enrolled&#xD;
      at 26 total investigational sites in the United States, Europe, and Israel, of which 20 sites&#xD;
      were in the United States. A minimum of 50% of subjects were planned to be enrolled at US&#xD;
      sites, and no single site was permitted to enroll more than 20% of all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with indications for TAVI and who met study eligibility criteria were randomized 2:1&#xD;
      (stratified by study site) to one of two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention (Phase 1 Cohort) - TAVI with the TriGuard HDH CEPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control - standard unprotected TAVI At sites where the investigator did not have prior&#xD;
           experience with the TriGuard device (minimum of 2 prior cases), up to 3 roll-in subjects&#xD;
           were enrolled. Roll-in subjects were not randomized, but underwent TAVI with the&#xD;
           TriGuard HDH device. These cases were proctored by a Sponsor representative.&#xD;
           Investigational sites with ≥2 prior TriGuard cases were allowed to enroll 1 roll-in&#xD;
           subject at the discretion of the site principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were to be followed clinically in-hospital and at 30 and 90 days, and to undergo&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted MR imaging 2 to 5 days post-procedure, and neurologic and&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing pre-procedure, post-procedure (2-5 days post-procedure), and at 30&#xD;
      and 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial randomized cohort expected to enroll up to 285 subjects. Note: Enrollment in&#xD;
      Phase I has been halted after enrolling a total of 258 subjects (54 roll-ins and 204&#xD;
      randomized subjects including 63 controls) based on the recommendation of the Data Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee following a review of interim 30-day data on 90 subjects at the prespecified&#xD;
      interim analysis time point. A next iteration device designed for increased efficacy, ease of&#xD;
      use, and improved safety will be tested in Phase II (below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II In Phase II, up to 295 randomized subjects and 40-50 roll-in subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled at up to 25 sites in the United States (inclusive of sites enrolling subjects in&#xD;
      Phase I). No single site will be permitted to enroll more than 20% of all randomized subjects&#xD;
      in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with indications for TAVI and who meet study eligibility criteria will be randomized&#xD;
      2:1 (stratified by study site) to one of two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention - TAVI with the TriGUARD 3 CEPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control - standard unprotected TAVI. Randomization will be stratified by implanted valve&#xD;
           type (Medtronic vs. Edwards).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No single valve type will be implanted in more than approximately 70% of randomized patients&#xD;
      (phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roll-in subjects (a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 Roll-ins per-site) will not be&#xD;
      randomized, but will undergo TAVI with the TriGUARD 3 device. These cases will be proctored&#xD;
      by a Sponsor representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed clinically in-hospital and at 30 days, undergo&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted MR imaging 2 to 5 days post-procedure, and undergo neurologic (NIHSS)&#xD;
      testing pre-procedure, post-procedure (2-5 days post-procedure), and at 30 days. A follow-up&#xD;
      phone-call to assess the occurrence of death or stroke will be done at 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial randomized cohort will consist of up to 225 subjects. After at least 50% of the&#xD;
      initial randomized cohort (approximately 112 subjects) have reached the 30 day primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint evaluation time point, a sample size reestimation will be performed in case&#xD;
      the conditional power of the trial (assessed by the independent biostatistician) is &gt;40% but&#xD;
      &lt;80%, subject to approval by the Sponsor. If this analysis determines that more than 225&#xD;
      randomized subjects will be required to ensure adequate study power, enrollment may continue&#xD;
      until the required number of subjects have been enrolled, or until the total subject limit&#xD;
      for the study has been reached (whichever occurs first).&#xD;

        <description>Combined safety endpoint at 30 days defined according to VARC-2 (&quot;TAVI early safety&quot;) as a composite of:&#xD;
All-cause mortality - number of patients that expired&#xD;
All stroke (disabling and non-disabling) - defined by VARC-2 scale&#xD;
Life-threatening or disabled bleeding - BARC bleeding scale - 5 point scale ranging from no bleeding to fatal&#xD;
Acute kidney injury - Stage 2 or 3 (including renal replacement therapy)&#xD;
Coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention&#xD;
Major vascular complication, and&#xD;
Valve-related dysfunction requiring repeat procedure (BAV, TAVI, or SAVR) - number of patients in whom a valve related dysfunction occurred It was pre-specified to combine all participants that received the device in the andomized Intervention and Roll-in Arms/Groups for this Outcome Measure.</description>
        <time_frame>30 Days</time_frame>
        <population>The population that received the investigational device, Treatment and Rollin patients against safety performance goal. 5 patients withdrew prior to receiving the device resulting in 157 (121Tx+41RI-5). Control patients did not receive the device and were not evaluated in safety endpoint. Composite endpoint is comprised of the number of events against total number of events in accordance with MACCE. The safety endpoint was pre-specified to be calculated separately for the Roll-In population.</population>

          <description>Combined safety endpoint at 30 days defined according to VARC-2 (&quot;TAVI early safety&quot;) as a composite of:&#xD;
All-cause mortality - number of patients that expired&#xD;
All stroke (disabling and non-disabling) - defined by VARC-2 scale&#xD;
Life-threatening or disabled bleeding - BARC bleeding scale - 5 point scale ranging from no bleeding to fatal&#xD;
Acute kidney injury - Stage 2 or 3 (including renal replacement therapy)&#xD;
Coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention&#xD;
Major vascular complication, and&#xD;
Valve-related dysfunction requiring repeat procedure (BAV, TAVI, or SAVR) - number of patients in whom a valve related dysfunction occurred It was pre-specified to combine all participants that received the device in the andomized Intervention and Roll-in Arms/Groups for this Outcome Measure.</description>
          <population>The population that received the investigational device, Treatment and Rollin patients against safety performance goal. 5 patients withdrew prior to receiving the device resulting in 157 (121Tx+41RI-5). Control patients did not receive the device and were not evaluated in safety endpoint. Composite endpoint is comprised of the number of events against total number of events in accordance with MACCE. The safety endpoint was pre-specified to be calculated separately for the Roll-In population.</population>
