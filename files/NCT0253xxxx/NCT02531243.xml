  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether a new family therapy using computer games with&#xD;
      biofeedback might help people at clinical high risk for psychosis and their family members&#xD;
      learn to experience less stress and have fewer mental health challenges.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CALMS revolves around the use of Emotional Manipulatives (EM) developed at Boston Children's&#xD;
      Hospital (BCH). EM are single and multi-user biofeedback games designed to enhance executive&#xD;
      control of emotion. The intervention and EM in CALMS were adapted from those used in Anger&#xD;
      Control Training (ACT) with Regulate and Gain Emotional Control (RAGE-Control). In a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial at BCH, ACT and RAGE-Control relative to &quot;sham&quot; video-game play&#xD;
      without biofeedback led to significantly greater reductions of aggression in adolescents and&#xD;
      greater improvement in family functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this feasibility study, family dyads will participate in 12 sessions aimed at&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. enhancing engagement through the use of video and other games,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. enhancing stress resilience through biofeedback, education, and individualized&#xD;
           stress-reduction practice, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. harnessing the power of the family to enhance contextual learning and the generality and&#xD;
           duration of effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, self-report, and heart rate measures will be assessed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12&#xD;
      week assessments.&#xD;
