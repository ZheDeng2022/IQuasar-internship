      This study aims to establish the ability of 4,000 IU oral vitamin D3 per day (in combination&#xD;
      with a daily multivitamin) to safely convert vitamin D3-deficient subjects at increased risk&#xD;
      of lung cancer to a vitamin D3-sufficient state, and to explore effects of vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplementation in this population on markers of inflammation and lung cancer risk. Current&#xD;
      and former smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of&#xD;
      developing lung cancer and represent the clinical population of interest for this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking avoidance or cessation are essential to the prevention of lung cancer. However, not&#xD;
      all smokers are able to quit smoking and, importantly, former smokers remain at increased&#xD;
      risk of lung cancer compared to never smokers. Despite smoking prevention/cessation programs&#xD;
      and treatment advances, lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in&#xD;
      the United States with more than 158,000 individuals expected to die from this disease in&#xD;
      2015. Effective and safe prevention strategies are expected to be more successful in reducing&#xD;
      lung cancer deaths than treatment of established disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NF-kappaB (NF-kB) pathway activation underlies smoking-related inflammation and lung&#xD;
      carcinogenesis, and those agents which suppress NF-κB signaling may have the potential to&#xD;
      prevent lung cancer. Recent preclinical data from our group and others indicate that the&#xD;
      active metabolite of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], has lung cancer&#xD;
      chemopreventive activity. Because systemic 1,25(OH)2D3 administration is complicated by its&#xD;
      hypercalcemia-inducing properties, the investigators propose to use oral supplementation with&#xD;
      vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) to safely achieve chemopreventive 1,25(OH)2D3 levels within the&#xD;
      lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIb study aims to evaluate the ability of 4,000 IU&#xD;
      oral vitamin D3/day (in combination with a daily multivitamin) to safely convert vitamin&#xD;
      D3-deficient subjects at risk of lung cancer to a vitamin D3-sufficient state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited from among Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study Extension&#xD;
      (PLuSS-X) and PLuSS-XX participants not diagnosed with lung cancer, and from among the&#xD;
      patient population seen by the PI of this protocol. The study consists of two stages, a&#xD;
      screening and an intervention stage, with their own consent forms. In Stage 1 (the screening&#xD;
      stage), the vitamin D3 status of subjects potentially eligible for participation in the&#xD;
      intervention will be determined; in Stage 2 (the intervention stage), supplementation with&#xD;
      oral vitamin D3 will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who fulfill the eligibility criteria and provided signed consent for Stage 2&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive: (A) 4,000 IU vitamin D3 plus a multivitamin&#xD;
      (containing 400 IU vitamin D3) daily for one year, or (B) a placebo vitamin D3 pill plus a&#xD;
      multivitamin daily for one year. Both groups will contain equal numbers of current and&#xD;
      ex-smokers; in total 120 subjects will be randomized. To evaluate whether supplementation&#xD;
      safely corrects vitamin D3 deficiency in this population, blood samples will be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months of intervention for evaluation of 25(OH)D3 and serum calcium.&#xD;
      The collected blood will also be used to facilitate biomarker assessment. Pulmonary function&#xD;
      tests (PFTs) will be obtained at baseline and repeated after 12 months to determine whether&#xD;
      supplementation has an effect on lung function. Sputum and nasal epithelium will be collected&#xD;
      at baseline, 6 months and 12 months to facilitate biomarker assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study Objectives Primary Objective: To establish the 12-month conversion rate (i.e.,&#xD;
      proportion of subjects whose baseline vitamin D3 deficiency is corrected after 12 months of&#xD;
      supplementation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To determine the 3-month and 6-month conversion rates and examine the&#xD;
      effect of vitamin D3 supplementation in current and former smokers. Additionally, to examine&#xD;
      the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on biomarkers of lung cancer risk, inflammation,&#xD;
      and pulmonary function.&#xD;
