      The purpose of this study is to learn more about personalized cancer therapy including&#xD;
      response to treatment and side effects. Information from the patient's medical record&#xD;
      regarding the tests and treatments they have received, or will receive, for their cancer will&#xD;
      be collected. Genomic testing on tissue from the primary tumor or metastases will be used to&#xD;
      match therapy recommendations. Patients in which there is no appropriate matched therapy will&#xD;
      receive systemic chemotherapy according to their treating physician's discretion. This&#xD;
      information will be used to describe whether or not patients respond better when their&#xD;
      physicians choose to treat them according to the genetic makeup of their tumor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label navigational investigation to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      using molecular profile-based evidence to determine individualized cancer therapy for&#xD;
      patients with incurable malignancies. This is a non-randomized, histology-agnostic trial.&#xD;
      While it is known that individual histologies are composed of a heterogeneous mix of genomic&#xD;
      alterations, it is not clear that one case mix is better or worse than another. Thus, a&#xD;
      strategy of molecular matching that may apply across cancers is being tested. All eligible&#xD;
      and consented patients will have their tumor tissues genomic profiled by Foundation&#xD;
      Medicine's FoundationOne genomic analysis. Patients will be stratified into Group 1&#xD;
      (treatment naïve, unresectable/medically unfit for surgery), Group 2 (treatment naïve,&#xD;
      metastatic), and Group 3 (prior treated), respectively. Following analysis for genomic&#xD;
      alterations, matched therapy, if available, will be recommended by the Study Committee or&#xD;
      Molecular Tumor Board. If the patients received the matched therapy, they are designated as&#xD;
      in Arm A. Otherwise, if the patients received the unmatched therapy (i.e., treating&#xD;
      physician's choice of traditional systemic chemotherapy), they are designated as in Arm B.&#xD;
      The study feasibility will be measured by the ability to enroll patients, the acceptable&#xD;
      turnaround time and the actionable information obtained from the genomic profiling, and the&#xD;
      viability of identifying and delivering the matched therapy. The treatment efficacy will be&#xD;
      determined among the patients groups and treatment arms. The safety profile of the treatment&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;

             renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease or active, uncontrolled infection,&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are pregnant or breast-feeding patients or any patient with childbearing potential not&#xD;
             using adequate pregnancy prevention (site-specific criteria applying to Avera only).&#xD;
