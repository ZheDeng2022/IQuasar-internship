  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays feeding intolerance (FI) is a common condition among preterm infants. It has been&#xD;
      estimated that 16%-29% of premature infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)&#xD;
      develop feeding intolerance at some point during their length of stay. The most frequent&#xD;
      signs of FI are the presence of abdominal distension, abundant and/or bilious gastric&#xD;
      residuals and vomiting suggesting an inability of the infant to further tolerate enteral&#xD;
      nutrition, it increases with decreasing in gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW). FI&#xD;
      represents one of the most uncontrollable variables in the early nutritional management of&#xD;
      these infants, and may lead to suboptimal nutrition, delayed attainment of full enteral&#xD;
      feeding and prolonged parenteral nutrition supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS has been used in preterm infants to evaluate changes in cerebral perfusion and&#xD;
      oxygenation. It provides real time insight into the oxygen delivery, presented as regional&#xD;
      oxygen saturation rSO2 with lower values than SpO2 distal pulse-oximetry where is mostly&#xD;
      measured as arterialized capillary bed (around 55% vs 98% Oxygen saturation in regional NIRS&#xD;
      vs conventional pulse-oximetry). Light easily penetrates the thin tissues of the neonate&#xD;
      through bone and soft tissue, particularly the thin capillary bed of the tissues; NIRS&#xD;
      provides non-invasive, continuous information on tissue perfusion and oxygen dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique uses principles of optical spectrophotometry that make use of the fact that&#xD;
      biological material, including the skull, is relatively transparent in the NIR range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dave et al. evaluated the abdominal tissue oxygenation with NIRS, and showed that preterm&#xD;
      infants change their cerebral - splanchnic oxygenation ratios during feedings, mainly because&#xD;
      an increasing in the splanchnic oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gay et al. performed abdominal NIRS in premature piglets showing association of&#xD;
      perfusion/oxygen changes with NEC spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to evaluate the association between feeding intolerance and&#xD;
      unchanged splanchnic regional saturation and variation in the cerebral splanchnic ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FI diagnosis follows a subjective approach, where the clinician is worried in further risk of&#xD;
      develop Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This non-studied relationship (FI and NEC) lower the&#xD;
      threshold for the diagnosis of FI. Furthermore, infants with FI diagnosis commonly are&#xD;
      subject of stop or slow the progression of feedings, increasing the risk of intestinal villi&#xD;
      atrophy, and increase the length of parenteral nutrition support, and also the length of stay&#xD;
      in the NICU settings. If NIRS technology help the clinicians to detect true abnormalities&#xD;
      objectively as a new monitor assessing adequate feeds progress decreasing failure to feed,&#xD;
      and therefore diminishing the need for parenteral feeds and further complication associated&#xD;
      with it.&#xD;

      Approach Basic study design The study design is a matched-pair case-control cohort,&#xD;
      longitudinal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and assembly of patients Premature infants from 32 to 36 6/7 weeks of&#xD;
      postmenstrual age, with feeding tolerance at least of 50ml/kg/day, inpatients at the Brigham&#xD;
      and Women's NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Premature infants from 32 to 36 6/7 weeks of postmenstrual age, with feeding tolerance&#xD;
           at least of 50ml/kg/day which have been diagnosed with food intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group will be composed with patients from the same population age range&#xD;
           tolerating at least 50 ml/Kg/day (Half of the minimum full feeds daily requirement) of&#xD;
           Human milk of enteral Formula delivered in bolus, 6 to 8 times per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed consent from parent(s) or guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Premature infants with know conditions that could affect the attachment of the sensors&#xD;
           in the body areas as Gastroschisis, Omphalocele, Post surgical intestine resection, on&#xD;
           peritoneal dialysis, with lacerations in the abdomen and frontal area of the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants who have been diagnosed with Necrotizing enterocolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants with current diagnosis of Sepsis and/or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome&#xD;
           (SIRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants with severe Intra-Ventricular Hemorrhage (Intra-cranial Hemorrhage).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants with Hereditary Spherocytosis, total or partial (hypoplasia) congenital asplenia&#xD;
           hypoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposures and their measurement The investigators will use two NIRS devices, the INVOS™ 5100c&#xD;
      Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter is a 2 wavelength, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy system&#xD;
      employing near infrared light to estimate the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen&#xD;
      in tissue underneath the sensor. An adhesive sensor containing a light source and 2&#xD;
      photodiodes is applied to the skin over the tissue of interest and the returning light is&#xD;
      analyzed for oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin light absorption. Absorption signals from the&#xD;
      photodiode closer to the light source are subtracted from those from the farther photodiode&#xD;
      where the returning photons penetrate more deeply in the tissue. This suppresses absorption&#xD;
      events originating in the outer layers of tissue that are common to both photodiodes,&#xD;
      including the effects of skin pigmentation and subcutaneous tissues. This method of &quot;spatial&#xD;
      resolution&quot; also allows estimation of scattering to improve measurement accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-invasive device Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved (FDA 510k&#xD;
      #K082327), with an intended use for infants with a weight greater than 2.5 Kg. Given that the&#xD;
      target population of this study has weights under the description to use, and being used in&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen monitoring, in order to be approved by the Institutional Board Review (IRB)&#xD;
      committee. The investigators will catalogue it as non-significant risk device under the&#xD;
      Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), 21 CFR 812.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device has four channels where the light sensors will retrieve the lectures from the&#xD;
      splanchnic (left flank), mesenteric (infra-umbilical), muscular (either right or left thigh)&#xD;
      and cerebral (forehead) areas. The NIRS sensors Cerebral (IS-C) and Somatic (IS-S)&#xD;
      Infant/Neonatal Somatic OxyAlert® will be attached directly to the infant skin in order to&#xD;
      obtain the area lecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cases will be diagnosed as feeding intolerant for the attending physician staff and those&#xD;
      patients that have been at least with 50ml/Kg/day in their enteral feedings will be&#xD;
      approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the case is attached with the NIRS device, the selection of the matching control will&#xD;
      take place, a feeds tolerating infant (at least 50 mL/Kg/day) sharing gestational range age&#xD;
      and gender if possible. for The study coordinators will obtain the consent from the&#xD;
      parent(s); those families will have the opportunity to speak with the Physician investigator&#xD;
      (PI). All the staff members are certified in the CITI program (Collaborative IRB Training&#xD;
      Initiative) to ensure and discuss the protocol with the infant's parent(s) or guardian. After&#xD;
      the sensors have been attached the data will be recorded the display of the monitor will be&#xD;
      turned off, the data will be extracted and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confounders and their measurement The study design will allow to minimize the confounders&#xD;
      with restriction (inclusion and exclusion criteria), same at risk population, and matching&#xD;
      the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low perfusion status need to be assessed monitoring vital signs (HR,RR,BP) and pulse-oximetry&#xD;
      (SpO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and their measurement Clinical outcome data will be correlated with tissue oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (TOI) from the NIRS device, other outcomes variables include: length of NICU stay,&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality, feeding tolerance, advance in the feedings and abdominal sign of&#xD;
      intolerance, abdominal distension, gastric residues greater than 50% of the intermittent&#xD;
      bolus. Other variables will be recorded, infant perinatal history, level of oxygen&#xD;
      requirements, ventilatory support status, morbidities associated, laboratory studies, vital&#xD;
      signs and parenteral nutrition status. oxygen saturation by standard pulse oximetry, formula&#xD;
      and/or human milk feeding status, and follow them until their discharge from the Hospital,&#xD;
      looking for length of stay, development of Necrotizing enterocolitis, and/or&#xD;
      Broncho-pulmonary dysplasia. The data will be extracted from their clinical records (EPIC&#xD;
      System).&#xD;
