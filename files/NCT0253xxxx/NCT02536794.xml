      The main purpose of this study is to determine the anti-tumor activity of MEDI4736 in&#xD;
      combination with tremelimumab in patients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer. Both&#xD;
      MEDI4736 and tremelimumab are antibodies (proteins used by the immune system to fight&#xD;
      infections and cancers). MEDI4736 attaches to a protein in tumors called PD-L1. It may&#xD;
      prevent cancer growth by helping certain blood cells of the immune system get rid of the&#xD;
      tumor. Tremelimumab stimulates (wakes up) the immune system to attack the tumor by inhibiting&#xD;
      a protein molecule called CTLA-4 on immune cells. Combining the actions of these drugs may&#xD;
      result in better treatment options for patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate clinical benefit rate in patients with metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer&#xD;
      treated with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer treated with MEDI4736 in combination with&#xD;
      tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate if tissue-based immunohistochemical expression of programmed death-ligand&#xD;
      (PD-L)1; tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); peripheral T cell subpopulations; changes in&#xD;
      tissue and peripheral T cell receptor genotype; human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype; and&#xD;
      immune-related candidate gene signatures predict response to MEDI4736 in combination with&#xD;
      tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To demonstrate the pharmacodynamic effects of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab on tissue and&#xD;
      serum based biomarkers including PD-L1, TILs, T cell subpopulations, and T cell receptor&#xD;
      genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive MEDI4736 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Four weeks after the last combination dose, patients continue to&#xD;
      receive MEDI4736 every 2 weeks for up to 18 additional doses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve clinical benefit (complete&#xD;
      response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD]) until the end of the 52 week&#xD;
      period will then enter follow-up. During follow-up patients who develop PD may be re-treated&#xD;
      with MEDI4736 at the dose previously administered IV for an additional 52 weeks using the&#xD;
      same guidelines as with the initial 52 week period if they meet treatment in the setting of&#xD;
      PD criteria. Only one 52 week retreatment period will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

          <description>Patients receive anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 IV over 1 hour and tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Four weeks after the last combination dose, patients continue to receive anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 every 2 weeks for up to 18 additional doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving PD or clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD) may be retreated with anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 for an additional 52 weeks.&#xD;

Patients achieving PD or clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD) may be retreated with anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 for an additional 52 weeks.&#xD;

          <description>CBR is defined as the number of patients with complete response (CR) plus those with partial response (PR) plus those with stable disease (SD) for ≥ 12 weeks using Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 with the following definitions:&#xD;
Complete Response - Disappearance of all lesions Partial Response - At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters Stable Disease - Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study</description>
          <population>Per protocol patients were required to complete 2 months of study treatment to be evaluable for this endpoint, however all patients who had a response are reported here as the study did not meet its total sample size</population>
