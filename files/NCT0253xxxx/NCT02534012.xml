      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly patients are usually presented with higher risk for developing cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      complications after general anesthesia (GA). The risk of adverse events in elderly patients&#xD;
      increases with the combination of intraoperative fentanyl, opioid premedication and&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockers. Bilateral paravertebral block (PVB) has been associated with&#xD;
      favorable outcomes in patients undergoing ventral hernia repair. Hence, elderly patients may&#xD;
      benefit from PVB anesthetic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to compare PVB versus GA for elderly patients undergoing major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery. The primary outcome measure is admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).&#xD;
      The secondary objective is postoperative analgesic consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following approval from the Institutional Review Board, 60 patients aged 70 years or older&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo major abdominal surgery from May 2016 till December 2020 will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Consent will be obtained from the patients or their family member.&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two groups. Group I will receive PVB while group II will&#xD;
      receive GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic variables including age, gender, height, weight, and ASA physical status will be&#xD;
      collected for each patient. Intraoperative hemodynamic data such as mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) and heart rate (HR) are noted. Moreover, surgery duration, admission to ICU and&#xD;
      hospital stay are recorded. Morbidity and mortality rates will also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Anesthesia technique Anesthesia is induced with 1 µg/kg fentanyl, 1.5-2 mg/kg&#xD;
      propofol and 1-2 mg midazolam. Then, endotracheal intubation is facilitated by 0.15 mg&#xD;
      nimbex. Anesthesia is maintained by 1-1.5% sevoflurane, 0.5 µg/kg/h fentanyl, 0.05 mg/kg/h&#xD;
      nimbex, 60% nitrous oxide and 40% oxygen. Any hemodynamic change of 25% results in a gradual&#xD;
      increase or decrease of the sevoflurane concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral Block Technique Bilateral nerve stimulator-guided PVB is performed while&#xD;
      patients are in lateral decubitis position. The number and level of injections depend on the&#xD;
      type of surgery and length of incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appropriate levels for the PVBs are determined by palpation of the spinous processes. An&#xD;
      intervertebral line is drawn at the appropriate levels and the injection site is marked 2.5&#xD;
      cm lateral to the midline on both sides. After aseptic preparation of the skin, 0.3 mL 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine is infiltrated at the injection sites. A 22-G nerve stimulation needle (Stimuplex;&#xD;
      B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) is advanced 1-2 cm perpendicularly to the skin using a nerve&#xD;
      stimulating current of 2.5-5.0 mA, while closely watching for contractions of the abdominal&#xD;
      muscles. The tip of the needle is adjusted to continue to produce muscle contractions while&#xD;
      reducing the stimulating current to approximately 0.5-0.6 mA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on patient weight, 3-5 mL of the local anaesthetic mixture is injected at each&#xD;
      injection site. Each 20 mL of the local anaesthetic mixture contains: 8mL lidocaine 2%, 8 mL&#xD;
      lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 5µg mL-1, and 4 mL bupivacaine 0.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of PVB failure, patients will be converted to GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission to ICU and hospital stay Patients who are hemodynamically stable, conscious and do&#xD;
      not feel pain will be transferred from the PACU to the floor. On the other hand, patients&#xD;
      will be admitted to ICU if they are unconscious, intubated, and hemodynamically unstable.&#xD;
      Patients will be discharged from hospital when they are able to drink, eat and do not have&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity and complications Morbidity is defined as having chest infection, kidney failure,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, and dementia.&#xD;
