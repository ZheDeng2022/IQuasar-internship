  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who are exposed to traumatic events are at risk for developing PTSD and other mental&#xD;
      health problems. Although effective treatments for childhood PTSD exist, service delivery&#xD;
      approaches that are more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective are needed to improve&#xD;
      access to evidence-based treatment. The proposed study furthers our pilot work and evaluates&#xD;
      an innovative Stepped Care Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy designed to optimize&#xD;
      treatment in community settings and improve the value and efficiency of trauma-focused&#xD;
      treatment for children compared to existing approaches, thereby reducing childhood PTSD and&#xD;
      related societal impacts and costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 68-80% of youth will experience at least one potentially traumatic event during&#xD;
      their childhood with about one third experiencing more than one traumatic event. Exposure to&#xD;
      traumatic events markedly elevates the risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) and associated impairment. Despite advances in effective trauma-focused treatments for&#xD;
      children, the lack of efficient, accessible, personalized, and cost-effective trauma&#xD;
      treatment for children is a major public health concern. Thus, there is a critical need for&#xD;
      interventions to improve efficiency, access, and cost-effectiveness and to offer tailored&#xD;
      approaches that meet the unique needs of the child. The present study builds on the&#xD;
      investigators NIH-funded pilot work (1R34MH092373-01A1) that developed an innovative Stepped&#xD;
      Care Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (SC-TF-CBT). The purpose of the proposed&#xD;
      study is to examine how to optimize the efficiency (e.g., via matching children to&#xD;
      appropriate treatment dosage at baseline, utilizing second-stage tailoring variables, and&#xD;
      identifying mechanisms of change) and cost-effectiveness of Stepped Care TF-CBT. The&#xD;
      long-term goal is to develop an effective, efficient, accessible, and cost-effective adaptive&#xD;
      Stepped Care TF-CBT intervention that can be available to more trauma-exposed children, and&#xD;
      to advance knowledge about service delivery approaches that may be applicable to providing&#xD;
      treatment for other childhood mental health disorders. The goal of the study is consistent&#xD;
      with the strategic objective to &quot;Develop New and Better Interventions that Incorporate the&#xD;
      Diverse Needs and Circumstances of People with Mental Illness,&quot; and the research priorities&#xD;
      that call for trials that foster prescriptive, personalized mental health care, incorporate&#xD;
      tailoring variables to match patient interventions, improve access to services, decrease&#xD;
      costs of services, and incorporate measures of putative mechanisms of action in trials in&#xD;
      &quot;real world&quot; settings. In a randomized clinical trial with 216 children ages 4 to 12 years at&#xD;
      community-based agencies, the following aims are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine Stepped Care TF-CBT (e.g., starting with Step One parent-led,&#xD;
      therapist-assisted treatment and then either maintenance or Step Two TF-CBT) relative to&#xD;
      standard TF-CBT (e.g., therapist-led treatment);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine tailoring variables that could be used to individualize (i.e., tailor) the&#xD;
      decision of which children should be assigned at baseline to Stepped Care TF-CBT versus&#xD;
      standard TF-CBT;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine if changes in the potential mechanisms of change variables (e.g., fear&#xD;
      arousal, maladaptive cognitions, negative expectancy, and fear toleration) mediate treatment&#xD;
      on child PTSD symptoms (PTSS) and impairment;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To examine the economic cost of delivering Stepped Care TF-CBT versus standard TF-CBT.&#xD;
      Children with PTSD are at considerable risk for numerous biopsychosocial problems. Without&#xD;
      accessible, effective treatment, these problems tend to persist into adulthood. This study&#xD;
      will yield clinically important data which will improve the value and efficiency of treatment&#xD;
      of children with PTSD, thereby reducing childhood PTSD and related societal impacts and&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
