  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, recurrent, and frequent chronic disorder.&#xD;
      Treatment is often challenging; an estimated 20-40% of patients do not benefit sufficiently&#xD;
      from existing antidepressant interventions including trials of medication and psychotherapy.&#xD;
      A 15-25% of patients manifest a chronic, treatment-resistant course of illness, resulting in&#xD;
      a need for additional treatment options. Brain stimulation techniques are considered as a&#xD;
      promising therapeutic approach in affective disorders like MDD. Transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been largely&#xD;
      investigated in experimental neurosciences and tDCS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been&#xD;
      proposed as novel treatment in MDD. In the largest 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      in MDD to date, Brunoni et al. (2013) have shown that tDCS combined with an Selective&#xD;
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline) resulted in an antidepressant efficacy&#xD;
      superior to placebo treatment, tDCS alone and sertraline alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the sustained efficacy and tolerability of repeated&#xD;
      tDCS for the treatment of MDD. It is hypothesized that prefrontal tDCS in combination with an&#xD;
      SSRI will provoke an antidepressant effect while antidepressant medication alone (sham tDCS)&#xD;
      did not. This will be measured by the change from baseline in the Montgomery Åsberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores after 6 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial (5 centers involved) patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of MDD receive a 6-weeks treatment with prefrontal tDCS (anode over electrode&#xD;
      position F3, cathode over F4, 5 sessions/week for 4 weeks followed by 2 sessions/week for 2&#xD;
      weeks, 24 treatments in sum, 30min/day, 2mA intensity) or sham tDCS (frequency and duration&#xD;
      correspondent active tDCS, ramp in and ramp out periods only without intermittent&#xD;
      stimulation), as adjunctive treatment with a SSRI. Follow-up per patient is 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      after the last tDCS treatment session. Before, during and after the treatment period&#xD;
      different assessment scales will be conducted to record neuropsychological features and the&#xD;
      course of the individual symptomatology.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women 18-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary DSM-5 diagnosis of Major Depression as assessed by the Structured Clinical&#xD;
             Interview for DSM-5 Axis I Disorders, Research Version (SCID-5-RV) with a single or&#xD;
             recurrent episode with the additional requirements of a current episode with a&#xD;
             duration of ≥4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current depressive episode is less than 5 years duration (the definition of an episode&#xD;
             is demarcated by a period of ≥2 months in which the patient did not meet full criteria&#xD;
             for the DSM-5 definition of major depressive episode).&#xD;
