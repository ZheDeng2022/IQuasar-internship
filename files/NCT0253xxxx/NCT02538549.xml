      Behavioral activation (BA) is a low cost, evidence-based intervention that can be effective&#xD;
      in treating depression and anxiety. We have developed a behavioural activation card game for&#xD;
      clients receiving treatment through the Crisis Team and Traditional Case Management (TCM) in&#xD;
      Kingston, ON. The game is designed to integrate behavioural activation tools into daily life&#xD;
      while receiving points for completion of the each Activity Challenge, which are divided into&#xD;
      4 areas (ACE4), with the goal to receive maximum amount of points in the timeframe of the&#xD;
      study. Using a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) design, participants (n=40) will be assigned to&#xD;
      one of two groups, with the intervention group receiving ACE4 and treatment as usual (TAU)&#xD;
      and the control group only receiving TAU. Assessments will be carried out upon entry to the&#xD;
      study and at the end of the intervention period (8 weeks). Assessments will be completed&#xD;
      using the WHODAS 2.0 (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule), HADS (The&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and CORE (Clinical Outcome in Routine Evaluation). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the treatment group receiving the ACE4 intervention will show improvement in&#xD;
      overall mental state. Analyses will be conducted using SPSSv16, an analysis of covariance and&#xD;
      t-test, and a binary logistic regression analysis will be used to investigate factors that&#xD;
      predict good outcomes. Results will be published in international journals and presented at&#xD;
      conferences with an aim towards being applied to clinics in Pakistan.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral activation (BA) is an evidence based intervention that has been found to be&#xD;
      effective in treating depression (ref). It has the advantage of being low cost and can be&#xD;
      used by people with low literacy. BA can be easily delivered in low and middle income&#xD;
      countries like Pakistan, if appropriately adapted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a single player card game that is based on principles of behavioral&#xD;
      activation. The game was used with crisis and transitional case management clients, with&#xD;
      positive feedback. This is a pilot study using a RCT design to test the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To assess effectiveness of ACE4, for depression against care as usual. Study design&#xD;
      and duration This study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) which aims to assess&#xD;
      effectiveness of ACE4 against care as usual for depression. Study participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to two groups the intervention group will receive ACE4 and TAU, while the&#xD;
      control group will receive only TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACE4: Introduction Intervention focuses on behavioral activation. Although ACE4 is a single&#xD;
      player game, it can be facilitated by a carer. The game comes with 15 cards in four colour,&#xD;
      with each colour representative of an activity area (for example, Creative activities,&#xD;
      recreational, self care and work, social and spiritual activities). The idea is to choose&#xD;
      equal number of activities from each colour. Every card has a number. Patients have to write&#xD;
      this number on activity calendar that comes with this game, along with the time activity was&#xD;
      performed. The aim of the game is to score maximum points at the end of the 6 weeks. Those&#xD;
      with scores in high range get ACE4 badge (in addition to getting an improvement in their&#xD;
      mood)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria All those who fulfill the diagnostic criteria of Depressive&#xD;
      episode (F32) or Recurrent depressive disorder (F33 except 33.4 ) using ICD10 RDC (based on&#xD;
      interviews using SCAN Urdu version), are between the ages of 18 to 65, score 8 or more on&#xD;
      HADS, Depression Subscale, will be approached. Patients will be asked to attend a further&#xD;
      appointment at the end of study period and will be assessed again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria include; excessive use of alcohol or drugs (using ICD 10 RDC for&#xD;
      alcohol or drug abuse or dependence) significant cognitive impairment (for example learning&#xD;
      disability or dementia) and active psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Patients who have been referred for the study will be provided brief information&#xD;
      about the study. Those who meet the criteria and consent will be then asked to join the study&#xD;
      and will be allocated to one arm of the trial after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size This is a feasibility study. We will take 40 patients, with 20 in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be performed distantly by a statistician, from the list of&#xD;
      all the patients who have been accepted for each group. After randomization patients will be&#xD;
      allocated to either treatment or the control arm. Randomization will be performed for each&#xD;
      group separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSTRUMENTS The assessments will be carried out at the base line and then at the end of&#xD;
      therapy (8 weeks). Control group will receive care as usual.A number equal to intervention&#xD;
      group will be employed in this group. Blind raters will be used to assess the change in&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) is a 14 item, self&#xD;
      assessment scale designed to measure anxiety and depression. It has a high internal&#xD;
      consistency, face validity and concurrent validity. Even-numbered questions relate to&#xD;
      depression and odd-numbered questions relate to anxiety. Each question has 4 possible&#xD;
      responses. Responses are scored on a scale from 3 to 0. The maximum score is therefore 21 for&#xD;
      depression and 21 for anxiety. A score of 11 or higher indicates the probable presence of the&#xD;
      mood disorder with a score of 8 to 10 being just suggestive of the presence of the respective&#xD;
      state. The two subscales, anxiety and depression, have been found to be independent measures.&#xD;
      In its current form the HADS is now divided into four ranges: normal (0-7), mild (8-10),&#xD;
      moderate (11-15) and severe (16-21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Outcome in Routine Evaluatoin (CORE) is is a client self-report questionnaire&#xD;
      designed to be administered before and after therapy. The client is asked to respond to 34&#xD;
      questions about how they have been feeling over the last week, using a 5-point scale ranging&#xD;
      from 'not at all' to 'most or all of the time'. The 34 items of the measure cover four&#xD;
      dimensions: Subjective well-being, Problems/symptoms, Life functioning and Risk/harm. The&#xD;
      responses are designed to be averaged by the practitioner to produce a mean score to indicate&#xD;
      the level of current psychological global distress (from 'healthy' to 'severe'). The&#xD;
      questionnaire is repeated after the last session of treatment; comparison of the pre-and&#xD;
      post-therapy scores offers a measure of 'outcome' (i.e. whether or not the client's level of&#xD;
      distress has changed, and by how much) (Evans, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Disability Questionnaire (BDQ) was developed by the WHO to measure disability due to&#xD;
      physical and psychological problems and has been used extensively in research (Von Korff et&#xD;
      al., 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data form will be used to collect information from the client.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites Crisis and the TCM services in Kingston, ON, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry and analysis Statistical analyses would be carried out using an intention to&#xD;
      treat. Analyses will be carried out using SPSS v16 . Both parametric and non parametric tests&#xD;
      will be carried out as appropriate to compare groups. An analysis of covariance will be used&#xD;
      to measure the differences between the two groups at three time points, where the data is&#xD;
      normally distributed. A t test will be used to compare groups, both paired and un-paired.&#xD;
      SPSS frequency and descriptive commands will be used to measure descriptive statistics. SPSS&#xD;
      explore command will be used to measure normality of the data, using histograms and&#xD;
      Kolmorogov Smirnov test. If the therapy is proved to be more effective than the control, we&#xD;
      will also use a binary logistic regression analysis to explore factors which predict good&#xD;
      outcome. An intention to treat analysis will be performed. Number Needed to Treat (NNT) will&#xD;
      be calculated to assist clinicians with clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in clinically naturalistic settings It is recognized that such research is most&#xD;
      likely to provide results that are relevant to routine clinical practice; the current study&#xD;
      provides a more rigorous evaluation for an intervention that can be provided in current&#xD;
      service in Pakistan and at no extra costs.&#xD;
