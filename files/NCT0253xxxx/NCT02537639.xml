      The investigators would like to evaluate how well intensive care trainees without previous&#xD;
      experience in transesophageal echocardiography are able to perform a transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography study in the clinical setting after completing a simulator based training&#xD;
      compared to conventional training.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography is currently the sole imaging modality at the bedside that provides&#xD;
      real-time information on cardiac anatomy and function. Echocardiography is increasingly used&#xD;
      in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting for the focussed hemodynamic assessment of patients&#xD;
      with cardiorespiratory compromise. The principal role for focussed echocardiography is the&#xD;
      time-sensitive assessment of the symptomatic patient. This evaluation primarily includes the&#xD;
      assessment for pericardial effusion, the evaluation of relative chamber size, global cardiac&#xD;
      and valvular function and patient volume status. The clinical impact of echocardiography for&#xD;
      the treatment of critically ill patients with hemodynamic compromise is well documented and&#xD;
      increasing general consensus exists, that all physicians in charge of critically ill patients&#xD;
      should be trained in focussed echocardiography. Accordingly there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      specific training in echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is besides transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) the&#xD;
      main imaging modality in the ICU setting. TTE image quality is often compromised by lung&#xD;
      inflation in ventilated patients or by the presence of dressings or drains in locations used&#xD;
      for image acquisition. It thus seems reasonable to suggest that every critical care physician&#xD;
      should be able to perform a focused TOE. However, a multitude of barriers continue to limit&#xD;
      TOE training including time constraints in busy ICUs, limited number of appropriate cases and&#xD;
      a lack of experienced teaching faculty. Proficiency in TOE image acquisition requires&#xD;
      in-depth knowledge of three-dimensional cardiac anatomy and repetitive supervised hands-on&#xD;
      experience to develop the necessary manual skills. Typically TOE skill acquisition occurs in&#xD;
      real time in the ICU while caring for a patient, thus the time that can be devoted to&#xD;
      training is limited. However, using a semi-invasive imaging modality in ICU patients for&#xD;
      training solely for training purposes is problematic due to the associated (minimal) risks&#xD;
      and patient discomfort. Recently commercially available TOE simulation systems have been&#xD;
      introduced. These systems allow for patient-independent training of TOE skills using&#xD;
      simulations of the human heart. When used as an educational adjunct standardized TOE&#xD;
      simulation training in a virtual reality environment may lead to a more rapid development of&#xD;
      psychomotor skills. TOE simulators also offer the possibility to simulate pathological&#xD;
      conditions of the heart and thus may facilitate training in image interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a simulator based TOE training&#xD;
      curriculum to train all necessary components of focused critical care echocardiography in&#xD;
      accordance with the basic perioperative transesophageal examination as defined by the&#xD;
      American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists.&#xD;
      This includes the psychomotor skills necessary for obtaining echocardiographic images of&#xD;
      sufficient quality according to established quality scoring systems and the ability of&#xD;
      recognizing the relevant anatomic structures as well as image interpretation when evaluating&#xD;
      a hemodynamically compromised patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of a simulator in the training for transesophageal echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a prospective, observational trial investigating the impact of&#xD;
      simulator TOE training in novice operators on quality of imaging, correct image&#xD;
      interpretation and resource use when performing a focussed TOE examination in ICU patients.&#xD;
      Forty-fife ICU trainees without previous hands-on echocardiography skills will undergo a&#xD;
      formal training consisting of 4 hours of theoretical instructions including basics of&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac anatomy, standard views as well as physiology and&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Instructions will be provided by expert TOE operators. 30 of these trainees&#xD;
      will additionally be trained using the HeartWorks TOE simulator. This training consists of 4&#xD;
      sessions of supervised practice using the TOE simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After conclusion of the training program the trainees will perform one basic perioperative&#xD;
      echocardiography study using the HeartWorks TOE simulator and two basic perioperative&#xD;
      echocardiography studies in real ICU patients.&#xD;
