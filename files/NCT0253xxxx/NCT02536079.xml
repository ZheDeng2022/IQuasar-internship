    <textblock>
      The NeST registry is a pro-active industry-academic collaboration to assess the use and&#xD;
      safety of NeuroAiD in the real world setting. An online entry system was set up to allow easy&#xD;
      data entry and retrieval of clinical information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NeST Registry is designed as a product registry that would provide information on the use&#xD;
      and safety of NeuroAiD in clinical practice. An online NeST Registry was set up to allow easy&#xD;
      entry and retrieval of essential information including demographics, medical conditions,&#xD;
      clinical assessments of neurological, functional, and cognitive state, compliance,&#xD;
      concomitant medications and side effects if any, among patients on NeuroAiD. Participation is&#xD;
      voluntary. Data collected are similar to information obtained during standard care and are&#xD;
      prospectively entered by the participating physicians at baseline (before initialization of&#xD;
      NeuroAiD) and during subsequent visits. The follow up visits are timed with clinical&#xD;
      appointments. Anonymized data will be extracted and collectively analyzed. Initial target&#xD;
      sample size for the registry is 2000.&#xD;

        The NeST Registry is a product-specific and safety outcome registry that includes patients&#xD;
        who are taking NeuroAiD. Participation is entirely voluntary and an agreement will be&#xD;
        obtained before inclusion. The decision on the use of NeuroAiD should be made following a&#xD;
        discussion between participant and physician and only then will the option of participation&#xD;
        in the registry be considered.&#xD;
