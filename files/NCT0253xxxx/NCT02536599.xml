      The aim of the study is to identify clinical and laboratory parameters, present at the time&#xD;
      of initial evaluation that could help predict which children with cancer, fever, and&#xD;
      neutropenia will be at risk for developing clinically documented infections and/ or&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been recognized that not all neutropenic patients have the same risk of&#xD;
      developing serious infections and/or complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fever and infection represent the most important complications of myeloablative cytotoxic&#xD;
      therapy that results in severe mucositis and prolonged neutropenia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important concepts in the approach to infections in the febrile neutropenic&#xD;
      patient is the recognition of risk. Risk can be defined in two ways. First, risk may be&#xD;
      defined in terms of the probability for developing a febrile neutropenic infection; and&#xD;
      second, it may be defined in terms of the likelihood for significantly poor outcomes due to&#xD;
      that infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An understanding of the risks in the latter case may be used to define the approaches to&#xD;
      management; for instance, in-patient versus out-patient treatment strategies and&#xD;
      administration of intravenous versus oral formulations of antimicrobial therapy. These&#xD;
      considerations have significant economic and quality of life ramifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many institutions have developed simple clinical criteria to identify low-risk patients&#xD;
      without having to calculate a risk-index score. This might be a more practical method in busy&#xD;
      clinical settings, or as a tool in setting of low resource country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include children, either referred from the pediatric oncology clinic, or who&#xD;
      have been previously admitted to the pediatric oncology department, those who have been&#xD;
      documented with episodes of fever and neutropenia at South Egypt Cancer Institute (SECI), and&#xD;
      fulfilling all criteria for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients at the time of initial evaluation will be subjected to complete clinical&#xD;
      history and full clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled patients will be followed for either developing clinically evident infection&#xD;
      e.g., pneumonia, gastroenteritis, meningitis, septicemia, etc.), or until resolution of fever&#xD;
      and/ or neutropenia. The risk for either developing clinically evident infection, or not,&#xD;
      will be assessed according to clinical and laboratory parameters, present at the time of&#xD;
      initial evaluation to identify those patients who would be more prone to develop infection&#xD;
      and/ or complications Fever is defined as a temperature greater than or equal to 38.3 C&#xD;
      occurring once or a temperature greater than or equal to 38 C occurring twice during a&#xD;
      24-hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an absolute neutrophilic count (ANC) of less than 500/mm3 and those with an ANC&#xD;
      of less than 1,000/mm3 and decreasing will be considered neutropenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete blood count &amp; other diagnostic studies, including laboratory studies and imaging&#xD;
      procedures will be obtained if needed to further evaluate and determine the source of fever&#xD;
      and/or infection.&#xD;
