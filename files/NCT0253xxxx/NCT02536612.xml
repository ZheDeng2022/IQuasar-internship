      The purpose of the study is to test feasibility and acceptability of a lottery to help women&#xD;
      in Cape Town, South Africa to continue using long-acting reversible contraceptives to avoid&#xD;
      unintended pregnancies, and to also use condoms to reduce sexually transmitted infections&#xD;
      including HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to implement a pilot project offering conditional economic&#xD;
      incentives (CEI) for dual protection (the prevention of HIV or other sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections and pregnancy via the simultaneous use of condoms plus effective contraception)&#xD;
      among young women in Cape Town, South Africa, to test feasibility and acceptability, and to&#xD;
      gather preliminary evidence on effect sizes to inform a future efficacy trial. CEI are an&#xD;
      innovative structural approach for dual protection, which so far has not been tested in&#xD;
      generalized HIV epidemic settings. The project has three aims. First, it will test the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a conditional economic incentive (CEI) program to&#xD;
      incentivize dual protection among young women in Cape Town. The working hypothesis is that a&#xD;
      program with modest economic incentives in the form of a lottery to continue using modern&#xD;
      contraception and stay free of sexually transmitted infections (STI) can be implemented among&#xD;
      young women who express a desire to avoid unintended pregnancies. The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      CEI treatment group will exhibit greater program participation and retention rates as&#xD;
      compared to the control group. Second, the study will obtain estimates of the effect of CEI&#xD;
      on the primary outcomes (adherence to the dual protection regimen) through: (1) continuation&#xD;
      of a contraceptive method of choice throughout the six month study period, and (2)&#xD;
      self-reported condom use. Contraceptive continuation will be measured via clinic records&#xD;
      (proxy for clinical checkup) at the 3 and 6 month follow up visits. Self-reported condom use&#xD;
      will not be used to provide any incentives. The hypothesis is that receipt of CEI (lotteries)&#xD;
      will be associated with higher rates of dual protection. Third, the study will examine the&#xD;
      degree to which CEI (lotteries) impact secondary outcomes: a urine pregnancy test and STI&#xD;
      status (measured at baseline and 6 month follow up). A selected STI (syphilis) will be&#xD;
      monitored for assessment of the STI outcome, using a rapid test that can be administered at&#xD;
      clinic level. The working hypothesis is that the participants in the CEI (lottery) treatment&#xD;
      group will have reduced rates of STI and they will have lower rates of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial will include young women, ages 18-40, recruited from a community clinic in&#xD;
      Cape Town. A maximum of 96 women will be randomly assigned to one of two arms (n=48 each) in&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial design. In the trial, Arm 1 (control) will receive transport&#xD;
      compensation for study visits at each of the study visits at baseline and at months 3 and 6.&#xD;
      Arm 2 (intervention) will receive transport compensation for study visits at each visit at&#xD;
      baseline and at months 3 and 6, plus the opportunity for entry in a lottery. Participants in&#xD;
      Arm 2 will have a chance to receive two lottery tickets: (a) the first when returning by&#xD;
      month 3, subject to confirmation of continued use of the participant's preferred&#xD;
      contraceptive; (b) the second upon completion of the six month study period, subject to&#xD;
      confirmation of continued use of the participant's preferred contraceptive over the course of&#xD;
      the 6 month study period; and if they are free of a new curable STI. The lottery tickets will&#xD;
      enter the participant into a drawing for a prize at month 3 and at the end of the six month&#xD;
      study period. All participants will receive transport compensation each time at baseline,&#xD;
      month 3 and month 6. There will be 15-20 minute follow-up sessions for everyone at months 3&#xD;
      and 6 when receiving STI results, and CEI (lotteries) for those in the treatment group. At&#xD;
      month 3, follow-up sessions will include some reinforcement of key messages related to dual&#xD;
      protection. At months 3 and 6, the follow-up sessions will include administration of the&#xD;
      study questionnaire.&#xD;
