    <textblock>
      Intratumoral plasmid IL-12 electroporation (IT-pIL12-EP) will be administered to&#xD;
      approximately 10 patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with cutaneous or&#xD;
      subcutaneous disease. Patients will receive one complete cycle of therapy, consisting of&#xD;
      local injection of plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12) followed immediately by electroporation (EP), into&#xD;
      accessible tumor lesions. IT-pIL12-EP will be administered in Days 1, 5, and 8 of the single&#xD;
      28-day cycle.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of intratumoral injection of&#xD;
      pIL-12 followed immediately by electroporation (IT-pIL12-EP). A minimum of ten patients with&#xD;
      biopsy-accessible triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be treated in this study.&#xD;
      Additional patients, up to a maximum of 25 patients, may be enrolled based upon&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic observations and at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, in&#xD;
      consultation with the Sponsor. All patients will receive a single 28-day treatment cycle. One&#xD;
      lesion will remain untreated (the control lesion). Treatment will be administered on Days&#xD;
      1,5, and 8 of the single 28-day cycle. Treatments will consist of direct injection of pIL-12&#xD;
      into tumor lesions, followed immediately by electroporation of the lesions. At the end of the&#xD;
      treatment cycle, patients will return to clinic for a final safety evaluation and tumor&#xD;
      biopsy. This end of study (EOS) visit will occur prior to initiating any new anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapy/regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo tumor biopsies at two separate timepoints for molecular and&#xD;
      histological analyses associated with the primary endpoint. At least one lesion will be&#xD;
      biopsied at Screening (pre-treatment sample). Biopsies of the untreated control lesion and at&#xD;
      least one treated lesion will be obtained at the EOS visit (post-treatment samples).&#xD;
      Additional tumor biopsy samples may be requested if there is either tumor regression or&#xD;
      progression prior to EOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of participation will be approximately 4 weeks for each patient. A patient is&#xD;
      considered to have completed the study if all three IT-pIL12-EP treatments (Days 1, 5, &amp; 8)&#xD;
      and all required pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies have been obtained and EOS safety&#xD;
      follow-up evaluations have been performed.&#xD;
