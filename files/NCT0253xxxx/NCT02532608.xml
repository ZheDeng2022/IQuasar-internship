      In this study the investigators plan to systematically characterise infra-slow EEG&#xD;
      oscillations during sleep, explore their relationship to the microstructure of sleep, and&#xD;
      investigate its role in the physiology and pathophysiology of sleep by co-registration of&#xD;
      Full band EEG with polysomnography during wake and sleep in healthy subjects, after sleep&#xD;
      deprivation, and in patients with restless legs syndrome/periodic leg movements during sleep&#xD;
      (RLS/PLMS).&#xD;

      Sleep is a highly dynamic process and during large parts of sleep the level of arousal&#xD;
      fluctuates on a multi-second time scale between the sleep stage specific background and&#xD;
      transient, phasic events that clearly arise from this background and constitute the&#xD;
      microstructure of sleep. This microstructure is part of the dynamic physiological sleep&#xD;
      regulation and at the same time reflects the instability of sleep, is critically involved in&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of sleep and a determinant of the recuperative value of sleep and daytime&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intriguingly, these sleep microstructural fluctuations are in a multi-second range that&#xD;
      corresponds closely to the so-called infra-slow oscillations that are ubiquitous in the&#xD;
      central nervous system. Infra-slow oscillations (0.01 - 0.1 Hz) have been observed in both&#xD;
      humans and animals across brain structures and spatial scales in the dynamics of single unit&#xD;
      firing rates, direct electrical potential fluctuations and oscillation amplitude modulations.&#xD;
      The possibility to record these infra-slow oscillations on the level of the surface EEG with&#xD;
      direct current (DC) or Full band (Fb) EEG offers a new approach to study the microstructure&#xD;
      of sleep and characterise the full range of sleep-related EEG oscillations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to record and systematically characterise infra-slow oscillations during wake and all&#xD;
           stages of sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to explore the relationship between sleep infra-slow oscillations and microstructural&#xD;
           events of sleep, in particular the cyclic alternating pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to explore the effect of acute sleep deprivation on sleep infra-slow EEG activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to investigate infra-slow sleep EEG activity in patients with RLS/PLMS, common sleep&#xD;
           disorders with prominent periodic arousals, heart rate activations, and leg movements&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to explore the relationship between infra-slow EEG oscillations and periodic events in&#xD;
           movement and autonomic system activity in patients with RLS/PLMS.&#xD;
