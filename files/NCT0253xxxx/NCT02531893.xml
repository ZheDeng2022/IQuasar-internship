      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When children have severe irritability and temper outbursts, they can be so cranky or angry&#xD;
      that it leads to problems at home, in school, and with friends. This is called Disruptive&#xD;
      Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) and there have been no psychological treatments developed&#xD;
      specifically for children with this problem. Researchers think two forms of therapy,&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpretation Bias Training (IBT), might help&#xD;
      children with DMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test two whether IBT and CBT can decrease severe irritability in children and youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children 8-17 years old with DMDD. Their symptoms must have started before age 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their symptoms. Parents and participants will&#xD;
      answer questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can do only one or both of these treatments if they wish. Those who wish to do&#xD;
      both will start with IBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do CBT will have 12-16 weekly meetings of research talk therapy. A parent&#xD;
      will participate in part of the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will talk about what makes them irritable and how it affects them. They may be&#xD;
      put in situations that might make them annoyed or irritable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will rate how intense their irritability is. Parents and participants will&#xD;
      complete rating scales, questionnaires, and interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will do practice activities at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants doing IBT will have up to 14 sessions over 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will view 15 faces, one at a time, on a computer. They will choose if the face&#xD;
      looks happy or angry on a computer. Sometimes the computer gives feedback. Participants will&#xD;
      complete some sessions at the NIH and some at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and parents answer questions about their progress.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This purpose of this protocol is to further the development of two potential&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic treatments for youths with chronic, severe and impairing irritability. The&#xD;
      first potential treatment is Interpretation Bias Training (IBT), a computer-based training&#xD;
      designed to shift emotional judgments of ambiguous faces away from angry, and toward happy,&#xD;
      judgments. The first component of this protocol includes a randomized, controlled trial of&#xD;
      active IBT in youth with severe irritability. The second potential treatment is a cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting severe irritability. The goal of this protocol is to&#xD;
      conduct a preliminary study using a randomized within-subjects multiple-baseline design to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of a new manualized exposure-based CBT with parenting training in the&#xD;
      treatment of severe irritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Assess the efficacy of Interpretation Bias Training (IBT) in youths with severe&#xD;
      irritability, operationalized as those meeting criteria for DSM-5 Disruptive Mood&#xD;
      Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). To accomplish this objective, we will conduct a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) of active IBT in 40 youths with DMDD. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive four IBT training sessions (active vs. placebo, in a double-blind design) over four&#xD;
      days followed by weekly mood ratings for two weeks. Primary outcome measures in this trial&#xD;
      will assess changes in irritability using the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI:&#xD;
      clinician-rated, parent-rated, and child-rated) and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement&#xD;
      (CGI-I). After completing the RCT, all participants will be offered four open, active IBT&#xD;
      sessions, delivered on the same schedule as in the RCT and using the same primary outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Test the efficacy of a new manualized CBT for severe, impairing irritability in&#xD;
      youth. To accomplish this objective, we will utilize a within-subjects multiple baseline&#xD;
      design (Onghena &amp; Edgington, 2005; Gliner, Morgan, Harmon, &amp; Harmon, 2000; Morgan &amp; Morgan,&#xD;
      2001). The children will be randomized to their start times. Clinical ratings, as well as&#xD;
      parent- and child- report ratings will be obtained every two weeks (plus or minus seven days)&#xD;
      during both the baseline and active periods. This is not an RCT. All children will receive&#xD;
      active CBT following variable (randomized) start times. Consistent with the manual we will&#xD;
      continue to meet with children and their parents utilizing newly manualized exposure-based&#xD;
      CBT procedures, such as eliciting hierarchies of irritability inducing events, exposure&#xD;
      exercises (e.g., in-vivo, role-play, imaginal) and parent training. We will conduct the CBT&#xD;
      on N=40 youth with severe, impairing irritability. Primary outcome measures for CBT will&#xD;
      assess changes in irritability using the ARI (clinician-rated, parent-rated, and child-rated)&#xD;
      and CGI-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 1a and 1b: Assess the effect of IBT on clinical measures of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, and functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 2: Assess the effect of the CBT for irritability on clinical measures of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects can participate in one or both of these potential treatments. If they opt to do&#xD;
      both, there will be a four-week wash-out period between treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is taking place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All outpatients, ages&#xD;
      8-17, enrolled in NIMH-DIRP Protocol 02-M-0021, who are in stable treatment in the community&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the protocol will involve conducting a randomized controlled trial of IBT&#xD;
      in 40 youths who meet criteria for DMDD. The goal of this novel, potential treatment is to&#xD;
      decrease the severity of the child s irritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the protocol will involve conducting a randomized within-subjects&#xD;
      multiple-baseline trial of CBT targeting severe irritability including N=40 youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects can elect to participate in the IBT randomized controlled trial only, CBT treatment&#xD;
      or both. If subjects elect to participate in both IBT and CBT, there will be a one-month&#xD;
      wash-out period in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measures will assess changes in irritability using the ARI (clinician-rated,&#xD;
      parent-rated, and child-rated, original and revised versions for IBT and CBT, respectively)&#xD;
      and CGI-I. Secondary measures include parent and self-report measures of irritability,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, anger, social status, and aggression, as well as clinician ratings of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and impairment. Data for ecological momentary assessments (EMA) will be&#xD;
      collected using secure technology, with procedures approved by the NIMH ISSO; subjects and&#xD;
      their caregivers will be asked a set of questions relating to recent experiences and emotions&#xD;

             assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria both Interpretation Bias Training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
        Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The individual exhibits any of these cardinal bipolar symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Elevated or expansive mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Grandiosity or inflated self-esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Decreased need for sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Increase in goal-directed activity (this can result in the excessive involvement&#xD;
                  in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. A history of hypomanic or manic symptoms that occurred in distinct episodes&#xD;
                  lasting more than 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meets DSM 5 criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective&#xD;
             illness, Autism Spectrum Disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. IQ&lt;70&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The symptoms are due to the direct physiologic effects of a drug of abuse, or to a&#xD;
             general medical or neurological condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Meets criteria for alcohol or substance abuse three months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Meets DSM 5 criteria for current major depressive disorder. The rationale for the&#xD;
             exclusion of youth with MDD is because the two novel interventions being tested are&#xD;
             contraindicated for those with major depressive disorder. However, there is no&#xD;
             contraindication to participation for those with treated/resolved or remitted major&#xD;
             depressive disorder; only those with a current diagnosis need to be excluded.&#xD;
