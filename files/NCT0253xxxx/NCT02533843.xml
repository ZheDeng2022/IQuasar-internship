      Specific Aim: This prospective randomized study aims to compare the impact of three different&#xD;
      catheter ablation approaches on long-term procedure outcome in terms of arrhythmia recurrence&#xD;
      in persistent (PeAF) and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (LSPAF) patients. The&#xD;
      three strategies to be evaluated are 1) ablation at sources guided by FIRMap (using&#xD;
      RhythmView™ Workstation from TOPERA), 2) ablation at sources guided by FIRMap + conventional&#xD;
      pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) and 3) Extended PVAI plus ablation of non-PV triggers&#xD;
      and complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE).&#xD;

      Specific Aim: This prospective randomized study aims to compare the impact of three different&#xD;
      catheter ablation approaches on long-term procedure outcome in terms of arrhythmia recurrence&#xD;
      in persistent (PeAF) and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (LSPAF) patients. The&#xD;
      three strategies to be evaluated are 1) ablation at sources guided by FIRMap (using&#xD;
      RhythmView™ Workstation from TOPERA), 2) ablation at sources guided by FIRMap + conventional&#xD;
      pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) and 3) Extended PVAI plus ablation of non-PV triggers&#xD;
      and complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Extended PVAI plus ablation of non-PV triggers and CFAE results in better&#xD;
      long-term procedure outcome in PeAF and LSPAF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The limited success rate of conventional ablation approaches in LSPAF has led to&#xD;
      the search for the ideal ablation strategy (1). The main problem in the settings of PeAF and&#xD;
      LSPAF is the lack of information on the best targets to ablate to achieve freedom from&#xD;
      arrhythmia (2). Some strategies aim at elimination of AF triggers; some solely target CFAE&#xD;
      for atrial substrate modification whereas others elect for isolation of PVs plus posterior&#xD;
      wall along with ablation of non-PV triggers demonstrated by high-dose isoproterenol challenge&#xD;
      with or without CFAEs. (2). The last option has been shown to be the best option so far in&#xD;
      improving the freedom from AF at long-term follow-up (2, 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently Narayan et al, by using a computational mapping system that identifies 'rotors'&#xD;
      (organized reentrant circuits or focal impulses), were able to achieve a success rate of&#xD;
      82.4% following ablation of rotors plus PVAI, at a median follow-up of 273 days, in a&#xD;
      primarily paroxysmal AF population (4). The results of this study are promising and need to&#xD;
      be tested in patients with PeAF and LSPAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the long-term efficacy and safety of different ablation approaches in&#xD;
      PeAF and LSPAF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This prospective study will enroll 120 consecutive PeAF/LSPAF patients and&#xD;
      consenting patients will be randomized to any of the 3 groups (40 per group); Group 1:&#xD;
      ablation at sources guided by FIRMap (using RhythmView™ Workstation from TOPERA) Group 2:&#xD;
      ablation at sources guided by FIRMap + conventional pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI)&#xD;
      Group 3: Extended PVAI plus ablation of non-PV triggers and complex fractionated atrial&#xD;
      electrograms (CFAE) Patients will be randomized to different treatment groups after the risks&#xD;
      and benefits of each one are discussed in detail with them.&#xD;
