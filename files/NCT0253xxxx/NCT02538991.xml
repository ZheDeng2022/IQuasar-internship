      One out of three adult females suffer from daily urinary incontinence. Two thirds of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence is physical activity-related stress urinary incontinence (SUI). If the&#xD;
      first-line treatment for SUI, training of pelvic floor muscles, is insufficient, treatment&#xD;
      options are suburethral sling operation or transurethral bulking injection. Randomized&#xD;
      studies between TVT and Bulkamid® and the knowledge about cost-effectiveness and patient&#xD;

&#xD;
      This prospective randomized study compares TVT and Bulkamid®-injections in treatment of SUI.&#xD;
      Main outcome measures are patient satisfaction, complications and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      treatment in reducing urinary leakage. Secondary outcome measures are cost-effectiveness,&#xD;
      pain during and after treatment and changes in Quality of Life and symptoms.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           One out of three adult females suffer from daily urinary incontinence. Two thirds of&#xD;
           urinary incontinence is physical activity-related stress urinary incontinence (SUI). If&#xD;
           the first-line treatment for SUI, training of pelvic floor muscles, is insufficient,&#xD;
           treatment options are suburethral sling operation or transurethral bulking injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tension-free Vaginal Tape (TVT) is considered the gold standard for the treatment of&#xD;
           SUI1. TVT operation is an effective treatment with efficacy as high as 90%. TVT&#xD;
           performed by an experienced operator carries a very low risk of serious complications.&#xD;
           Following complications rates have been reported after TVT: bladder perforation 3,8%,&#xD;
           urinary tract infection 4,1%, complications requiring laparotomy 3,4%, complete&#xD;
           postoperative urinary retention 2,3% and minor voiding difficulties 7,6%. All these&#xD;
           complications or side effects occur in up to 20 - 30% of the patients. Long-term effects&#xD;
           of TVT are still unclear and complications such as vaginal erosion or urinary tract&#xD;
           protrusion of the tape are concerning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bulking agents create an artificial mass into the urethral submucosa and according to&#xD;
           hypothesis improve urethral coaptation and restore continence especially when abdominal&#xD;
           pressure is increased. It has also been suggested that midurethral injection therapy may&#xD;
           increase the central filler volume and consequently increase the power of the urethral&#xD;
           sphincter. Several different agents have been used for periurethral and transurethral&#xD;
           injections, e.g. collagen, ethylene vinyl alcohol, hyaluronic acid and polyacrylamide&#xD;
           hydrogel (PAHG). However, some of these agents have been abandoned due to safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Nordic countries Polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAHG) is nowadays used for urethral&#xD;
           injections. PAHG is biocompatible, non-biodegradable, non-allergenic, non-migrational,&#xD;
           atoxic, stable, and sterile. Urethral bulking therapy is minimally invasive in nature&#xD;
           and treatment doesn't require hospitalization. Procedure can be performed under local&#xD;
           anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The efficacy of PAHG-injections in treating stress urinary incontinence has varied from&#xD;
           64% to 74% depending on the treated patient group. Urethral injections have a lower risk&#xD;
           of complications than TVT-operation and PAHG has shown a very low risk of serious&#xD;
           adverse events. Bulking therapy has no negative effect in terms of possible subsequent&#xD;
           midurethral sling operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cochrane review on urethral injection therapies concluded that injection therapies are&#xD;
           inferior to surgery at 1-year follow-up but have a better safety profile. However, the&#xD;
           objective outcome and effect of the treatment are not necessarily equal to patient&#xD;
           satisfaction and improvement in quality of life (QOL). A study by Corcos et al.&#xD;
           comparing surgery and collagen injections for treatment of SUI showed significantly&#xD;
           better outcome in 24-hour pad test for women treated with surgery compared to those&#xD;
           treated with collagen injections but no difference in patient satisfaction and QOL at 12&#xD;
           months between the two groups. Number and severity of complications were much greater in&#xD;
           the surgery group. A questionnaire study assessing treatment acceptability and treatment&#xD;
           expectations in women with lower urinary tract symptoms, showed that patients have a&#xD;
           general preference for less invasive therapy even with the cost of lower success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis and aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomized studies comparing urethral injection treatment and TVT are missing. There was&#xD;
           no significant difference in patient satisfaction after urethral injections with&#xD;
           collagen and surgery. Surgical group in this study consisted of treatment with sling&#xD;
           operation, Burch procedure or needle bladder neck suspensions. While there are no&#xD;
           comparative studies between TVT and Bulkamid®, the knowledge about cost-effectiveness&#xD;
           and patient satisfaction is missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This prospective randomized study compares TVT and Bulkamid®-injections in treatment of&#xD;
           SUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects included in this study are women suffering from such a stress urinary incontinence&#xD;
      that a non-conservative treatment is planned. They have to be willing to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are given oral and written information on the study and randomized into two groups&#xD;
      undergoing either TVT-Exact® or Bulkamid®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Flow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Randomization before treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment (Bulkamid or TVT exact)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phone call contact after 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Second Bulkamid-treatment if necessary within 3 months after first treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 3 months follow-up visit and decisions about secondary treatment if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. (Secondary) TVT treatment at least 3 months after follow-up visit (or Bulkamid treatment&#xD;
           following primary TVT-treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. One-year follow-up visit and decisions about further treatments if necessary&#xD;
           (re-Bulkamid/TVT?)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Questionnaires 2,3 and 4-years after treatment, mail contact&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. 3-year follow-up visit offered&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. 5-year follow-up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations before treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-3 day micturition diary and standardised questionnaire forms assessing symptom&#xD;
           distress (UDI-6, IIQ-7) and the impact of urinary incontinence on quality of life and&#xD;
           sexual function (RAND-36, PISQ-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's estimation of the distress caused by SUI (VAS scale 0= no distress to 10= very&#xD;
           much distress)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion of urinary tract infection (sample 2-3 weeks before treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination: cough stress test and PVR measurement by ultrasound, exclusion of&#xD;
           pelvic organ prolapse and large uterine myomas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urodynamics, if needed to confirm diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A stress pad test described by Svenningsen et al.20 (Pad weighing after 20 jumping jacks&#xD;
           on the spot and three forceful coughs in the standing position with 300 ml bladder&#xD;
           volume. To women unable to perform the test it was modified version to 10 coughs in the&#xD;
           standing position).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations after the treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-void residual urine volume (if &lt;150ml patient will be discharged)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain in VAS scale (0=no pain to 10= worst possible pain the patient can imagine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Question of: would the patient recommend the treatment to a good friend?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Was the pain during treatment: as the patient expected, less, worse?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations on follow-up visits (3 months, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gynecological examination (with ultrasound)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cough stress test with 200 to 250 filling in the bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress PAD test described earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PVR measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion of urinary tract treatment to patients with failed response or symptoms of&#xD;
           infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires (RAND-36, UDI 6, IIQ-7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain in VAS scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction to treatment in VAS scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Question of: would the patient recommend the treatment to a good friend?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The length of sick-leave after the operation, possible other visit to other health care&#xD;
           providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of the efficacy of the treatment against stress urinary incontinence in&#xD;
           categories: fully recovered, partly recovered, no change, worse symptoms, cannot answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon, who performed the procedure, will not perform follow-up visits.Questionnaires&#xD;
      (RAND 36, UDI-6, IIQ-7, PISQ-12) will be collected from the patients two to four years after&#xD;
      treatment via mail. Also above mentioned analysis of the efficacy of the treatment and&#xD;
      further questions on possible incontinence are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of possible adverse events (complications) of the treatment will be performed&#xD;
      during the operation and after it during the whole follow-up time. The adverse effects will&#xD;
      be categorized as related to the treatment, possibly related to the treatment and not related&#xD;
      to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TVT treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      TVT will be performed under local anesthesia (70 - 100 ml 0.25% prilocain cum epinephrine)&#xD;
      with i.v. pain medication phentanyl two doses and more on request. Operation will be&#xD;
      performed with TVT-Exact® kit. Operation can be performed policlinically or in an operation&#xD;
      theatre depending on the patient's medical condition. Cystoscopy will be performed after the&#xD;
      set of tapes. A cough stress test with 250 to 300 ml bladder fulfillment will show the right&#xD;
      tension of the tape. Before the operation a prophylactic antibiotic of Cefuroxime 1.5 g i.v&#xD;
      will be given (Dalacin 900 mg i.v in cases of allergy to penicillin). The patient can go home&#xD;
      after 2 to 4 hours follow-up, when PVR is under 150 ml. A sick leave of 5 days is&#xD;
      recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All used medications, the duration of treatment, follow-up time and the time when patients&#xD;
      leave the hospital are written down as well as the onset of urination. Pain is asked in VAS&#xD;
      scale 0 to 10 (maximal and total VAS) and the patient's are asked to describe, whether the&#xD;
      pain during treatment was as expected/less/more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bulkamid®- injections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urethral injections will be performed policlinically under local anesthesia (10 ml lidocain,&#xD;
      two injections on both sides of the urethra). The Bulkamid-injections will be transurethral&#xD;
      four injections (0.2 - 1ml) in locations &quot;ten, two and five and seven o'clock&quot; within 0.5 to&#xD;
      1 cm from the bladder - urethra junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional injections will be avoided and can be injected only if the first injections fail.&#xD;
      After the operation the patient urinates to empty the bladder. The PVR is checked after the&#xD;
      treatment with ultrasound simultaneously with evaluation of stability of the&#xD;
      Bulkamid-injections. The treatment will be photographed as before and after still pictures&#xD;
      for later evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All used medications, the duration of treatment, follow-up time and the time when patients&#xD;
      leave the hospital are written down as well as the onset of urination. Pain is asked in VAS&#xD;
      scale 0 to 10 (maximal and total VAS) and the patient's are asked to describe, whether the&#xD;
      pain during treatment was as expected/less/more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the given treatment fails to treat stress urinary incontinence or stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence returns after a while, a TVT- or Bulkamid®-operation can be (re-)performed after&#xD;
      the follow-up visit. The primary treatment after one Bulkamid®-injection is a secondary&#xD;
      injection after follow-up visit. Bulkamid® injections do not interfere subsequent TVT&#xD;
      operation and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-injections of Bulkamid will be done in basis of &quot;filling up the gaps&quot; after primary&#xD;
      treatment. In other words they are done according to the situation seen during second&#xD;
      treatment. The treatments are photographed before and after (still pictures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a non-inferiority trial based on patient satisfaction rates.&#xD;
      The patient satisfaction rate of VAS scale ≥80 was assumed in 80% and 75% of the TVT- and&#xD;
      Bulkamid-patients. If there is a true difference in favour of the standard treatment of 5%,&#xD;
      then 192 patients (96 per group) are required to be 80% sure that the upper limit of a&#xD;
      one-sided 95% confidence interval will exclude a difference in favour of the standard group&#xD;
      of more than 20%. A 10% dropout rate was assumed and 212 women were planned to randomize&#xD;
      (1:1) in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization numbers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization numbers will be generated before the onset of the study and sealed in&#xD;
      opaque envelopes. Randomization will performed using a computer-assisted random block system&#xD;
      (R Development Core Team, 2006, Greg Snow, 2006) with permuted randomization for random block&#xD;
      clinical trials. Random blocks of 4 to 6 women were used. Altogether 250 random numbers will&#xD;
      be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment of the patients will be done within the end of year 2017. Primary follow-up&#xD;
      and reporting of first outcomes will happen within 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical reason&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness or complications of operations for stress urinary incontinence have been&#xD;
      shown, but a randomized comparison of TVT and urethral injection is missing. Therefore this&#xD;
      study is needed. This study will also provide information about the cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction of these treatments. This is a comparison between a more effective TVT&#xD;
      operation that has a higher risk for complications and a probably less effective, but safer&#xD;
      Bulkamid®- injections. TVT operation can be performed after Bulkamid® treatment and Bulkamid®&#xD;
      injections do not interfere the subsequent TVT treatment.&#xD;
