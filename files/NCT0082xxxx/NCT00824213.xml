      The investigators propose to investigate the performance of the image reconstruction software&#xD;
      with resolution recovery correction for bone SPECT studies. The investigators estimate that&#xD;
      in only 30 minutes, using this new technique of collimator de-blurring, one could perform a&#xD;
      fully 3-dimensional SPECT whole-body bone study, essentially obviating the necessity for&#xD;
      doing planar bone studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the scope of the proposed project, the investigators group aims to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that one can perform a Tc-99m whole-body SPECT study in the same time as a regular routine&#xD;
      planar bone study, with greater localization accuracy, and greater lesion detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a &quot;gold standard&quot; necessary to assess the performance of the SPECT bone scans,&#xD;
      the investigators will compare number of malignant lesions detected in patients who are&#xD;
      proven to have metastatic skeletal bone lesions on PET F-18 whole-body scans, with whole-body&#xD;
      Tc-99m SPECT lesions. The investigators also propose to compare the detection of SPECT scans&#xD;
      with standard planar bone scans. This will allow for two major comparisons (a) the accuracy&#xD;
      of SPECT bone studies compared to planar bone studies, and (b) the accuracy of SPECT bone&#xD;
      scans compared to F-18 PET studies. Most prior studies purporting to show the superiority of&#xD;
      F-18 bone scans to Tc-99 bone scans were done only against either planar scans or a&#xD;
      combination of planar scans and partial SPECT studies over the spine. We anticipate that F-18&#xD;
      bone scans, due to the higher counting statistics of PET agents, will show more lesions than&#xD;
      SPECT, but the exact increase in sensitivity has never been compared to whole-body SPECT&#xD;
      scans.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone scintigraphy (e.g. &quot;bone scan&quot;) with Tc-99m diphosphonates is one of the most common&#xD;
      imaging radioisotope procedures in departments of nuclear medicine worldwide, with several&#xD;
      thousand performed every year in a busy nuclear medicine service. Despite giving fast and&#xD;
      accurate skeletal surveys in conditions ranging from metastatic cancer, to fractures, to&#xD;
      infection, the technology has seen little change since the early 1970's. The Anger camera&#xD;
      remains the instrument of choice for taking serial images of a patient's skeleton, and since&#xD;
      the late 1970's SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) - essentially &quot;nuclear CT&#xD;
      imaging of 3-D distribution of radiotracer&quot; has been added to improve contrast resolution and&#xD;
      lesion placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the known greater sensitivity of SPECT compared to planar bone nuclear medicine&#xD;
      studies, SPECT is usually done only in limited patients due to time constraints. This is&#xD;
      because a standard tomographic bone acquisition requires about 20 minutes, therefore it&#xD;
      usually can only be performed over one body region such as the abdomen or chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal PET scanning with F-18 Fluoride has become popular since the introduction of&#xD;
      multiple PET scanners for imaging cancer with F-18 FDG. It provides much higher count rates&#xD;
      than traditional bone scans done with Tc-99m phosphates, and many authors have shown that it&#xD;
      is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting skeletal lesions. Indeed, several PET&#xD;
      centers have proposed replacing the standard Tc-99m bone scan with F-18 PET scans. However&#xD;
      the short half-life of F-18 makes this type of study practical only for PET centers within a&#xD;
      short distance from a cyclotron. Furthermore, most PET scanners are usually fully occupied&#xD;
      doing other types of diagnostic oncology studies, and the cost of the F-18 is currently not&#xD;
      reimbursed for simple skeletal surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently it has become feasible to dramatically shorten the time necessary for acquisition of&#xD;
      a nuclear medicine SPECT study. This has occurred with the introduction of new image&#xD;
      reconstruction software which includes resolution recovery correction (so called &quot;collimator&#xD;
      de-blurring&quot;). Since this approach results in significant improvement of image resolution,&#xD;
      many centers are currently looking at the feasibility of using this new technique to reduce&#xD;
      imaging times. For example, its use has been investigated for nuclear cardiac scans with&#xD;
      acquisition times shortened by half.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to investigate the performance of the image reconstruction software with&#xD;
      resolution recovery correction for bone SPECT studies. We estimate that in only 30 minutes,&#xD;
      using this new technique of collimator de-blurring, one could perform a fully 3-dimensional&#xD;
      SPECT whole-body bone study, essentially obviating the necessity for doing planar bone&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the scope of the proposed project, our group aims to test the hypothesis that one can&#xD;
      perform a Tc-99m whole-body SPECT study in the same time as a regular routine planar bone&#xD;
      study, with greater localization accuracy, and greater lesion detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a &quot;gold standard&quot; necessary to assess the performance of the SPECT bone scans,&#xD;
      we will compare number of malignant lesions detected in patients who are proven to have&#xD;
      metastatic skeletal bone lesions on PET F-18 whole-body scans, with whole-body Tc-99m SPECT&#xD;
      lesions. We also propose to compare the detection of SPECT scans with standard planar bone&#xD;
      scans. This will allow for two major comparisons (a) the accuracy of SPECT bone studies&#xD;
      compared to planar bone studies, and (b) the accuracy of SPECT bone scans compared to F-18&#xD;
      PET studies. Most prior studies purporting to show the superiority of F-18 bone scans to&#xD;
      Tc-99 bone scans were done only against either planar scans or a combination of planar scans&#xD;
      and partial SPECT studies over the spine. We anticipate that F-18 bone scans, due to the&#xD;
      higher counting statistics of PET agents, will show more lesions than SPECT, but the exact&#xD;
      increase in sensitivity has never been compared to whole-body SPECT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the feasibility of implementing whole-body SPECT in routine practice with&#xD;
           standard SPECT gamma cameras&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the value of whole-body SPECT compared to whole-body planar studies for the&#xD;
           detection of bone metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the results of state-of-the art whole-body SPECT skeleton surveys with&#xD;
           state-of-the art whole-body Na18F PET whole-body bone surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Obtain preliminary data on the respective accuracy of planar bone scintigraphy,&#xD;
           whole-body SPECT and Na18F PET/CT to plan future studies on the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
           these methods to improve prostate cancer staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A whole-body bone SPECT is more sensitive and specific than a conventional planar bone&#xD;
           scan for the detection of bone metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whole-body bone SPECT is less sensitive than a whole-body bone PET but the lower&#xD;
           sensitivity has minimal impact on the overall detection of bone metastases on a patient&#xD;
           basis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open phase II study designed to accumulate preliminary data on the relative&#xD;
      diagnostic value of planar bone scintigraphy, whole-body bone SPECT and whole-body bone PET&#xD;
      with sodium 18F-Fluoride. We plan to accrue a total of 25 subjects with suspected bone&#xD;
      metastases who will undergo planar bone scintigraphy, bone SPECT and a Na18F whole-body bone&#xD;
      PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients studies will be analyzed by 3 independent nuclear medicine readers, with number&#xD;
      of lesions identified on planar scans being compared to number of lesions on non-Astonish&#xD;
      SPECT bone scans and Astonish SPECT bone scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study will be scored by noting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number and localization of lesions detected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  level of certainty (1 = definitely malignant, 5= definitely benign)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  general visual quality of images (graded from 1 = poor to 5 = excellent)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Na18F PET/CT bone study will serve as the reference gold-standard study against which the&#xD;
      other acquisitions will be judged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical consideration&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study which will provide preliminary data for further power calculations to&#xD;
      estimate the study size needed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement of&#xD;
      whole-body SPECT compared to planar scintigraphy. With 25 subjects, we will have 82% of&#xD;
      chance to demonstrate a statistically significant 30% difference in accuracy between planar&#xD;
      scintigraphy and whole-body SPECT compared to the reference standard (PET/CT).&#xD;
