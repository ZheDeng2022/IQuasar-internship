      The specific aims of the patient intervention are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. increase patient knowledge about pacemakers (PM) and implantable&#xD;
           cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. help patients to identify if their PM or ICD has been interrogated&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. improve patient's physician-patient communication skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. teach patients how to identify if their device has been recalled&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. train patients what to do in case of a device recall&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational interventions proposed, if proven to be effective by this pilot, will provide&#xD;
      a low-cost, reproducible intervention to improve the clinical care and safe management of&#xD;
      pacemakers (PM) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) in patients. The goal of&#xD;
      the intervention will be to promote the safe use of implantable pulse generators.&#xD;

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete 3 sets of questionnaires (at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study, at 2-months and at 4-months) which will be sent to you and returned&#xD;
      by you through the mail. This will not require you to travel to M.D. Anderson. In addition to&#xD;
      the questionnaires, you will also complete 2 follow-up phone interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first set of questionnaires will be mailed to your home. The questionnaires will ask&#xD;
      questions about your anxiety level and how much you know about pacemakers or implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter-defibrillators. There will also be questions about your gender, age, ethnicity,&#xD;
      and race. The questionnaires will take about 25 minutes to complete. When you are finished,&#xD;
      you will mail the questionnaires to the study staff. An envelope with pre-paid postage will&#xD;
      be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Packet:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed the questionnaires, you will receive an educational packet in the&#xD;
      mail. The packet will have a DVD or a video (depending on whether you tell us you have a DVD&#xD;
      player or a VHS player) with information on medical devices, device recall information (when&#xD;
      and why certain devices have been recalled in the past), a list of on-line resources and&#xD;
      benefits of routine follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will call your home 1 week after you receive the educational packet for a&#xD;
      follow-up interview. A member of the study staff will review the packet with you. The phone&#xD;
      call will last about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 2 months and at 4 months after you complete the first set of questionnaires, an&#xD;
      additional set of questionnaires will be mailed to you. You will be asked to complete the&#xD;
      same questionnaires as you did in the first set. At 4 months an additional questionnaire&#xD;
      about the information in the educational packet and how useful it was to you will be&#xD;
      included. The questionnaires will take about 25 minutes to complete. When you are finished,&#xD;
      you will mail the questionnaires to the study staff. An envelope with pre-paid postage will&#xD;
      be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You participation on this study is complete once you have completed the additional&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 104 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
