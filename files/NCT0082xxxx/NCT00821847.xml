  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent progress in antiretroviral therapy has turned HIV infection into a chronic disease.&#xD;
      Patients survival has dramatically improved but complications may occur that need to be&#xD;
      prevented and monitored. As much as 10 % of HIV patients may suffer from chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, an affection that is not symptomatic until a very late stage secondary to HIV&#xD;
      infection, drugs exposure, hypertension or diabetes. Guidelines have suggested that renal&#xD;
      function should be regularly assessed in HIV patients to perform early diagnosis for chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease and allow initiation of preventive measures aimed at preserving renal&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma creatinine dosage is the easiest way to evaluate renal function but glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate estimation from cockcroft or MDRD formulae is a much better indicator of&#xD;
      renal function. Other markers like cystatin C may be used. None of these markers has been&#xD;
      validated in HIV patients. Therefore our study is aimed at comparing validity of creatinine&#xD;
      clearance estimation with Cockcroft and Gault and MDRD formula and cystatin C compared to the&#xD;
      gold standard measurement of glomerular renal function.&#xD;

      Aim of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to test the different available markers for the estimation of&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in HIV patients in order to determine which one is the more&#xD;
      appropriated in this particular population. We will analyze the role of the variation in&#xD;
      muscular mass in the estimation of GFR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several lines of evidence point to renal disease becoming an important complication of human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus infection and therapy. The spectrum of renal disease in the HIV&#xD;
      patient has dramatically changed with HIV associated nephropathy becoming less prevalent and&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease [CKD] becoming an everyday concern parallel to the prevalence of renal&#xD;
      risk factors such as aging, hypertension and diabetes. Different studies have shown that the&#xD;
      prevalence of CKD defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml/min/1.73m2&#xD;
      is around 10% in HIV patients. CKD is associated with increased mortality, a new concept that&#xD;
      has emerged in the past years putting CKD in the top 5 critical cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
      Evaluating individual renal function in HIV patients allows better care in prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events as well as initiation of nephro-protection strategies in order to slow&#xD;
      down the loss of renal function and alleviate or postpone the need for dialysis. Since HIV&#xD;
      patients also receive chronic multi-therapy, evaluating renal function is also mandatory to&#xD;
      allow drug dosage adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma creatinine dosage is routinely used to estimate GFR but it is closely correlated to&#xD;
      age, sex, weight and ethnic origin of the patients. All these factors make creatinine&#xD;
      unreliable for GFR estimation. Laboratory dosage of creatinine may be performed with&#xD;
      different techniques (JAFFE or enzymatic dosage) with a 20% variation in the results for the&#xD;
      same patient. None of the GFR estimation formulae (Cockcroft et Gault or MDRD) have been&#xD;
      validated in HIV patients. Cystatin C, a new marker still under evaluation, seems to show&#xD;
      some interest in such patients because of its relative independency with regard to muscle&#xD;
      mass, but has not been tested in HIV patients. Some cystatin C based formulae have been&#xD;
      proposed but not yet tested and validated in HIV patients. HIV infected patients may exhibit&#xD;
      abnormal body composition particularly affecting lipids but also, as shown recently, muscle&#xD;
      mass. Our study will precisely measure body composition in order to allow interpretation of&#xD;
      the variations of the renal markers with regard to muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS :&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients (men, caucasians) with an estimated GFR between 60 and 15 ml/min/1.73m2 will be&#xD;
      included in the study. After giving all necessary information and collection of informed&#xD;
      consent, blood will be drown to allow creatinine, cystatin C, albumin, C reactive protein and&#xD;
      urea dosages. GFR will be measured using plasmatic clearance of EDTA-51Cr. Body composition&#xD;
      will be performed using DEXA scan. Two visits will be necessary to complete the evaluation&#xD;
      for every patient, scheduled at the same time than the routine medical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study should allow better definition of the ideal marker for GFR in HIV infected male. Il&#xD;
      will also afford better comprehension of the factors involved in the variation of creatinine&#xD;
      dosage in this population namely those related to the biochemical dosage and to the change in&#xD;
      body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion :&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infection and its treatment is definitely a serious risk factor for renal disease.&#xD;
      Although, optimal care for HIV-infected patients becomes more and more complex due to&#xD;
      multiple comorbidities, efforts must be made to diagnose a decline in glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate in order to provide improved control of CKD-associated cardiovascular risk and optimized&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy. Therefore evaluating glomerular filtration rate is critical in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients to allow determination of the optimum follow up strategy and the&#xD;
      critical therapeutic measures, namely drug dosage adaptation.&#xD;
