  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous leg ulcers are a common, costly and debilitating condition, with few effective&#xD;
      treatments. Compression bandaging helps healing, but more than four out of every ten leg&#xD;
      ulcers remain unhealed after three months. New treatments to help heal venous ulcers are&#xD;
      urgently needed. Initial studies with a new drug product candidate called Nexagon® (developed&#xD;
      by CoDa Therapeutics, Inc.) have shown improvements in healing when applied topically to a&#xD;
      wound. Further research will be undertaken to assess the safety and activity of Nexagon® when&#xD;
      applied to venous leg ulcers in humans, and to obtain further information on the most&#xD;
      appropriate dose or doses to apply. A proposed randomised controlled trial aims to further&#xD;
      evaluate Nexagon® by randomly allocating (e.g., by the toss of a coin) 90 people with venous&#xD;
      leg ulcers to Nexagon® (one of two different doses) or a vehicle (substance containing no&#xD;
      medication) to be applied to their ulcer three times over four weeks. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed up for 12 weeks to evaluate ulcer healing.&#xD;
