      Because local anesthetic infiltration has not been comparated to continuous infusion after&#xD;
      spine fusion surgery, the investigators designed this study to determine whether this&#xD;
      technique could enhance analgesia and improve patient outcome after posterior lumbar&#xD;
      arthrodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Main Objective of the study is to compare the evolution of the postoperative levels of&#xD;
      pain until J2, in the scheduled lumbar surgery between 2 groups of patients, one receiving an&#xD;
      infiltration &quot;single shot&quot; of local analgesic (Ropivacaïne), one receiving a single shot&#xD;
      infiltration and a continuous infiltration of Ropivacaine during 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups the wound was infiltrated with a solution of ropivacaine 0.5% 200 mg/40 mL,&#xD;
      and in one group an infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% 5 mL/h was maintained for 48 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are the consumption of morphine,the rate of the nausea and the&#xD;
      postoperative vomits, the delay up to the first rise, the quality of the sleep, the duration&#xD;
      of hospital stay and the persistence of residual pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain after posterior lumbar stabilization surgery is related to soft tissue and&#xD;
      muscle dissection and to manipulations and removal at the operation site. Most patients&#xD;
      complain of severe pain at rest during the first 24 h after surgery. This pain increases&#xD;
      considerably with mobilization because of the reflex spasm of paraspinal muscles that is&#xD;
      triggered by the primary wound pain. During the following 48-72 h, postoperative back pain is&#xD;
      generally moderate at rest, whereas it remains severe on movement and produces discomfort&#xD;
      that can interfere with patient mobilization and, possibly, with discharge time. Despite the&#xD;
      favourable effects of analgesia in the early postoperative period, this drug association may&#xD;
      produce a number of well-known side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory&#xD;
      depression, sedation, renal abnormality, and upper gastrointestinal and operative site&#xD;
      bleeding. Local anesthetic infiltration of the surgical wound is a useful method in the&#xD;
      treatment of postoperative pain after various surgical procedures. Ropivacaine is an&#xD;
      interesting molecule for infiltration because of its vasoconstrictive properties and&#xD;
      decreased neuro- and cardiotoxicity compared with bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Main Objective of the study is to compare the evolution of the postoperative levels of&#xD;
      pain until J2, in the scheduled lumbar surgery between 2 groups of patients, one receiving an&#xD;
      infiltration &quot;single shot&quot; of local analgesic (Ropivacaïne), one receiving a single shot&#xD;
      infiltration and a continuous infiltration of Ropivacaine during 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After we obtained approval from the ethics committee and informed, written consent from&#xD;
      patients, patients older than 18 years old , heavier than 50 kg, without psychological&#xD;
      disorders, benefiting from of arthrodesis scheduled by a rachis lumbar posterior way were&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized to one of the two following postoperative analgesia groups after a&#xD;
      presealed envelope was opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative pain management is standardised with paracetamol, profenid and ACP morphine&#xD;
      for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups the wound was infiltrated with a solution of ropivacaine 0.5% 200 mg/40 mL,&#xD;
      and in one group an infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% 5 mL/h was maintained for 48 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Main Objective of the study is to compare the pain between 2 groups by means of the EVA&#xD;
      (score of 0 for absence of pain in 10 for conceivable maximal pain) measured at H2, H8, H16,&#xD;
      H24, H48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The consumption of morphine 24 H and 48 H after surgery - The rate of the nausea and the&#xD;
           postoperative vomits defined as the number of patients presenting the symptom on the&#xD;
           number of patients in the group. - Delay up to the first rise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delay will be estimated in hours enter the end of the intervention surgery and the first&#xD;
           one night&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality of the sleep estimated every morning with an analogical visual scale from 0&#xD;
           (very bad quality of sleep) to 10 (excellent quality of sleep)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of stay: calculated in days as the delay between the end of the&#xD;
           intervention and the capacity at the exit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recall of the patients in 3 and 6 months after the surgery to estimate the persistence&#xD;
           of residual pains and if they still consume opioid. We shall ask to the patient to&#xD;
           clarify the presence or the absence of pain The amount of analgesics required and the&#xD;
           local and systemic adverse events were recorded for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge was decided by the surgeons according to the following discharge criteria:1)&#xD;
      satisfactory pain control for self-mobility; 2) uncomplicated wound-healing process 3) no&#xD;
      impairments in haemoglobin 4) normothermie 5) normal transit, no nausea and vomit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample-size calculation was based on an expected difference of 20 mm in VAS measurements for&#xD;
      pain between groups. We calculate we need 64 patients for our main outcome. Each patient will&#xD;
      be monitored during 6 month after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of the study is 2 years.&#xD;
