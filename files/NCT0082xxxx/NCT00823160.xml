      Penetrating wounds to the heart may present to the emergency unit with the presence of blood&#xD;
      in the pericardial sac as determined on ultrasound. If these patients are stable, the study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that they can be managed with a very simple surgical procedure called a&#xD;
      subxyphoid pericardial window (SXW), in which the blood is drained from around the heart via&#xD;
      a small skin incision below the rib cage. In all other centres in the world these cases are&#xD;
      managed by open chest surgery called a sternotomy. The investigator's experience in dealing&#xD;
      with these injuries is that this is unnecessary and requires a large amount of resources for&#xD;
      no benefit to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients are randomized to receive either open chest surgery (sternotomy) or&#xD;
      the much smaller operation of the SXW. The patients are then followed up with respect to&#xD;
      their hospital stay and any complications that they develop. Normally, a patient undergoing&#xD;
      open chest surgery will stay in intensive care unit for a minimum of 2 days and have a total&#xD;
      hospital stay of at least 7 days and be at risk of a number of complications such as&#xD;
      pneumonia. Patients undergoing a SXW usually remain in hospital for a period of 3 days and do&#xD;
      not require intensive care management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's hypothesis is that in all these patients the heart injury has sealed and&#xD;
      the patient is no longer in any danger. It is not necessary to perform open chest surgery on&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first prospective, randomized clinical study ever performed on penetrating&#xD;
      cardiac injuries in the world literature. A group of patients with penetrating chest injuries&#xD;
      will present haemodynamically stable, with blood in the pericardial sac diagnosed on&#xD;
      ultrasound. The accepted international management of what is termed; &quot;the stable&#xD;
      haemopericardium&quot; has been a median sternotomy. In our experience in Cape Town, when a median&#xD;
      sternotomy is performed in these cases, any cardiac injury if present has already sealed or&#xD;
      there is no cardiac injury. We feel that these patients should be managed with a much smaller&#xD;
      and simpler operation that does not require admission to the intensive care unit&#xD;
      post-operatively and this is merely drainage of the blood from around the pericardial sac via&#xD;
      a subxyphoid window (SXW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method A SXW is performed under general anaesthetic and involves a 5 cm incision below the&#xD;
      sternum. The pericardial sac can be opened and the blood drained. This small operation also&#xD;
      allows the heart to be examined for any active bleeding. If there is active bleeding then&#xD;
      obviously, a median sternotomy is required to fix the hole in the heart. If there is no&#xD;
      active bleeding then the patient is randomized to either median sternotomy (the international&#xD;
      norm) or the pericardial sac is merely drained with a soft drain and no further surgery is&#xD;
      performed. The randomization is computer generated. The patients are documented with respect&#xD;
      to intensive care stay and total hospital stay. Any complications are noted and the patients&#xD;
      are then followed up in order to ensure that the patients who underwent the SXW alone are&#xD;
      alive and well. This is essential to ensure the safety of this much smaller procedure for&#xD;
      this condition. Informed consent is signed for each patient and all patients must be older&#xD;
      than 18 years of age.&#xD;
