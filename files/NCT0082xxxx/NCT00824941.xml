  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 15 to 20 percent of individuals living in the United States have chronic abdominal&#xD;
      pain, often of unknown origin, which is often difficult to diagnose and treat. One possible&#xD;
      cause of chronic abdominal pain is an inflammation of the intestines, but it is not known&#xD;
      whether the two are related. Furthermore, although overweight people tend to be more likely&#xD;
      to have increased inflammation, it is not known whether there is a connection between&#xD;
      increased body weight and chronic abdominal pain. This study will examine the relationship&#xD;
      between symptoms of chronic abdominal pain and intestinal inflammation by comparing the&#xD;
      medical test results of normal weight and overweight patients who have a history of chronic&#xD;
      abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 224 subjects, who must be men and women between the ages of 13 and&#xD;
      45. Half the subjects will be healthy participants, and half will have had chronic abdominal&#xD;
      pain of unknown origin for longer than 6 months. Female participants must take a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test before starting the study, and will not be allowed to participate if the test&#xD;
      is positive. During the study, patients will visit the NIH Clinical Center on two occasions&#xD;
      for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first visit, patients will provide a medical history, including information about&#xD;
      current medications or natural remedies and tobacco and alcohol use, and will also fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires to provide information about symptoms, current levels of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      pain, and general quality of life. The study researchers will conduct a physical examination,&#xD;
      measure patients height and weight, and draw blood for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the second visit, and&#xD;
      will be asked to bring a bathing suit and a swim cap to the Clinical Center. On the day of&#xD;
      the visit, patients will fill out questionnaires to provide information about symptoms,&#xD;
      current levels of gastrointestinal pain, and general quality of life. Patients will also&#xD;
      provide a blood sample for testing. Researchers will measure patients blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate, height, weight, waist/hip circumference, and intra-abdominal measurement.&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked to put on the bathing suit and swim cap to have their body fat&#xD;
      measured using a machine called the BOD POD. To test the gastrointestinal system, patients&#xD;
      will then be asked to drink a sugar-based test solution, and researchers will collect all&#xD;
      voided urine for the next 5 to 6 hours. (Patients may drink water during this time.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On either Day 1 or Day 2 of the study, patients will sip, swish and spit an additional sweet&#xD;
      taste solution. Patients will sip, swish, and spit different concentrations of this sweet&#xD;
      taste solution, for a total of 25 tastings of this solution. Subjects will then complete&#xD;
      questionnaires about their sweetness preferences related to these 25 tastings.&#xD;

      The objective of this natural history study is to assess the specific gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      symptoms and pathophysiology of chronic abdominal pain of unknown origin at the molecular&#xD;
      level. This research will test the hypothesis that chronic abdominal pain of unknown etiology&#xD;
      has an inflammatory mechanism. Although increased body weight may be associated with&#xD;
      increased inflammation, it is unclear that increased body weight is associated with chronic&#xD;
      abdominal pain. Accordingly both overweight and normal weight subjects with and without&#xD;
      chronic abdominal pain of unknown origin will be included in this study. The study design is&#xD;
      a longitudinal natural history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to test the relationship between abdominal pain symptoms and intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation in two groups (overweight and normal weight patients with chronic abdominal pain&#xD;
      of unknown origin). After obtaining informed consent, an initial screening history and&#xD;
      physical exam to ensure eligibility will be performed. The participants abdominal pain,&#xD;
      psychological distress, quality of life, socio-demographic, and co-morbidities will be&#xD;
      assessed via questionnaires. Anthropometry, vital signs, and fasting blood work will be drawn&#xD;
      at both of the two visits to the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health for&#xD;
      clinical screening labs and research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three measures of intestinal inflammation including fecal calprotectin, intestinal&#xD;
      permeability, and serum cytokine IL-6 levels. A stool sample will be collected to measure&#xD;
      fecal calprotectin. Intestinal permeability will be measured with the administration of a&#xD;
      sugar based test solution which will be given orally to participants after an overnight fast&#xD;
      on their second visit. Excreted urine sugar ratios, expressed per m2 of body surface area,&#xD;
      will measure gastrointestinal permeability. Body mass and body fat analysis&#xD;
      (plethysmography), intra-abdominal and liver ultrasound, and Fibroscan measures will also be&#xD;
      collected on visit two. On either Day 1 or Day 2 of the study, patients will sip, swish and&#xD;
      spit additional sweet taste solutions and complete questionnaires about their sweetness&#xD;
      preferences related to these tastings.&#xD;
