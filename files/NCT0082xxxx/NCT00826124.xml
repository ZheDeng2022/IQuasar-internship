  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural steroid injections (ESI) are the most frequently performed procedures in pain&#xD;
      clinics. When performing ESI, there is no consensus about how to best select candidates for&#xD;
      this intervention, and which level(s) to inject. Some experts advocate basing the injection&#xD;
      level on MRI findings, whereas others recommend clinical symptoms. In order to determine&#xD;
      whether MRI is necessary before referring patients with chronic LBP radiating into the leg(s)&#xD;
      for pain management interventions, we will perform a randomized comparative study involving&#xD;
      131 patients with chronic low back and leg pain who are clinically candidates for epidural&#xD;
      steroid injections into two groups. Group I will receive two ESI based solely on historical&#xD;
      and physical exam (PE) findings. Group II will receive treatment only after MRI is reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that MRI will not have a significant effect on treatment&#xD;
      outcome, and will have minimal impact on patient care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and thirty-one patients referred to the Blaustein Pain Treatment Center with back&#xD;
      and leg pain will be randomized to receive one of two treatments. Sixty-three patients will&#xD;
      be allocated to group I and up to 68 to group II (see below and statistical analysis). All&#xD;
      patients will be candidates for ESI based on history and physical exam. All 63 group I&#xD;
      patients will receive two ESI based solely on history and PE (i.e. the treating physician&#xD;
      will be blinded to MRI results). Group II will receive treatment based on MRI, history and&#xD;
      PE. This probably but may not include ESI (i.e. it is conceivable that a normal MRI might&#xD;
      result in conventional therapy instead of ESI, though chemical irritation of nerve roots&#xD;
      often occurs without disc protrusion. We estimate this to occur in no more than 10% of cases&#xD;
      (probably less); hence, we are planning to randomize up to 68 patients to group II. If an ESI&#xD;
      is done, the patient will receive two injections, similar to patients in group I.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by a research assistant via a computerized randomization system in&#xD;
      groups of 13. In order to ensure no serious pathology is missed in group I subjects, a&#xD;
      separate doctor with no knowledge of treatment allocation will review the films. If there is&#xD;
      serious pathology such as evidence of spinal metastases or infection, the patient will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. There will be no &quot;control&quot; group in this study. Both evaluating&#xD;
      physicians and patients will be blinded until they exit the study.&#xD;
