      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending,&#xD;
      multiple, oral doses of PRA-027 in Japanese postmenopausal women. The secondary purpose is to&#xD;
      evaluate the PK and PD profile of multiple oral doses of PRA-027 in Japanese postmenopausal&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Aged 35 to 65 years inclusive on study day 1 of the treatment period. Menopause may be&#xD;
             spontaneous or due to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Postmenopausal women are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Spontaneous amenorrhea must have begun by age 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Spontaneous amenorrhea must have initiated at least 6 months before study day 1&#xD;
                  of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For subjects who have had spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 6 months but less&#xD;
                  than 12 months before screening, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level must be&#xD;
                  ≥ 38 mIU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For subjects who have had spontaneous amenorrhea for 12 months or longer before&#xD;
                  screening, no FSH level determination is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For subjects who have had amenorrhea as a result of bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
                  without hysterectomy; surgery must have occurred at least 6 months before&#xD;
                  screening. No FSH measurement is required. Subjects must provide evidence of the&#xD;
                  procedure by an operative report or by ultrasound scan. The date (month/year) of&#xD;
                  the subjects' last menstrual period must be determined and recorded on the source&#xD;
                  document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) in the range of 17.6 to 26.4 kg/m2 and bodyweight ≥ 45 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             BMI is calculated by taking the subject's weight, in kilograms, divided by the square&#xD;
             of the subject's average height, in meters, at screening:BMI = weight (kg)/[Height&#xD;
             (m)]2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Healthy, as determined by the investigator, on the basis of screening evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatinine&#xD;
             levels should be below the upper limit of normal at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Nonsmoker or smoker of fewer than 10 cigarettes per day as determined by history. Must&#xD;
             be able to abstain from smoking during the inpatient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a high probability for compliance with and completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
