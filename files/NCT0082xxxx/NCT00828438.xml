      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the PK properties of lorcaserin in subjects with end&#xD;
      stage renal disease (ESRD) who require dialysis and will be studied under dialysis and&#xD;
      non-dialysis conditions.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males or females aged between 18 and 79 years (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to give signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Renal function will fall into one of the following categories (ideal body weight will&#xD;
             be used for the calculation):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One-fifth of subjects will have normal renal function, defined as creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance &gt; 80 mL/min calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One-fifth of subjects will have creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One-fifth of subjects will have creatinine clearance 31-50 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One-fifth of subjects will have creatinine clearance 5-30 mL/min, but not require&#xD;
                  dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One-fifth of subjects will have chronic end stage renal disease, require&#xD;
                  regularly scheduled hemodialysis, and be on a stable hemodialysis regimen for at&#xD;
                  least 3 months prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects in the renally impaired groups will have stable renal disease as per&#xD;
             Investigator's assessment, with no clinically meaningful changes for 1 month prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects in all groups will have a BMI of 27-45 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Considered to be in stable health in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Eligible male and female subjects must agree not to participate in a conception&#xD;
             process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior participation in any study of lorcaserin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically significant new illness in the 1 month before screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Not suitable to participate in the study in the opinion of the Investigator including&#xD;
             an existing physical or mental condition that prevents compliance with the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of any of the following cardiovascular conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction (diagnosed by cardiac enzyme[s] and/or diagnostic ECG),&#xD;
                  CVA, TIA or RIND within 3 months of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiac arrhythmia requiring initiation of a new medical or surgical treatment&#xD;
                  within 3 months of screening (pacemaker and/or defibrillator implanted &gt; 3 months&#xD;
                  prior to screening is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of pulmonary artery hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive result of HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C screens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Malignancy within 2 years of the screening visit (except basal cell or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma with clean surgical margins)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of SSRI's, SNRI's, and other medications must meet washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Recent history (within 3 months prior to the screening visit) of alcohol or&#xD;
             drug/solvent abuse or a positive screen for drugs of abuse at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participated in any clinical study with an investigational drug, biologic, or device&#xD;
             within 1 month prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Unwilling, or whose partner is unwilling, to use an adequate means of contraception&#xD;
             during and for 1 month following completion/withdrawal of the study&#xD;
