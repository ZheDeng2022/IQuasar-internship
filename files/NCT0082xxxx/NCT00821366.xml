    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the benefits of ARV treatment to patients, to the&#xD;
      family members of patients on ARV treatment, and to communities at large. The study also aims&#xD;
      to investigate the impact of a peer adherence support and a nutritional intervention on&#xD;
      measures of treatment success. To this end, 648 patients who had commenced ARV treatment in&#xD;
      the past month at twelve selected health care facilities will be recruited into the study. In&#xD;
      addition, 204 randomly sampled households from the communities served by the twelve selected&#xD;
      clinics will be recruited into the study. Trained enumerators will at baseline conduct&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with patients and households. Following the baseline survey,&#xD;
      patients recruited into the study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving ARV treatment and the associated support currently provided in the&#xD;
           public sector ARV treatment programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving (a) plus bi-weekly visits by an experienced ARV patient who has been&#xD;
           trained as a peer adherence supporter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving (a) and (b) plus a weekly nutritional supplement in the form of two&#xD;
           400g cans of meatballs and spaghetti in tomato sauce The group of 'comparison'&#xD;
           households comprises the fourth group. Trained enumerators will conduct follow-up&#xD;
           interviews with all patients and households at approximately six- and at twelve-months&#xD;
           respectively. In addition, the ARV coordinator and other providers working in the ARV&#xD;
           treatment programme at each of the twelve selected health care facilities will be&#xD;
           interviewed by trained enumerators, at baseline and again at six- and at twelve-months.&#xD;
           Clinical data will be obtained from patient files at baseline and at completion of the&#xD;
           study. Using these data, various outcomes of importance to the study will be compared&#xD;
           between the four study groups, using experimental and non-experimental methods.&#xD;

      The study has three main objectives, each with a set of more specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Present a broader view of treatment success&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve this objective, the study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate how access to antiretroviral treatment and to nutritional supplementation&#xD;
           impacts labour productivity and time allocation of patients and other household members&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate how access to antiretroviral treatment and to nutritional supplementation&#xD;
           impacts household welfare&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate how access to antiretroviral treatment and to nutritional supplementation&#xD;
           impacts educational and health outcomes for children in households with patients on&#xD;
           antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Develop a model of the determinants of treatment success&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve this objective, the study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how various individual, household and facility-level characteristics impact&#xD;
           adherence to antiretroviral treatment, including access to a disability grant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how access to a peer adherence supporter and nutritional supplementation&#xD;
           impacts adherence to antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in enhancement in adherence, from&#xD;
           both a fiscal and a social perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Understand the links between treatment and prevention&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve this objective, the study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how access to antiretroviral treatment impacts on the uptake of voluntary&#xD;
           counselling and testing among members of households including patients on ARV treatment&#xD;
           and among members of households in the general community&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how access to antiretroviral treatment, to a peer adherence supporter and to&#xD;
           nutritional supplementation impacts on the sexual behaviour of patients on&#xD;
           antiretroviral treatment, their household members, and members of households in the&#xD;
           general community&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate effective AIDS treatment and support in settings where free ARV&#xD;
      treatment has been introduced already, with issues of scale-up and sustainability as a result&#xD;
      representing an important issue. The study therefore is being conducted in twelve phase I ARV&#xD;
      assessment sites in the Free State province, i.e. sites where ARV treatment first became&#xD;
      available when the ARV treatment programme was launched in the Free State province in&#xD;
      2004/05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of study The study is a prospective, cohort study with a patient, household,&#xD;
           facility and provider survey component. The study has a social scientific focus, with a&#xD;
           clinical component, and comprises two behavioural interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of experimental design The study is a combination of a group time-series&#xD;
           quasi-experimental design and a a variation of a double randomised consent design. The&#xD;
           study comprises four groups of households, three of which include patients on ARV&#xD;
           treatment (Figure 1). The provision of ARV treatment represents a quasi- or field&#xD;
           experiment, while the peer adherence support and nutritional interventions represent a&#xD;
           randomised-control experiment executed in accordance with a Zelen-type double randomised&#xD;
           consent design. This study design is deemed appropriate given the fact that: blinding is&#xD;
           not practicable or possible; the use of classical randomisation and informed consent&#xD;
           procedures significantly threatens internal validity; the interventions are highly&#xD;
           attractive; the control group receives standard care; the study focuses on a clinically&#xD;
           relevant objective(s) and offers important new insights (Kaptchuk, 2001; MacLehose et&#xD;
           al, 2001; Rains &amp; Penzien, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Figure 1: Experimental study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group A: Households including ARV patients who receive the ARV treatment and associated&#xD;
           support provided as part of government's ARV treatment programme Sample size: n~216]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group B: Households including ARV patients who receive the ARV treatment and associated&#xD;
           support provided as part of government's ARV treatment programme PLUS Adherence support&#xD;
           provided by a trained peer adherence supporter during twice weekly visits to the patient&#xD;
           [Sample size: n~216]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group C: Households including ARV patients who receive the ARV treatment and associated&#xD;
           support provided as part of government's ARV treatment programme PLUS Adherence support&#xD;
           provided by a trained peer adherence supporter during twice weekly visits to the patient&#xD;
           PLUS Nutritional supplementation: weekly delivery of two 400g cans of meatballs and&#xD;
           spaghetti in tomato sauce by peer adherence supporter [Sample size: n~216]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group D: Randomly selected households from the general community served by the selected&#xD;
           health facility, excluding households where someone is known to receive ARV treatment&#xD;
           [Sample size: n~180]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size calculation for the arms of the study is based on the method proposed by&#xD;
           Freedman (1982). The sample size estimation is based on the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The proportion of people showing an improvement in a specific outcome, are compared&#xD;
                across two arms of the study at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Attrition in the control group of comparison households is assumed to be minimal or&#xD;
                none (since there is no ARV patient in the household), while attrition in the&#xD;
                intervention arms (where ARV treatment is considered an intervention) is assumed to&#xD;
                be much higher, given a reported mortality of 10% among ARV patients in the first&#xD;
                months of treatment (Free State Department of Health, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The required sample sizes for a 4-equal-arms-at-end-of-study design were calculated&#xD;
                taking into account the attrition rate of 17% in the three intervention groups and&#xD;
                a ratio of 1 for the treatment: control arms at the end of the study is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assuming a two-tailed test with Type I error of 5%, Type II error of 10%, and at&#xD;
                least 17% improvement in any outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The affordable sample size was 801 households with 177 for the control arm and 208 for&#xD;
           each of the intervention arms. This sample is expected to yield statistically&#xD;
           significant results for the analysis of all measures contemplated. Although the&#xD;
           statistical power of the study design with this sample size can be considered good the&#xD;
           sample size was rounded up to ~828 households, with ~180 households in the control arm&#xD;
           and ~216 households in each of the intervention arms. This was done to represent&#xD;
           multiples of 12 since the study will be conducted in 12 facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Method of randomisation From among the ~648 ARV patients recruited into the study&#xD;
           [~54/study site], individual patients will be assigned randomly to the control group&#xD;
           [Group A; n~216] and to the two experimental arms of the study [Group B &amp; C; n~216&#xD;
           each], using the relevant random sampling selection commands in version 10 of the Stata&#xD;
           software programme.&#xD;
