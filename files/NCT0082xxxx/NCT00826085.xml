      This is a research study to evaluate the effects of ThermoDox in combination with therapeutic&#xD;
      heating of the chest wall in the treatment of recurrent regional breast cancer. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of ThermoDox and measure efficacy in&#xD;
      recurrent chest wall patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in both the United States and the world.&#xD;
      Despite a variety of hormonal, cytotoxic and biologic approaches, a significant number of&#xD;
      tumors will recur in the chest wall and axillary area following primary treatment. Any local&#xD;
      recurrence of breast cancer after mastectomy is generally regarded as a poor prognostic&#xD;
      indicator. However, it is also generally agreed that those who present without measurable&#xD;
      metastatic disease at the time of loco-regional recurrence (LRR) have a more favorable&#xD;
      disease and may experience long-term survival. Overall up to 35% of women with operable&#xD;
      breast cancer will experience an isolated LRR following their primary treatment. Patients&#xD;
      with LRR suffer from disfiguring tumors and other clinical signs and symptoms including pain,&#xD;
      lymphedema limiting range of motion in the affected extremity, foul-smelling wounds, and a&#xD;
      visual reminder of tumor progression. Up to 40% of patients undergoing a mastectomy as their&#xD;
      primary treatment will experience a recurrence at the chest wall or overlying skin (RCW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For initial curative intent in LRR, available interventions include surgical resection in&#xD;
      patients whose tumor and clinical status permits anesthesia and surgical removal, radiation&#xD;
      therapy in patients whose tumor and clinical status permits additional radiation, systemic&#xD;
      hormonal and/or cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients whose tumors are sensitive to such drugs&#xD;
      and combinations of the aforementioned. For unresectable LRR tumors, radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy are used to manage the disease. In this setting some success has been achieved;&#xD;
      however, a patient who reoccurs following these treatments is often treated with palliative&#xD;
      intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diathermy refers to the therapeutic generation of local heat in body tissues by&#xD;
      high-frequency electromagnetic radiation, electric currents, or ultrasonic waves. In mild&#xD;
      hyperthermia local tissue temperatures are restricted to a range of 39-45°C. Two types of&#xD;
      external devices, microwave systems and ultrasound systems, have been approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      delivering mild hyperthermia to the chest wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild hyperthermia from either microwave or ultrasound devices has been used safely in breast&#xD;
      cancer treatment. In conjunction with external beam radiation, both types of devices have&#xD;
      been used to heat the chest wall and both devices have demonstrated enhanced effects when&#xD;
      compared to radiation therapy without additional hyperthermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxorubicin hydrochloride is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic. The recommended&#xD;
      single-agent dose of doxorubicin HCl (Adriamycin®) for injection is 60 to 75 mg/m2&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) in three-week cycles. Acute myelosuppression and long term, cumulative,&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity (congestive heart failure) are dose-limiting. Doxorubicin is active against&#xD;
      breast cancer as a single agent and is used with other drugs in multi-agent chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens. In LRR breast cancer, single agent doxorubicin achieves response rates comparable&#xD;
      to combination chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (ThermoDox®) is a temperature sensitive liposomal&#xD;
      drug delivery system that selectively accumulates in tumors as a result of their leaky&#xD;
      vasculature. During ThermoDox/hyperthermia therapy, the tumor is heated locally while the&#xD;
      rest of the body remains at a normal temperature. When the liposomes encounter a temperature&#xD;
      of 39.5°C or above, they release doxorubicin locally into the heated area. Liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin is administered intravenously and, because it is particulate, will eventually be&#xD;
      removed from circulation by the reticuloendothelial system in the liver and spleen.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic data from liver cancer patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA)&#xD;
      and ThermoDox show that the major portion of exposure to ThermoDox (about 95% of the&#xD;
      liposomal doxorubicin plasma AUC0-∞) occurs during the first six hours following the&#xD;
      infusion, establishing this time period as optimal for application of hyperthermia. Animal&#xD;
      studies have repeatedly shown higher tumor doxorubicin concentrations and enhanced tumor cell&#xD;
      killing when ThermoDox is combined with hyperthermia compared to doxorubicin without&#xD;
      hyperthermia.&#xD;

    <description>ThermoDox is a 30 minute intravenous infusion followed by hyperthermia within 60 minutes of infusion completion.&#xD;
Hyperthermia is a therapy used to heat tumors for 60 minutes. Using heat energy, the tumor is heated to a certain temperature. The heat can damage cancer cells at levels that are usually safe for normal cells and can be used to attack cancer in four major ways: 1) heat damages or weakens the cells of the tumor; 2) heat increase blood flow through the weakened tumor; 3) increased blood flow raises oxygen levels in tumors; and 4) when the body senses fever it can stimulate the nature immune system.&#xD;
All patients will receive up to six ThermoDox/hyperthermia treatments at 21-day intervals.</description>
