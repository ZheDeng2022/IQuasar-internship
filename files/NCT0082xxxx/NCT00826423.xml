      This study is short course (3 month) multiple drug antibiotic therapy. The purpose of this&#xD;
      research study is to evaluate the clinical and radiology response to assess whether drug&#xD;
      resistance develops and assess quality of life measures with MAC disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to assess the safety and efficacy of short course (3 months)&#xD;
      multiple drug antimicrobial therapy in adults with MAC pulmonary disease associated with&#xD;
      multifocal bronchiectasis and multiple small nodules. We propose to evaluate the clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic response, assess whether macrolide (either Clarithromycin or Azithromycin)&#xD;
      resistance develops, and assess quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No evidence of efficacy is required to proceed to longer term studies; however, we will need&#xD;
      to confirm lack of development of macrolide resistance in this pilot study before proceeding&#xD;
      to any additional studies to evaluate the efficacy of short course MAC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once we have demonstrated the feasibility of short course therapy and confirm that resistance&#xD;
      to macrolides does not develop, we hope to apply for external funding to support a longer&#xD;
      term randomized controlled trial comparing &quot;standard&quot; MAC therapy (which usually consists of&#xD;
      a period of eighteen to twenty-four months with at least three antimicrobials) to short&#xD;
      course (three months) MAC antimicrobial treatment, alternating each year with nine months of&#xD;
      non-MAC bronchial hygiene measures for two consecutive years. If a larger study confirms&#xD;
      efficacy of this approach, we would then propose even larger multi-site studies to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that short course MAC therapy alternating every year with non-MAC bronchial&#xD;
      hygiene therapy should be considered in all adult patients with MAC pulmonary disease&#xD;
      associated with multifocal bronchiectasis and multiple small nodules throughout their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longer term goal of this research is to develop an optimal treatment strategy for these&#xD;
      patients (in whom MAC will likely persist indefinitely) that will result in not only a better&#xD;
      quality of life, but less evidence of long term lung damage, less risk of drug-related&#xD;
      morbidity, and be better tolerated by the patients compared to current treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this pilot study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Confirm that macrolide (either Clarithromycin or Azithromycin) resistance does not&#xD;
           develop as a result of short course treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess for change in quality of life metrics (St. George Respiratory Questionnaire and&#xD;
           SF 12) from baseline to the conclusion of the study period (six months). We expect to&#xD;
           see improvement in quality of life measures as a result of this short course treatment&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess for change in pulmonary function from baseline to the conclusion of the study&#xD;
           period. We expect to see improvement particularly in the FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and diffusing&#xD;
           capacity for carbon monoxide as a result of this short course treatment trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess for change in high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) of the chest,&#xD;
           evidence of MAC pulmonary disease (multifocal bronchiectasis associated with multiple&#xD;
           small nodules) from baseline to the conclusion of the study period. We do not anticipate&#xD;
           being able to demonstrate improvement in the HRCT evidence of MAC lung disease during&#xD;
           the short period of this trial since these changes usually occur quite slowly.&#xD;

        Fifteen adult patients will be included in this pilot study. This sample size was chosen&#xD;
        not on the basis of formal statistical considerations. However, data from 15 patients will&#xD;
        be sufficient to provide rough preliminary estimates of parameters that may be needed for&#xD;
        developing power statements for a follow-up larger (randomized) trial. If macrolide&#xD;
        resistance occurs in 5% or less of patients in this population, with â‰¥83% probability only&#xD;
        one or zero of the 15 patients will develop resistance. If two or more of the 15 patients&#xD;
        develop resistance then further investigations of resistance will be warranted before&#xD;
        moving on to randomized trials.&#xD;
