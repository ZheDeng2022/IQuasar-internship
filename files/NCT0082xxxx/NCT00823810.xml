  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measuring tumor response to treatment based on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) has been a widely debated issue (response criteria in solid tumors&#xD;
      [RECIST] and World Health Organization criteria). Furthermore, early identification of&#xD;
      nonresponding patients is of great importance because the rates of response of common&#xD;
      malignant solid tumors to chemotherapy are in the range of only 20-30%. Therefore,&#xD;
      quantitative imaging of tumor metabolism with 18F-FDG PET/CT may provide important advantages&#xD;
      and thus reduce side effects and costs of ineffective therapy. However, the evidence to date&#xD;
      for the use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT with this indication is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present trial is to determine the impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the&#xD;
      management of advanced colorectal cancer. The aim is also to confirm whether a metabolic&#xD;
      response can be used as a surrogate end point in monitoring treatment response in this cancer&#xD;
      type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 40 patients with advanced colorectal cancer patients. All patients will&#xD;
      be studied with 18F-FDG PET/CT combined with diagnostic contrast enhanced abdominal CT before&#xD;
      the start of chemotherapy and re-evaluated 4-5 weeks after the initiation of therapy. Effect&#xD;
      of this metabolic and anatomic change in therapy are evaluated and correlated to survival,&#xD;
      morbidity, and treatment -related costs. Histopathologic confirmation of response is&#xD;
      evaluated whenever possible. The data will be collected between 2008 and 2012.&#xD;
