      Nocturia, waking at night from sleep to void, is a prevalent and troublesome symptom.&#xD;
      Treatment with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist medication (α-blockers) is a standard therapy&#xD;
      for LUTS in men, but α-blockers offer only limited reductions in nocturia. While combinations&#xD;
      of multiple drugs could be used, many individuals wish to take fewer medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the BEDTiMe Nocturia Study will undergo a series of visits during which they&#xD;
      will receive a combination of either standard drug therapy (or placebo) and a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention tailored to help with nocturia or problems with nocturia. Participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated for outcomes at 12 weeks and followed for six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will yield important information related to alternative treatments of nocturia in&#xD;
      men, as well as novel information regarding the clinical importance of these nocturia&#xD;
      reductions. This study has the potential to alter standards of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nocturia, waking at night from sleep to void, is a prevalent and troublesome symptom. While&#xD;
      other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)-- including poor urinary stream, urgency,&#xD;
      frequency, and straining to void-- are also common, nocturia is one of the most bothersome&#xD;
      LUTS. Nocturia causes sleep disruption and is associated with accidental falls and higher&#xD;
      utilization of sick days from work. Conditions that result in low volume urinary voids, high&#xD;
      urine production at night, and/or primary sleep disturbances will cause nocturia. Overactive&#xD;
      bladder (OAB), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), congestive heart failure (CHF), poorly&#xD;
      controlled diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral edema, and obstructive sleep apnea all cause&#xD;
      nocturia. Individual patients frequently have multiple conditions potentially related to&#xD;
      nocturia, which highlights the need for strategies that are broad-based interventions.&#xD;
      Treatment with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist medication (α-blockers) is a standard therapy&#xD;
      for LUTS in men, but α-blockers offer only limited reductions in nocturia. While combinations&#xD;
      of multiple drugs could also be employed to more successfully treat nocturia, non-drug&#xD;
      treatments are an important option for those unwilling or unable to take additional&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BEDTiMe Nocturia Study (Behavior and Exercise or Drug Trial in Men with Nocturia), is a&#xD;
      two-site (Atlanta and Birmingham), randomized, clinical trial. The 200 male participants will&#xD;
      be stratified by degree of nocturia and urinary flow rate and randomized to three treatment&#xD;
      arms: 1) α-blocker therapy alone; versus 2) a standardized, multicomponent behavioral and&#xD;
      exercise therapy (M-BET), given with placebo tablets; versus 3) combination therapy (M-BET&#xD;
      and α-blockers). The M-BET intervention includes: training in pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      rehabilitation, self monitoring with bladder diaries, and teaching urge suppression and other&#xD;
      skills to inhibit detrusor contractions; fluid management strategies; sleep hygiene&#xD;
      strategies; and non-pharmacological management of lower extremity edema. Interventions&#xD;
      similar to M-BET have shown reductions in nocturia in women with urge urinary incontinence&#xD;
      (UI) that exceeded benefit from anticholinergic drug therapy. The use of this intervention in&#xD;
      men builds upon strong pilot data from the MINIM trial (Multicomponent Interventions for&#xD;
      Nocturia in Men; VA GRECC Pilot, VA Medical Research Services) and the ongoing study&#xD;
      Behavioral Treatment For Overactive Bladder In Men (VA RR&amp;D B02-2489R, Burgio, PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design allows 3 main research questions to be addressed: 1) Does M-BET reduce&#xD;
      nocturia more than α-blockers?; 2) Does M-BET improve sleep more than α-blockers?; and 3)&#xD;
      Will combination therapy be more effective than either treatment alone? The main outcomes&#xD;
      will be nocturia reduction and sleep improvement at 12 weeks. Nocturia reduction will be&#xD;
      assessed by participant completed bladder diaries and sleep improvement will be assessed by&#xD;
      wrist-actigraph determined sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and wake time after sleep&#xD;
      onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will yield important information related to alternative treatments of nocturia in&#xD;
      male veterans, as well as novel information regarding the clinical importance of these&#xD;
      nocturia reductions. Though many clinicians employ single-agent α-blockers routinely for the&#xD;
      treatment of nocturia, few utilize multicomponent behavioral interventions or use behavioral&#xD;
      therapy. Thus, this study has the potential to alter standards of care.&#xD;
