  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of fluphenazine in&#xD;
      patients with advanced multiple myeloma. The study will also describe the efficacy of this&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, dose-escalating, Phase 1b trial in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma. Patients will be dosed on Days 1 and 8 of each 21&#xD;
      day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, the MTD determining portion of the&#xD;
      study, patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients at each dose level. At least 3&#xD;
      patients will complete 21 days at each dose level and will be evaluated for safety and&#xD;
      tolerability before additional patients are treated at higher doses. Doses will be increased&#xD;
      following a modified Fibonacci scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, twelve additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD determined in Part 1 (or&#xD;
      the dose for the highest dose cohort completed if the MTD has not been reached) to further&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of this dose regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum fluphenazine pharmacokinetic studies will be performed during the first cycle of the&#xD;
      therapy in all Part 1 and Part 2 consenting patients.&#xD;

    <description>Fluphenazine HCl will be administered intravenously. To quickly reach and maintain the target bone marrow concentration for 18 hours, the study drug will be administered using 3 bolus injections (0, 6, and 12 hours). Fluphenazine will be dose-escalated according to a modified Fibonacci scheme, terminating in 40% increments. Treatments will be administered on days 1 and 8 of every 21 day cycle.</description>
