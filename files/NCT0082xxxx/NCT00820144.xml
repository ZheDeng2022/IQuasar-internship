  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a biomedical research without direct individual benefit, exploring and comparing the&#xD;
      mucosal immune response after oral, nasal and sublingual administration of B-subunit of&#xD;
      non-toxic cholera toxin (CTB) in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immense majority of the infections involve the mucosal surfaces as a gateway of the&#xD;
      pathogenic agent. These mucosal surfaces are mainly represented by the gastrointestinal,&#xD;
      respiratory and urogenital tract. These mucosal surfaces contain a highly developed immune&#xD;
      system, which can exploit in a mucus vaccine approach to fight against infectious agents upon&#xD;
      their penetration in the body. It has been established that to be effective against infection&#xD;
      mucosa, a vaccine must stimulate the local immune system. This objective is reached much more&#xD;
      efficiently when the vaccine is administered by mucosal way (oral, nasal) than by the&#xD;
      parenteral classical way. Recent works allowed developing a new non invasive system of&#xD;
      administration of vaccines. It is based on the mucosal administration (oral, nasal, rectal,&#xD;
      vaginal) comprising a combination of antigen bound (either chemically or by genetic fusion)&#xD;
      to the non-toxic subunit of cholera toxin or CTB (Cholera Toxin B subunit). This subunit has&#xD;
      an exceptional affinity for GM1 ganglioside expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells.&#xD;
      So, the mucosal administration (by oral or nasal route) of a low dose of an antigen linked to&#xD;
      the CTB - Mucosal vector with immunomodulatory properties - Leads powerful secretor immune&#xD;
      responses in the exposed mucous As well as in distant mucous, with a strong production of&#xD;
      secretories IgA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The developed methods of exploration have to allow to characterize the cells which live (or&#xD;
      which migrate) in the mucous membrane investigated on the functional and phenotypic plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research should lead to a range of standardized operating procedures, allowing to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccines candidates to the mucous administration and of&#xD;
      predictive markers of the type of immune response generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to analyse at the healthy voluntary subjects the&#xD;
      systematic immunizing answer induced after nasal, oral or sublingual administration of the&#xD;
      CTB from blood samples - the lymphoid &quot;compartment&quot; the most accessible at the man- from&#xD;
      saliva and from nasal wash. The immune response after administration of the CTB By sublingual&#xD;
      way should be comparable in that of two other ways in term of intensity of the response,&#xD;
      however, with a different IgA / IgG report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to establish a range of tests to predict the&#xD;
      character and the intensity of this response by analyzing the expression of B cells certain&#xD;
      surface molecules marking their future for the production of Antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a regional prospective monocentric study conducted in opened without direct individual&#xD;
      profit. The study will be conducted over 3 years including 24 months of recruitment for each&#xD;
      patient with a follow-up of 35 days and 6 months of operation data.&#xD;
