  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out the highest dose of vandetanib that can be safely&#xD;
      given with repeat radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study drug has been designed to block certain chemical pathways that stimulate tumor to&#xD;
      grow. The study drug has been shown to slow the growth of a number of types of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a dose escalation study. A dose escalation study means that successive groups of&#xD;
      patients will receive higher doses of the study drug. There are three dose levels. The dose&#xD;
      of the study drug received will depend on the stage the study has reached at the time a&#xD;
      patient decides to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to taking the study drug patients will also receive radiation therapy to the&#xD;
      brain tumor for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The objective of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      VANDETANIB given with 36 Gy hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The MTD will be dose&#xD;
      of VANDETANIB at which no patients develop acute grade 5 toxicity and less than 30% of&#xD;
      patients develop acute (within 30 days of radiation therapy) or delayed (at least 30 days&#xD;
      after radiation completed) dose limiting toxicities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Screening Prior to receiving any treatment, tests will be performed to determine overall&#xD;
      medical condition. This will include blood tests, questions about medical history, and&#xD;
      physical and neurological exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scan of the brain, electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray will be performed as baseline&#xD;
      studies if they have not been performed in the last 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women of child-bearing potential will also have a serum pregnancy test within 2 days before&#xD;
      taking the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment If all of the study criteria are met and subject is enrolled in the study,&#xD;
      you will start taking the study drug at least 7 days before radiation therapy. You will take&#xD;
      the study drug once a day by mouth. You should take the study drug at about the same time&#xD;
      each day. If you forget to take a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, as long&#xD;
      as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose is due. If it is less than 12 hours until the&#xD;
      next dose, do not take the dose you have missed. If you throw up within 30 minutes after you&#xD;
      take the study drug, you should take another dose, and use medicine to stop or relieve your&#xD;
      vomiting per your doctor's instruction. You will continue to take the study drug for a total&#xD;
      duration of one year. The study will be stopped if your disease progresses or there is&#xD;
      excessive toxicity. Your participation in the study will be for one year. However, we will&#xD;
      continue to follow your disease status, general health and possible treatment-related side&#xD;
      effects after one year and for as long as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I study. These types of studies usually include a small number of subjects&#xD;
      and are often called dose-escalation studies. Subjects in the first dose group will be&#xD;
      receiving a small dose of the study drug. If no unacceptable side effects are observed in&#xD;
      these subjects, the next group of subjects will receive the next higher dose of study drug.&#xD;
      The study drug doses planned are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level Drug dose Level 1 100 mg once a day Level 2 200 mg once a day Level 3 300 mg once&#xD;
      a day&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to one of three levels depending on when you enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also receive radiation therapy. The radiation dose is the same for all patients.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy will begin at least 7 days after you begin taking the study drug. The&#xD;
      radiation therapy will be once a day for 3 consecutive days. A special plastic mask will be&#xD;
      made for you and used to hold your head still during each radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and procedures will be performed throughout your treatment to determine how your cancer&#xD;
      is responding and to monitor you for safety purposes. The tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      scheduled for you. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, neurological examination, and ECG, right before, and in the first,&#xD;
           second, fourth, eighth and twelfth week of drug treatment; then once every three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI and quality of life questionnaires at one month and three month after&#xD;
           radiation therapy, then once every three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray as your doctor determines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up You will also have follow-up visits with your doctor once a month for the first 6&#xD;
      months, then once every three months. You may also see your doctor anytime as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration You will be on this study for up to 12 months.&#xD;
