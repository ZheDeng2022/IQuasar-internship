    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the response to methylphenidate treatment of children&#xD;
      with two different subtypes of ADHD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Inattentive subtype (IN) of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder was newly defined in&#xD;
      DSM-IV (1994). Recent epidemiological studies suggest that IN is at least as common and as&#xD;
      impairing academically and socially as the more commonly recognized Combined type (CB).&#xD;
      However, little is known about the etiology, course and outcome, or treatment of the IN type.&#xD;
      Notably, although stimulant drugs are commonly used clinically to treat the disorder, there&#xD;
      have been no systematic studies of its efficacy in the IN subtype. Differences between the IN&#xD;
      and CB subtypes in behavioral phenotype, as well as in gender ratio, age of onset, and&#xD;
      comorbidity suggest there may be critical differences in neurobiology, which may have&#xD;
      relevance for response to drug treatments. The lack of data concerning stimulant drug&#xD;
      efficacy in the IN type thus constitutes an important issue from the perspective of public&#xD;
      health and quality of care. The proposed research is responsive to the current RFA in that it&#xD;
      will study the efficacy of an established treatment (stimulants) in a new patient population&#xD;
      (the IN subtype). A second specific aim is to test a hypothesis, emerging from a review of&#xD;
      the literature, of divergence between dose-response curves for effects on activity and&#xD;
      attention. We predict that the dose that optimizes performance on ratings of&#xD;
      hyperactivity-impulsivity will be lower than that which optimizes performance on ratings of&#xD;
      academic function and on the neuropsychological tests. We will similarly examine whether&#xD;
      differences in dose-response curves for specific functions extend to differences between&#xD;
      subtypes in optimal dose. The final aim of the current study is to compare the IN and CB&#xD;
      subtypes with respect to selected measures of neurocognitive function on placebo and in&#xD;
      response to drug treatment. We predict that the IN subtype will perform more poorly on&#xD;
      measures of spatial orienting and stimulus encoding, whereas the CB subtype will show greater&#xD;
      deficits on measures of cognitive inhibitory control, and that both types of cognitive&#xD;
      deficit will respond to drug treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:Inattentive Subtype:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A diagnosis on the structured DISC interview conducted with the parent, of ADHD,&#xD;
             Predominantly Inattentive Type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ratings by parent and by teacher corresponding to a total score above the 93rd&#xD;
             percentile (i.e. more than 1.5 SD above the mean) on the scale of &quot;DSM-IV Inattention&quot;&#xD;
             on the current Conners Parent (or Teacher) Rating Scale - Long Form. The items on this&#xD;
             scale are the inattention symptom criteria from the DSM-IV, each of which the&#xD;
             informant is asked to rate in severity on a 4-point scale ranging in severity from 0&#xD;
             (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;very much&quot;). A score above the 93th percentile indicates that&#xD;
             the child's score equals or exceeds that for 93% of other children of the same age&#xD;
             (within 2 years) and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (a) Scores more than 1 SD (84th percentile) above the mean on the&#xD;
        DSM-IV-Hyperactive-Impulsive scale on the Conners Parent or Teacher Rating Scales-Long&#xD;
        Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Combined Subtype:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A diagnosis of ADHD, Combined type on the structured DISC interview with the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ratings by parent and teacher each corresponding to a total score above the 93rd&#xD;
             percentile (i.e. more than 1.5 SD above the mean) on the scale of &quot;DSM-IV attention&quot;&#xD;
             on the current Conners Parent (Teacher) Rating Scales - Long Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ratings by parent and teacher each corresponding to a total score above the 93rd&#xD;
             percentile (i.e. more than 1.5 SD above the mean) on the scale of &quot;DSM-IV&#xD;
             Hyperactive-Impulsive&quot; symptoms on the current Conners Parent (Teacher) Rating Scales&#xD;
             - Long Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criterion: The child's school must agree to administer medication at mid-day and&#xD;
        to allow the teacher to complete the requisite behavior ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. WISC-III full-scale IQ less than 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Major acute or chronic medical condition, including sensory loss, and neurological&#xD;
             disorder, or any medical condition that would preclude the use of stimulant&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Comorbidity: The study rationale for inclusion/exclusion of comorbid&#xD;
             psychological/psychiatric conditions is as follows: children for whom the study&#xD;
             treatment is contraindicated, or for whom treatment not provided in the study is&#xD;
             required immediately, will not be entered in the trial. Thus, as an example, comorbid&#xD;
             depression or anxiety disorder is permitted provided immediate treatment of the&#xD;
             depressive or anxiety disorder is not required. Tic disorders of mild to moderate&#xD;
             severity, and stable, would be eligible for inclusion, as this would not constitute a&#xD;
             contraindication to receiving stimulants. However, children with pronounced or&#xD;
             unstable tics would not be eligible for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Children with any of the following conditions will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
             psychosis, any pervasive developmental disorder, and bipolar disorder. Thus children&#xD;
             will be permitted in the study if they have a comorbid learning disability,&#xD;
             oppositional defiant disorder, or conduct disorder. The Wechsler Individual&#xD;
             Achievement Tests will be administered in order that we can characterize our sample&#xD;
             with respect to the presence of comorbid learning disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concomitant medications: Systemically absorbed medication will be exclusionary, while&#xD;
             non-systemically absorbed medications will generally be permitted. Children who have&#xD;
             taken any experimental medication in the past month will be excluded. Any prior&#xD;
             psychotropic medication must have a suitable washout period of at least 4 half-lives&#xD;
             before assessment can begin (generally a minimum of 2 weeks; up to 4 weeks for&#xD;
             fluoxetine). Children taking methylphenidate at the time of inquiry may be withdrawn&#xD;
             from medication only if treatment response is less than optimal and a re-evaluation is&#xD;
             deemed clinically necessary. Children taking other psychotropic medication may be&#xD;
             discontinued, provided their prescribing physician is in agreement with this plan, and&#xD;
             provided there is clinical indication for doing so (i.e., either inadequate response,&#xD;
             adverse effects or problematic time-action properties).&#xD;
