  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) like LBH589 have recently been established as novel&#xD;
      potent anti-cancer agents for solid and hematologic malignancies. Several pre-clinical&#xD;
      reports have shown a good anti-tumoral activity of different HDACi on human or murine HCC&#xD;
      models. These compounds, e.g. Trichostatin A, SAHA, MS-275 and others, have been shown to&#xD;
      induce apoptosis in HCC cells and to inhibit growth of HCC by inhibiting proliferation and&#xD;
      tumor-related angiogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, HDACi sensitize HCC in a synergistic manner&#xD;
      to other forms of cytotoxic stimulation, e.g. by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs or&#xD;
      TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. It has also been shown that the combination of HDACi with various&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors like sorafenib, erlotinib or others, promotes the anti-tumor efficacy of&#xD;
      single agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the investigators' own previous experiences with different HDACi and LBH589 in&#xD;
      preclinical HCC models, a strong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic as well as an&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic effect will be expected by combining LBH589 with an existing sorafenib&#xD;
      treatment. It is assumed that this combination will prolong overall survival and&#xD;
      time-to-progression with lowered adverse effects in HCC patients.&#xD;
