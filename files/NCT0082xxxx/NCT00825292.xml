  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in western society. To prevent colon cancer it&#xD;
      is recommended for people to undergo a screening colonoscopy at the age of fifty. The purpose&#xD;
      of the colonoscopy is to remove polyps, since some of these lesions are precancerous.&#xD;
      Precancerous polyps are called adenomas. This method of prevention is effective, but the&#xD;
      standard colonoscopy currently used does not detect all polyps. Studies have reported a polyp&#xD;
      miss rate of about 24%. Furthermore, we are unable to distinguish precancerous polyps from&#xD;
      benign polyps, also known as hyperplastic polyps, with standard colonoscopy. This results in&#xD;
      all polyps being removed at time of colonoscopy, even the benign polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help improve the detection of colon polyps new endoscopic technologies have been&#xD;
      developed. These technologies include high definition white light (HDWL)and high definition&#xD;
      narrow band imaging (HDNBI). HDWL improves the overall resolution of the images seen during&#xD;
      colonoscopy. HDNBI can help us better classify polyps by enhancing their tissue appearance as&#xD;
      well as seeing small blood vessels and capillaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study to determine if HDNBI imaging shows an increased polyp detection rate&#xD;
      when compared to the current standard colonoscopy. In addition to develop a classification&#xD;
      system to help better differentiate between precancerous polyps and their benign counterparts&#xD;
      using HDWL and HDNBI.&#xD;

      II. Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The use of NBI colonoscopy will reduce the miss rate for colon polyps compared to&#xD;
           standard white light imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HDWl and HDNBI are more accurate than standard colonoscopy for the classification of&#xD;
           adenomatous polyps in comparison to other non-premalignant polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the miss rate of standard white light imaging compared to NBI for detection of&#xD;
           colon polyps with NBI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate the accuracy of standard white light, HDWL and HDNBI imaging modes for the&#xD;
           classification of adenomatous (premalignant) versus non-adenomatous (hyperplastic,&#xD;
           inflammatory, normal) polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the inter-observer agreement for classification of adenomatous versus&#xD;
           non-adenomatous polyps based on standard, NBI and HDWL imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Study Design: A prospective phase II cross-over trial. Patients will undergo both&#xD;
      procedures (standard, NBI) back to back under conscious sedation. The order of the procedure&#xD;
      will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Setting: The study will take place at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, Division of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, an expert center in the diagnosis and treatment of colon polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Study Subjects All patients scheduled for colonoscopy at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility using inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients that are deemed&#xD;
      eligible will be offered participation in the study. Informed consent will be obtained and&#xD;
      the participant will be registered in our database. Prior to consent the participant will be&#xD;
      made aware of the investigative nature of the study, alternatives, risks, and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease precluding colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presence of conditions not allowing for polypectomy or biopsy (e.g. coagulation&#xD;
           disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Known familial polyposis syndrome (FAP, HNPCC, Juvenile polyposis, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sub-optimal preparation for the procedure, which will be determined by patient history&#xD;
           or based on the initial colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 Procedure and Data Collections&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Pre-procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be prepared for colonoscopy with the standard preparation and will be&#xD;
      scheduled to have the procedure at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville. The principal investigator (PI)&#xD;
      will screen eligible patients based on medical history, physical exam and laboratory data on&#xD;
      day of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients typically arrive at the registration area at least 60 minutes before start of&#xD;
      scheduled procedure. A GI endoscopy nurse will prepare patients in the standard manner and&#xD;
      intravenous access will be placed. Eligible patients will be offered informed consent by the&#xD;
      study PI or designee. Patients who agree to participate in the study will sign informed&#xD;
      consent and will be registered in the database. A log with only non-identifiable (e.g.&#xD;
      patients # 1) will also be maintained of eligible patients who decline to participate. The GI&#xD;
      endoscopy nurse will monitor patient's vitals before, during and after procedure as per&#xD;
      standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exams will be performed back to back with a standard colonoscope and an ETMI colonoscope&#xD;
      provided by Olympus. The order of the first and second procedure will be randomized according&#xD;
      to a list prepared by the statistician using randomly permuted blocks to ensure equal numbers&#xD;
      of patients are randomized to the two groups. All patients will be sedated with meperidine or&#xD;
      fentanyl and midazolam to achieve conscious sedation. Each procedure will be preformed by a&#xD;
      different endoscopist. The endoscopist will be either the P.I. supervised by a GI staff&#xD;
      physician or solely by one of the five GI staff physicians. During the initial colonoscopy&#xD;
      all visualized polyps will be noted, photographed, and removed. When the ETMI colonoscope is&#xD;
      used, all polyps will be photographed using these modes (HDWL, HDNBI). The NBI portion of the&#xD;
      exam will be performed using the MB-046 cap to further enhance stabilization of the focal&#xD;
      length of the colonoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second procedure will be done with the same level of careful inspection as the first&#xD;
      although we not specifically regiment the time of withdrawal beyond what the endoscopist&#xD;
      feels is necessary for a careful examination. During the second colonoscopy all visualized&#xD;
      polyps will be noted, photographed and removed. During the first procedure, the time will be&#xD;
      evaluated with a stopwatch. The stopwatch will start when the endoscopist begins pull-back at&#xD;
      the cecum and end when the scope is removed from the anal verge. The clock will be stopped&#xD;
      during washing of the bowel, polypectomy, biopsy or any other therapeutic maneuver. At the&#xD;
      end of the first procedure, the endoscopist will be informed of the withdrawal and inspection&#xD;
      time and every effort will be made to match this to the second procedure. Time will be&#xD;
      recorded similarly for the second procedure. Polyps will be classified as pedunculated,&#xD;
      raised-sessile (rounded) or flat. Flat polyps will be further classified according to the&#xD;
      Paris endoscopic classification 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Post-procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure all patients will be brought to the recovery and monitored as per&#xD;
      standard protocol. Participants will be given discharge instructions as per protocol and also&#xD;
      be provided with information to contact the P.I. if any problems should occur. Any post&#xD;
      procedure complication will be reviewed on weekly intervals.&#xD;
