  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical illnesses and treatments can cause distress in patients, and medical professionals&#xD;
      are very interested in identifying distress quickly to ensure that a patient can receive&#xD;
      appropriate support and treatment. Adult patients often use a screening tool known as the&#xD;
      Distress Thermometer to indicate the causes and levels of distress they feel. However, little&#xD;
      work has been done on how to assess distress in pediatric patients. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of the Distress Thermometer as a tool to accurately measure&#xD;
      distress in pediatric patients, and determine whether primary caregivers and physicians can&#xD;
      also use the Distress Thermometer to accurately gauge a patient s levels and sources of&#xD;
      distress. The study will also investigate the effectiveness of the Distress Thermometer&#xD;
      compared with other means of measuring fatigue, mood, and pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include approximately 90 patients between 7 and 21 years of age who are&#xD;
      currently enrolled in a National Institutes of Health pediatric research study. It will also&#xD;
      include responses from the primary caregivers and primary medical providers of the patients&#xD;
      involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will complete the Distress Thermometer s self-reported distress scale and other&#xD;
      standardized measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain. In addition, patients&#xD;
      between 18 and 21 years of age will be asked to assess the benefits and negative effects of&#xD;
      participating in psychosocial research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the same day, the patient s primary caregiver and primary medical provider will complete a&#xD;
      Distress Thermometer survey to estimate the patient s distress level. If either the patient&#xD;
      or the primary caregiver indicate high levels of distress or mood symptoms, the researchers&#xD;
      will offer them an opportunity to speak with a mental health professional. The primary&#xD;
      medical provider will also receive a copy of the responses reported on the patient s Distress&#xD;
      Thermometer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate a measure that would assist clinicians in&#xD;
      assessing the presence of psychological distress in children and adolescents with serious&#xD;
      medical illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess the inter-rater reliability of the Distress Thermometer by comparing ratings&#xD;
      of the patient s distress given by the patient, the primary caregiver and the patient s&#xD;
      primary medical provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess the concurrent validity (i.e. the extent to which a test correlates with&#xD;
      other previously validated measures of similar constructs) of the Distress Thermometer, a&#xD;
      brief screening tool for psychological distress, as compared to validated measures of&#xD;
      psychological symptoms (i.e. depression, anxiety, pain and fatigue) in patients with&#xD;
      pediatric cancer, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) HIV-1 infection, Primary Immune Deficiencies&#xD;
      (PIDs), DNA repair diseases, sickle cell disease, and Li-Fraumeni.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess the acceptability of completing the Distress Thermometer to patients,&#xD;
      primary caregivers, and medical providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To assess the feasibility of administering the Distress Thermometer to patients with&#xD;
      cancer, NF1, and HIV-1 infection, PIDs, and DNA repair diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 1: To assess the relationship between the caregiver s self-report of&#xD;
      psychological symptoms and his or her rating of the patient s level of distress on the&#xD;
      Distress Thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2: To assess whether patient ratings on the Distress Thermometer differ between&#xD;
      the specific diseases, controlling for disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 3: To assess the burden and benefits of participating in psychosocial research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is taking place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Medstar Georgetown&#xD;
      University Hospital. All outpatients, ages 7-21, enrolled in a research study either at the&#xD;
      Pediatric Clinic, the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic, or the Dermatology Clinic at the NIH&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of pediatric cancer, NF-1, HIV, PIDs, and DNA repair, and those at risk for&#xD;
      Li-Fraumeni (P53 positive)syndrome diseases will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
      Additionally, all outpatients, ages 7-21, seen at Medstar Georgetown University Hospital for&#xD;
      HIV or sickle cell disease will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will complete a brief self-report distress scale (the Distress Thermometer) and&#xD;
      standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pain, and fatigue. Additionally, all patients&#xD;
      will be asked to assess the benefits and burdens of participating in psychosocial research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary caregivers will rate their child s level of distress (using the Distress&#xD;
      Thermometer), pain, fatigue anxiety and depression, and complete a self-report measure&#xD;
      assessing their own psychological symptoms in addition to questions that assess the benefits&#xD;
      and burdens of participating in psychosocial research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary medical provider (physicians or nurse practitioners) will give their estimation&#xD;
      of the patient s distress (using the Distress Thermometer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, primary caregivers and medical providers will assess the acceptability of&#xD;
      completing the Distress Thermometer. Additionally, data collectors will assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of administering the Distress Thermometer in a pediatric clinic. &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures include the Distress Thermometer, a brief screening tool consisting of a single item&#xD;
      rating of distress and a list of possible reasons for distress; the Children s Depression&#xD;
      Inventory (CDI); the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18); the State Trait Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      (STAI); the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale; the Children s Fatigue Scales; an Acceptability and&#xD;
      Feasibility scale for completion of the Distress Thermometer; and two questions regarding&#xD;
      perception of research participation.&#xD;
