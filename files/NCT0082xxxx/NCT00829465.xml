    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is a highly invasive malignancy and the rate of surgical resection is no more&#xD;
      than 28%. After diagnosis, the average survival rate of patient is less than 50% in 6 month,&#xD;
      less than 24% in 1 year and 5% in 5 year. The TACE treatment, under the theoretical basis of&#xD;
      blood supply of Liver cancer, is obviously better than the other non-surgical therapy, in&#xD;
      terms of tumor regression, AFP decrease, survival time and the evaluation of the quality of&#xD;
      life. However, its overall effect is not yet satisfactory. As a result, concerning the&#xD;
      research of drug for liver cancer and improving the overall efficacy of the treatment of&#xD;
      liver cancer has a very real and important clinical significance and social value. Licartin&#xD;
      (Iodine-131-Labeled Metuximab) injection is a antibody drug with new target and the only drug&#xD;
      that China own the intellectual property rights. It has specific high affinity with&#xD;
      HAb18G/CD147, the liver cell membrane antigen. Labeled 131I is taken to the liver tissue,&#xD;
      owning high-dose concentration and releasing β particles to liver cancer cells to and kill&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Second Military Medical University, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, planed to use&#xD;
      the treatment of Licartin combined with TACE for the patients of unresectable hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma and evaluate the difference of tumor size, AFP change, TTP, the overall survival&#xD;
      rate between different treatment group.&#xD;
