      This study will determine whether the drug betahistine increases focus and causes side&#xD;
      effects in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder in which problems with paying&#xD;
      attention and focusing disrupt people's lives. Betahistine is a drug that activates&#xD;
      histamine, a compound found in the human body that regulates immune response and acts as a&#xD;
      neurotransmitter. Increased availability of histamine in the brain is known to enhance&#xD;
      attention and cognition. In previous studies, betahistine increased vigilance in healthy&#xD;
      participants. Presently, betahistine is used outside the United States to treat vertigo, but&#xD;
      at doses that are too low to have an effect on attention and cognition. Based on data&#xD;
      regarding the use of betahistine outside the United States and on data from other studies&#xD;
      using betahistine, there do not appear to be any significant side effects from its use at low&#xD;
      doses. This study will determine both whether betahistine is effective in increasing&#xD;
      vigilance in people with ADHD and whether it has any side effects at higher doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last approximately 4 weeks. Participants will first attend a&#xD;
      screening visit that will include a review of their medical and psychiatric history, a&#xD;
      physical examination, vital signs measurements, an electrocardiogram (EKG) test, blood and&#xD;
      urine sample collection, an eating questionnaire, and a clinical interview to confirm an ADHD&#xD;
      diagnosis. Eligible participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either betahistine&#xD;
      or placebo on subsequent study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then attend three weekly study visits, starting 1 week after completing&#xD;
      screening. At each visit, participants will receive a dose of either betahistine or placebo.&#xD;
      The dose of betahistine will increase at each visit, starting at 50 mg, then increasing to&#xD;
      100 mg, and then to 200 mg. Participants will be asked to refrain from eating and to drink&#xD;
      only water in the 12 hours prior to study visits. Also at each visit, participants will have&#xD;
      their vital signs measured, complete questionnaires concerning appetite and mood, perform&#xD;
      attention and memory tests, provide several blood samples, undergo an EKG test, and perform a&#xD;
      breathing test. Some of these tests will be repeated several times over the course of each&#xD;
      study visit. Additionally, at the last study visit, participants will undergo a physical&#xD;
      examination and provide urine samples.&#xD;
