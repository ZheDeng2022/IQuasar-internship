      In this study, we intend to divide the subjects who have been confirmed recurrent HCC into&#xD;
      two groups: Group A: treatment with pure surgery or Group B: treatment with pure radio&#xD;
      frequency. We will compare the non-tumor survival time, long-term survival rate between the&#xD;
      two groups, summarize the merits and demerits of both groups, and try to establish a&#xD;
      standardized therapy and treatment for the this kind of patients through prospective studies&#xD;
      on the molecular biological difference of pathological samples between the first and second&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;

      The recurrence and metastasis of primary liver cancer (PLC) have always been a tough problem&#xD;
      for surgeons. Gu Hong-guang reported the five years recurrence rate in PLC subjects reached&#xD;
      75~100%, among which 60% were discovered within three years after surgeries, with the peak&#xD;
      appearing at 18~24 months. According to a report delivered by Zhong-Shan Hospital, the&#xD;
      recurrence rate of small HCC was 40%, and that of large HCC was 1.9 times of small HCC. Chen&#xD;
      Han agreed that the recurrence rate in 1~2 years reached 71.6%, while in 2~11 years was&#xD;
      28.4%. With the rapid development of iconography and surgical techniques, it is possible for&#xD;
      surgeon to resect the recurrent HCC now. In 1986, Nagasue et al. reported the excision of&#xD;
      recurrent HCC and proved that comparing with non-surgical treatment, subjects with recurrent&#xD;
      HCC excision got a higher survival rate. However, the excision rate of recurrent HCC has&#xD;
      always been an arguable point. Nakajima et al. suggested the excision rate in 133 subjects&#xD;
      was 24%, while Matsuda et al. agreed that in 91 subjects reached 44%, and Zhoo reported that&#xD;
      in 384 subjects was 35%; Kakazu et al. insisted that in 286 subjects was 17%; Nagasue et al.&#xD;
      said that in 290 subjects was 30%; Shoto et al. reported that in 341 subjects was 19% and&#xD;
      Poon et al. advocated that in 244 subjects was 10%. He Sheng summarized the 1295 subjects in&#xD;
      recent five years, and only 106 of them had the opportunities to have excision again (8.18%).&#xD;
      Sugimachi, Minagawa et al. reported separately the 5 year survival rate in recurrent HCC&#xD;
      subjects were 47.5% and 56.0%, which showed no significant difference with the first&#xD;
      surgeries, but better therapeutic effects, meanwhile, third and forth surgeries could also&#xD;
      get similar survival rate, which indicated that surgical excision is a vital treatment in&#xD;
      recurrent HCCs. Chen Han in our hospital reported the first, third, fifth, and tenth year&#xD;
      survival rate in 162 recurrent HCC subjects who underwent first surgical treatment were&#xD;
      separately 96.8%, 66.7%, 43.6% and 21.8%; while that in subjects who received second surgical&#xD;
      treatment were separately 94.7%, 44.9% and 25.0% at the first, third, and fifth year (mean&#xD;
      survival time was 45 months, and average survival time was 54 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we intend to divide the subjects who have been confirmed recurrent HCC into&#xD;
      two groups: Group A: treatment with pure surgery or Group B: treatment with pure radio&#xD;
      frequency. We will compare the non-tumor survival time, long-term survival rate between the&#xD;
      two groups, summarize the merits and demerits of both groups, and try to establish a&#xD;
      standardized therapy and treatment for the this kind of patients through prospective studies&#xD;
      on the molecular biological difference of pathological samples between the first and second&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;
