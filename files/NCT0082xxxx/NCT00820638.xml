      Hypothesis Subjects can safely use the Myomo e100 NeuroRobotic System in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety of the device will be measured by the number of unanticipated or significant&#xD;
           device related adverse events reported over a three week period of time. Minor known&#xD;
           risks anticipated from device use are mild muscle soreness and fatigue. These will not&#xD;
           be considered adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives &amp; outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A series of secondary outcome measures will be taken for the reasons listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ ROM in the affected arm will be taken at the elbow, specifically elbow extension and&#xD;
           flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MMT will be taken for the bicep and tricep muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI) will be administered at the&#xD;
                start and end of the study scale to measure changes in functional recovery of the&#xD;
                arm and hand. 4 This is a valid, clinically relevant, responsive functional&#xD;
                assessment of the recovering paretic upper limb and uses bilateral, real-life&#xD;
                items. Successful changes in this test will be defined as a predetermined minimum&#xD;
                increase in scores. This inventory will provide two types of information: 1st&#xD;
                baseline measures of the severity of the individual's impairment and functional&#xD;
                levels. This will help identify which groups of stroke patients are best suited for&#xD;
                this product in the home&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additionally, since the subjects will be practicing specific tasks on the Chedoke&#xD;
                via repetitive task practice it is anticipated that there may be a change in the&#xD;
                Chedoke scores at the end of four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Motor Activity Log, a semi-structured interview for hemiparetic stroke patients&#xD;
                will be administered at the study start and end, as well as weekly by the therapist&#xD;
                during the weekly visits to assess the use of their paretic arm and hand (amount of&#xD;
                use [AOU]) and quality of movement [QOM]) during activities of daily living. It is&#xD;
                anticipated that the subject will use the device more each week as the subject is&#xD;
                more acquainted with the device and as tasks become easier. 5&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data will also be captured to determine if subjects are able to be trained to&#xD;
                successfully don, doff, and operate the device via passing a competency exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain in the shoulder, arm, and hand areas will be assessed on a VAS (0-10) weekly&#xD;
                at the therapist visit. It is not anticipated that there will be an increase in arm&#xD;
                pain beyond normal muscle soreness related to increase utilization of muscle fibers&#xD;
                after several months of inactivity.6&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Skin areas on the affected arm will be examined by the therapist at the weekly&#xD;
                visit and noted for redness or skin breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Goal: 6 (completers) subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
           (Goal 15 enrolled to accommodate drop outs and those who may not pass the competency&#xD;
           exam)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Initial training:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will come to the clinic over a period of 5 days, for up to three, 2 hour&#xD;
           sessions each to perform all pre tests, learn how to properly don, operate the device,&#xD;
           and to safely perform a series of home activities. The teaching therapist will determine&#xD;
           the appropriate device settings for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the first session the subject will:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Review and sign the informed consent form 2. Perform all pre and post tests under the&#xD;
           supervision of a therapist 3. Receive an introduction to the device that will include&#xD;
           fitting, basic operation and safety related items to operating the device (i.e.) and&#xD;
           simple flexion and extension tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. The subject will be given a user manual and MAL. He/she will be asked to fill out the&#xD;
           MAL so the therapist can get an idea of what the person can do on a daily basis. The&#xD;
           subject will be asked to be familiar with the user manual. The subject will return in 2&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the second training session the subject and therapist will:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Review donning and doffing the brace 2. Review turning the device on and off 3.&#xD;
           Review safety and the user manual 4. Take a device competency test to ensure the subject&#xD;
           is aware of all safety precautions and basic device operation. If they fail they will be&#xD;
           allowed to come back to Myomo for up to 4 additional visit in order to provide an&#xD;
           opportunity to pass the competency. .&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Next the therapist will program the device specifically to the subject's level of&#xD;
           competency. The subject will be given specific device settings based on their ability to&#xD;
           perform the tasks in table 1 which the therapist feels is the most appropriate for the&#xD;
           patient. The goal of the setting is to provide the subject with assistance with the&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. The subject will be instructed in how to fill out the home user log. 7. The subject&#xD;
           will be provided with the therapist's direct number if any questions related to&#xD;
           operation arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The third through sixth visit will be utilized if the subject requires further&#xD;
           instruction and review.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Initial assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the first training session, the treating therapist will adminster commonly utilized,&#xD;
           non invasive, therapeutic outcome measures. These measures will include but are not&#xD;
           limited to: the subject's range of motion( elbow flexion and extension), manual muscle&#xD;
           strength in the bicep and tricep, functional measures such as: Chedoke Arm and Hand&#xD;
           Activity Inventory (CAHAI), the Motor Activity Log (MAL) and affected arm pain&#xD;
           assessment using the Visual Ananlog Scale.(VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assigned treatment tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
           During 15 sessions, over a period of three weeks, the subjects will then be asked to&#xD;
           perform tasks at home with the device on. The subjects will be asked to perform these&#xD;
           tasks at home for approximately one hour each session. The frequency of sessions will&#xD;
           be: 5 times per week..&#xD;
&#xD;
           After a brief stretching and warm up period, each subject will be asked to perform&#xD;
           muscular re-education and ROM activities. A sample of possible activities put together&#xD;
           by a panel of expert therapists can be found in table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Table 1. # Task Device mode to be used Number of Sets/Reps&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Bend and straighten the elbow while seated (bicep/tricep mode) 3sets/10 reps&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Straighten the elbow and hold 10 seconds while seated (tricep mode) 3 sets/10 reps&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Wall Push Ups/Seated or standing (tricep mode) 3 sets/10 reps&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Bicep curls with a rolling pin (bicep mode) 3 sets/10 reps&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Pick up a box from various heights (bicep mode) 3 sets/10 reps&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Place container on table (focus on straightening the arm) (tricep mode) 3 stes/10&#xD;
                reps&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Steady oneself on a counter top while standing x 20 seconds (tricep mode) 3 sets/10&#xD;
                reps&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Carry an object in hand from place to place (bicep mode) 3 sets/10 reps&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Toss a ball (overhand or underhand) (bicep mode/tricep mode) 3 sets/10 reps&#xD;
&#xD;
            10. Pick up tooth-brush and brush teeth (bicep mode) 3 sets/10 reps&#xD;
&#xD;
            11. Pick up glass (bicep mode) 3 sets/10 reps&#xD;
&#xD;
           The therapist will provide the patient with a work sheet that lists the exercises chosen&#xD;
           from the list above, the mode and settings for the device and the number of sets and&#xD;
           reps that should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Then, after each session the subject will be asked to complete a simple log that tracks&#xD;
           compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If any type of injury occurs when using the device it will be reported by the subject&#xD;
           immediately to the therapist or PI via phone. The incident will be thoroughly documented&#xD;
           using guidelines set in place by the New England IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Weekly therapist visit The patient will return to the research laboratory once a week at&#xD;
           Myomo,Inc. The therapist will then review the home use journal with the subject and&#xD;
           confirm if no adverse events were reported that none occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Final study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The last study visit will include post evaluation report. The research therapist will&#xD;
           take ROM, MMT measurements, administer the MAL,the CAHAI and the VAS for pain. Finally,&#xD;
           a simple questionnaire about the ease of use of the device and satisfaction with use.&#xD;
           Any adverse events since the last visit will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Physician visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any patient who reports upper limb pain, rash, joint swelling, skin changes or skin&#xD;
           injury or any other condition associated with use of the device will be directly&#xD;
           referred to their treating physician by the PI or study therapist via phone and a follow&#xD;
           up letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Event:&#xD;
&#xD;
           An Adverse Event is defined as any injury sustained by the subject during the study&#xD;
           visits. Examples of occurrences that would be considered Adverse Events include but are&#xD;
           not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bruising of arm soft tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Spasms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Shoulder pain&#xD;
&#xD;
           All Adverse Events must be noted in the CRF by marking the Adverse Event check box and&#xD;
           then providing a detailed description of the Adverse Event in the notes section of the&#xD;
           form. In addition to the standard information captured in the CRF, the notes on the&#xD;
           Adverse Event should include information about the specific activity (functional,&#xD;
           exercise, or otherwise) that the subject was engaged with at the time of the event, as&#xD;
           well any relevant circumstances surrounding the event. Any adverse event must be&#xD;
           reviewed by the entire study staff. The adverse event must be reported to the NEIRB in a&#xD;
           timely manner and not more than 72 hours after the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious adverse events must be reported to the NEIRB as soon as possible, but not more&#xD;
           than 24 hours after the event.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female over the age of 18 who experienced no more than one ischemic or&#xD;
             hemorrhagic stroke, at least 6 months ago resulting in hemiparesis in one upper&#xD;
             extremity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Upper extremity Fugl Meyer score &gt;10- - subject must score at least a 10 on the UE FM&#xD;
             at the baseline screening appointment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to Low Tone (Modified Ashworth Score &lt;= 3) If there is too much background&#xD;
             contraction in the arm, the system will be unable to pick up voluntary contraction&#xD;
             from the background noise, and the brace may not be strong enough to counter the&#xD;
             muscle tone. Subject's Modified Ashworth at the screening evaluation score should be &lt;&#xD;
             3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Considered medically stable- medical conditions that are not under control may affect&#xD;
             the subject's ability to participate in treatment sessions safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to participate in 17 one hour treatment sessions and willing to complete the&#xD;
             evaluations- subjects must be willing to attend all evaluation and treatment sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Score &lt; 3 rating of shoulder pain on the visual analog scale (Appendix N) - subjects&#xD;
             must be able to safely tolerate the weight of the brace (about 2 lbs) during treatment&#xD;
             sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brace fits on arm properly and without discomfort (No red marks or discomfort observed&#xD;
             in 10 minutes of use)- subjects need to be able to tolerate sessions with the device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is a detectable EMG signal in bicep and tricep and the subject is able to use&#xD;
             the brace volitionally- Some voluntary muscle activity must exist for the system to be&#xD;
             controlled by the subject due to the non-invasive, surface EMG, sensing methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A current medical history of uncontrolled cardiovascular, or pulmonary disease, or&#xD;
             other disease that would preclude involvement in a therapeutic treatment - Subjects&#xD;
             must be able to tolerate a 45 minute upper-extremity therapy session in order to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of neurological disorder other than stroke- other neurological disorders may&#xD;
             affect the upper extremity motor performance of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other significant pain or skin irritation in the upper extremity that would be&#xD;
             exacerbated if by the use of the brace - While wearing the brace, the system is&#xD;
             pressed close to the upper arm and strapped around it. If the subject suffers from&#xD;
             dermal breakdown or other skin conditions that may be aggravated by such a situation,&#xD;
             they should not be involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substantial contracture of elbow - The system cannot work in the presence of reduced&#xD;
             range of motion due to contractures. A substantial contracture is defined as greater&#xD;
             than 20 degrees of elbow flexion contracture measured at the baseline evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe sensory loss: Score of 2 on the NIH stroke scale for sensory impairment. The&#xD;
             system can work on subjects with sensory loss, however the concern is that a subject&#xD;
             with severe sensory loss would not know if the system was applying too much force to&#xD;
             the arm or if a strap was too tight and therefore not be able to inform their&#xD;
             clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of Botox injections in shoulder, arm or hand for the 3 months prior to study start&#xD;
             and throughout the duration of the research study. - the use of Botox may alter the&#xD;
             subject's performance on upper extremity motor tasks that are being assessed in the&#xD;
             research&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive or perceptual deficits sufficiently severe enough to interfere with ability&#xD;
             to follow instructions- If the subject is unable to understand and follow simple&#xD;
             instructions or express if the presence of pain, they should not be included. If the&#xD;
             subject scores &lt;69 on the Modified Mini Mental Exam or, if in the opinion of the&#xD;
             principle investigator the subject can not safely participate in the study, the&#xD;
             subject will be excluded.&#xD;
