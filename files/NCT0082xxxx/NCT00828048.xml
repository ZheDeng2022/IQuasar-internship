      A centralized web-based database will be used to track patients with IPMN lesions of the&#xD;
      pancreas to study natural history and risk factors for malignant transformation in this&#xD;
      multi-center study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMN) are increasingly recognized&#xD;
      in clinical practice. They represent a unique clinicopathologic entity that is characterized&#xD;
      by mucin production, cystic dilation of the pancreatic ducts, and intraductal papillary&#xD;
      growth. The World Health Organization recognized IPMN as a distinct clinical entity in 1996.&#xD;
      Recent literature suggests that up to 45% of IPMN are malignant and should be resected;&#xD;
      however these data are based on larger, primarily symptomatic lesions. Several studies have&#xD;
      been published in the recent literature reporting single-center experience with IPMN&#xD;
      resections and observations with small numbers of patients. The natural history of these&#xD;
      lesions and risk of malignancy is still vague. Consensus guidelines for management of IPMN&#xD;
      were published in 2006, but noted the limited knowledge available in six areas: definition&#xD;
      and classification, preoperative evaluation, indication for resection, method of resection,&#xD;
      histological data on frozen section/positive margins and specimen processing, and finally,&#xD;
      method of follow-up. Speaking to this need, we propose an international registry for&#xD;
      multi-center collaboration in the above areas of need in IPMN research and clinical&#xD;
      management. This will be through a centralized, web-based registry with data entered by each&#xD;
      center in a de-identified way to protect confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected from the IRB approved retrospective chart review IRB# 07-007202 will be&#xD;
      incorporated into this data base. Any patients that participate in the prospective study will&#xD;
      be consented with HIPPA consent prior to collection of data.&#xD;
