      The STARR network registry consists of a 4 spoke 1 hub system. Which will consist of&#xD;
      prospective collection, recording, and regular analysis of telestroke patient consultation&#xD;
      and care data for the purpose of quality measure assessment and improvement and benchmarking&#xD;
      against other national and international telestroke programs.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute stroke resources and care are deficient in Arizona's rural communities. Stroke&#xD;
      telemedicine is a proven modality for overcoming the deficiency. Stroke telemedicine allows a&#xD;
      telephonic consultation and/or two-way audio video consultation between a stroke neurologist&#xD;
      and a stroke patient at a remotely located emergency department. University of California San&#xD;
      Diego Stroke Center has completed an NIH funded randomized controlled trial, STRokE DOC,&#xD;
      comparing telephonic consultations to video consultations. In that trial, video telemedicine&#xD;
      consultations resulted in more accurate decision making compared with telephone&#xD;
      consultations. The video telemedicine consultative modality provides the rural stroke patient&#xD;
      with the opportunity to receive expert stroke care, interpretation of neuroimaging,&#xD;
      determination of appropriate acute therapy, and recommendations regarding need for transfer&#xD;
      to a higher level of care. Mayo Clinic Arizona is currently completing a state funded&#xD;
      feasibility trial, STRokE DOC Arizona (06-005731), as a preliminary step toward establishing&#xD;
      a state wide stroke telemedicine network, STARR. The STARR network plan should include the&#xD;
      prospective collection, recording, and regular analysis of telestroke patient consultation&#xD;
      data for the purpose of quality measure assessment and improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this research is to establish a system for the prospective collection,&#xD;
      recording, and regular analysis of telestroke patient consultation and care data for the&#xD;
      purpose of quality measure assessment and improvement and benchmarking against other national&#xD;
      and international telestroke programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STARR network consists of a primary stroke center hub (Mayo Clinic Hospital) that serves&#xD;
      multiple spoke hospitals in remote and rural regions of the state (e.g. Kingman and Yuma&#xD;
      Regional Medical Centers, La Paz Regional Hospital and Copper Queen Community Hospital). Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic vascular neurologists, who have licenses and privileges to practice teleneurology at&#xD;
      spoke hospitals in the state, participate in a 24/7 Mayo Clinic telestroke hotline. When an&#xD;
      acute stroke patient presents to a STARR network participating spoke hospital emergency&#xD;
      department, a stroke alert is activated and the hotline is phoned. An on-call vascular&#xD;
      neurologist receives the pager notification and communicates with the referring emergency&#xD;
      physician. The telestroke consultation will begin by telephone and will be supplemented by&#xD;
      audio-video telemedicine communication and teleradiology. The patient is registered at Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic and a registration number is generated by the house supervisor. Emergency neurology&#xD;
      care is rendered. Every participating spoke hospital emergency physician is already a&#xD;
      sub-investigator in telestroke research and has completed HSRP training and certification.&#xD;
      The Mayo Clinic IRB has served as the central IRB of record for state funded Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      telestroke research. The patient or legal designate will be approached by either the spoke&#xD;
      emergency physician investigator and/or the hub neurologist investigator (via telemedicine&#xD;
      camera) for consent to proceed with telestroke consultation, and to acquire, store, and&#xD;
      analyze data concerning the acute stroke care and outcome of the patient. Data sources will&#xD;
      include the Mayo Clinic electronic transcribed telestroke consultation note, the emergency&#xD;
      department nursing and physician records, the admission consultation and diagnostic tests&#xD;
      records, hospital discharge note, and the content of a brief 90 day follow-up phone call by&#xD;
      the research coordinator to patient and/or family member. The licensed neurologists already&#xD;
      have authorization to access patient spoke hospital records as part of their clinical&#xD;
      privileges, but the designated Mayo Clinic research coordinator will have the responsibility&#xD;
      to extract data from the sources and enter it into the registry. The STARR registry data&#xD;
      elements will be exactly the same as the established and familiar data elements for the&#xD;
      STRokE DOC Arizona trial, for the purposes of continuity. Mayo Clinic Arizona research&#xD;
      biostatistics group will develop the electronic data manager and conduct and report analyses&#xD;
      monthly to the telestroke research group.&#xD;
