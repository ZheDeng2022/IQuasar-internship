  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a persistent, subjective sense of tiredness, which interferes with a person's&#xD;
      usual ability to function. It is believed to be both the most common and the most distressing&#xD;
      symptom experienced by those with cancer. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there has&#xD;
      been inadequate research into the management of cancer-related fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants are the only class of drug established as being&#xD;
      directly effective in relieving fatigue. Traditional stimulants, such as methylphenidate&#xD;
      (Ritalin), can cause side-effects such as difficulty sleeping at night and anxiety. Modafinil&#xD;
      is a relatively new stimulant with few side-effects. There is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      modafinil can reduce fatigue in healthy individuals and patients with chronic, non-cancer&#xD;
      conditions. No good quality studies have been published evaluating modafinil in patients with&#xD;
      cancer, despite multiple calls for such research to be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have completed a small study to determine the feasibility of undertaking a&#xD;
      larger, high quality study to assess the effect of modafinil on fatigue in patients with lung&#xD;
      cancer. Modafinil appeared to improve fatigue rapidly and was not associated with serious&#xD;
      side-effects. Ten of the fifteen patients who completed the study chose to continue modafinil&#xD;
      long-term. However, the study was too small for definite conclusions to be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This larger, definitive study, funded by a National Cancer Research Institute research award,&#xD;
      will establish more clearly whether modafinil can improve fatigue in patients with lung&#xD;
      cancer. Two hundred and six patients will be recruited from a number of sites across the UK.&#xD;
      Half of the patients will take modafinil, and the other half will take a 'dummy' tablet every&#xD;
      day for a month. The fatigue levels of the two groups will be compared. Confirmation that&#xD;
      modafinil can relieve cancer-related fatigue could have a highly significant impact on the&#xD;
      quality of life of the very large number of patients suffering from this common and&#xD;
      distressing symptom.&#xD;
