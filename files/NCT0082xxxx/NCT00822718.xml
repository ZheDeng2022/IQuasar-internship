    <textblock>
      According to Seoul cancer registry data (2000), cancer became the leading cause of death in&#xD;
      Korea, accounting for 23.9% of all deaths and gastric cancer is the most prevalent malignant&#xD;
      neoplasm, comprising 20.8% of all cancers. Korea and some part of Asian countries have the&#xD;
      highest incidence of gastric cancer in the world. Therefore, gastrectomy became one of the&#xD;
      most common cancer operation in Korea. Thanks to early detection and intervention, the&#xD;
      mortality of early gastric cancer drops dramatically and is now believed to be one of the&#xD;
      most curable diseases among all the cancers. However, after successful operation and the&#xD;
      declaration of cure of the stomach cancer, the patients are left without stomach for all his&#xD;
      remaining life. If the patients lose most of his stomach tissue, there are several problems,&#xD;
      which include loss of reservoir function for food and indigestion. Besides, loss of appetite&#xD;
      is of the paramount importance because the stomach is an important endocrine organ&#xD;
      controlling the appetite via gut-brain axis and the main axis is through a hormone called&#xD;
      ghrelin, the only orexigenic hormone in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because ghrelin is mainly secreted by the fundus and body, operations such as laryngoscopic&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: (LRYGBP), laryngoscopic-adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB)&#xD;
      virtually abolish the ghrelin expressing cells. Thus loss of appetite is an inevitable&#xD;
      consequence. Then what happens of the plasma ghrelin after Billoth surgery (standard gastric&#xD;
      cancer operation) which removes antrum and body of the stomach where ghrelin expressing cells&#xD;
      are relatively less distributed? Also puzzling is the fact that after surgery some patients&#xD;
      start to gain weight while others continue to lose weight and appetite. Are there&#xD;
      ghrelin-expressing cell hyperplasia in the patients who start to gain weight?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gastrectomy operation which is performed at the investigators institute is Billoth I or&#xD;
      II operation. The operation virtually eliminate the half of the body and most of the antrum.&#xD;
      If fundus is involved also, proximal gastrectomy is the operation of the choice. Most of the&#xD;
      patients who have these operations will lose weight during 1-3 months after surgery,&#xD;
      thereafter slowly recover. However, the mechanism of the weight recovery has not been&#xD;
      elucidated so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To elucidate the mechanism of re-gaining body weight and possible ghrelin expressing cell&#xD;
      hyperplasia, the investigators designed the prospective study to investigate the stomach&#xD;
      tissue as well as plasma ghrelin in the patients who are going to have Billoth surgery. The&#xD;
      items to be investigated include plasma for hormones (ghrelin, leptin, insulin, CCK, PYY),&#xD;
      stomach tissue for ghrelin, diet evaluation and body weight (body mass index) changes for 7&#xD;
      months after gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that their study will reveal the valuable information on the body&#xD;
      weight recovery and appetite issue. So far the issue of the stomach cancer patients was&#xD;
      related to survival issue. However, to lead a comfortable life the quality of life is also&#xD;
      very important. The investigators approach will hint the way of surgery which will benefit&#xD;
      the patients to live a happy life.&#xD;

      The below is the items to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diet evaluation: standard three-day diet evaluation table (Dept. of Nutrition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body weight and height: BMI .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ELISA for plasma ghrelin, leptin, insulin, CCK, PYY: whole blood 5 ml in EDTA tube&#xD;
           (sampling time: during fasting, around 8 AM-9 AM if possible)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  two biopsy specimen: the same site. Fundus. One for ELISA and one for IHC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ELISA for tissue ghrelin: frozen in liquid nitrogen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immunohistochemistry for ghrelin producing cell hyperplasia, Paraffin block cutting for&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  gastric cancer patients treated by subtotal gastrectomy (without chemotherapy or&#xD;
             radiation therapy) : Actually the differentiation of EGC or AGC depend on the depth of&#xD;
             invasion. Therefore if the patients are not cachetic because of metastasis or tumor&#xD;
             burden, there is no need toe exclude the AGC patients from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with chemotherapy or radiation therapy diabetes mellitus: It has been&#xD;
             reported that plasma ghrelin is influenced by the insulin. Thus a history of diabetes&#xD;
             exclude the enrollment of the protocol.&#xD;
