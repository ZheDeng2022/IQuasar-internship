    <textblock>
      All patients in the initial cohort were treated with long protocol for ovarian stimulation.&#xD;
      For pituitary down-regulation, patients were treated with daily administration of 0.5 mg&#xD;
      buserelin (suprefact, Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany) from day 21 of menstrual cycle. Buserelin&#xD;
      was reduced to 0.25 mg daily when ovaries were quiescent on ultrasound, and COH was initiated&#xD;
      with recombinant FSH (Gonal F, Serono, Aubnne, Switzerland) 150 IU/day on day 2 of withdrawal&#xD;
      bleeding. Serial ultrasound examinations and evaluation of serum E2 levels were used to&#xD;
      assess ovarian response, and then gonadotropin dose adjustments were done as required. Human&#xD;
      chorionic gonadotropin (pregnyl, Organon, Oss, the Netherlands ) 10,000 IU was administered&#xD;
      when at least two follicles reached a mean diameter of 18 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte retrieval was performed 34-36 hours after hCG administration and conventional&#xD;
      insemination or ICSI was performed as clinically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 187 patients allocated to fresh ET group, ET were performed on the day 2. Embryos were&#xD;
      transferred under ultrasound guidance, with a C.C.D. embryo transfer catheter (Laboratory&#xD;
      C.C.D., Paris, France). Luteal support with progesterone in oil (Progesterone, Aburaihan Co.,&#xD;
      Tehran, Iran) 100 mg daily IM was started on the day of oocyte retrieval and continued until&#xD;
      the documentation of fetal heart activity on ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 187 patients allocated to FET group, cryopreservation of all embryos were undertaken with&#xD;
      vitrification by Cryotop method and after two months, embryos were transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for the Cryotop vitrification of embryos was described previously (Kuwayama et&#xD;
      al., 2005; Kuwayama, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a two-step loading with equilibration solution containing 7.5% (v/v) ethylene glycol&#xD;
      and 7.5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and vitrification solution containing 15% (v/v) ethylene&#xD;
      glycol, 15% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.5 mol/L sucrose, embryos were loaded with a narrow&#xD;
      glass capillary onto the Cryotop in a volume of &lt; 0.1 µL . After loading, almost all the&#xD;
      solution was removed to leave only a thin layer covering the embryos, and the sample was&#xD;
      quickly immersed into liquid nitrogen (LN). Subsequently, the plastic cap was pulled over the&#xD;
      film part of the Cryotop, and the sample was stored under LN. At warming, the protective cap&#xD;
      was removed from the Cryotop while it was still submerged in LN and the Cryotop was immersed&#xD;
      directly into a 37˚C medium containing sucrose. The embryos were then sequentially incubated&#xD;
      in diluents solution before further in vitro culture for transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were prepared for ET with oral E2 to attain endometrial thickness ≥ 8 mm and triple&#xD;
      line pattern on ultrasound scans. At that time, patients were given 100 mg of IM progesterone&#xD;
      in oil daily and ET was preformed three days later under abdominal ultrasound guidance as&#xD;
      described earlier. Oral E2 and progesterone were continued until documentation of fetal heart&#xD;
      activity by ultrasonography.&#xD;
