    <textblock>
      Pityrosporum folliculitis presents as fine superficial follicular pustules and papules on the&#xD;
      trunk and upper extremities. Ketoconazole 2% foam was recently approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      seborrheic dermatitis in immunocompetent patients 12 years and older. Ketoconazole 2% foam is&#xD;
      felt to work by reducing the number of pityrosporum yeast organisms. Safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      ketoconazole 2% foam treatment for this fungal infections has not been established. This&#xD;
      study is to demonstrate efficacy and safety in the treatment of pityrosporum folliculitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malassezia/pityrosporum species is a ubiquitous saprophyte of human skin. This organism is&#xD;
      implicated in the etiology of seborrheic dermatitis, tinea versicolor, and pityrosporum&#xD;
      folliculitis. The prevalence of pityrosporum folliculitis is especially high in warm and&#xD;
      humid environments, although its presence is universal. Pityrosporum folliculitis presents in&#xD;
      immuno-competent, acne-prone young adults as fine superficial follicular pustules and papules&#xD;
      on the trunk and upper extremities. There are no comedones. This acneiform condition is&#xD;
      non-scarring. It causes significant morbidity for patients as it is frequently mistaken for&#xD;
      acne vulgaris with scarring potential, often associated with pruritis, and fails to respond&#xD;
      to adequate conventional acne treatment- systemic antibiotics, topical benzoyl peroxide, and&#xD;
      topical retinoids. Pityrosporum folliculitis can be the sole presenting condition or it can&#xD;
      coexist with acne vulgaris. Less commonly, patients with pityrosporum folliculitis present&#xD;
      with associated tinea versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. The diagnosis is made by clinical&#xD;
      presentation, microscopic examination for the pustule for spores/hyphae, skin biopsy, and&#xD;
      retrospectively following good response to antimycotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketoconazole 2% foam was recently approved for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in&#xD;
      immunocompetent patients 12 years and older. Safety and efficacy of ketoconazole 2% foam&#xD;
      treatment for pityrosporum folliculitis has not been established. Prior to the availability&#xD;
      of the ketoconazole 2% foam, successful treatment of pityrosporum folliculitis required&#xD;
      systemic anti fungal drugs such as ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole. It also&#xD;
      responds to oral isotretinoin. Systemic antimycotics are effective but repeated use of these&#xD;
      drugs incurs safety concerns including hepatotoxicity and drug-drug interactions. Oral&#xD;
      isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodulo-cystic acne and generally is inappropriate as a&#xD;
      routine treatment modality for pityrosporum folliculitis. As pityrosporum folliculitis is a&#xD;
      non-scarring acneiform condition and can be recurrent, effective and safe, patient initiated&#xD;
      topical treatment would be a more appropriate form of therapy.The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to demonstrate that ketoconazole 2% foam may be the treatment of choice for pityrosporum&#xD;
      folliculitis.&#xD;
