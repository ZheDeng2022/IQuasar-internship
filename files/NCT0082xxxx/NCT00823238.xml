      This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of these 2 modes of&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment on BALF inflammation in young, P. aeruginosa-positive CF patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder which is typically fatal during early adulthood,&#xD;
      due to progressive bronchiectasis and respiratory failure. Chronic lung infection with&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa begins in early life and is clearly associated with decline&#xD;
      (especially mucoid phenotypes), making this infection a major target of therapy. The&#xD;
      inflammatory response to infection may also be dysregulated in CF, so that suppression of&#xD;
      airway inflammation is a second major goal of therapy. However, &quot;best practice&quot; for treatment&#xD;
      of Pseudomonas infection in early CF is not defined (several recently published commentaries&#xD;
      available upon request) and is a critical issue currently in clinical management of CF.&#xD;
      Inhaled tobramycin alone has been reported to be effective at short-term eradication of P.&#xD;
      aeruginosa from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) age&#xD;
      3 mo-6 yr, but inflammation was unaffected by this treatment, and recurrence of infection&#xD;
      occurred fairly quickly for mucoid strains. The ideal treatment would result in long-term&#xD;
      reduction in both bacterial quantity and inflammation. Some bacteria in the CF airway may be&#xD;
      both inaccessible to inhaled antibiotics, and &quot;hidden&quot; from BALF, by location in inspissated&#xD;
      secretions, and P. aeruginosa may not be effectively eradicated in paranasal sinuses. Thus,&#xD;
      it is reasonable to hypothesize that treatment with parenteral antibiotics provides better&#xD;
      overall eradication of organisms and consequently reduced stimulus for ongoing or recurrent&#xD;
      inflammation in the airways. We therefore propose a prospective, randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing the effects of these 2 modes of antibiotic treatment on BALF inflammation in young,&#xD;
      P. aeruginosa-positive CF patients.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Positive respiratory culture (sputum, BALF, or deep pharyngeal culture) in the past 3&#xD;
             months for P. aeruginosa. Those who are culture positive for both P. aeruginosa and&#xD;
             additional bacteria (S. aureus, H. influenzae) would also be eligible (but see&#xD;
             microbiologic exclusions below). Children with either first isolate or&#xD;
             chronic/repeated P. aeruginosa infection are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically stable as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. No systemic anti-P. aeruginosa antibiotics in the past 2 mo, and no TOBI in the&#xD;
                  past 1 month;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. No pulmonary exacerbation in the past 1 mo (definition furnished on request); and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. FEV1 â‰¥ 70% predicted (best baseline past 6 months and at study entry) for those&#xD;
                  old enough to reliably test spirometric lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Recent (within past 2 mo) use of systemic anti-Pseudomonas antibiotics, with the&#xD;
             exception of chronic (three times a week) azithromycin;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recent (within past 2 wk) use of systemic anti-inflammatory agents;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Mycobacterial pathogens on AFB smear at initial bronchoscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Multiple-drug resistant (MDR)-P. aeruginosa, or oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA)&#xD;
             on respiratory cultures in the past 3 months. If either MDR-P. aeruginosa, or ORSA are&#xD;
             isolated at the initial bronchoscopy, subjects will be excluded and results discussed&#xD;
             with primary caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Viral pathogens are occasionally isolated from BALF but this may take 2-3 weeks. Thus,&#xD;
             any subjects with this result after initial bronchoscopy will likely have completed&#xD;
             the treatment protocol, but would not undergo bronchoscopy #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of reactions to or problems with anesthesia or sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of reactions to or problems with aminoglycosides (medicines like tobramycin or&#xD;
             gentamicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of hemoptysis (coughing up blood) within 30 days prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of anemia or thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Administration of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of abnormal kidney function (greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             serum creatinine for age).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of documented chronic hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. for children under the age of 3 months, prematurity defined as gestational age &lt; 36&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
