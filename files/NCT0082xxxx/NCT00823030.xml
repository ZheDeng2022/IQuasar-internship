      The purpose of this study is to determine the amount of improvement in bladder function and&#xD;
      pain relief with the administration of 2% alkalinized lidocaine in patients with interstitial&#xD;
      cystitis. Specifically, we want to see if the administration of 2% alkalinized lidocaine&#xD;
      treatments in the bladder improves urodynamic test result values. We hope to enroll&#xD;
      approximately 40 patients in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that the administration of 2% alkalinized lidocaine in the&#xD;
      bladder may improve the bladder's capacity to hold urine and urine flow rates while&#xD;
      simultaneously providing pain relief. As part of standard of care at the Smith Institute of&#xD;
      Urology Pelvic Pain Center, we routinely offer our IC patients 2% alkalinized lidocaine with&#xD;
      follow up urodynamic evaluation. Our research looks to expand upon the prior studies and&#xD;
      confirm the findings of improved bladder function and enhanced pain control of 2% alkalinized&#xD;
      lidocaine versus placebo by performing a second urodynamic evaluation, which is not routinely&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic bladder condition that includes symptoms of bladder&#xD;
      or pelvic pain as well as irritative voiding symptoms (urgency, frequency, nocturia,&#xD;
      dysuria). The syndrome is usually diagnosed clinically after ruling out any possible&#xD;
      infectious or neoplastic causes. Due to the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, the&#xD;
      reported prevalence of IC in the United States varies widely from 35 to 24,000 per 100,000&#xD;
      persons1,2. Regardless, there is no doubt that IC is a source of much distress and profoundly&#xD;
      affects quality of life. IC patients have been reported to have lower quality of life than&#xD;
      dialysis patients. They are 6 times more likely than the general population to cut down on&#xD;
      work time owing to health problems and have higher reported incidences of depression, chronic&#xD;
      pain, anxiety and overall mental health2,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact pathophysiology or etiology of IC is not completely understood but there have been&#xD;
      much advancement in knowledge. The etiology is most likely multifactorial and studies have&#xD;
      shown a role for epithelial dysfunction, inflammatory events as well as neurological&#xD;
      dysfunction [Figure 1]. An initiating event such as infection, trauma, or autoimmune disorder&#xD;
      leads to dysfunctional urothelium4. Activation and upregulation of sensory nerves occurs,&#xD;
      leading to mast cell activation and release of histamine and other mediators5,6. This, in&#xD;
      turn, leads to a cycle of symptoms for the IC patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the multifactorial nature of its pathogenesis, IC treatment is complicated and&#xD;
      involves multimodal treatments that target different factors. Tricyclic antidepressants&#xD;
      control the regulation and activation of the nerves7. Antihistamines target mast cell&#xD;
      activation8 while heparinoids such as pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) or heparin targets&#xD;
      the dysfunction epithelium. Heparin is one of the most commonly used intravesical agent for&#xD;
      the treatment of IC. It has been found to be effective is almost 50% of patients9. While&#xD;
      heparinoid therapy enhances the barrier effect of the disrupted urothelium, it does not&#xD;
      directly target the sensory nerves of the bladder. Hence, it may take more than 2 years of&#xD;
      treatment for severely affected patients to feel any symptomatic relief10. Furthermore, once&#xD;
      symptomatic relief is achieved, it is not sustained for very long11. Urologists aimed to&#xD;
      develop therapy that would directly affect the sensory nerves of the bladder and provide&#xD;
      immediate symptomatic relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of intravesical lidocaine in severe IC was first reported in Sweden in 1989. Asklin&#xD;
      et al., reported on one patient who received repeated intravesical instillations of lidocaine&#xD;
      and achieved much relief13. Success with the treatment was subsequently reported for another&#xD;
      patient in 199214. Surprisingly, there have been very few studies on the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      intravesical lidocaine in IC patients since then. To date, all studies involving intravesical&#xD;
      lidocaine lack randomization or a control group. It is difficult to determine the influence&#xD;
      of any existing placebo effect of intravesical instillations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such study was conducted in 2005 by Parsons et al., which tested the efficacy of heparin&#xD;
      combined with intravesical lidocaine in 47 newly diagnosed IC patients. 75% of patients&#xD;
      reported significant improvement in symptoms after just one instillation with symptomatic&#xD;
      relief lasting at least 4 hours. Significant improvement in symptoms was reported in 94% of&#xD;
      patients who received a second instillation using a higher concentration of lidocaine. Of 20&#xD;
      patients who received a course of 6 instillations over 2 weeks, 80% reported sustained&#xD;
      relief15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Welk and Telchman looked specifically at dyspareunia response to intravesical lidocaine in 23&#xD;
      IC patients. 57% reported resolution of dyspareunia. They also found a significant difference&#xD;
      in response rate between patients with bladder tenderness and patients with multiple tender&#xD;
      locations on vaginal exam (85% versus 29% respectively)16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urodynamic studies performed in IC patients generally demonstrate normal cystometry, although&#xD;
      IC patients have characteristic reductions in bladder capacity secondary to pain and&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to bladder dilation3. In a recent retrospective study, Srinivasan et al&#xD;
      observed that a statistically significant difference was appreciable when comparing pre and&#xD;
      post lidocaine UDS evaluation in bladder capacity, maximum flow rate, and first strong&#xD;
      sensation to void. 12 The impact of alkalinized lidocaine on UDS parameters, however, remains&#xD;
      elusive and deserving of a well designed randomized control trial.&#xD;
