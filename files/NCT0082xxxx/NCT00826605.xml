      The purpose of this study, then, is to search existing clinic and hospital records for&#xD;
      answers to the following two questions: (1) Do pregnant women who are at least 37 weeks&#xD;
      gestation and who have an increase in urubilinogen on urine dipstick at a prenatal&#xD;
      appointment have a statistically significant shorter average time before going into active&#xD;
      labor than their negative counterparts? (2) Do pregnant women who are at least 37 weeks&#xD;
      gestation and who show a modest weight loss between two prenatal appointments have a&#xD;
      statistically significant shorter average time before going into active labor than their&#xD;
      counterparts who did not lose weight?&#xD;

      Rationale/Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a retrospective review of records which examines the possibility of two markers&#xD;
      for the onset of active labor (contractions which result in a change in the uterine cervical&#xD;
      dilatation) on routine clinical prenatal assessment. The markers in question are an elevation&#xD;
      of urobilinogen on routine dipstick and slight maternal weight loss. An apparent clinical&#xD;
      correlation between the presence of urobilinogen, maternal weight loss and onset of active&#xD;
      labor has been observed in our patient population. Our hypothesis is that these markers in&#xD;
      the term gravida are an indication of delivery within a week of their appearance on routine&#xD;
      prenatal evaluation. Should a correlation exist, the clinician would have a relatively&#xD;
      inexpensive way of identifying patients that could deliver within the week and could possibly&#xD;
      predict those patients that would have success with induction, as the normal labor process&#xD;
      may have begun. The purpose of this study, then, is to search existing clinic and hospital&#xD;
      records for answers to the following two questions: (1) Do pregnant women who are at least 37&#xD;
      weeks gestation and who have an increase in urobilinogen on urine dipstick at a prenatal&#xD;
      appointment have a statistically significant shorter average time before going into active&#xD;
      labor than their negative counterparts? (2) Do pregnant women who are at least 37 weeks&#xD;
      gestation and who show a modest weight loss between two prenatal appointments have a&#xD;
      statistically significant shorter average time before going into active labor than their&#xD;
      counterparts who did not lose weight? In humans, the signals that initiate labor are not&#xD;
      completely understood. While many theories have been explored, an exact pathway has not yet&#xD;
      been determined. Urobilinogen is formed from conversion of conjugated bilirubin in the&#xD;
      intestine by bacteria. A fraction of the urobiliogen is then reabsorbed into the bloodstream&#xD;
      and filtered by the kidneys, becoming a colorless component of urine. Normally, only 1-4 mg&#xD;
      of urobilinogen is excreted in the urine per day. Hemolytic processes, hepatocellular damage,&#xD;
      and cholestasis can elevate urobilinogen in the urine. Routine dipstick tests have a normal&#xD;
      urobilinogen range of 0.2 to 1 mg/dl (1). In this study, we will examine the urine dipsticks&#xD;
      for an increased change in the urobilinogen levels within the last two prenatal appointments&#xD;
      prior to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous studies could be located regarding a link between an elevation in urobilinogen&#xD;
      and/or minor maternal weight loss and parturition, labor, onset. There have been studies to&#xD;
      suggest rationale for our clinical observation, however. Estrogens and progesterone both play&#xD;
      a role in the growth and contractility of uterine myometrial cells. Progesterone tends to&#xD;
      promote uterine relaxation, hence the name &quot;pro-gestâ€¦&quot;. In most species, progesterone levels&#xD;
      dramatically fall, a 'withdrawal', prior to the onset of labor. However, in human and higher&#xD;
      level primates, the progesterone and estrogen levels are both elevated in later gestation and&#xD;
      during parturition. The &quot;withdrawal&quot; in humans, therefore, may be mediated by changes in the&#xD;
      myometrial responsiveness to progesterone (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogens induce myometrial contractility. Estriol is the most abundant estrogen during&#xD;
      pregnancy and is produced by the placenta. It first appears at approximately the ninth week&#xD;
      of gestation from the last menstrual period (3). Plasma concentrations of this estrogen&#xD;
      increase throughout gestation along with those of estrone and estradiol (3,4,5). In the weeks&#xD;
      preceding parturition, concentrations of estriol dramatically increase and continue to rise&#xD;
      until birth (6). Estriol's roles include preparing uterine tissues for contraction and&#xD;
      possibly signaling parturition in higher primates and humans (3,4,7,8,9,10). A rise in&#xD;
      estriol, which can be monitored in saliva, has been shown to precede parturition, regardless&#xD;
      of whether labor begins preterm, at term, or postterm (11,12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogens' effect on the liver has been studied extensively. The active transport of biliary&#xD;
      components in the canaliculi is impaired by estrogen (13). The pregnant state can cause some&#xD;
      changes in bile acid production and secretion, presumably due to the higher levels of&#xD;
      estrogen, but also because of progesterone's effect on GI motility. This can lead to a mild&#xD;
      subclinical cholestasis. Studies have shown conflicting evidence as to whether there is an&#xD;
      increase in bile acid levels during pregnancy. As estrogen increases are known to induce a&#xD;
      cholestasis, and urobilinogen levels increase in cholestasis, our hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      increase in estrogen levels within the last week of pregnancy may slow the clearance of bile&#xD;
      even further yielding the rise in urobilinogen levels noticed on routine dipstick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in depth literature review was performed in an effort to find a correlation between&#xD;
      maternal weight loss and the onset of labor. No supporting literature validated or explained&#xD;
      our clinical observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This study will be a retrospective chart review of all eligible patients who&#xD;
      presented to labor and delivery at Oklahoma State University Medical Center between the dates&#xD;
      of January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2006. We selected this particular time period of charts&#xD;
      to review, because they are recent enough to be accessible, and we estimate they will yield&#xD;
      usable data for about 200 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include mothers between the ages of 18 and 34 years of age with a&#xD;
      single intrauterine pregnancy between 37 weeks and 41 weeks gestational age. (Both very young&#xD;
      mothers and women 35 and older have increased risk of premature delivery.) The patients will&#xD;
      have an admission diagnosis of either active labor or spontaneous rupture of membranes.&#xD;
      Active labor is defined as uterine contractions resulting in changes either in the cervical&#xD;
      dilatation, the effacement of the cervix and/or descent of the fetal head in the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will review chart data collected from our obstetrical clinic, OSU Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology, as well as OSU Medical Center records. We will first search the hospital's&#xD;
      records for patients admitted with the diagnosis of active labor. These charts will be&#xD;
      examined for inclusion/exclusion criteria and entered into the study if they are eligible (as&#xD;
      later defined). Once these charts have been obtained, we will then search their corresponding&#xD;
      clinic chart for the defined parameters of our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study population will consist of women between the ages of 18 and 34 who delivered a&#xD;
      single, viable, term infant at OSU Medical Center between January 1, 2002 and December 31,&#xD;
      2006. Gestational age must be greater than 37 weeks and less than 41 weeks, as ascertained by&#xD;
      certain last menstrual period and/or first trimester ultrasound. The chart must include a&#xD;
      diagnosis of active labor or spontaneous rupture of membranes, and the patient must have had&#xD;
      at least two third-trimester prenatal checkups at OSU Houston Center OB/GYN, including one&#xD;
      during the last two weeks of gestation. We will define a term infant as 37 weeks gestation or&#xD;
      greater (3). Our study population will consist of mainly Medicaid patients. The ethnic blend&#xD;
      of our study population will include Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, American Indian,&#xD;
      and Asian women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will exclude women with multiple gestation, because they are at risk of preterm labor. We&#xD;
      will also exclude anyone else who had preterm delivery. In addition, we will exclude women&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis and hepatitis, chronic&#xD;
      hypertension, intraamniotic infection, preeclampsia or its variant, HELLP syndrome,&#xD;
      cholelithiasis, inadequate prenatal care, preterm labor, or induction of labor (other than&#xD;
      due to premature rupture of membranes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Only the investigators will have access to the patients' data collection&#xD;
      sheet. Individual physicians involved in the care of a specific patient will have access to&#xD;
      that patient's information. All individuals will be in compliance with HIPPA guidelines as&#xD;
      set forth by the university and the medical center. Patient records will be locked in a file&#xD;
      cabinet or kept with their regular charts in the patient records department of the OSU&#xD;
      Houston Center OB/GYN clinic. Any information obtained from hospital labor and delivery&#xD;
      charts will be collected by Dr. Harris. It will be directly transported from the hospital to&#xD;
      the clinic only by her, will be kept on her person at all times en route, and will be stored&#xD;
      in a locked folder while in transit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected from the patients' hospital record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Name&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Birthdate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age of patient (years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Medical Record Number (MRN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Gestational age (in weeks and days)/Determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Initial sterile vaginal exam results (normal yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Date and time of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Admission Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Date and time of delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Co-morbidities, pregnancy complications&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Delivery Mode&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Indication for Cesarean Section if applicable Note that it is not possible to determine&#xD;
           the time of onset of active labor, only the time of hospital admission. We are assuming&#xD;
           that most women who go into active, natural labor present to the hospital within 12-18&#xD;
           hours. The day of hospital admission, then, serves as a rough, best estimate for onset&#xD;
           of natural, active labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected from the patients' clinic record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient's Name&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Birthdate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MRN (megawest number)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Date of delivery (from hospital record)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Date of first clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Number of clinic visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Weight on first clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Total pregnancy weight gain&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Date of last clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Weight at that visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Urine dipstick result at that visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Sterile vaginal exam (SVE) (dilation, effacement, station) at that visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Date of Visit prior to last clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Weight at that visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Urine dipstick result at that visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. SVE at that visit&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. Pregnancy Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that after 36 weeks gestation, prenatal visits are scheduled weekly at OSU Clinics.&#xD;
      Therefore, unless the patient is not compliant with routine visits, natural labor for a term&#xD;
      pregnancy will take place no longer than seven days from last clinic visit. No other data&#xD;
      will be collected from any patient charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using PC SAS Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The two components&#xD;
      of the study will be analyzed separately. The weight loss leg of the study will utilize an&#xD;
      independent t-test in an effort to determine the relationship of weight loss (yes/no) to time&#xD;
      to delivery. For the urobilinogen component of the study, we will utilize correlation&#xD;
      techniques to assess the relationship of time to delivery and urobilinogen level.&#xD;
      Significance will be determined at the 0.05 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All records and lab results will be maintained at Oklahoma State University Medical Center,&#xD;
      department of medical records and laboratory storage on the hospital's Meditech system. All&#xD;
      of the documents linking patient names to these numbers and charts will be destroyed after&#xD;
      data collection is complete.&#xD;
