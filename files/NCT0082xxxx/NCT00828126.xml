  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how often using a positron emission&#xD;
      tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan in addition to a standard computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) scan will change the surgical plan in patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have a PET-CT scan performed. The picture&#xD;
      produced by this scan will be compared to a standard CT scan to see if any additional tumors&#xD;
      can be located. If the study doctor thinks that additional tumors are present, a biopsy may&#xD;
      need to be performed to check the status of the tumors. The type of biopsy will depend on&#xD;
      where the tumor(s) are located on the body. If a biopsy is performed, you will sign a&#xD;
      separate consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who decide to take part in this study will be asked if they think they might be&#xD;
      pregnant at the start of the study. Women who are unsure if they may be pregnant or think&#xD;
      that they may be pregnant must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET-CT Scan Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the PET-CT scan is performed, you will be asked to avoid stressful exercise for 24&#xD;
      hours. Starting about 12 hours before the scan, you should eat a high protein diet and limit&#xD;
      the amount of carbohydrates you eat. Starting about 6 hours before the scan, you should not&#xD;
      eat or drink anything other than water (fast) until after the scan is done. You may continue&#xD;
      to take prescribed drugs with water during the fasting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the PET-CT scan, you should wear comfortable clothing, preferably without metal&#xD;
      buttons and/or zippers. You will be asked to remove any metallic objects you have when you&#xD;
      arrive at the PET-CT Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (a few drops from the fingertip) will be collected to check your blood sugar&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A radioactive sugar solution, called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), will be given through a&#xD;
           needle in a vein of your arm. The injection will last about 5 minutes. Following the FDG&#xD;
           injection, you will rest for about 1 hour to allow the FDG to move throughout the body.&#xD;
           You will then be asked to urinate before the scan is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will lie flat on your back on the scanner table. The table will move slowly in and out of&#xD;
      a donut-shaped machine called the PET-CT scanner. This scanner creates a picture that shows&#xD;
      the FDG in the tumor(s) and organs. The scan takes about 45-60 minutes. You will need to lie&#xD;
      as still as possible while the scan is being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over after PET-CT scan has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of your standard of care, your primary care physician may order additional imaging&#xD;
      after your completion of this study for follow-up purposes. The study doctor will review&#xD;
      these images to compare them with the PET-CT images. The study doctors will also review the&#xD;
      results of any biopsies you may have had as a result of PET-CT findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. PET-CT and CT scans are FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available. The PET-CT component of this study is investigational because it is being done&#xD;
      within a certain timeframe (within 30 days after your CT scan) instead of at the timeframe&#xD;
      your doctor would normally decide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 150 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson&#xD;
      Cancer Center (MDACC).&#xD;

        Individuals over 18 years of age with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread to&#xD;
        other parts of the body) and are considered a candidate for surgery based on a&#xD;
        contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) scan.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. AJCC Stage III melanoma with clinically evident (macroscopic) disease, either by&#xD;
             physical examination or on conventional imaging, or AJCC stage IV melanoma with&#xD;
             metastatic site(s) considered surgically resectable. The initial decision regarding&#xD;
             surgical candidacy should be made by surgical oncologist. Patients with indeterminate&#xD;
             CT findings that are larger than 1 cm outside of the field of the potential surgery&#xD;
             will be also included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Contrast- enhanced CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis performed either at MDACC or&#xD;
             outside of the institution should indicate surgical candidacy. Outside CT imaging&#xD;
             studies should be of acceptable quality, as determined by the evaluating radiologist.&#xD;
             PET-CT per protocol must be performed within 30 days from the contrast-enhanced CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. 3. Age &gt;/= 18. All minor patients will be excluded to avoid excessive radiation dose.&#xD;
             There is data suggesting small but statistically significant increased risk for&#xD;
             secondary malignancy due to the cumulative dose of radiation exposure associated with&#xD;
             diagnostic imaging. Children are most sensitive to radiation long term adverse&#xD;
             effects. Therefore current pilot study will accrue adults only. If the result of this&#xD;
             study will indicate potential advantage of PET-CT, this data can be weighted against&#xD;
             radiation exposure risks to decide upon imaging strategies in pediatric patients with&#xD;
             melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Regional disease limited to an involved sentinel lymph node (occult or microscopic&#xD;
             regional nodal metastasis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Availability of prior PET-CT, performed within 60 days of initial clinical&#xD;
             appointment.&#xD;
