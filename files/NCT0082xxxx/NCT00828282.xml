  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to generate a preliminary analysis of this novel therapeutic&#xD;
      approach and laboratory studies for patients with recurrent or refractory CLL. Further, this&#xD;
      pilot trial will demonstrate the feasibility of the translational science methods proposed&#xD;
      for this new collaboration of investigators. The investigators hypothesize that patients with&#xD;
      relapsed CLL are recruitable to this study, that the methods for measuring simvastatin&#xD;
      concentration and target protein translation are feasible, and that the investigators can&#xD;
      efficiently apply the laboratory research methods to patient blood samples before and after&#xD;
      patients have taken the study medication.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
             leukemia (CLL). Criteria for diagnosis are as per the WHO classification of&#xD;
             hematologic tumors (Jaffe 2001). As per the 1996 NCI guidelines for CLL &quot;[second-line&#xD;
             or later] treatment of CLL is generally palliative in intent; therefore, patients who&#xD;
             have relapsed may be followed without therapy until they experience disease-related&#xD;
             symptoms or progressive disease, with deterioration of blood counts, discomfort from&#xD;
             lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent infections, or associated autoimmune&#xD;
             disorders&quot; (Cheson 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of high-dose simvastatin in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status #2 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits unless resulting from&#xD;
                  documented hemolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine ≤ 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatine phosphokinase ≤ 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active infections requiring systemic antibiotics should be excluded&#xD;
             until resolution of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects simvastatin on the developing human fetus at the studied therapeutic dose&#xD;
             are unknown. For this reason and because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain or nervous system disease should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to simvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances known or with the&#xD;
             potential to interact with the CYP3A4 isoenzymes are provided in the appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not take other anti-cholesterol treatments during this study. Patients&#xD;
             who were previously taking anti-cholesterol treatment prior to study entry must be off&#xD;
             the anti-cholesterol medications for 14 days before enrolling on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, diarrhea, myopathy, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are a&#xD;
             drug class with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with simvastatin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with simvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with simvastatin.&#xD;
