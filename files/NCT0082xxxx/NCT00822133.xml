    <textblock>
      Since VAT bears with it severe postopearive pain, and since ketamine has been shown to be an&#xD;
      optimal analgesics adjuvant for postoperative pain, we wish to assess to effects of ketamie&#xD;
      vs. lidocaine if put on the skin in the sites where scopes are interset into the chest for&#xD;
      thoracoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine hydrochlorid is a general anesthetic that is also used as short term sedative.&#xD;
      Ketamine has an antagonistic effect on the central spinal N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)&#xD;
      receptors, the latter modulating pain stimuli generated peripherally on their way to central&#xD;
      pain centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine has been used recently pre-operatively rather than post-operatively. Our recent&#xD;
      experience with pre-operative use of ketamine has not been analyzed yet by Tel Aviv Medical&#xD;
      Center's researchers. However, there is some experience with topical dermal, epidural,&#xD;
      intra-articular and oral usage of ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as we no, there are no reports on patients' subjective feeling when ketamine was given&#xD;
      pre-operatively for postoperative acute pain in patients undergoing partial lung resections.&#xD;
      The possible influence of such an effect on the patient's well-being and the patient's family&#xD;
      feelings and reactions were neither explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to examine the possibility that if ketamine is administered in the&#xD;
      pre-operative period, as a topical ointment, this will induce changes in the patient's&#xD;
      sensation of pain, his own satisfaction, and possibly his family's satisfaction as well. The&#xD;
      basis of this contention is that by administering less morphine (which is given to the&#xD;
      patient in the immediate post-operative period through PCA [Patient-Controlled Analgesia]),&#xD;
      with or without changes in pain, might have positive effects on the patient's well being and&#xD;
      his family's. This issue will be assessed by a verbal questionnaire and based and on a visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of 20 patients each will be enrolled in the study. The first group will receive&#xD;
      a placebo topical paste which will be produced by the hospital pharmacy. The second group&#xD;
      will be given Lignocain paste, and the third group will get ketamine topical paste, prepared&#xD;
      by the pharmacy as well. The study will be double blind and randomized. All patients will be&#xD;
      treated with morphine postoperatively, as mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the amounts of morphine that will be used by the patients&#xD;
      postoperatively by patients treated by ketamine will be reduced as compared to the other&#xD;
      groups. This might increase the patient's and family's satisfaction rates, regardless of the&#xD;
      decrease in the subjective pain ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of this study is that if the contention that is at the basis of this study is&#xD;
      proven true, similar surgical groups of patients will benefit from the addition of topical&#xD;
      ketamine administration to the habitual morphine-used postoperative only analgesia. By doing&#xD;
      so, complications that stem from high doses of morphine will diminish, thus maintain&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability and benefiting from the advantages of a patient being awake,&#xD;
      cooperative and able to feedback the medical personnel in real time about his condition.&#xD;
      Cooperation and satisfaction of the patient and family could be the end result of this&#xD;
      process. Finally, it is assumed that under such conditions the number of complications in the&#xD;
      postoperative period will minimize as well.&#xD;
