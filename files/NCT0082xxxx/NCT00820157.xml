      The aim of this study is to compare the surgical outcomes of cytoreductive surgery followed&#xD;
      by Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) with TACE alone in patients with MNHCC so as to&#xD;
      establish a treatment standard for MNHCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the world's most common malignancies, especially in&#xD;
      East-Asian countries. Hepatic resection has been accepted as the only means of cure for&#xD;
      patients with HCC. The results of hepatic resection for early-stage HCC are&#xD;
      favorable.Nevertheless, the role of surgical resection for multinodular HCC (MNHCC) is less&#xD;
      well-defined.The presence of multiple tumors has been shown to be one of the most significant&#xD;
      independent factors to influence cumulative survival rates in HCC after hepatic&#xD;
      resection.Using the BCLC criteria,liver transplantation provides an alternative curative&#xD;
      treatment option for MNHCC with size ≤ 5 cm in diameter and tumor number &lt;3，but MNHCC beyond&#xD;
      these criteria usually receive palliative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For MNHCC which not suitable for curative treatment, non-surgical and surgical interventions&#xD;
      are available for palliative care.Cytoreductive surgery has the potential to increase the&#xD;
      quality and quantity of survival in patients with advanced HCC. Cytoreductive surgery is&#xD;
      carried out with partial hepatectomy,cryosurgery,microwave coagulation therapy(MCT),or&#xD;
      absolute alcohol injection.It has been shown to prolong survival and provide good symptomatic&#xD;
      relief in patients with good surgical risks in non-randomized studies.Cytoreductive surgery&#xD;
      aims at removal or destruction of all macroscopic tumours, allowing microscopic foci to&#xD;
      persist while preserving as much of the functional liver tissue as possible. The development&#xD;
      of effective local ablative therapy (LAT), such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy,&#xD;
      facilitates reduction of the tumour burden even further during the operation.Cytoreductive&#xD;
      surgery can also be followed by other non-surgical treatments,such as regional therapy or&#xD;
      systemic therapy, to deal with the residual disease or micrometastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the surgical outcomes of cytoreductive surgery followed&#xD;
      by TACE with TACE alone in patients with MNHCC so as to establish a treatment standard for&#xD;
      MNHCC.&#xD;
