  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To show that a structured treatment plan based upon Accu-Chek 360 View has a favorable effect&#xD;
      on physician decision-making and HbA1c for patients on oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) or&#xD;
      insulin for type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Compared to controls, intervention subjects will undergo a greater number of&#xD;
      medication changes and have a lower HbA1 at the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Higher rates of monitoring at entry will be associated with lower CHO&#xD;
      consumption, lower percent body fat, higher medication compliance, and higher physical&#xD;
      activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Patients with lower rates of monitoring at entry will have higher rates of&#xD;
      depression, more likely to have an external locus of control, and express greater fear about&#xD;
      self-testing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary care providers (PCP's) will be randomized to intervention and control arms. Their T2D&#xD;
      patients will be identified by searching computerized pharmacy records for OHA or insulin,&#xD;
      followed until they are on a stable medical regimen, and eligible to participate if their&#xD;
      baseline HbA1c is 7.0 - 9.5% if on OHA or 7.5 - 10.0% if on insulin. Two sample frames will&#xD;
      be created for intervention patients: one of patients on OHA alone and one of patients on&#xD;
      insulin alone or in combination with OHA. The same procedure will be used to develop&#xD;
      corresponding sample frames for control patients. OHA patients will be randomly sampled from&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups at a ratio of 1:1 until 174 subjects have been enrolled.&#xD;
      Insulin patients will be recruited in the same manner until another 174 subjects are&#xD;
      recruited. At entry, patients will have measurements of fat mass, insulin-resistance,&#xD;
      stimulated C-peptide, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of targeted SMBG, provider training, and patient education, all&#xD;
      of which will be focused on normalizing the most significant glucose abnormalities at any&#xD;
      given time. SMBG will alternate between 2 strategies: glucose profiling and target&#xD;
      monitoring. Intervention PCP's will use 360 View to identify a patient's most significant&#xD;
      glucose elevation(s) and devise a treatment plan that includes the medication to be used,&#xD;
      starting dose, dose increment per cycle, interval between dose increases, monitoring times&#xD;
      and frequency, goal for the target, and stop criteria. Separate treatment protocols will be&#xD;
      recommended for OHA patients with basal hyperglycemia, OHA patients with PP hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      insulin patients with basal hyperglycemia, and insulin patients with PP hyperglycemia.&#xD;
      Treatment will conform to current standards of practice as defined by package inserts and&#xD;
      Micromedex, the VA's official on-line drug reference. Subjects will repeat the dose titration&#xD;
      cycle under the guidance of a case manager until the target is reached, maximal recommended&#xD;
      doses of medications are used, or a stop criterion is met. They will then resume glucose&#xD;
      profiling to identify the next target. This process is repeated until all targets reach their&#xD;
      optimal value. Intervention subjects will undergo no less than 4 cycles in 48 weeks. Control&#xD;
      patients will monitor and be treated in the customary manner.&#xD;
