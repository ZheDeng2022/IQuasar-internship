      Patients suffering from migraine will be randomly allocated to one of two different&#xD;
      behavioral interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) an eight week intervention program based&#xD;
           different meditation &amp; yoga techniques and teaching information regarding the&#xD;
           relationship between stress and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  into an active control group teaching three times within eight weeks relaxation&#xD;
           techniques (progressive muscle relaxation PMR) and giving psychoeducation on migraine.&#xD;
           The investigators will measure the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks before&#xD;
           during and after the intervention as well as secondary variables on quality of life and&#xD;
           psychological functioning. The hypothesis is that patients allocated to the MBSR&#xD;
           intervention will reduce the frequency of their migraine attacks compared to the active&#xD;
           control group and compared to their own baseline.&#xD;

      Sixty patients suffering from migraine will be randomly allocated to one of two different&#xD;
      behavioral interventions: (i) mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) an eight week&#xD;
      intervention program based different meditation &amp; yoga techniques and teaching information&#xD;
      regarding the relationship between stress and health. or (ii) into an active control group&#xD;
      teaching three times within eight weeks relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation&#xD;
      PMR) and giving psychoeducation on migraine. The investigator will measure the frequency and&#xD;
      intensity of migraine attacks before during and after the intervention by headache diaries as&#xD;
      well as secondary variables on pain sensation, psychological well being, generic quality of&#xD;
      life, pain regulation, pain acceptance, mindfulness, compliance and satisfaction with the&#xD;
      intervention. The hypothesis is that patients allocated to the MBSR intervention will reduce&#xD;
      the frequency of their migraine attacks compared to the active control group and compared to&#xD;
      their own baseline.&#xD;
