      Title: Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Dose-Escalation Phase I Study of the&#xD;
      Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of a Single Intravenous Dose of ETI-204 (AnthimTM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: This study will determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a&#xD;
      single iv dose of ETI-204 in subjects 18 to 50 years of age. Three cohorts will be studied&#xD;
      sequentially: subjects receiving 120 mg, 240 mg and 360 mg of ETI-204. The study will be&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, and stratified by gender. Each cohort will contain 15 subjects&#xD;
      (including at least four females), twelve who will receive ETI-204 and three who will receive&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives: To determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ETI-204&#xD;
      following a single intravenous administration.&#xD;

      Study Duration: Maximum 70 days for each subject (from enrollment to end of follow-up&#xD;
      period), unless the Day 70 HAHA (human anti-humanized antibodies) is positive, in which case&#xD;
      subjects will be followed until HAHA test results are negative. This does not represent the&#xD;
      total study duration, which is determined by the screening period and enrollment rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Agent: ETI-204 is a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to protective antigen (PA) from&#xD;
      Bacillus anthracis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of Evaluations: Blood for pharmacokinetics (antibody concentration): Predose and at&#xD;
      the following times after the start of infusion: 60 minutes (i.e., at the completion of the&#xD;
      infusion), 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours and on Days 7, 14, 21, 42, 56 and 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis (referred to as safety laboratory assessments in&#xD;
      the schedule of events), and urine drug screen (including ethanol and cotinine at all&#xD;
      visits): Screening, Day 0, immediately pre-dose and on the following days after the start of&#xD;
      infusion: 7, 14, 21, and 42. Urine pregnancy tests for all females will be performed at&#xD;
      screening, baseline, immediately pre-dose and at 42 days. Tests of coagulation and viral&#xD;
      serology tests will be done at screening only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG: A 12-lead ECG will be done at screening. In subjects with acceptable ECG parameters,&#xD;
      continuous 24-h Holter monitoring. will be then performed. After enrollment, a standard&#xD;
      12-lead ECG recording will be performed on study Day 1 (predose, 1.5h, 2h, 4h, 8h and 12h ±20&#xD;
      min) and continuous ECG telemetry monitoring beginning approximately 2 hours prior to the&#xD;
      start of infusion and continuing at least 14 hours after the start of infusion. ECG is also&#xD;
      recorded at the following study Days: 2, 7, 14, 21, and 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of product specific human anti-humanized antibodies (HAHA): Pre-dose and 42 days&#xD;
      after dosing. HAHA positive subjects on Day 42 will be followed bi-weekly until study Day 70&#xD;
      and then monthly until HAHA test results are negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs (BP, P, T, RR): Screening, Day 0, before and at the following times after the&#xD;
      start of the infusion on study day 1: 15, 30, 45, 60, 90±3 minutes; 2h,4h,8h, 12h and 24h±10&#xD;
      minutes (Day 2); Days 7, 14, 21 and 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for Local and Systemic Adverse Events: The infusion site and proximal areas will be&#xD;
      inspected for evidence of erythema, edema, visible or palpable cord, etc. on study days 1, 2,&#xD;
      7, 14, 21 and 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating Sites: The Ohio State University Clinical Pharmacology Unit Columbus, Ohio&#xD;
