      The aim of the study is to compare the hospitalisation period in ORL surgery for two groups&#xD;
      of patients. One of them will be treated for alcohol addiction to weaning them before the&#xD;
      surgery ORL. The other group will be treated with usual methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol, associated or not associated with tobacco, is known to increase the incidence of ORL&#xD;
      cancer. So, in fact many patients perform their ORL surgery operation in spite of their&#xD;
      alcohol addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies showed that a post surgery weaning syndrome increases morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So our study will focuses on the benefits of pre surgery medical weaning program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is an open randomised, prospective study. The patient will be divided in two&#xD;
      groups. In one hand, the first group is designed as &quot;treated&quot; will get alcohol weaning in the&#xD;
      hospital alcohol department. The patient will be hospitalized during one week before the ORL&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this hospitalisation, the patient will receive medicinal treatment, medical follow-up&#xD;
      and psychological counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the other hand, the second group designed as &quot;control group&quot; will be hospitalized directly&#xD;
      in ORL surgery department. The patient will be received a treatment for alcohol weaning&#xD;
      according to their symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their hospitalisation, the treated group will be followed-up regularly for their&#xD;
      alcohol addiction either in support group or in individual counselling. The control group&#xD;
      will be followed-up with the usual method in the ORL surgery department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected result is to improve the care for patients with alcohol addiction and who must&#xD;
      have an ORL surgery reducing the hospitalisation duration, the level of post operative&#xD;
      complication and increasing the abstinence level. 115 patients will be included in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
