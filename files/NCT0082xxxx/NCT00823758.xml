      Introduction to Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a joint collaboration of the Centers for Education and Research on Therapeutics (CERTS) at&#xD;
      The University of Pennsylvania and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, this study proposes to a)&#xD;
      combine detailed but under-utilized existing large datasets and b) collect new primary data;&#xD;
      together, resulting two data resources will advance our ability to describe, study, and&#xD;
      understand the effectiveness and safety of pharmaceuticals received by pediatric patients in&#xD;
      hospitals, and how to improve the safe use of over-the-counter (OTC) acetaminophen in home&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CERTS study is organized into two projects: Project I and Project II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this protocol, the study focus will be Project II-Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project II will seek to qualitatively describe the patterns of use and misuse of&#xD;
      over-the-counter OTC acetaminophen, through information gathered from consumers of various&#xD;
      age groups, as well as professional key informants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project II-Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Qualitatively explore knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices regarding adult and&#xD;
      adolescent self-administration of OTC acetaminophen, and parental administration of OTC&#xD;
      acetaminophen to children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Qualitatively explore experiences and practices of key professional informants, including&#xD;
      physician and pharmacists, with respect to communicating information on the administration&#xD;
      and risks of OTC acetaminophen to consumers and patients.&#xD;

      Individual Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will take part in individual interview session.&#xD;
      The interviews will be conducted by phone and audiotaped (recorded) and transcribed (typed)&#xD;
      by the research staff at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked a series of questions about your knowledge of acetaminophen, views about&#xD;
      the packaging, beliefs about the benefits and risks of taking acetaminophen, and when and how&#xD;
      often you use acetaminophen. You will also be asked about what you have heard from other&#xD;
      people about using acetaminophen and what types of experiences other people that you talked&#xD;
      to about acetaminophen have had. The interview should last about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect your confidentiality, only first names will be used during the interview sessions.&#xD;
      Your name and any identifiable information will be removed when the audio recordings are&#xD;
      typed. The audio recordings will be stored in a password protected file that only the study&#xD;
      chair and research staff will have access to. The audio recordings will be destroyed by the&#xD;
      researchers once study results have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after the interview is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 124 people will be enrolled in this multicenter study. All will be enrolled by M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson research staff. Participants will be recruited from outpatient pediatrics and&#xD;
      primary care clinics at Kelsey-Seybold and Harris County Hospital District.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Group Session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus group session will be led by a trained interviewer. There will also be a research&#xD;
      staff member present. During the focus group sessions, the interviewer will ask the group&#xD;
      questions about acetaminophen, the directions on the packaging, beliefs about the benefits&#xD;
      and risks of taking acetaminophen, and when and how often you use acetaminophen. Each focus&#xD;
      group session should last about 90-120 minutes and will have 6-8 participants. The study&#xD;
      chair will decide which focus group you will participate in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take part in one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents of children less than 8 years old will meet to talk about how acetaminophen is&#xD;
           given to children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults will meet to talk about your beliefs about the benefits and risks of taking&#xD;
           acetaminophen, how you take acetaminophen, and how often you take acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus group sessions will be audiotaped (recorded) and transcribed (typed) by the&#xD;
      research staff at M. D. Anderson. To protect your confidentiality, only first names will be&#xD;
      used during the focus group sessions and names will be coded when typed. The audio recordings&#xD;
      will be destroyed by the researchers once study results have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over when the focus group session is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 124 people will be enrolled in this multicenter&#xD;
      study. All will be enrolled by M. D. Anderson research staff. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from outpatient pediatrics and primary care clinics at Kelsey-Seybold and Harris County&#xD;
      Hospital District.&#xD;
