      Objective of the study is to create and validate Chronic Quality of Life (CQOL) index that&#xD;
      explores habits, career paths and other life choices psoriasis patients make as a result of&#xD;
      coping with their disease that may not be impacted by therapy implemented at a given point in&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The investigators think this data will show that patients who were diagnosed at a young age&#xD;
      will have worse chronic quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a visible disease, psoriasis can be embarrassing and psychosocially stressful in addition&#xD;
      to physically uncomfortable. Patients' lives are affected in physical, psychological, social,&#xD;
      sexual and occupational aspects. These burdens may cause patients to assume maladaptive&#xD;
      habits and coping mechanisms, leading to a downward spiral in functioning within society,&#xD;
      prohibiting patients from achieving their highest potential quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' study goal is to create and validate Chronic Quality of Life (CQOL) index&#xD;
      that explores habits, career paths and other life choices psoriasis patients make as a result&#xD;
      of coping with their disease that may not be impacted by therapy implemented at a given point&#xD;
      in time. In creating this questionnaire and validating it the investigators will collect&#xD;
      preliminary data. The investigators think this data will show that patients who were&#xD;
      diagnosed at a young age will have worse chronic quality of life. In the long run, the&#xD;
      investigators will use the CQOL index in studies in which patients are treated for psoriasis&#xD;
      to determine which treatments can change a psoriasis patient's chronic quality of life. This&#xD;
      information will be used to create guidelines for treatment focused on achieving a patient's&#xD;
      optimal quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another aspect that the investigators would like to look at is the skin carotenoid levels in&#xD;
      the psoriasis population. Previous studies showed that psoriasis patients had lower levels of&#xD;
      skin carotenoids when compared to healthy volunteers. This observation was not statistically&#xD;
      significant perhaps due to a small sample size (21 subjects in the psoriasis group and 35&#xD;
      subjects in the control group). Skin carotenoid levels measurement is optional for study&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
