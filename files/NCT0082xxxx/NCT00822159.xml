  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures mostly occur in elderly people with low bone strength. Bone strength is&#xD;
      determined by bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover, microarchitectural and geometrical&#xD;
      properties of the bone. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard technique to&#xD;
      measure BMD. However, BMD just provides information regarding the quantity of mineral in&#xD;
      bone, which is only one component of bone strength. To date there is no reliable method to&#xD;
      assess bone strength in vivo. Therefore, a method to assess bone strength beyond BMD would&#xD;
      provide additional information regarding the patients' risk of bone related fixation failure&#xD;
      after fracture fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DensiProbe is a new diagnostic device that was developed for intra-operative assessment of&#xD;
      mechanical stability of the bone in the proximal femur. It consists of a drill bit like tool&#xD;
      and an electronic system to measure the peak torque to break-away of trabecular bone in the&#xD;
      femoral head of patients undergoing DHS surgical treatment. In a cadaver study comparing bone&#xD;
      mineral density measured by quantitative computed tomography with bone strength measured by&#xD;
      DensiProbe a high correlation between these two parameters could be shown. In a clinical&#xD;
      pilot study a significant correlation between DensiProbe measurements and BMD measured by DXA&#xD;
      at the femoral neck in patients with hip fractures could be shown. However, no perfect&#xD;
      correlation was expected because DensiProbe measures bone strength, which is only partly&#xD;
      caused by BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone related fixation failure, such as secondary loss of reduction, is influenced by bone&#xD;
      strength, bone mineral density, fracture type, fracture reduction and primary positioning of&#xD;
      the implant. The predictive value of DensiProbe measurements for secondary loss of reduction&#xD;
      needs to be investigated. If DensiProbe turned out to be an effective screening tool for&#xD;
      patients with low bone strength that are on higher risk of the aforementioned complications&#xD;
      these patients may in future benefit from alternative treatment methods (e.g. augmentation&#xD;
      techniques) in order to reduce bone related fixation failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present study is to investigate if bone strength measured by&#xD;
      DensiProbeTM Hip (DensiProbe) is an independent factor to predict secondary loss of reduction&#xD;
      (screw migration of 5 mm or more and / or telescoping of 10 mm or more) in patients with hip&#xD;
      fractures after fracture fixation with DHS.&#xD;

    <description>DensiProbe (CE marked) is a mechanical probe, which is used intra-operatively to assess mechanical stability of the trabecular bone in the proximal femur. It consists of a drill bit like tool and an electronic system for measuring the peak torque to break-away of trabecular bone in the femoral head. DensiProbe measurements are designed to be integrated in the DHS surgical procedure.</description>
