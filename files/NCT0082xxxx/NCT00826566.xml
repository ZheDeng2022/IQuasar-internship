  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays it has become evident that a chronic systemic inflammation is present in patients&#xD;
      suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the nuclear enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase (PARP) as a key&#xD;
      mediator within these systemic inflammatory processes as well as in COPD associated exercise&#xD;
      intolerance and muscle weakness could recently been identified. The attenuating effect of&#xD;
      dietary ingredients with PARP inhibiting activity on systemic inflammation was supported by&#xD;
      data from in vitro and in vivo studies, from other groups as well as from our own lab. We&#xD;
      identified several caffeine metabolites as potent inhibitors of the most abundant&#xD;
      PARP-isoform PARP-1 in-vitro, in animal models as well as in ex-vivo experiments with whole&#xD;
      blood from COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, clinical data with respect to their anti-inflammatory effects in COPD patients are&#xD;
      currently not available for none of these substances. Therefore, the current clinical pilot&#xD;
      study is intended to establish for the first time clinical data (proof of principle) on the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory potential of caffeine metabolites.&#xD;
