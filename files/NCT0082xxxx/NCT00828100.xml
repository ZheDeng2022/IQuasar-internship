      The primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of the investigational&#xD;
      fluID Rapid Influenza Test and the BinaxNOW® Influenza A &amp; B Test in detecting influenza type&#xD;
      A and influenza type B, with respect to fresh nasal wash / aspirate specimens collected from&#xD;
      patients presenting with signs and symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI). Specimens to be&#xD;
      evaluated in this study will be enrolled in a concurrent clinical study per protocol FLU-05,&#xD;
      entitled &quot;Prospective Evaluation of the fluID Rapid Influenza Test&quot;. All subjects enrolled in&#xD;
      the FLU-05 study will have consented to having their samples used in future investigations&#xD;
      involving the fluID Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted during the 2008-2009 influenza season in North America and Hong&#xD;
      Kong, which is anticipated to run from November 2008 to May 2009. Should the influenza season&#xD;
      conclude in North America and Hong Kong prior to the attainment of the minimum target&#xD;
      enrollment specified in the FLU-05 study, study sites in Australia will also be enlisted in&#xD;
      order to enroll subjects; in such a case, enrollment will continue during the 2009 influenza&#xD;
      season in these countries, which is anticipated to run from May through October, 2009.&#xD;

    <description>The fluID™ Rapid Influenza Test is an in vitro diagnostic assay designed to be used with a reader for the qualitative detection of influenza type A and type B nucleoprotein antigens, and the differentiation of influenza type A subtypes A/H1 and A/H3 antigens associated with the seasonal influenza H1N1 and H3N2, in nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal wash/aspirate specimens. The test is intended as an aid in the rapid, qualitative diagnosis of influenza type A and type B viral infections in patients symptomatic with influenza-like illness. The fluID™ Rapid Influenza Test is intended for use by a healthcare professional in a laboratory or Point-of-Care (POC) setting.</description>

    <description>The BinaxNOW Influenza A &amp; B Test is an in vitro immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of influenza A and B nucleoprotein antigens in nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal wash/aspirate specimens. It is intended to aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. Negative test results should be confirmed by culture.</description>
