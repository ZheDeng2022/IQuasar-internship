  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) is a bacterium that causes many painful skin and soft tissue&#xD;
      conditions, such as scalded-skin syndrome, boils, or impetigo. Serious cases may result in&#xD;
      deadly complications but S.aureus can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics. There&#xD;
      are, however, certain strains which cannot be treated with standard antibiotics.&#xD;
      Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one such strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRSA is increasingly being seen in both hospital and community settings, making it a serious&#xD;
      public health issue. People with Atopic Dermatitis (AD), particularly those with a history of&#xD;
      Eczema Herpeticum (EH), may be at greater risk for infection by MRSA. The reason for this&#xD;
      higher risk is unknown but may be linked to extended treatment with staphylococcus&#xD;
      antibiotics in addition to the absence of certain proteins on their skin, which have immune&#xD;
      function. The purpose of this study is to determine the reasons for MRSA infection in AD&#xD;
      participants with and without a history of EH.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of drug-resistant staphylococcal strains was first seen in the US almost a&#xD;
      decade ago, when the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported four fatal community-based&#xD;
      MRSA infections in children. In recent years, MRSA has grown into a serious public health&#xD;
      concern with an increasing number of both hospital-acquired and community-acquired cases&#xD;
      being seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be approximately 130 participants recruited for this trial. The study population&#xD;
      will consist of people with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and people without Atopic Dermatitis&#xD;
      (non-atopic). AD is a skin disorder with an itchy, red skin rash. People with AD are more&#xD;
      likely to get bacterial and viral skin infections, possibly because they lack certain&#xD;
      proteins in their skin, which help the body's immune system to fight infections. AD people&#xD;
      with a history of Eczema Herpeticum (EH) may also be at greater risk for being infected with&#xD;
      MRSA. This could be due to extended treatment courses with staphylococcal antibiotics,&#xD;
      especially because overuse and misuse of antibiotics can lead to bacterial antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance. The precise reasons are unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      reasons for infection in AD participants with and without a history of EH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are seeking to recruit patients with either Methicillin-sensitive&#xD;
      staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) or MRSA bacteria on their skin, so that they may adequately&#xD;
      study potential factors related to MRSA infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will determine if the MRSA collected from people with AD is primarily community&#xD;
      or hospital associated. They will also determine if the proteins on the skin of ADEH+ people&#xD;
      with MRSA differ from the proteins on the skin of AD people with MSSA or people without AD,&#xD;
      or if there are any marked differences in serum total IgE levels between AD subjects with&#xD;
      MRSA, MSSA, or without S. aureus. Approximately 60 ADEH+ and 60 ADEH- participants will need&#xD;
      to be enrolled to find participants with MRSA or MSSA on their skin. Presence of these&#xD;
      bacteria on the skin can only be determined once skin swabs are collected and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are deemed eligible at screening, they will continue on to the study visit,&#xD;
      which will last for approximately 2-3 hours. At the study visit, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to provide information related to their medical history including infection, hospitalization,&#xD;
      and medication record. Additionally, a skin exam will be performed to verify diagnosis&#xD;
      (ADEH-, ADEH+, or non-atopic); nasal and skin swabs samples will be collected; tape&#xD;
      strippings samples will be collected; and a blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
