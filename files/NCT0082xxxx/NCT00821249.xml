  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-phase study during which patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM) or plasma cell leukemia (PCL), who have already received at least two previous&#xD;
      treatments, will receive investigational study drug ARRY-520.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 3 parts. In the first part of the study, Phase 1, patients will receive&#xD;
      increasing doses of study drug, with or without granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)&#xD;
      support, in order to achieve the highest dose possible that will not cause unacceptable side&#xD;
      effects. Approximately 30 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 1 (Active, not&#xD;
      recruiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study, Phase 2, patients will receive the best dose of study drug&#xD;
      determined from the first part of the study and will be followed to evaluate what side&#xD;
      effects the study drug causes and what effectiveness it has, if any, in treating the cancer.&#xD;
      Approximately 30 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2 (Active, not recruiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third part of the study, Phase 2 with Dexamethasone, patients will receive the best&#xD;
      dose of the study drug determined from the first part of the study, in combination with&#xD;
      dexamethasone, and will be followed to evaluate what side effects the combination causes and&#xD;
      what effectiveness the combination has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 50&#xD;
      patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 3 (Active, not recruiting).&#xD;
