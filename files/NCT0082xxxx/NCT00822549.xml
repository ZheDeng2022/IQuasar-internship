    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to improve our knowledge on the pharmacodynamic,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic relationships of morphine administered to relief severe&#xD;
      postoperative pain. The analysis will encompass the efficacy (acute during titration and&#xD;
      subacute during the first 24 hours) and adverse effects of morphine. Our purpose is also to&#xD;
      better characterize the age- and sex-related differences which probably markedly differ&#xD;
      between the two periods (acute vs sub acute).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No previous study attempted to characterize the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic relationships of morphine in the early postoperative period, whereas it is&#xD;
      the main clinical situation for severe pain and a unique model for its study (not possible in&#xD;
      the healthy volunteer). Indeed, intravenous titration of morphine is the first step for pain&#xD;
      control in the postanesthesia care unit. Administration of intravenous boluses of morphine&#xD;
      enables to obtain complete pain relief in 98% of the patients. We intend to study the effects&#xD;
      of morphine (intravenous titration then patient-controlled intravenous administration (PCA)&#xD;
      for 24 hours), perform dosages of plasma concentration of morphine an its main metabolites,&#xD;
      and also study gene polymorphisms coding for main proteins involved in the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic profile of morphine (hepatic metabolism, distribution and elimination,&#xD;
      interaction with morphine receptor). Five hundred patients scheduled for major orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery will be included in this prospective study. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      improve our knowledge on the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      relationships of morphine administered to relief severe postoperative pain. The analysis will&#xD;
      encompass the efficacy (acute during titration and subacute during the first 24 hours) and&#xD;
      adverse effects of morphine. Our purpose is also to better characterize the age- and&#xD;
      sex-related differences which probably markedly differ between the two periods (acute vs&#xD;
      subacute). We consider that this knowledge is important to confirm or not several important&#xD;
      concepts currently used to define the appropriate analgesic regimen to control severe pain in&#xD;
      the postoperative period.&#xD;
