    <textblock>
      Dasatinib and lenalidomide are both prescribed for use in patients with different cancers of&#xD;
      the blood. This study is experimental because neither drug has been approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. There are few standard&#xD;
      treatments when fludarabine is no longer effective in patients with CLL. Some patients have&#xD;
      received additional combination therapy with fludarabine, Campath, bone marrow transplants or&#xD;
      supportive care. Dasatinib and lenalidomide have been effective in high-risk CLL patients in&#xD;
      other pilot mono therapy studies. The combination of dasatinib and lenalidomide has not been&#xD;
      studied in humans before and this study is designed to test whether this combination is safe&#xD;
      to use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLL is an incurable disease with current therapies. Modern chemoimmunotherapies, including&#xD;
      combinations of rituximab and purine nucleoside analogues (fludarabine, cladribine, and&#xD;
      pentostatin), offer the possibility for improved survival, but all patients will eventually&#xD;
      relapse. Patients with relapsed or refractory disease will only experience diminishing&#xD;
      benefits with additional lines of therapy. In addition, patients with high-risk CLL have poor&#xD;
      responses to even first-line therapies. Lenalidomide and dasatinib have non-overlapping&#xD;
      proposed mechanisms of action. Single agent phase II studies with lenalidomide and dasatinib&#xD;
      have demonstrated responses in heavily pretreated and high-risk patients. For these reasons,&#xD;
      we propose to treat patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL to purine nucleoside&#xD;
      analogue therapy with combination lenalidomide and dasatinib.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent including a HIPAA form&#xD;
             according to institutional guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Immunophenotypically confirmed diagnosis of B-CLL, who either have Rai stage III/IV&#xD;
             disease or require treatment for Rai stage I/II disease as defined by criteria based&#xD;
             on the NCI 1996 guidelines (Appendix VII and IX).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Relapsed and/or refractory disease to a purine nucleoside analogue (pentostatin,&#xD;
             fludarabine, or cladribine). Relapse is defined as a patient who has previously&#xD;
             achieved the clinicopathologic criteria for a CR or PR, but after a period of ≥ 6&#xD;
             months demonstrates evidence of disease progression. Refractory is defined as a&#xD;
             patient progressing on therapy or who cannot maintain at least a PR for ≥ 6 months&#xD;
             (Appendix IV). The patient may have had therapy subsequent to receiving a purine&#xD;
             nucleoside analogue, but must also have relapsed or been refractory to this most&#xD;
             recent therapy (Appendix IV).&#xD;

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2 x ULN or ≤ 5 x ULN if hepatic metastases are&#xD;
                  present.&#xD;

             either local therapy (radiation or surgery) or are actively receiving hormonal therapy&#xD;
