  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether improvements in behavior occur in children&#xD;
      with phenylketonuria (PKU) who are taking Kuvan.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little research has been conducted to examine behavior and cognition in children with mild&#xD;
      PKU/hyperphenylalanemia, but there is evidence of reductions in general intelligence (IQ)&#xD;
      (Costello, 1994) and impairments in executive abilities (Diamond, 1994; Gassio, 2005) in this&#xD;
      population. It is important to note that the phenylalanine levels of children with mild PKU&#xD;
      are approximately equivalent to those of children with classical PKU whose phenylalanine&#xD;
      levels have been managed through dietary control. In children with diet-treated PKU,&#xD;
      impairments in behavior and cognition are well-documented, particularly in relation to&#xD;
      executive abilities (Christ, 2006; White, 2001, 2002). Taken together, these findings suggest&#xD;
      that children with mild PKU are at risk for behavioral and cognitive impairments, and it is&#xD;
      possible that these impairments may be mitigated by lowering phenylalanine levels through&#xD;
      treatment with Kuvan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this issue, approximately 20 children with mild PKU from 6 to 18 years of age&#xD;
      (inclusive) and their parents will participate in the study. The behavior and cognition of&#xD;
      children with mild PKU will be assessed using the following methods: (1) Parents will&#xD;
      complete inventories to rate the behavior and cognition of their children; (2) Older children&#xD;
      will complete self-report inventories to rate their behavior and cognition; (3) Cognitive&#xD;
      tasks assessing IQ and executive aspects of attention (i.e., sustained attention and&#xD;
      inhibitory control) will be administered to all children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are two-fold. First, we will determine if behavior and cognition are&#xD;
      compromised in children with mild PKU prior to treatment with Kuvan (baseline). To accomplish&#xD;
      this objective, we will administer measures of behavior and cognition that include normative&#xD;
      data based on age. We hypothesize that children with mild PKU will have ratings and scores&#xD;
      that are ≥ 1 standard deviation from the normative mean. Second, we will determine if&#xD;
      behavior and cognition improve in children with mild PKU following treatment with Kuvan. To&#xD;
      accomplish this objective, we will administer the same measures of behavior and cognition&#xD;
      after 4 and 24 weeks of treatment with Kuvan(4-week and 24-week follow-ups, respectively). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the follow-up ratings and scores of children with mild PKU will improve by ≥&#xD;
      0.5 standard deviation relative to their baseline ratings and scores.&#xD;
