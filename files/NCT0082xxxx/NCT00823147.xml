  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research shows that the immune system is involved in chronic pain. The immune system is&#xD;
      involved in the process of inflammation. The investigators are still learning about the&#xD;
      factors that cause inflammation, but know it can be measured in the blood. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to understand how negative thoughts affect the immune system in women with&#xD;
      chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-study asks subjects to store a blood sample for future research by the PI aimed at&#xD;
      identifying genetic markers in women with chronic pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A main goal of the study is to better understand pain mechanics. Research has linked&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines to the development and progression of pain. Research has also&#xD;
      linked female gender with increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines (relative to males)&#xD;
      following psychological stress. Therefore, we hypothesize that women in the study who&#xD;
      evidence significantly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines following pain catastrophizing&#xD;
      may be at risk for the progression of their pain condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be 60 women having chronic musculoskeletal pain (we will enroll up to 75&#xD;
      persons to account for attrition and screen failures but require the usable data of only 60&#xD;
      women). Based on enrollment rates for our previous study, and given our expanded catchment&#xD;
      area, we expect to enroll 60 persons within approximately 14 months and to complete the&#xD;
      experimental phase of the study within approximately 17 months. The follow-up phase of the&#xD;
      study will continue, for as long as participants agree to be followed for up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized, controlled experiment. Participants are consented and&#xD;
      enrolled under the impression that they will undergo one stress experiment day (lasting about&#xD;
      5.5 hours). However, on their study day we will randomize subjects to either be in the&#xD;
      control group or the catastrophizing (stress) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: The purpose of this visit is to determine eligibility and obtain informed&#xD;
      consent. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed through medical record review, a&#xD;
      screening interview, and a hormonal bloodspot kit. A questionnaire will also be given to&#xD;
      determine level of depressive symptoms and to assess for suicidality. The hormonal bloodspot&#xD;
      kit involves a finger prick and obtaining about 5-6 drops of blood. If lab analysis of this&#xD;
      kit determines abnormal hormonal levels, persons will be excluded from further participation&#xD;
      in the study. Participants will be given a saliva kit to gather 4 saliva samples at home over&#xD;
      the course of one day. Participants will store these saliva samples in their refrigerator.&#xD;
      They will either bring in the kit at the time of their study visit or mail the kit in a&#xD;
      prepaid box given to them (the hormones in the saliva are shelf stable for up to 3 weeks; we&#xD;
      will ask participants to refrigerate the samples if they are not immediately mailing them or&#xD;
      bringing them to the study site. In this way we will best ensure that samples will be&#xD;
      preserved and usable). All participants enrolled in the study will be under the impression&#xD;
      that they will be participating in a catastrophizing experiment during their study day.&#xD;
      However, only half of the participants will actually experience the 10-minute stress&#xD;
      experiment on experiment day. We have included this minor form of deceit in the protocol so&#xD;
      we can control for the anticipatory stress of expecting to experience a negative emotional&#xD;
      experiment. We highlight here that the mild deception will occur for only half the sample&#xD;
      (those going into the control group) and it represents a decrease in risk for these persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit: This study visit is scheduled to occur during the follicular phase of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle (this phase follows the menstrual period and is easy to predict in our sample&#xD;
      of normally menstruating women by using a calendar). If difficulty is encountered in&#xD;
      predicting the date of the follicular phase, participants will call the PI or study&#xD;
      coordinator when their menstrual period begins to schedule their study date (approximately&#xD;
      5-6 days from onset on menses). All participants arrive in a fasting state, during their&#xD;
      follicular phase to control for sex-steroid influences on immunity. 3ml of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn for hormone levels. The hormone level will not be analyzed at this time, but saved&#xD;
      until the end of the study for analysis, if needed. A complete cardiometabolic panel will be&#xD;
      measured via bloodspot. If the subject agrees to take part in the sub study, we will take an&#xD;
      additional 10mL of blood for an extra bloodspot card that we will store for future&#xD;
      pain/genomic research. Pain ratings will be assessed, and questionnaires will be completed.&#xD;
      Standardized meals (with no caffeine) will be served to participants (breakfast, lunch,&#xD;
      snacks). An OCTRI research nurse will place an intravenous catheter into the arm of&#xD;
      participant's choosing. A Holter heart monitor will be placed on participants by nursing.&#xD;
      This is a portable device that measures heart beat. Placement of the leads around the heart&#xD;
      involves cleaning the skin. The monitor will remain affixed for the duration of the study&#xD;
      visit. At this point participants will be randomized to either be in the control group or in&#xD;
      the catastrophizing group using a random number generator. After they are randomized into one&#xD;
      of the two groups, the deception will be revealed to the control group, and its rationale&#xD;
      explained. Those randomized to the stress group will be informed of the deception, and the&#xD;
      rationale for having used it, at the conclusion of the study visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in the control group will have serum measurements taken at the time points listed in&#xD;
      the study activities table below. They will occupy themselves for the next 4.5 hours with&#xD;
      activity options to keep them from sleeping during the study visit, such as reading&#xD;
      magazines, crossword puzzles, or games. We will have these on hand, or they can bring them to&#xD;
      the visit. At each time point, salivary cortisol, heart rate, blood pressure, and pain&#xD;
      ratings will be assessed. At the end of the final blood draw, the IV catheter is removed and&#xD;
      the first study visit is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those persons randomized to the catastrophizing group will undergo a 10min pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing induction following the 25 min post- IV catheterization rest period (we are&#xD;
      also calling this the stress experiment). The PI will guide participants to focus on their&#xD;
      pain, to imagine it worsening in the near future, and to describe how their worsening pain&#xD;
      will affect life domains most important to them. The induction is standardized in the&#xD;
      following ways: 1) duration of induction (10 minutes); 2) imaginal focus on pain worsening in&#xD;
      the near future; 3) participants are guided to describe the anticipated negative consequences&#xD;
      of their pain worsening; 4) participants will be guided to describe the ways in which they&#xD;
      feel helpless while imagining the scenario. Items 2-4 are designed to tap the 3 components of&#xD;
      pain catastrophizing (rumination, magnification of pain, helplessness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain ratings and stress response will be measured via heart rate and blood pressure and&#xD;
      salivary cortisol according to the study activities table below. No bloodspot kits will be&#xD;
      collected during this visit. This study visit ends after the 270min post-induction blood&#xD;
      draw. The PI will debrief subjects and assess their affective state. Free counseling will be&#xD;
      offered before the subject leaves the study visit (only one person in the previous study&#xD;
      opted for the post-study counseling). If anyone in the stress group would like a counseling&#xD;
      referral the PI will provide local options to them. All participants receive a next-day&#xD;
      telephone call to assess for mood state and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term Follow-Up: We have included a separate consent form to allow us to follow subjects&#xD;
      over time. A main goal of the study is to better understand pain mechanics. Research has&#xD;
      linked pro-inflammatory cytokines to the development and progression of pain. Research has&#xD;
      also linked female gender with increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines (relative to males)&#xD;
      following psychological stress. Therefore, we hypothesize that women in the study who&#xD;
      evidence significantly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines following pain catastrophizing&#xD;
      may be at risk for the progression of their pain condition. We expect that if we follow our&#xD;
      sample over time, we will see a trend that will serve as preliminary data to allow us to&#xD;
      investigate this further. While the catastrophizing experiment will provide us with&#xD;
      meaningful data, this longitudinal sub study will allow us to define the clinical and&#xD;
      functional relevance of our findings. For those who consent to this related study, subjects&#xD;
      will be contacted every 6 months for up to 10 years and asked several questions about their&#xD;
      pain, mood, function, and stress levels. They will also be asked to complete 4 questionnaires&#xD;
      including: the Oswestry Disability Index, The CES-D form, and the Perceived Stress Scale.&#xD;
      These questionnaires can be read to the subject over the phone or completed on paper. If the&#xD;
      subject would like to complete them on paper, an address, stamped return envelope will be&#xD;
      provided. They will also be asked if we can contact them again in 6 months.&#xD;
