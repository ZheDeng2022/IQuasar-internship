  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will be assessed for immunologic response to&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccination. Patients with IBD meet criteria as outlined by the Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control (CDC) for pneumococcal vaccination, yet the investigators have found that&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccination in this population is under-utilized. It is unknown whether or not&#xD;
      IBD or IBD-related medications impact the immune response to this recommended vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of 25 patients each will be recruited. The first group will consist of&#xD;
      outpatients with IBD who are receiving infliximab (Remicade TM) while on concommitant&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy (with either 6MP, azathioprine, or methotrexate). This group is&#xD;
      intended to represent a common 'heavily immunosuppressed' patient group with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group will consist of patients with IBD seen in our outpatient clinic who are not&#xD;
      on any immune-suppressive medications. These patients meet CDC criteria for vaccination by&#xD;
      virtue of having a chronic medical illness. The third group will consist of healthy&#xD;
      age-matched (to the first group) controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, patients will be screened with baseline lab tests including&#xD;
      testing for antibodies against pneumococcus. At the baseline visit, patients will also&#xD;
      undergo a brief medical history, physical examination, and assessment of their IBD disease&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will then undergo a one-time intramuscular vaccination with 23-valent&#xD;
      polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax TM). One month later, subjects will return for&#xD;
      a blood draw to assess for response to pneumococcal vaccination.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females over the age of 18 with inflammatory bowel disease; healthy controls&#xD;
             will be age- and sex-matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient must understand and voluntarily sign and informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A history of chronic (greater than 1 month) ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease&#xD;
             diagnosed and documented by the standard clinical, radiographic, endoscopic, and&#xD;
             histopathologic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. (Group 1): Outpatients at CSMC IBD center with IBD who are on maintenance anti-TNF&#xD;
             therapy with infliximab OR ADALIMUMAB plus concomitant immunomodulator therapy (with&#xD;
             either 6MP, AZA, or MTX)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. (Group 2): Outpatients at CSMC's IBD Center with documented IBD who are not on any&#xD;
             immune-suppressive medications. Treatment with oral or topical 5-ASA products,&#xD;
             antibiotics, or probiotics, are permitted.&#xD;
