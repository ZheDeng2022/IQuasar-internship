  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of ARQ 197 administered orally in combination&#xD;
      with sorafenib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is only enrolling patients in the expanded cohorts with hepatocellular carcinoma,&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of an initial patient cohort of 3 or 6 patients will follow the traditional &quot;3 +&#xD;
      3&quot; dose escalation scheme. These patients will be treated with ARQ 197 and sorafenib at Dose&#xD;
      Level 1 (ARQ 197 360 mg BID and sorafenib 200 mg BID). Enrollment of subsequent patient&#xD;
      cohort(s) will depend on the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment in the&#xD;
      initial cohort. If &lt;33% patients treated at Dose Level 1 experience dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity(ies) (DLT) by the end of first treatment cycle (4 weeks), then next cohort of 6&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and treated at Dose Level 2 (ARQ 197 360 mg BID and sorafenib 400&#xD;
      mg BID). If ≥ 33% patients treated at Dose Level 1 experience DLT(s) by the end of first&#xD;
      treatment cycle, the next cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled and treated at Dose Level 0&#xD;
      (ARQ 197 240 mg BID and sorafenib 200 mg BID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional treatment cohorts may be enrolled to explore intermediate, higher or lower doses&#xD;
      of ARQ 197, as indicated by the tolerability, safety profile, and pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-patient dose-escalation from Dose Level 1 to Dose Level 2 may occur in patients&#xD;
      enrolled in Dose Level 1 after they complete at least 1 cycle of treatment without DLT and&#xD;
      other drug-related adverse event that, in the opinions of Investigator and Medical Monitor,&#xD;
      is serious and medically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a safe and recommended dose level is determined, an expanded cohort (Expansion Cohort 1)&#xD;
      of up to 40 patients with either unresectable HCC or advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), for&#xD;
      whom sorafenib is indicated, will be enrolled and treated at this dose level (expansion&#xD;
      portion). Up to 20 patients with unresectable HCC and up to 20 patients with advanced RCC may&#xD;
      be enrolled in this protocol (including patients in dose-escalation cohorts and expansion&#xD;
      cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional expansion cohort (Expansion Cohort 2) of up to 40 patients with breast cancer,&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer or melanoma will be enrolled and treated at MTD/RP2D. Up to 10&#xD;
      patients may be enrolled for breast and non-small cell lung cancer and up to 20 patients with&#xD;
      melanoma (at least 10 of whom must have NRAS mutation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under Amendment #3, newly enrolled subjects with HCC will be given ARQ 197 at 240 mg BID as&#xD;
      starting dose. If a patient with HCC tolerates this starting dose for at least one cycle, the&#xD;
      investigator may increase his/her dose to 360 mg BID.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be treated with ARQ 197 and sorafenib at Dose Level 1 (ARQ 197 360 mg twice daily (bid) and sorafenib 200 mg bid). Patients with HCC will start treatment with ARQ 197 at 240 mg bid and sorafenib 200 mg bid. Enrollment of subsequent patient cohort will depend on the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment in the initial cohort.&#xD;
If &lt; 33% patients treated at Dose Level 1 experience dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (DLT) by the end of first treatment cycle (4 weeks), then next cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled and treated at Dose Level 2 (ARQ 197 360 mg bid and sorafenib 400 mg bid). If ≥ 33% patients treated at Dose Level 1 experience DLT(s) by the end of first treatment cycle, the next cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled and treated at Dose Level 0 (ARQ 197 240 mg bid and sorafenib 200 mg bid).</description>
