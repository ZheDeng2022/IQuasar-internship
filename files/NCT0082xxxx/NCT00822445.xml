    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a Public Health problem, because of the numbers of events&#xD;
      (more than 200,000 per year in France). Craniocerebral tomodensitometry (CCT) is widely used&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of minor/mild TBI, but both the access to the CCT and the cost of this&#xD;
      imagery are critical factors. We hypothesized that the blood level measurement of S100&#xD;
      protein (S100), a neurological biomarker of cerebral injury, would help to the clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of minor/mild head injury events, and would be an economic alternative to CCT for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of these pathologies. In addition, a part of the study will explore the&#xD;
      prognostic value of such blood level S100 determination for the evaluation of medical/social&#xD;
      consequences of minor/mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the contribution of early determination (to medical care) of S100 for the&#xD;
           diagnosis of minor/moderate TBI (TCCMM - Glasgow sup or equal to 9),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the usefulness of a second dosage three hours later for the medical&#xD;
           decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other words, to compare S100 biomarker and CCT considered as a reference ( &quot;Gold&#xD;
      Standard&quot;) for the diagnosis or exclusion of TCCMM, and to precise its terms of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to conduct a cost-effectiveness study of blood level determination of S100 vs. CCT for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of minor/moderate TBI and its medical/social consequences&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nearly two hundred thousand head injury cases (Traumatic Brain Injury - TBI) are reported&#xD;
      each year in France. Less than 5% are severe, defined by a Glasgow score (GCS) above 9.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies indicate that TBI is the fourth leading cause of death and disability&#xD;
      in industrialized countries. Major causes of mild/minor TBI are falls and domestic trauma in&#xD;
      the elderly or children, and sports accidents. The minor/mild brai injury (MBI) may represent&#xD;
      5 to 10% of emergency consultations in the UAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of a head injury is assessed by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and TBI are&#xD;
      divided into three groups: minor (13-15), moderate (9-12) , severe (3-8). Definition of TCC&#xD;
      has considerably evolved over the past 20 years, to take into account the pathophysiologic&#xD;
      lesions secondary is related to systemic factors (hypotension, hypoxia ...) and intracranial&#xD;
      factors ( intracranial hypertension, seizures committals ...). These side events, occurring&#xD;
      within hours or days after the primary injury caused by an impact (contusion, hematoma,&#xD;
      deceleration), increase the morbidity of the initial event, and must therefore be detected&#xD;
      both early and fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of TBI requires imaging data such as craniocerebral tomography (CCT), which&#xD;
      will be renewed after 24 hours and if necessary the following day. Until now, no pertinent&#xD;
      biological marker was proposed to complete the clinical/imagery investigation of&#xD;
      mild/moderate TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100B protein (S100) is a constitutive protein of glial cells, whose physiological functions&#xD;
      are both intracellular, i.e. intracytosolic calcium binding, and extracellular, e.g. by&#xD;
      promoting neuritic proliferation and/or neuronal apoptosis. Due to specificity of its&#xD;
      cellular expression, S100B protein is a useful biological marker of acute neurological&#xD;
      disorders, such as ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke, and traumatic head injury. hemorrhage,&#xD;
      ischemic stroke) or traumatic (TCC). Plasma S100 is significantly increased in subjects with&#xD;
      a major TCC, but also in the majority of minor or moderate TBI. A prognostic value of S100&#xD;
      also was suggested : patients who exhibited medical or social sequelae after several months&#xD;
      after TBI also shoed high plasma levels of S100 in the first hours of the head injury. Such&#xD;
      results of international clinical studies proposed S100 as a biomarker of diffuse brain&#xD;
      injury, and indicate the importance of early determination of plasma concentration of S100&#xD;
      and its integration among the other elements of diagnosis (imaging) for assessing the&#xD;
      severity of trauma and its short and long terms.&#xD;
