      This protocol allows for the treatment of patients, male and female, between the ages of 18&#xD;
      years and 70 years. Patients must have failed to respond to steroid treatment for Grade C-D&#xD;
      acute GVHD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a treatment protocol to provide patients who have failed steroid treatment for acute&#xD;
      GVHD expanded access of Prochymal. It is anticipated that a maximum of 10 patients per month&#xD;
      for a total of 120 patients per year will be treated according to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with Prochymal twice per week at a dose of 2 x 106 human mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cell (hMSC)/kg (actual body weight) for each of 4 consecutive weeks. Infusions will be&#xD;
      administered at least 3 days apart.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years to 70 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is strongly recommended, to exclude patients presenting&#xD;
             with diarrhea or abnormal liver function tests caused by infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed to respond to steroid treatment (methylprednisolone&#xD;
             [≥1mg/kg/day] or equivalent) for Grades C-D acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prochymal must be administered not longer than 14 days after the initiation of&#xD;
             systemic steroid therapy for acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prochymal must be administered either before or at the same time any additional GVHD&#xD;
             therapy is administered&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an adequate renal function as defined by Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
             equation:Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are women of childbearing potential, must be non-pregnant, not&#xD;
             breast-feeding, and use adequate contraception. Male patients must use adequate&#xD;

          -  Patient has stage 3 or 4 liver GVHD, bilirubin &gt;6 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has stage 4 GI-GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any underlying or current medical condition that would interfere with the&#xD;
             evaluation of the patient including uncontrolled infection, sepsis, organ failure, etc&#xD;
             or any medical condition that has a high probability of causing death in less than 30&#xD;
             days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may not receive any other investigational agent (not approved by the FDA for&#xD;
             any indication) concurrently for the duration of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has evidence of a pulmonary infiltrate or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and must&#xD;
             not be likely to require more than 2 liters of oxygen via face mask or an estimated&#xD;
             fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) of 28% via other delivery methods in&#xD;
             order to sustain an O2 saturation of 92% during the next 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a known allergy to bovine or porcine products&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a medical history of a solid tumor disease.&#xD;
