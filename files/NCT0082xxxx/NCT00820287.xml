    <textblock>
      Testis cancer with germ cells is the most frequent cancer of young men and its incidence is&#xD;
      in constant increase in many industrialized countries, as in France. An increased risk of&#xD;
      developing testis cancer has been described in patients with testicular ectopia history and&#xD;
      testicular cancer history (controlateral testicular cancer) and more recently suggested in a&#xD;
      population of hypofertile men with altered spermatogenesis. To a better understanding of this&#xD;
      risk, an attempt of characterization of this group of patients has been proposed in the&#xD;
      present work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of this project is to characterize morphological and molecular markers&#xD;
      of hypofertility which could serve as predictive markers of testis malignant transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project conducted in 3 establishments, the investigators propose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To select a population of hypofertile patients exhibiting compatible clinical and&#xD;
           morphological characters with a high risk of testis tumoral transformation (secretory&#xD;
           azoospermia and/or a history of testicular ectopia. To determine the spermatogenic&#xD;
           arrests on histological criteria (score of Jonhsen).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the expression of four proteins or family of proteins suspected of being&#xD;
           involved in testis tumorogenesis such as: the Placenta Alkaline Phosphatase (PLAPE),&#xD;
           cyclin A1, VASA and connexin (Cx) by immunohistochemistry and by real-time quantitative&#xD;
           RT-PCR analysis real-time analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a possible correlation between the clinical data, spermatogenesis arrest&#xD;
           and the expression of these biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These approaches would allow to identify, in this population of hypofertile patients,&#xD;
      subgroups of men who could develop tumours with germ cells, and subsequently to propose&#xD;
      potential biomarkers for testis cancer. A more clinical observation of these subgroups will&#xD;
      be also proposed.&#xD;
