        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female subjects aged 18 years and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who are able to attend all follow-up visits and who are able to comply with&#xD;
             all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who are willing and able to give written informed consent to take part in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At the Day -7 visit subjects must have a corneal epithelial defect that has persisted&#xD;
             for between 7 days and 14 days, which has a minimum diameter of 2 mm along the&#xD;
             greatest axis, and which has not shown improvement despite conventional treatment such&#xD;
             as tear supplements and bandage contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The original defect to the cornea must have been caused by either alkaline or acidic&#xD;
             agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use of concomitant ocular medications in the screening period that are not specified&#xD;
             in standardized PED treatment regime&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Likely to require the use of concomitant ocular medications that are not specified in&#xD;
             the standardized PED treatment regime during the study follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Decrease or increase in the PED by more than 30% during the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have an active lid or ocular infectious process of any sort&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with corneal perforation or impending corneal perforation&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The circumference affected by limbal blood vessel ischemia is greater than 75% of the&#xD;
             circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with severe lid abnormalities contributory to the persistence of the PED such&#xD;
             as inability to close the lids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with bilateral PED, if the smaller PED has a longest diameter of &gt; 2 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. F&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who have a history of AIDS or HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with any other condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would exclude&#xD;
             the subject from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone) or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive or chemotherapeutic agents within 7 days prior to Day 0, or likely&#xD;
             to receive one of these therapies during study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who have participated in a clinical trial within 30 days prior to Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Diabetics with an HbA1c greater than 6.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Diabetics who are currently prescribed more than one oral medication for their&#xD;
             diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects who have more than one distinct PED in the study eye.&#xD;
