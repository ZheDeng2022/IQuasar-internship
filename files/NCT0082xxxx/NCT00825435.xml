      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard-of-care risk-stratification algorithm (SOC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past 20 years since Goldman et al4 described a clinical algorithm to predict MI in ED&#xD;
      patients, the clinical ability to decrease the false-negative rate for myocardial events has&#xD;
      not improved. Hence, the emergency physician (EP) is compelled to admit to the hospital the&#xD;
      majority of patients who present with acute chest pain for further observation and&#xD;
      investigation due to inconclusive evidence of ACS or MI during the index ED visit;&#xD;
      false-negatives are still sent home with CAD; and false-positives are admitted without CAD;&#xD;
      accounting for a significant consumption of resources every year in the US1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current state of the art for EPs includes clinical data, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and&#xD;
      cardiac biomarkers5 (Fig. 1). The limitations of using the Goldman prediction rule and the&#xD;
      ECG is that they are insensitive indicators of myocardial injury in patients with MI4-9. The&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of cardiac biomarkers is proportional to the time from onset of&#xD;
      chest pain. Cardiac troponin begins to rise within 3-4 hours after the onset of myocardial&#xD;
      injury and may remain increased for up to 4-7 days for cTnI and 10-14 days for cTnT10. There&#xD;
      is enthusiasm for myoglobin as an early marker; however, myoglobin is non-specific11-16 In ED&#xD;
      based trials; cardiac biomarkers have performed well but have not changed the cost and&#xD;
      admission rate (false-positives). In 1999, McCord et al9 published a single center&#xD;
      prospective cohort study that examined point-of-care cardiac biomarkers during the first 90&#xD;
      minutes and if they could help to exclude AMI in the ED chest pain patient. The post-hoc&#xD;
      analysis and resultant negative predictive value (NPV) was 98 to 99% at time 0 minutes, 90&#xD;
      minutes, and 3-hours with various combinations of the three biomarkers including Myoglobin,&#xD;
      Troponin I and CK-MB. These results demonstrated a consistency of negative predictive values&#xD;
      with both combinations of CK-MB with myoglobin equal to Troponin with myoglobin. In 2004,&#xD;
      Fesmire, et al17 reported in another prospective ED cohort study that a 2-hour delta CK-MB&#xD;
      level outperforms myoglobin level in the early identification and exclusion of acute MI and&#xD;
      can effectively risk-stratify patients for 30-day adverse outcomes. In both of these ED based&#xD;
      trials, despite the impressive post-hoc NPV in the McCord et al trial, the cost and admission&#xD;
      rate (false-positives) remains the same since the rule-out MI process requires admission and&#xD;
      24 hours of serial cardiac enzyme testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain undergo the SOC risk-stratification&#xD;
      algorithm to determine the etiology of the complaint (Figure 1). The SOC risk-stratification&#xD;
      initially includes the clinical assessment and an ECG. If the ECG reveals an ST elevation MI&#xD;
      (STEMI) the patient is treated immediately in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. If the&#xD;
      ECG is normal or indeterminate, and there are clinical risk factors, the patient will undergo&#xD;
      cardiac biomarker testing. If the cardiac biomarkers are negative, the patient will then be&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital for further testing. If the cardiac biomarkers are positive, the&#xD;
      patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for further testing. If the clinical&#xD;
      risk factors are absent and the ECG is normal, the patient may be discharged without further&#xD;
      testing4-8, however this is practiced in a small percentage (11%) of patients9. This practice&#xD;
      risk-stratification algorithm continues to be the SOC. However, the combination of the&#xD;
      Goldman predictor risk algorithm (ECG and symptoms) with a Troponin I (cTnI) &lt; 0.3 was not&#xD;
      able to identify a group of chest pain patients at &lt;1% risk for the composite outcome of&#xD;
      death, AMI or revascularization18. Further demonstrating the need for integration of&#xD;
      additional testing that will decrease the false-positive and false-negative rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding nuclear perfusion cardiac testing to the SOC risk-stratification in the ED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have studied adding exercise stress testing and echocardiograms in the ED in&#xD;
      the SOC risk-stratification of acute chest pain. Both the exercise stress test and the&#xD;
      echocardiogram can be enhanced with the addition of nuclear perfusion that can define recent&#xD;
      reduction in arterial flow to specific segments of the myocardium. Due to the known weakness&#xD;
      of exercise testing 19 and the cost of adding nuclear perfusion enhancement to both the&#xD;
      exercise stress test and the echocardiogram, neither study findings have informed the&#xD;
      standard-of-care risk-stratification algorithm20-22. Furthermore, no apriori clinical&#xD;
      research had performed a cost-analysis to confirm the obvious excessive expense of adding&#xD;
      nuclear study in chest pain patients. However, stress testing is considered a worthy test to&#xD;
      include in the risk-stratification algorithm because it is capable of detecting flow limiting&#xD;
      stenosis, though does not establish the presence or absence of coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding non-invasive cardiac imaging: Coronary CT angiography (CTA) to the SOC (CTA + SOC)&#xD;
      risk-stratification in the ED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate decision-making in the low to intermediate-risk subgroup of patients presenting&#xD;
      with acute chest pain requires new tools. We postulate that perhaps the incorporation of&#xD;
      coronary CTA can, by providing an anatomical window that defines the amount of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic burden within the coronary tree, advance the risk-stratification algorithm in&#xD;
      low to intermediate-risk acute chest pain in a cost-effective manner. In recent years, there&#xD;
      has been much interest in noninvasive imaging techniques that allow direct visualization and&#xD;
      assessment of the coronary arteries (Image A). The coronary tree is challenging to image due&#xD;
      to the continuous motion of the coronary arteries. This motion necessitates both high spatial&#xD;
      and temporal resolution. Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) techniques have made&#xD;
      imaging of the coronary arteries possible. The introduction of electron-beam CT (EBCT) in&#xD;
      1984 first allowed for ECG-synchronized imaging of the heart. In 1998, the first multiple&#xD;
      detector spiral CT (MDCT) system with 4 detector rows was introduced, allowing for greater&#xD;
      volume of coverage with each rotation of the CT gantry than EBCT. 23 Since that time, gantry&#xD;
      rotation times have decreased, resulting in improved temporal resolution. An increase in&#xD;
      number of detectors has allowed for sub-millimeter spatial resolution. At this time, 64 slice&#xD;
      MDCT (Image A) is considered the &quot;state of the art&quot; technology for performance of coronary&#xD;
      CTA, although the next generation of scanners, including dual source and 256 slice MDCT are&#xD;
      currently under evaluation. Several small studies in the literature have shown the utility of&#xD;
      coronary CTA in the safe and rapid triage of low to intermediate-risk acute chest pain&#xD;
      patients presenting to the ED24-29. One of the clinical advantages of the coronary CTA is&#xD;
      that, unlike stress testing that can detect flow limiting stenosis but not CAD; it can detect&#xD;
      flow limiting stenosis in addition to the presence or absence of coronary artery disease. The&#xD;
      disadvantage of coronary CTA is the exposure to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple small trials comparing coronary CTA with invasive coronary angiography have&#xD;
      demonstrated sensitivities ranging from 86-99% and specificities ranging from 93-97% for the&#xD;
      detection of hemodynamically significant CAD. The negative predictive value (NPV) of coronary&#xD;
      CTA in these studies was uniformly high, ranging from 95-99%, while rates of non-evaluable&#xD;
      segments were low, ranging from 0-12%23, 30-34. Results of the multicenter, international&#xD;
      CORE-64 trial were discussed at the 2007 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions&#xD;
      evaluating the diagnostic performance of coronary CTA as compared with interventional&#xD;
      coronary angiography in 291 patients with suspected or known CAD and Agatston calcium score&#xD;
      &lt;600. On a per patient basis, the sensitivity and specificity of coronary CTA for detection&#xD;
      of significant CAD were 85% and 90%, while positive and NPV were 91% and 83%35. Moreover, in&#xD;
      2007, Meijboom et al36 reported on the utility of the coronary CTA in symptomatic patients&#xD;
      with low, intermediate, or high estimated pretest probability of having significant CAD. Of&#xD;
      the 254 patients enrolled in the study, the authors determined that all of the patients in&#xD;
      both the low and intermediate-risk groups that were found to not have disease by coronary CTA&#xD;
      were later determined to not have disease by invasive coronary angiography. Patients&#xD;
      presenting to the ED with acute chest pain could potentially undergo more rapid triage with&#xD;
      coronary CTA, speeding diagnosis, lowering hospital and further cost of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional reports on cost-analyses in populations when adding coronary CTA to the SOC&#xD;
      risk-stratification algorithm (CTA + SOC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study by Goldstein et al published in 2007 in Journal of the American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology, the authors reported that ED cost during the index visit was significantly lower&#xD;
      in the group that received the coronary CTA versus the group that did not receive the&#xD;
      coronary CTA. However, this cost difference was primarily due to a decrease in length of stay&#xD;
      in the ED rather than the cost associated with other testing, specifically nuclear imaging.&#xD;
      This cost analysis was limited to the index ED visits alone; since the study was powered for&#xD;
      outcomes, not cost. No additional cost data was gathered, although outcome follow-up was&#xD;
      6-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary cost-outcome data presented at the Chicago 2008 American College of Cardiology&#xD;
      meeting reported that; when including coronary CT calcium scores in the protocol to screen&#xD;
      495 asymptomatic firefighters, researchers were able to effectively triage subjects into&#xD;
      follow-up coronary CTA or send them back to work without further workup, thus, decreasing&#xD;
      cost. In another report presented, researchers concluded that cost was decreased in an&#xD;
      out-patient cardiology clinic by incorporating coronary CTA in the risk-stratification of&#xD;
      cardiac patients leading to reduced need for myocardial perfusion imaging and exercise&#xD;
      treadmill testing over a 6-month period. Moreover, doctors were able to identify more&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and provide more aggressive lipid management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data illustrate how cost and outcome studies are at the forefront of the research that&#xD;
      is measuring and defining the role of coronary CTA. The coronary CTA is so innovative in the&#xD;
      domain of acute chest pain, there is a paucity of published work that looks at the cost;&#xD;
      instead, the majority of the literature examines outcomes and is produced primarily by&#xD;
      cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare cost implications when adding coronary CTA to the SOC (CTA + SOC); and the&#xD;
      coronary CTA demonstrates normal coronary arteries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost implications of potentially discharging patients from the ED that are found to be&#xD;
      free of CAD without further testing are impressive. In May of 2008, data in abstract form&#xD;
      were presented in Academic EM where authors reported good NPV in 568 prospective patients who&#xD;
      received coronary CTA in the ED at 30-days. These reports lacked a description of design,&#xD;
      methodology, and a stated power calculation of an a priori hypothesis. Thus, the need for&#xD;
      more definitive apriori cost and outcome clinical research in the application of coronary CTA&#xD;
      in acute chest pain is warranted. The effect of this work will define and change the clinical&#xD;
      practice landscape when applying this innovation to the cardiac risk-stratification model,&#xD;
      particularly in acutely presenting chest pain. Embracing the incorporation of coronary CTA in&#xD;
      acute chest pain is an innovation that will require well performed clinical trials to define&#xD;
      the patients who will benefit most; whether it should be applied to asymptomatic patients,&#xD;
      low, intermediate, and/or high-risk acute chest pain patients remains the question.&#xD;
