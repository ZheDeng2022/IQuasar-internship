  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renovo, a Biopharmaceutical company involved in the development of drugs to improve the&#xD;
      appearance of scars and enhance wound healing, are proposing to carry out research in&#xD;
      improving the appearance of existing scars that are 2-6 months old using Juvista. Juvista has&#xD;
      not previously been administered to pre-existing scars without surgical revision, but it is&#xD;
      thought that some beneficial effects seen with Juvista in previous trials may also be seen&#xD;
      when administered to existing scars whilst the scar is maturing. This proof of concept study&#xD;
      will therefore investigate the effect of Juvista in Caucasian male and female patients when&#xD;
      administered to scars that are between two and six months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scarring in the skin can vary hugely between individuals; therefore the most reliable way to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of an improvement of scar appearance is to use a model where each patient&#xD;
      acts as their own control. A placebo will also be used for this trial as there are currently&#xD;
      no approved pharmaceuticals for the improvement of scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 patients will be allocated to one of two dosing groups. Patients who enter the&#xD;
      study will have linear scars resulting from broken skin (e.g. trauma, surgery) between 7 and&#xD;
      20cm in length, as well as meeting other specific criteria. The scar to be treated will be&#xD;
      divided into two equal segments. Each segment will receive an intradermal injection of&#xD;
      Juvista or placebo on Day 0 and 24 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measure of change in scar appearance will be performed using colour analysis which will&#xD;
      assess the change in colour between the Juvista treated segments versus the placebo treated&#xD;
      segment of the scar, with reference to the surrounding skin within each patient.&#xD;
