      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a novel non-invasive method for&#xD;
      swallowing disorders detection in geriatrics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interest: swallowing disorders exist at any age. More common among the elderly, their&#xD;
      prevalence is estimated at between 15 and 50% of more than 60 years. Recognized today as a&#xD;
      health problem of particular concern within this population, their pathological consequences&#xD;
      are multiple and severe: inhalation pneumonia, often a complication of &quot;the wrong track&quot;, was&#xD;
      recognized in the USA in 1989, as 5th cause of death among patients aged 65, and the 3rd&#xD;
      leading cause of death of patients over 85 years. Malnutrition facilitates infections by&#xD;
      depression of the immune system and promotes the development of bedsores. The swallowing&#xD;
      disorders resulting in an increase in the prevalence of dehydration, social isolation, but&#xD;
      also an increase in mortality. Faced with such consequences, it is therefore necessary to&#xD;
      have a reliable, non-invasive approach adapted to the fragility of the elderly to detect&#xD;
      these disorders in order to promote preventive strategies and / or curative justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality: This work, which is part of a clinical approach uses a new method of swallowing&#xD;
      study, described in A. Moreau-Gaudry's Medicine thesis : &quot;Assets of the respiratory&#xD;
      inductance plethysmography to the study of swallowing in geriatrics.&quot; The originality of this&#xD;
      lies in the combination of Respiratory Plethysmography by inductance (RPI) to the informatic&#xD;
      tool. The PRI allows continuous recording, thanks to a vest connected to a laptop, the&#xD;
      patient's breathing rate. Readily available at the patient's bedside, it is non-invasive and&#xD;
      perfectly suited to the fragility of the study population. The tool, by its automatic&#xD;
      guarantees objectivity and reproducibility of the analysis of deglutitions from respiratory&#xD;
      signal provided by the RPI.&#xD;
