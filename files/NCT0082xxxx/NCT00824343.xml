    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II trial to study the efficacy and safety of a Cdk inhibitor&#xD;
      P276-00 in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck. Patients with recurrent&#xD;
      or metastatic disease that is unresectable and incurable by radiation will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Thirty eight evaluable patients need to be enrolled in the study. All patients will receive&#xD;
      protocol treatment i.e. P276-00 as an intravenous infusion from day 1 to day 5 and from day 8&#xD;
      to day 12 in each 21 day cycle till progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations by means of recording vitals, physical examination and lab investigations like&#xD;
      hematology and clinical chemistry will be undertaken at regular intervals in each cycle.&#xD;
      Tumor measurements by spiral CT scan will be undertaken at baseline and at the end of every 2&#xD;
      cycles for response evaluation by RECIST criteria. All patients will be followed up for&#xD;
      survival status till one year of cycle 1 day 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      P276-00 was administered at a dose of 185mg/m2/day from day 1 to day 5 in each 21 day cycle.&#xD;
      The protocol was amended in July 2009. As per the amendment P276-00 will be administered at a&#xD;
      dose of 144 mg/m2/day from day 1 to day 5 and from day 8 to day 12 in each 21 day cycle till&#xD;
      progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.33 patients have been recruited in version 1&#xD;
      protocol, 38 more evaluable patients need to be recruited in version 2 protocol. Allowing for&#xD;
      approximately 30% drop-outs, it is estimated that, for enrolling 38 evaluable subjects in the&#xD;
      study, approximately 54 subjects would be enrolled. As the study has already enrolled 33&#xD;
      subjects, the sample size for the study to accommodate for same number of subjects (38&#xD;
      evaluable) in the revised protocol is estimated as approximately 87 (33 + 54) subjects. Hence&#xD;
      the total sample size (accounting for drop-outs) is 87 patients.&#xD;
