  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      nflammatory arthritis (IA) is a major cause of long-term disability. Due to specialist&#xD;
      shortages, failure of primary care providers and individuals to recognize the disease, and&#xD;
      lack of awareness of the importance of early intervention, delays to rheumatologic care are&#xD;
      common. Peer support models have been used for various health issues and may be one method to&#xD;
      assist individuals with early IA to manage their disease and cope with stress. One-on-one&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews will seek out feedback on a peer support approach and explore the&#xD;
      learning needs (informational needs, educational preferences) and opinions about emotional&#xD;
      and appraisal support of individuals living with IA from the perspectives of family and&#xD;
      friends. The data will be analyzed and expressed themes (articulated needs and understandings&#xD;
      of interviewee context) will guide the future development of a peer support intervention.&#xD;

      I. Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory arthritis is one of the most prevalent diseases in Canada, affecting about 10%&#xD;
      of Canadian adults (Health Canada, 2003). It is a leading cause functional disability,&#xD;
      chronic pain, and reduced quality of life, resulting in difficulties at work and at home.&#xD;
      Affected individuals experience general malaise and fatigue, persistent morning stiffness,&#xD;
      and severe joint pain. Also, the course and symptoms of the disease over time are often&#xD;
      unpredictable, making management difficult (Smolen and Aletaha, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no clear etiology for inflammatory arthritis, nor is there a definitive&#xD;
      cure. Existing treatments have been shown to maintain daily function, delay onset of&#xD;
      disability and alleviate pain. These include traditional medical treatment such as&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose oral glucocorticoids, disease&#xD;
      modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biologic agents to control local inflammatory&#xD;
      processes (Altman et al., 2000; American College of Rheumatology, 2002). Although medications&#xD;
      for self-care of patients are important, both educational programs and peer support have&#xD;
      played historic yet vital roles in helping individuals with inflammatory arthritis better&#xD;
      cope with their disease (Penninx et al., 1997; Tucker and Kirwan, 1991)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early treatment is of particular importance for patients diagnosed with inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis. One way to ensure prompt treatment to these patients is to enhance knowledge and&#xD;
      skills of both patients and their caregivers in order to improve decision-making and help&#xD;
      individuals manage disease. Patient education can help individuals and their family members&#xD;
      with patient self-care and prepare them to make decisions regarding their treatment (Koehn&#xD;
      and Esdaile, 2008). Also, better understanding of the relationship between clinical practice&#xD;
      and patient- and family-perceived needs will result in better patient-centered care (Koehn&#xD;
      and Esdaile, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely recognized that peer support plays a key role in the treatment of any disease&#xD;
      (Berkman et al., 2000). These social support groups include the family members and friends of&#xD;
      individuals with disease who can help them with treatment decisions and provide emotional&#xD;
      support while they cope with their disease. In general, having social support leads to&#xD;
      positive impact on quality of life (Savelkoul and de Witte, 2001) whereas lacking high&#xD;
      quality social relationships may lead to anxiety, depression, loneliness, and poor physical&#xD;
      health (Berkman et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is extensive literature exploring both peer support and patient education and their&#xD;
      associations with arthritis. Recent studies have revealed that individuals newly diagnosed&#xD;
      with rheumatoid arthritis look for not only informational support about symptoms and&#xD;
      management, but also emotional support such as having someone or a group to talk to (Radford&#xD;
      et al., 2008). Sherman (2003) reported that peer support provides happiness and boosts&#xD;
      self-esteem in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Patient education has been shown to&#xD;
      increase compliance with leisurely physical activity in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (Mayoux-Benhamou et al., 2008). Group sessions including partners of patients with&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis have led to mixed results regarding the effectiveness of spousal&#xD;
      participation (Martire et al., 2008; van Lankveld W, 2004; Riemsma et al., 2003). Less is&#xD;
      known about the specific educational needs of family members and friends of individuals newly&#xD;
      diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Purpose and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the learning needs of individuals with inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis from the perspective of family members and friends of those with inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis. In particular, this study aims to explore the types of support patients and their&#xD;
      families feel would be most helpful upon diagnosis. Specific objectives of this study&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the learning preferences of family members and friends of individuals who&#xD;
           have inflammatory arthritis, including thoughts about peer support,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify specific informational needs related to managing arthritis, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to explore how learning needs change over time or duration of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives will be addressed through semi-structured interviews of family members and friends&#xD;
      of patients through the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre rheumatology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to meet these objectives, the perspectives of family members and friends of&#xD;
      individuals with inflammatory arthritis will be explored using a qualitative approach. In&#xD;
      particular, semi-structured interviews will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. A. Semi-structured Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with key informants, defined as&#xD;
      individuals who have good knowledge and understanding about the disease of their family&#xD;
      member or friend with inflammatory arthritis and can clearly articulate their knowledge.&#xD;
      These interviews serve as an investigative technique for gathering data in short period of&#xD;
      time and to gain new insight and a broad perspective of views on the research question.&#xD;
      Although the same specific questions will be asked in the same manner with each interview,&#xD;
      the interviewer will be free to alter the order in which questions are asked so that the&#xD;
      interview caters towards each individual research participant. An interview guide (Appendix&#xD;
      A) was developed for the purpose of this study, and an interview notes form (Appendix B) will&#xD;
      be used for interviews. As it is a semi-structured interview approach, certain probe&#xD;
      questions that aim to encourage research participants to elaborate on their responses and&#xD;
      further discussion have not been included in this guide. Such probe questions are&#xD;
      context-dependent and evolve as the interview takes place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed field notes will be recorded during and after each interview, using the interview&#xD;
      notes form (Appendix B) as a guide. Digital recorders will be used to record interviews. All&#xD;
      digital audio files will be transcribed verbatim. All field notes and digital audio files&#xD;
      will be uploaded to NVivo8, a qualitative data management software serving to assist in the&#xD;
      analysis, synthesis, and management of data. Data transcription will be outsourced. A data&#xD;
      transfer agreement will be put in place with Sunnybrook Research Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be interpreted after each interview. Additional questions may be added to the&#xD;
      interview guide for subsequent interviews. Data will be collected until approximately 10 to&#xD;
      15 research participants are interviewed, or until there is enough information gathered such&#xD;
      that saturation of data is obtained - i.e., no new concepts arise from the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each interview is anticipated to last approximately one hour, and will conducted by a&#xD;
      second-year medical student trained by the study coordinator who has expertise in qualitative&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential research participants will be identified for participation in this study based on&#xD;
      the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be a family member or a care-giving friend of an individual diagnosed&#xD;
           with inflammatory arthritis by an established physician;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be aged 18 years or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be able to participate in a 1 hour interview; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be able to understand and converse in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be identified by Dr. Mary Bell (Principal Investigator) through her&#xD;
      rheumatology clinic at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. A flyer (Appendix H) will be given&#xD;
      to the patient by the PI to pass on to their friends or family members which would include&#xD;
      information about the study and how to contact the study team if they are interested in&#xD;
      participating. Upon contacting the study team, Dr. Bell will identify and screen family&#xD;
      members of patients according to the eligibility criteria for the study and will initiate the&#xD;
      informed consent process (Appendix C). Dr. Bell will then introduce the project and review&#xD;
      both an information letter (Appendix D) on the study and a consent form (Appendix C) with&#xD;
      each eligible patient. This will be done to ensure that each potential research participant&#xD;
      understands the purpose of the study and what is being asked of them. When an individual has&#xD;
      verbally agreed to participate, his/her name will be forwarded to the Office Manager at the&#xD;
      clinic who will contact the individual and schedule an interview at Dr. Bell's rheumatology&#xD;
      clinic office with the medical student co-investigator assigned to the project. A&#xD;
      confirmation letter (Appendix E) on a Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre letterhead signed by&#xD;
      Dr. Bell will be mailed to the potential research participant; this will include the time and&#xD;
      location of the interview. One day prior to the scheduled interview, the medical student will&#xD;
      telephone the individual to remind them of the time and location of the interview using a&#xD;
      standardized telephone script (Appendix F). At the beginning of the interview, prior to&#xD;
      asking any questions, the medical student will review the consent form, answer any further&#xD;
      questions the person may have and subsequently obtain written consent from the individual&#xD;
      prior to commencing the interview. Once written consent is obtained, a copy will be provided&#xD;
      to the research participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A constant comparative method (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) will be used to describe learning&#xD;
      needs using open-coding methods. Transcripts from each interview will independently&#xD;
      categorized by two members of the research team. Each team member will first analyze the data&#xD;
      independently before meeting to compare and come to an understanding of common emergent&#xD;
      themes that may arise during interviews. Each transcript will be compared and consensus&#xD;
      reached as to the code to assign a particular unit of text. A coding scheme will evolve as&#xD;
      data analysis progresses and themes will be derived through synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Risks and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known risks associated with this study. Participants of interviews may benefit&#xD;
      from having any questions they may have answered off-the-record before or after interviews.&#xD;
      Potential indirect benefits include improvement in care provided to individuals with&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis, particularly from the perspective of their family members and&#xD;
      friends, and the opportunity to share their experiences with other family members or friends&#xD;
      of individuals with inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Privacy and Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the Principal Investigator and the members of the research team who conduct interviews&#xD;
      will know the identity of research participants. Confidentiality will be ensured by assigning&#xD;
      each research participant a unique identifying number upon agreeing to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The list of names, addresses, and phone numbers corresponding to each study number and&#xD;
      all other identifying information will be kept on password-protected computers on a secure&#xD;
      server in a locked research room. All information obtained during the study will be held in&#xD;
      strict confidence, and any electronic data will be password-protected and stored on a secure&#xD;
      server in a locked research room. No names or identifying information will be used in any&#xD;
      publications or presentations, nor will they be transferred outside researchers in this&#xD;
      study. All hard copies of data will be stored in a locked research room at the Sunnybrook&#xD;
      Health Sciences Centre. Data will be retained for 25 years as stated in the protocol and&#xD;
      informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Compensation&#xD;
&#xD;
      No monetary remuneration will be provided. However, transportation costs will be covered&#xD;
      (e.g., subway tokens, taxi fares, parking) and refreshments will be provided (see Appendix G&#xD;
      for budget).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Communication of Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will be disseminated to research participants. Results will be&#xD;
      communicated to an academic and health professional audience through scientific publications&#xD;
      and presentations of findings. No identifying information will be contained in these reports&#xD;
      or presentations. All results presented will be in keeping with privacy and confidentiality&#xD;
      issues as addressed in section VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A presentation based on findings will be given to second year medical students at the&#xD;
      University of Toronto. Information given within the presentation will be shared with the&#xD;
      course coordinators of the Determinants of Community Health Year 2 course under the Faculty&#xD;
      of Medicine at the University of Toronto. Reports will be made available upon request.&#xD;
