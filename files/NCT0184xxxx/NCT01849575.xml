    <textblock>
      The purpose of VIPVIZA is to assess the impact of pictorial information about asymptomatic&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease to both physician and patient, for improving physicians' adherence to&#xD;
      prevention guidelines and patient perception and understanding of the cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) risk and consequent motivation for prevention. The intervention effect is assessed by&#xD;
      differences between randomization groups in the primaryboutcome Framingham Risk Score (FRS)&#xD;
      and the secondary outcomes the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) as well as changes&#xD;
      in these scores after one, three and six years. Secondary outcomes are also atherosclerotic&#xD;
      disease progression, as assessed by repeated carotid ultrasound examination after three and&#xD;
      six years, as well as the prevalence of acute events and mortality after 10 years . Social,&#xD;
      psychological and cognitive determinants of behavioral change as well as the intervention&#xD;
      impact on novel biomarkers will also be explored.&#xD;

      Project description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to contribute to improved primary prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease through the provision of a visual image and pictorial report of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis while still asymptomatic. The image and report are seen and discussed by both&#xD;
      physician and patient in order to improve guideline adherence and patient perception and&#xD;
      understanding of the CVD risk and consequent motivation for prevention. The specific&#xD;
      objectives include: 1. To assess the prevalence of asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease in&#xD;
      men and women through identification of carotid plaques and measurement of carotid&#xD;
      intima-media thickness (CIMT), and to relate plaques and CIMT to clinically estimated CVD&#xD;
      risk factors and risk scores; 2. To explore the impact of pictorial representations of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis on physicians´ adherence to prevention guidelines, and on individuals'&#xD;
      quality of life, preventive measures, risk factor control and progress of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      disease over the course of three and six years, as well as on premature CVD morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality over the course of 5 and 10 years; 3. To evaluate how individuals' social,&#xD;
      psychological, and cognitive characteristics relate to health behaviours, atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      CVD risk at baseline and progression of any atherosclerosis; 4. To investigate biomarkers in&#xD;
      relation to CIMT and plaques at baseline, changes in conventional CVD risk markers and&#xD;
      lifestyle, and progression of atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey of the field Primary prevention of CVD often fails due to poor adherence among&#xD;
      practitioners and patients to evidence-based prevention guidelines on effective modification&#xD;
      of risk factors by lifestyle change and pharmacological treatment. Contributory factors&#xD;
      include poor communication about the CVD risk by the physician and inaccurate risk perception&#xD;
      among patients. The risk message is usually communicated verbally or numerically, while&#xD;
      potentially more effective visual tools are seldom used. For the clinical assessment of CVD&#xD;
      risk the FRS and the European SCORE are most widely used. However, evidence that their use&#xD;
      translates into reduced CVD morbidity and mortality is scarce. These risk scores focus on&#xD;
      high-risk individuals, despite 60-70% of all CVD events occurring among individuals at low or&#xD;
      intermediate risk for CVD. They might also be too abstract to lead to accurate risk&#xD;
      perception and to motivate individuals to take preventive actions; information alone seldom&#xD;
      results in rational behavior modification. VIPVIZA takes a different approach from current&#xD;
      practice for the prevention of CVD. Instead of being based solely on indirect risk factors,&#xD;
      this project evaluates the atherosclerotic disease itself while it still is subclinical,&#xD;
      providing improved assessment, communication and perception of the CVD risk and hence greater&#xD;
      motivation for prevention. This is achieved with ultrasonography of medium sized arteries&#xD;
      with assessment of CIMT and existing atherosclerotic plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, setting and study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pragmatic randomised open-label controlled trial with blinded evaluators&#xD;
      (PROBE). VIPVIZA is integrated in and added to the ordinary Västerbotten Intervention&#xD;
      Programme (VIP). Individuals with at least one clinical CVD risk factor were invited to the&#xD;
      VIPVIZA trial when they participated in VIP (n=4177), resulting in inclusion of 3532&#xD;
      participants. Baseline visits with ultrasound examinations were carried out from April 29&#xD;
      2013 to June 7 2016. Participants were consecutively and randomly allocated to two groups&#xD;
      (intervention and control group) using a computer-generated randomization list. The&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations in VIPVIZA at baseline as well as after three and six years are&#xD;
      performed at the hospitals in the three cities/towns (Umeå, Skellefteå, Lycksele), and in&#xD;
      remote rural areas at primary health care centres. Risk factor measurements and&#xD;
      questionnaires at follow-up after one, three and six years are carried out for participants&#xD;
      living in Umeå at the Clinical Research Centre at Umeå University Hospital, and for&#xD;
      participants in the rest of the county at their local primary health care center. Both groups&#xD;
      are managed according to clinical guidelines for CVD prevention within primary care (not by&#xD;
      the study team).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention At baseline, pictorial representation of the carotid ultrasound results was&#xD;
      given to each participant in the intervention group and their primary care physician.&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis was presented as vascular age, with a gauge ranging from green through&#xD;
      yellow, orange and red to illustrate the individual's biological age compared to&#xD;
      chronological,age. A red or a green circle, like a traffic light, illustrated detected or no&#xD;
      detected plaque, respectively. Brief written information about atherosclerosis as a dynamic&#xD;
      process that is modifiable by a healthy lifestyle and pharmacological treatment, an&#xD;
      interpretation of the result and general advice on CVD prevention were included. After 2-4&#xD;
      weeks, participants received a follow-up phone call by a research nurse in order to reassure&#xD;
      and give additional information as needed. The same pictorial information was repeated to&#xD;
      participants after 6 months. No information about the ultrasound result was given to the&#xD;
      control group and their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At three- and six-year follow-up both the intervention and the control group participants and&#xD;
      their respective primary care physician receive information about ultrasound results with the&#xD;
      same format as was given to the intervention group at baseline. Thus, the intervention is&#xD;
      completed at the time-point for three-year follow-up. After that the two groups are&#xD;
      continuously followed through registries and compared with respect to atherosclerosis&#xD;
      development and hard outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical risk factors for cardiovascular disease: Measured at the baseline VIP health survey,&#xD;
      at 1-, 3- and 6-year follow-up (blood pressure, lipids, and glucose, BMI and waist&#xD;
      circumference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: The VIP questionnaire covers health, socioeconomic situation, quality of life&#xD;
      (RAND 36), lifestyle (physical activity, tobacco and alcohol consumption, diet), working&#xD;
      conditions, social network. Validated psychometric instruments at baseline and 3-year&#xD;
      follow-up included health literacy, coping strategies, an optimism-pessimism scale,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, HADS and self-rated risk of CVD. Perceptions about preventive medication and a&#xD;
      stress questionnaire at the 3-year follow-up. At 3-year follow-up questions on health&#xD;
      literacy, coping strategies and optimism/pessimism are replaced by questionnaires on&#xD;
      personality and dental care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid ultrasound examinations are performed at baseline, after 3 and6 years according to a&#xD;
      standardized protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews: With subsamples of participants after the first, second and third ultrasound&#xD;
      examination, and with primary care physicians after the first ultrasound examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stored samples of blood to the Medical Biobank: This is done at the baseline VIP visit and at&#xD;
      3- and 6-year follow-up among participants, to be used for analyses of novel biomarkers&#xD;
      Register data: Prescriptions, visits and risk factor measurements from the medical records&#xD;
      system in Västerbotten County. Dental health and dental radiological examinations from Dental&#xD;
      care. The Prescriptions register, Hospitalizations register and Causes of deaths register at&#xD;
      the National Board of Health and Welfare. In addition, physical and psychological functioning&#xD;
      and blood-group at military patterning at age around 18 from the Conscripts registry (for&#xD;
      male participants only), educational level and income from Statistics Sweden and air&#xD;
      pollutants by geographical region in the County of Västerbotten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time plan The study progress is largely according to the plan. Baseline examinations were&#xD;
      conducted April 2013-June 2016, the 1-year follow-up examinations June 2014-August 2017, and&#xD;
      the 3-year examinations September 2016 - June 2019. The six-year follow-up examinations&#xD;
      started December 2019 which is a delay of 6 months due to administrative reasons. Register&#xD;
      data from medical records, Statistics Sweden, the Conscripts register, Air-borne pollutants&#xD;
      are underway April 2020. Data on morbidity and mortality will be retrieved in 2027, i.e. one&#xD;
      year later than 10 years after trial start due to delay until data on events has been entered&#xD;
      into the registries.&#xD;

          <description>Intervention: Information about carotid ultrasound results to the participant and his/her primary care physician. Carotid intima-media thickness was presented as vascular age illustrating the individual's biological compared to chronological age, with a gauge going from green (at least 10 years younger), to yellow, orange or red (at least 10 years older). Plaque formation was a traffic light (green - no plaque, red - plaque). General information about atherosclerosis as a dynamic modifiable process and recommendation to follow clinical guidelines for risk factor control. After 2-4 weeks a follow-up call by a research nurse, to give additional information and reassurance, if needed. Identical information to the study participant is sent by post after 6 months.&#xD;
