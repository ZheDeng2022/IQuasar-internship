    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study (IPV 002ABMG) is to evaluate and compare three doses of IPV, two&#xD;
      doses of IPV plus one bOPV, and one dose of IPV plus two doses of bOPV in order to provide&#xD;
      evidence for better immunization policy making in regions of the world that must switch to&#xD;
      use of IPV/bOPV schedules in the 2014-2015 time frame. The goal is to identify the best&#xD;
      option optimizing humoral immune responses, intestinal immunity and thereby prevent community&#xD;
      transmission as well as preventing VAPP. Specifically, the study seeks to show that both of&#xD;
      the sequential regimens are equivalent (not-inferior) to the 3-dose IPV regimen in the&#xD;
      seroconversion rates to both type 1 and type 3 poliovirus such that not more than 10% of&#xD;
      subjects fall below the 95% confidence interval observed for the 3-dose IPV alone regimen and&#xD;
      the geometric mean titers (GMTs) are no more than 2/3 logs less than those for the 3-dose IPV&#xD;
      regimen. In addition, the study will evaluate by a novel method (poliovirus shedding index),&#xD;
      the adequacy of IPV vaccines in inducing intestinal immunity, specifically by reducing the&#xD;
      shedding of poliovirus type 2 after an OPV challenge. The hypotheses of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 3-dose IPV/bOPV sequential schedule including 1 or 2 doses of bOPV is non-inferior in&#xD;
           terms of types 1 and 3 seroconversion rates and GMTs to a 3-dose IPV schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two and possibly 1 IPV dose(s) provides significant seroconversion rates and GMTs to&#xD;
           type 2 poliovirus and sufficient priming to induce a rapid immune response in the&#xD;
           context of an oral challenge at 7 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three, 2, and possibly 1 dose of IPV will induce intestinal immunity to poliovirus type&#xD;
           2 as measured by a combination of quantity of virus in stools and duration of shedding&#xD;
           (shedding index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these 3 hypotheses, the study will explore the following hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Co-administration of bOPV and rotavirus at 16 weeks of age (the second rotavirus dose)&#xD;
      provides similar antirotavirus IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs compared to subjects&#xD;
      receiving rotavirus vaccine together with IPV.&#xD;

      3.0 STUDY DESIGN This is a multicenter, randomized, unblinded study. Healthy infants&#xD;
      attending the well-child care at outpatient clinics and due for their first dose of polio&#xD;
      vaccines will be eligible for the study. Infants 8 wks ± 7 days of age will be randomized and&#xD;
      allocated to three treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 STUDY POPULATION The study will be conducted in up to 7 &quot;vacunatorios&quot; in Chile. Parents&#xD;
      or legal guardians of healthy infants, who are receiving well-child care at designated&#xD;
      outpatient clinics, will be approached to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 5.1 Vaccines The vaccines to be used in this study include bOPV,&#xD;
      mOPV2, and IPV (see Section 14.2 for package inserts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.1 Bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (bOPV) Produced by Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France, bivalent&#xD;
      OPV vaccine contains types 1 and 3 polioviruses and it is indicated for supplementary&#xD;
      immunization activities in children from 0 to 5 years of age to prevent or contain outbreaks&#xD;
      caused by these 2 serotypes. The vaccine contains at least 6.0 log CCID50 of LS c2ab live&#xD;
      attenuated polio virus type 1; and at least 5.8 log CCID50 Leon I2aIb strain of polio virus&#xD;
      type 3. The vaccine dose is 2 drops (0.1 mL) using a multi-dose dropper vial, given directly&#xD;
      into the mouth. The vaccine should be stored in a freezer at -20°C, and after thawing it can&#xD;
      be stored up to 6 months at refrigerated temperatures of +2 to +8°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 Monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine Type 2 (mOPV2) Monovalent OPV type 2 live attenuated&#xD;
      poliomyelitis virus vaccine (mOPV2) is produced by Glaxo SmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium, as a&#xD;
      sterile suspension of poliovirus serotype 2 for oral administration. Each dose (0.1 mL)&#xD;
      contains not less than 105.0 CCID50 of the Sabin strain type 2 (P 712, Ch, 2ab). This will be&#xD;
      the challenge OPV strain used to assess intestinal shedding and immunity. The vaccine should&#xD;
      be stored in a freezer at -20°C, and after thawing it can be stored up to 6 months at&#xD;
      refrigerated temperatures of +2 to +8°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.3 Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) Inactivated poliovirus vaccine is produced by&#xD;
      Sanofi-Pasteur as a sterile suspension of 3 types of poliovirus. Each dose of vaccine (0.5&#xD;
      mL) contains 40 D antigen units of Mahoney strain (Type 1); 8 D antigen units of MEF-1 strain&#xD;
      (Type 2); and 32 D antigen units of Saukett strain (Type 3). It also contains 0.5% of&#xD;
      2-phenoxyethanol and a maximum of 0.02% of formaldehyde as preservatives. It may also contain&#xD;
      5 ng of neomycin, 200 ng of streptomycin, and 25 ng of polymixin B as residuals of the&#xD;
      vaccine production. The vaccine does not contain Thimerosal. The vaccine should be kept&#xD;
      refrigerated at +2 to +8°C, and should never be frozen. The dose of IPV vaccine should be 0.5&#xD;
      mL administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Vaccine Intervals and Administration All polio vaccine doses should be administered at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks or more apart. For IPV, the administration site is restricted to the&#xD;
      anterolateral aspect of the left thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All other intramuscular (IM) EPI routine vaccines will be administered to the&#xD;
           anterolateral aspect of the right thigh (or the arm at 16 weeks when 3 vaccines are to&#xD;
           be administered including IPV, pentavalent combination vaccine, and S. pneumoniae).&#xD;
           These vaccines should not be injected in the gluteal area or areas where there may be a&#xD;
           major nerve damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IPV will be administered IM at Week 8 (Group 1), Weeks 8 and 16 (Group 2), or Weeks 8,&#xD;
           16, and 24 (Group 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bivalent OPV will be administered as oral drops (2 drops for each vaccination) at Weeks&#xD;
           16 and 24 (Group 1) or Week 24 (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An oral challenge dose (2 drops) of mOPV2 will be administered at Week 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to an injection of any vaccine, all known precautions should be taken to prevent&#xD;
      adverse reactions. This includes a review of the potential participant's history with respect&#xD;
      to possible allergic reactions to the vaccine or similar vaccines. Epinephrine Injection&#xD;
      (1:1000) and other appropriate agents should be available to control immediate allergic&#xD;
      reactions. Health-care providers should obtain the previous immunization history of the&#xD;
      subject, and inquire about the current health status of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants participating in the study will be provided the recommended vaccines aside from polio&#xD;
      vaccine as per the National Immunization Schedule of Chile (DTPw/HBV/Hib, S. pneumoniae&#xD;
      vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a 2-dose (RotarixTM) oral rotavirus vaccine will be offered during the study at&#xD;
      8 weeks and 16 weeks of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serology Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational for each blood sample: After thorough discussions on the minimum number of serum&#xD;
      samples required to obtain valid answers to our hypothesis, the research group has arrived to&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline serum sample at 7-8 weeks to determine antibody titers to polioviruses (and&#xD;
           rotavirus) before any vaccination, required as a basis to detect seroconversion rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post IPV dose 1 at 16 weeks (Group 1) or IPV 2 at 24 weeks (Groups 2 and 3) to determine&#xD;
           IPV/bOPV dose-dependent seroconversions for poliovirus 2 with the shortest possible&#xD;
           latency after vaccination to avoid the potential confounder associated with exposure to&#xD;
           circulating poliovirus 2 vaccine viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post 3 doses to measure the primary objective, seroconversion and GMTs to types 1 and 3&#xD;
           after the different schedules. This serum will also be used for antirotavirus antibody&#xD;
           determinations in order to calculate seroconversion rates and GMCs achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. One week post-type 2 live poliovirus vaccine challenge at 28 weeks to determine if&#xD;
           infants who have not seroconverted to type 2 poliovirus after completing the series of 3&#xD;
           immunizations at 8, 16, and 24 weeks in each of the 3 groups, do so rapidly within 1&#xD;
           week after the challenge. Seroconversion within 1 week strongly suggests that although&#xD;
           the individual had not seroconverted prior to the mOPV2 challenge, that they would do so&#xD;
           rapidly should they encounter cVDPV2 in the environment; this in turn suggests that&#xD;
           although they might become infected by cVDPV2, their risk of developing neuroparalytic&#xD;
           disease as a consequence would nonetheless be substantially reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 4 blood samples will be collected for each study subject. A maximum of 3 mL will&#xD;
      be obtained by heel stick or venipuncture methods. Each blood sample will be transported&#xD;
      within 24 hours in appropriate cold chain conditions to the &quot;Central Study Laboratory&quot; at the&#xD;
      Microbiology and Mycology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
      University of Chile. Sera will be obtained and 2 aliquots will be placed into cryovials,&#xD;
      labeled with linked coding, and stored in a -20°C freezer. One aliquot will be shipped in&#xD;
      appropriate cold chain conditions to the Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Center for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention. The second aliquot will be left on repository storage at the&#xD;
      study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sera will be processed following a standard protocol (see Section 14.1). Neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies against polioviruses 1, 2, and 3 will be determined using a sero-neutralization&#xD;
      assay. The laboratory will be blinded with regard to the vaccination status of individuals&#xD;
      contributing particular specimens, ensuring the integrity of the study. After successful&#xD;
      completion of testing, duplicate specimens will be destroyed. Authorized specimens assays are&#xD;
      only for antibody levels to valences included in the study vaccines. Should the case arise,&#xD;
      the use of these specimens for any other assay will require the approval of the study Sponsor&#xD;
      and the Principal Investigator, as well as Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent&#xD;
      Ethics Committee (IEC) approval, as per applicable rules and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline sera and sera obtained at 28 weeks will be processed for antirotavirus IgA&#xD;
      concentration as previously described at Glaxo SmithKline laboratories (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Stool Samples for Poliovirus &quot;Shedding Index&quot; determination Stool samples (5 to 10 grams)&#xD;
      will be collected at 5 times for each subject, using WHO approved protocols and kits, and&#xD;
      transported and stored following the WHO procedures for detection of polioviruses. Fresh&#xD;
      stools will be collected unmixed with urine in a screw-top container, placed in a cold box&#xD;
      with frozen ice packs, and transported to the designated laboratory for storage in a freezer&#xD;
      at -20°C. A log book of collected and stored samples will be kept by the study personnel.&#xD;
      Stool samples will be used later to determine the excretion of polioviruses as per protocol&#xD;
      (Section 14.1). Samples will be sent in batches to the reference laboratory for poliovirus&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Medications/Treatments Permitted (including rescue medication) and not Permitted Before&#xD;
      and/or During the Trial There will be no restrictions in using medications/treatments except&#xD;
      for the following conditions: primary immune deficiency or immune deficiency subsequent to&#xD;
      treatment, leukemia, lymphoma or advanced malignancy in the subject to be vaccinated or&#xD;
      his/her close contact. Only medications to treat SAEs or IMEs will be documented in eCRF. All&#xD;
      other medications will be captured and recorded in the source document at the investigators&#xD;
      discretion at the investigational site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Subject Compliance Subjects are required to abide by scheduled visits and the vaccine&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
