  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence of a role of EGFR, treatment with EGFR-inhibitors in anal cancer&#xD;
      and synergies of EGFR-inhibitors with radiotherapy. Addition of the human anti-EGFR antibody&#xD;
      Panitumumab to chemoradiotherapy seems therefore solidly justified. This trial investigates&#xD;
      concurrent panitumumab/capecitabine/mitomycin concurrent to IMRT-radiotherapy. Treatment&#xD;
      components used in this study have been selected on scientific rationale. The trial regimen&#xD;
      should be feasible with acceptable toxicity and outcome similar to historic series.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess efficacy of treatment regimen composed of capecitabine, mitomycin, panitumumab,&#xD;
      and radiotherapy in terms of locoregional control rate in patients with stage II-IIIB&#xD;
      squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further assess efficacy of this regimen based on complete response (CR) rate,&#xD;
           colostomy-free survival, functional colostomy-free survival, overall survival (OS), and&#xD;
           progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the tolerability and safety profile of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the role of PET for staging and outcome prediction (for those patients who had&#xD;
           PET following local standards).&#xD;

The death of a patient without a reported progression will be considered as an event on the date of death. Patients who have neither progressed nor died will be censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment.
