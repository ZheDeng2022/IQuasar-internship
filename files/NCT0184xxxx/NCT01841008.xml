  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% has shown promising results for treating vitiligo in many&#xD;
      prospective studies. Prospective randomized studies versus placebo are required to confirm&#xD;
      the hypothesis that maintenance treatment with two applications of tacrolimus ointment 0.1%&#xD;
      per week can reduce relapses of non-segmental vitiligo lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective To assess the efficacy of maintenance therapy with topical tacrolimus vs&#xD;
      placebo in the prevention of depigmentation in patients with vitiligo who responded to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with tacrolimus vs topical placebo to&#xD;
           decrease the intensity of depigmentation in patients with vitiligo who responded to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the occurrence of possible adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of the study Inclusion: 12 months Treatment: 6 months Follow-up: 6 months Total length&#xD;
      of the study: 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Multicentric prospective interventional randomized comparative study versus&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit V0: Selection Information of the patient, control of inclusion and non inclusion&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit V1: Control of inclusion and non inclusion criteria, patients signed informed&#xD;
           consent. An initial clinical evaluation and photographs in direct sunlight and UV.&#xD;
           Topical treatment (tacrolimus or placebo) will be delivered to the patient by the&#xD;
           hospital pharmacy and should be applied twice per week (3 or 4 days apart) for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit V2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be reviewed after the end of treatment (24 weeks after the visit V1) for&#xD;
      final evaluation. A clinical assessment will be made and photographs in the same way as the&#xD;
      inclusion. Adverse reactions during treatment will be collected by the investigator (they&#xD;
      will be noted as and when the patient in a notebook that will be presented at baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of depigmentation will be evaluated in a blinded treatment of photographs by&#xD;
      two reviewers. In case of disagreement, the opinion of a third appraiser will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - End of study: After the end of the study patients will be supported via the usual care&#xD;
      recommended for their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---Percentage of patients at 24 weeks without depigmentation (depigmentation score = 0).&#xD;
           A score of depigmentation from 0 to 2 will be used. A blind treatment evaluation of&#xD;
           direct light and UV photographs will be made by two independent observers&#xD;
           (dermatologists) between inclusion and after 24 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---- The efficiency to reduce the intensity of relapses will be evaluated using the&#xD;
           score of depigmentation (rate of patients with a score of 0 or 1 in each group) and the&#xD;
           VASI score (Appendix 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The frequency, severity and time of occurrence of adverse events are reported. Side&#xD;
           effects are classified into grades according to WHO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subject Considering that depigmentation occurs in more than 40% of patients during&#xD;
      the 24 weeks of maintenance treatment and hoped that the proactive treatment will reduce the&#xD;
      rate of depigmentation of 10%, a population of 26 patients per group will be necessary&#xD;
      (taking into account 10% of patients lost to follow). The total number of patients to be&#xD;
      included in the study will be 52.&#xD;
