  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone grafting is widely used in hospitals to repair injured, aged or diseased skeletal&#xD;
      tissue. In Europe, about one million patients encounter a surgical bone reconstruction&#xD;
      annually and the numbers are increasing due to our ageing population. Bone grafting intends&#xD;
      to facilitate bone healing through osteogenesis (i.e. bone generation) at the site of damage,&#xD;
      but this is only attained presently by including cells capable of forming bone into the&#xD;
      augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone autograft is the safest and most effective grafting procedure, since it contains&#xD;
      patient's own bone growing cells (to enhance osteogenesis) and proteins (to enhance&#xD;
      osteoinduction), and it providing a scaffold for the new bone to grow into (osteoconduction).&#xD;
      However, bone autograft is limited in quantity (about 20 cc) and its harvesting (e.g. from&#xD;
      the iliac crest) represents an additional surgical intervention, with frequent consequent&#xD;
      pain and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that using autologous bone marrow cells expanded in GMP facility surgically&#xD;
      implanted with synthetic bone substitutes contribute to the resolution of the health and&#xD;
      socioeconomic complications of delayed union or non-union after diaphyseal and&#xD;
      metaphyseal-diaphyseal fractures with safety and efficacy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tissue engineering combines bone marrow cells or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), synthetic&#xD;
      scaffolds and molecular signals (growth or differentiating factors) in order to form hybrids&#xD;
      constructs. For bone reconstruction purposes, human MSCs have been seeded and cultured on&#xD;
      porous calcium phosphate ceramics in osteogenic media. Some clinical studies with low numbers&#xD;
      of patients have been reported using this approach but the outcomes were inconsistent with&#xD;
      low efficacy in bone regeneration. The reasons of the limited clinical success may be due to&#xD;
      several bottlenecks in the multidisciplinary field of bone tissue engineering. The&#xD;
      association in vitro of biomaterials and osteoprogenitor cells raises technical challenges&#xD;
      and regulatory and ethic issues for the implementation of clinical trials, whereas the&#xD;
      expansion of MSCs is now possible in GMP Facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results are to obtain bone consolidation thus healing of delayed union or&#xD;
      non-union, as proven by imaging techniques, without using bone graft. This will prove the&#xD;
      efficacy of the proposed IMP based on pluripotent MSCs expanded in a GMP facility and mixed&#xD;
      with granulated biphasic calcium phosphate in the surgical setting before implantation. No&#xD;
      expected complications related to the procedure are expected. Changes in serum levels of bone&#xD;
      turnover markers will be described.&#xD;
