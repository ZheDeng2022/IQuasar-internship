      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) To identify panels of RNAs and proteins predictive of response to HER2 targeted agents,&#xD;
      considering clinical responses. (ii) To investigate associations between presence vs. absence&#xD;
      (or relative levels) of identified extracellular (EC) RNAs/proteins and patients'&#xD;
      clinicopathological characteristics, including age at diagnosis, time to progression and&#xD;
      overall survival, as well as correlations with serum protein biomarkers routinely analysed&#xD;
      for these patients. (iii) To compare HER2 positive samples versus HER2 negative samples for&#xD;
      the existence of RNAs/proteins identified in (i) and (ii).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a predictive model for use in the HER2 positive population based on the most&#xD;
      accurate and sensitive combination of the identified biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a translational pilot study, involving two patient cohorts, designed to identify&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers for HER2 targeted therapy, which will be validated in a larger future&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: 300 newly diagnosed (including metastatic) HER2 positive breast cancer patients.&#xD;
      Cohort 2: 30 newly diagnosed HER2 negative breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimens will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before starting treatment (cohort 1 and 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after receiving chemotherapy and before starting HER2 targeted treatment (if applicable)&#xD;
           (cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  within one month following 1st treatment of HER2 targeted treatment (cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  approximately every 3 months (coinciding with formal disease assessment) while on HER2&#xD;
           targeted treatment for a maximum of 5 years (cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be processed to serum, which will be analysed for RNA and protein biomarkers.&#xD;
