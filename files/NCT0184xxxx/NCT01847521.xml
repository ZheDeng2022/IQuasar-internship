    <textblock>
      Background. Increasing evidence indicates that brain inflammation is important in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, including at least a significant proportion of&#xD;
      subjects with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Natural flavonoids, such as luteolin and&#xD;
      quercetin, exhibit potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, inhibit the release&#xD;
      of inflammatory mediators from human mast cells, and reduce maternal interleukin 6-induced&#xD;
      autism-like behavioral deficits related to social interactions in mice. In a case series of&#xD;
      37 children with ASD who took a dietary supplement containing luteolin and quercetin for 4&#xD;
      months reported gains in eye contact, attention and social interaction according to parental&#xD;
      reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability in white&#xD;
      children with ASD of a dietary supplement containing 2 flavonoids, luteolin and quercetin,&#xD;
      and the quercetin glycoside rutin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Fifty children (42 boys and 8 girls) divided into 2 equal age groups (4-6 years old,&#xD;
      and 7-10 years) with ASD were enrolled in a 26-week, prospective, open-label trial at the 2nd&#xD;
      University Department of Psychiatry at &quot;Attikon&quot; General Hospital, Athens, Greece, the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of which approved the study. The parents of all subjects were informed of the&#xD;
      study's aims, including risks versus benefits of participating and not participating as well&#xD;
      as the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and they written consent for participation in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants had already been diagnosed with ASD based on clinical assessments, and this&#xD;
      diagnosis was corroborated at the 'Attikon' clinic by meeting the cutoff scores on both the&#xD;
      DSM-IV-TR, symptom list and the ADOS algorithm. All children were medication naive. Apart&#xD;
      from the diagnostic evaluation, the assessment also included a thorough medical evaluation&#xD;
      comprising a physical examination and health history (including a review of allergic and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as any food allergies or food intolerance). All concurrent&#xD;
      interventions were thoroughly noted (type and hours), and the same was done at all visits.&#xD;
      After meeting screening criteria, subjects were evaluated at the baseline visit, mid-trial&#xD;
      visit at 18 weeks, and final visit at 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children were administered a dietary formulation containing 2 flavonoids, luteolin (100&#xD;
      mg/capsule) and quercetin (70 mg/capsule), and the quercetin glycoside rutin (30 mg/capsule).&#xD;
      The dose used was 1 softgel capsule per 10 kg (22 lb) weight per day with food for 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes were the age-equivalent scores in the 3 domains of the Vineland Adaptive&#xD;
      Behavior Scales (VABS), communication, daily living skills, and socialization. The VABS was&#xD;
      chosen because the impact of an agent on adaptive functioning in real life is even more&#xD;
      important for obtaining a better quality of life than just alleviation of some symptoms. The&#xD;
      raw scores from the interview can be also expressed as an age-equivalent score and a standard&#xD;
      score compared with those of the subject's peers. There are also supplementary special norms&#xD;
      for individuals with autism. Although standard scores could be more useful in subject&#xD;
      characterization, their use as an outcome measure has been proven to be less sensitive due to&#xD;
      floor effects and reduced variability, especially in short time periods, and thus these&#xD;
      scores underestimate change. Conversely, scores of special norms tend to overestimate change,&#xD;
      as a small increase in a raw score can produce a big improvement in special norm percentile&#xD;
      rank. Thus, raw scores and age-equivalent scores seem to be the most appropriate for use as&#xD;
      outcome measures, with the latter being more easily interpreted as change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), the Autism Treatment&#xD;
      Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score (CGI-I). To&#xD;
      explore other possible effects of the formulation not captured from the aforementioned&#xD;
      instruments, we chose to record any other benefits observed and reported by the parents&#xD;
      during its use. For this, the primary clinician (K.F.) conducted telephone or in-person&#xD;
      interviews of the parents, independently of the assessing clinician (A.T.), to discuss the&#xD;
      possible gains of the child. CGI-I was also independently coded by the primary clinician with&#xD;
      personal assessments as well as with information gathered by parents and, in the majority of&#xD;
      cases, by the subjects' trainers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance was monitored by softgel capsule count and the parents' assurance that the&#xD;
      capsules had actually been taken at each visit; in case of a capsule count &lt;85% of the&#xD;
      prescribed dosage at midterm and at the end of the study, the subject was excluded from the&#xD;
      final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events were systematically recorded on an adverse event form by using scales&#xD;
      indicating severity, relationship to the study procedures, action taken, and any therapy&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
