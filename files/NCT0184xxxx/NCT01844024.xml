  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uganda is one of the countries with highest fertility rate in the world, 6.7 children per&#xD;
      women. It is estimated that 56 percent of all pregnancies are unintended and the&#xD;
      contraceptive prevalence rate in Uganda is 23 percent. Unwanted pregnancy is common and&#xD;
      induced abortion is illegal. Unsafe abortion is responsible for significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality among women in Uganda. Almost 40% of admissions to emergency obstetric care units&#xD;
      in Uganda due to unsafe abortion is reported and considered high in international comparison.&#xD;
      Studies have revealed that trained midlevel providers can deliver safe post abortion care&#xD;
      (PAC) for incomplete abortion and use manual vacuum aspiration. The prostaglandin E1 analogue&#xD;
      misoprostol has been shown to be an effective tool in the treatment of incomplete abortions.&#xD;
      This option is so far under-used in developing countries, especially outside the larger&#xD;
      hospitals and private clinics. One significant limiting factor in providing safe PAC is the&#xD;
      lack of providers. So far technical training has been mainly limited to physicians. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of this project is to provide evidence based information that will contribute&#xD;
      to the development of strategies to increase women's access to high level post- abortion care&#xD;
      at primary health care level provided by midlevel providers in Uganda. A task shift to&#xD;
      midlevel provider in providing treatment of incomplete abortion will increase access to safe&#xD;
      PAC and is a key to Millenium Development Goal 5. Misoprostol treatment of incomplete&#xD;
      abortion remains underused and in accessible to a majority of women in Uganda because&#xD;
      national regulations restricts its prescription and supervision to doctors. However, the&#xD;
      safety of misoprostol treatment should make it amenable to provision by midlevel providers.&#xD;
      Training of midlevel providers in misoprostol treatment of incomplete abortion will support&#xD;
      task shifting in places where doctors are costly and scarce. By evaluating the effectiveness&#xD;
      of mid-level providers (midwives); administering misoprostol treatment of incomplete abortion&#xD;
      the project is attempting to contribute to the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      and safeguard high quality of post-abortion care. A direct economic impact can also be&#xD;
      expected due to reduced treatment costs of complications from unsafely induced abortion and&#xD;
      incomplete abortions. The involvement of midlevel providers in medical treatment of&#xD;
      incomplete abortion has previously not been systematically evaluated in African primary&#xD;
      health care setting.&#xD;
