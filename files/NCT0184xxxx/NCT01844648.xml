      To study the safety and efficacy of tropicamide 1 mg intra-oral slow dissolving muco-adhesive&#xD;
      thin films compared to placebo to reduce hypersalivation in PD patients manifesting&#xD;
      sialorrhea complaints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, multicentre study&#xD;
      comparing intra-oral slow dissolving muco-adhesive thin films containing tropicamide 1 mg or&#xD;
      Placebo. Patients will receive each treatment twice daily (1 h after breakfast and 1 h after&#xD;
      lunch) for 1-week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for eligibility during the 14-day screening period. Those patients&#xD;
      meeting all entry criteria at baseline will be randomized (1:1) to receive first tropicamide&#xD;
      followed by placebo films or vice versa. Patients will return for regularly scheduled visits&#xD;
      at Weeks 1 and 3 or at early discontinuation.&#xD;
