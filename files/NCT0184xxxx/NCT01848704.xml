      1Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are the gold standard for therapeutic evaluation. Rapid&#xD;
      dissemination of trial results and their translation into clinical practice is particularly&#xD;
      important. Abstracts published or presented in conferences are a large, rapid and free method&#xD;
      to disseminate these results. However, this mode of dissemination may have serious&#xD;
      consequences for patients if abstracts are not an accurate and unbiased reflection of the&#xD;
      trial results. Indeed, investigators have great freedom when writing their abstracts and&#xD;
      articles. They can choose the data to present and decide how to present them. Consequently,&#xD;
      they have many opportunities to shape readers' impressions of their results, that is, to add&#xD;
      &quot;spin&quot; (ie, spin is a specific way of reporting to convince readers that the beneficial&#xD;
      effect (efficacy, safety) of the experimental treatment is higher than shown by the results).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the impact of spin on the interpretation of results in abstracts of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials with nonstatistically significant results in the field of&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The investigators performed a RCT comparing the interpretation of results in&#xD;
      abstracts a) with and b) without spin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of abstracts of randomized trials with spin. The investigators selected a&#xD;
           sample of negative published RCTs (i.e. non statistically significant results) with a&#xD;
           spin in abstract conclusion identified in previous works. Inclusion criteria were 1)&#xD;
           RCTs with non statistically significant primary outcome, 2) spin in the abstract&#xD;
           conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Abstracts' modification Selected abstracts were systematically rewritten to contain no&#xD;
           &quot;spin&quot;. All abstracts were presented in the same format without the names of authors,&#xD;
           references, or the name of the journal in which it was published, and the names of&#xD;
           treatments were masked by using generic terms (e.g., treatment A, comparator B). All&#xD;
           abstracts had the same number of words +/-20&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment Abstracts were assessed by corresponding authors of randomized trials,&#xD;
           experts of specific grants and investigator of trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
           Experts were invited to participate in our study. They were not informed of the&#xD;
           objectives of our study. Each clinician were randomized to evaluate 1 abstracts with or&#xD;
           1 abstracts without spin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The primary endpoint was the interpretation of abstract results by the participants. All&#xD;
           readers participating in the study evaluated the abstract of randomized trial and&#xD;
           answered the following question: Based on this abstract, do you think treatment A would&#xD;
           be beneficial to patients? (answer: numerical scale from 0-10)&#xD;

      The investigators planned a RCT in which the unit of randomization is the abstract. The&#xD;
      planning, implementation, analysis and writing of this study followed the CONSORT&#xD;
      Statement12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of abstracts were evaluated: abstracts with and without &quot;spin&quot;. Randomization&#xD;
      characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization list was established in blocks of 30. So, each participant could evaluate 1&#xD;
      abstract with spin or 1 abstract with no spin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list and the block size were not disclosed to investigators. Allocation concealment was&#xD;
      obtained by use of a computerized randomization system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant logged on the system but did not evaluate any abstract, the assessments were&#xD;
      excluded and the abstracts were automatically allocated to the next participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluators participating in this study were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The &quot;corresponding authors&quot; of published RCTs in the field of cancer. The investigators&#xD;
           systematically searched Medline via PubMed to identify all publications of RCTs in 2012&#xD;
           and if needed 2011, 2010. The investigators collected all e-mails of &quot;corresponding&#xD;
           authors&quot; of these items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experts of a French national grant in the field of cancer All potential participants&#xD;
           were invited by e-mail to participate in a study on the interpretation of results of&#xD;
           abstracts of clinical trials. If they agreed to participate, they used an Internet link&#xD;
           that gave them access to abstracts to assess.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigators of trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and comparators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of abstracts with spin We selected from previous work and personnel&#xD;
      collection13-16, 30 abstracts of 2 parallel arms negative RCTs (ie, non-statistically&#xD;
      significant primary outcome) evaluating treatment in the field of cancer and having spin in&#xD;
      the abstract conclusion according to a classification developed previously13. We excluded&#xD;
      abstract with very unusual type of spin such as a focus on another study objective, with spin&#xD;
      related only to safety, or study comparing the same treatment but with different dosage or&#xD;
      different mode of administration or different duration of treatment. We also excluded&#xD;
      abstract of RCTs with small sample size (&lt;100). Abstract were numbered from 1 to 30 and were&#xD;
      classified in two categories: 10 abstracts (numbers 11/12/14/16/20/22/24/27/28/30) with high&#xD;
      level of spin (i.e., no acknowledgment of the non statistically significant primary outcome&#xD;
      in the conclusion) and 20 with low level of spin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of abstracts without spin The abstracts with spin were systematically rewritten&#xD;
      without spin. One researcher rewrote each abstract according to specific guidelines described&#xD;
      in the box. All abstracts had the same number of words +/-25. All abstracts without spin were&#xD;
      evaluated independently by another researcher any disagreement were discussed and the&#xD;
      abstract was modified according to the consensus reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, for each study, the investigators had 2 versions of the abstract: 1 with spin and 1&#xD;
      without spin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstracts with and without spin were presented in the format of the original abstract with&#xD;
      the same typography. The names of authors, references, journal name, registration number,&#xD;
      trial name or acronym, and article title were deleted, and the treatment names and&#xD;
      description were systematically masked with generic terms (e.g., treatment A and comparator&#xD;
      B). If needed some information that could help identifying the treatment were deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome The primary endpoint was participants' interpretation of the abstracts. All&#xD;
      study participants evaluated each abstract. They answered the following question on a&#xD;
      numerical scale graded from 0 (not at all likely) to 10 (very likely)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Based on this abstract, do you think treatment A would be beneficial to patients? (answer:&#xD;
      numerical scale from 0-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints were the assessment of the study quality, the study importance, the&#xD;
      interest in reading the full text and the probability of being published. For each abstract,&#xD;
      the participants answered the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate the overall rigor of the study methodology? (scale 0-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate the importance of the study (scale 0-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are you interested in reading the full article for the study described in this abstract?&#xD;
           (scale 0-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do you think it would be interesting to run another trial evaluating this treatment?&#xD;
           (scale 0-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the interpretation of the abstract by participants. This outcome is&#xD;
      very subjective. A recent study has shown that lack of blinding is responsible for an&#xD;
      overestimation of treatment effect in randomized trials with subjective primary endpoints17.&#xD;
      To minimize bias, the investigators proposed to have participants blinded to the study&#xD;
      hypothesis. All participants were informed that they were participating in a survey on the&#xD;
      interpretation of abstracts of clinical trials. They were not informed of the objectives and&#xD;
      assumptions of the study before the end of the study when reporting the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data collected The investigators also collected the changes to abstracts in terms of&#xD;
      words deleted and words added to each abstract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will read 1 abstract with or 1 abstract without spin. A sample of 266&#xD;
      assessments of abstracts is needed to show an effect size of 0.4 with primary outcome&#xD;
      assuming a mean difference of 1 point and a common standard deviation based on a pilot study&#xD;
      of 2.5 with a power of 90% and an alpha risk equal to 5%. Thirty abstracts with spin and 30&#xD;
      abstracts without spin are available. Theoretically, each abstract must be read the same&#xD;
      number of times according to randomization group. Considering all these elements, it will be&#xD;
      necessary to include 300 participants (150 in each arm). Each abstract will be read 5 times&#xD;
      in each group (abstract with low level of spin will be read 200 times (100 in each group) and&#xD;
      abstract with high level of spin will be read 100 times (50 in each group)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be undertaken independently and blindly with use of SAS v9.3 by a&#xD;
      statistician of the Centre for Clinical Epidemiology. A statistical analytic plan will be&#xD;
      developed and validated before searching the database. The statistical analysis plan will be&#xD;
      revised during the study to take into account any amendments to the protocol or any other&#xD;
      change having an impact on the statistical analysis originally planned. All versions will be&#xD;
      kept on file for review. A T test will be used for analysis of primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. This statistical plan can be modified according to available data. For instance, if&#xD;
      the number of readings for a particular vignette is unbalanced in groups, a multi-level model&#xD;
      (a mixed model for clustered data) will be used to compare adjusted means for the primary&#xD;
      outcome measures between the 2 arms. This means that statistical analysis will be adjusted&#xD;
      for unbalanced repartition of abstracts in each group. The same model will be applied to&#xD;
      secondary outcomes and to the subgroup abstracts with high level of spin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary analysis will compare the ICC between readers of abstracts with spin and&#xD;
      abstracts without spin by computing the 95% confidence interval of the difference between&#xD;
      ICCs (by a bootstrap method).&#xD;
