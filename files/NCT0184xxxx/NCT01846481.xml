  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 4-sequence, 2-period, double-blind, placebo controlled study in male&#xD;
      and female subjects with an American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of cocaine abuse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be a 28-day screening period with eligible subjects remaining resident in the&#xD;
      clinic from the evening before Day -1 up and until the morning of Day 9. On the morning of&#xD;
      Day 1, a 50 mg intravenous (IV) infusion of cocaine will be administered over 10 minutes to&#xD;
      all subjects. If none of the stopping criteria were met and no intervening safety concerns,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment sequences on Day 3. On dosing days, Day 3&#xD;
      and Day 6, subjects will have fasted at least 8 hours before dosing of cocaine and either&#xD;
      RBP-8000 200 mg, RBP-8000 100 mg or matching placebo.&#xD;
