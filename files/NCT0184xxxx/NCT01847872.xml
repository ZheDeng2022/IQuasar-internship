  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to identify interference between intramuscular Inactivated&#xD;
      Polio Vaccine (IPV) and other vaccines (Measles Rubella and Yellow Fever) co-administered at&#xD;
      nine months of age and to confirm the safety of co-administration. In addition, the study&#xD;
      will compare the immunogenicity and safety of IPV when administered via different routes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1504 healthy infants between the ages of nine to ten months, who have completed&#xD;
      their primary immunizations, including at least three doses of trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine&#xD;
      (tOPV) will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In studies conducted to date, Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) appears to boost the systemic&#xD;
      immunity generated by Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) priming significantly more effectively than&#xD;
      the use of additional doses of OPV. The use of IPV to both enhance the immunity generated by&#xD;
      OPV and also to provide protection against circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2&#xD;
      outbreaks and Vaccine Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis has the potential to address&#xD;
      concerns regarding a switch to bivalent OPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant administration with Expanded Program of Immunisations(EPI) vaccines given at&#xD;
      about nine months would be a feasible programmatic approach. Maternal antibodies will have&#xD;
      largely waned by this point negating any inhibitory effect which they may have within the&#xD;
      priming schedule. Significant interference between IPV, Measles and Rubella (MR) and Yellow&#xD;
      Fever (YF) vaccines must be excluded to ensure that IPV introduction does not negatively&#xD;
      impact on the immunogenicity or safety of the other vaccines in the program at the same&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restricted manufacturing capacity in the context of a higher manufacturing cost than OPV&#xD;
      would currently limit the rate at which IPV could be rolled out within a modified EPI&#xD;
      schedule. The administration of a fractional dose of the vaccine by the Intradermal route&#xD;
      would facilitate vaccine role out through limiting the cost and the manufacturing scale-up&#xD;
      required. The proposed study is phase 4, eight-arm, open label, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical vaccine trial. A total of 1504 randomized healthy infants between nine and ten&#xD;
      months will receive IPV, MR and YF vaccines either alone, in combinations of two vaccines, or&#xD;
      all three vaccines will be given together. Different routes (IM and fractional dose ID) and&#xD;
      needle free jet injections devices for administration of IPV will be compared in the&#xD;
      different groups. The participants will be assigned to one of eight groups using blocked&#xD;
      randomization scheme in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non- inferiority of serological responses and median antibody titers will be the primary&#xD;
      immunogenicity end points. The incidence of serious adverse events and other important&#xD;
      medical events at any point during the study will be the primary safety end point in all&#xD;
      groups. Following device of reference needle/syringe administration, any local adverse event&#xD;
      (reactogenicity), which will be collected on day 0(day of vaccination), day 1, day 2 and day&#xD;
      3 will be a second primary safety endpoint.&#xD;
