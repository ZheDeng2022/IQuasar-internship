    <textblock>
      Background: Due to the lingering effects of general anesthesia and the administration of&#xD;
      medications for pain after surgery, children in the recovery room are at risk for breathing&#xD;
      problems. While there are less data specific to children, in general 25% of patients in the&#xD;
      recovery room experience complications from anesthesia. The most common complications involve&#xD;
      the patient's airway and their ability to breath adequately. Currently, checks of oxygenation&#xD;
      with a pulse oximetry monitor and of respiration through nursing assessments are used to&#xD;
      detect breathing problems. However, these are believed not to be adequate for reliably&#xD;
      recognizing significant respiratory depression until other dangerous events develop such as&#xD;
      the cessation of breathing, severe drops in oxygen levels, or cardiac arrest. Capnography is&#xD;
      a monitoring device that measures the amount of carbon dioxide being exhaled and assesses the&#xD;
      adequacy of respiration. A small plastic cannula sits at the base of the nose and on the lip&#xD;
      to continuously monitor the patient's breathing. Most children tolerate this device well and&#xD;
      staff consider it easy to use. While capnography is routinely used in the operating room to&#xD;
      monitor breathing, it is not used during post-operative care when patients are still at risk&#xD;
      of breathing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine if capnography can detect problems with breathing faster and more&#xD;
      often than traditional monitors. To determine if the addition of capnography to routine&#xD;
      monitoring will decrease the numbers of additional adverse events that occur in children&#xD;
      undergoing post-operative care by allowing nurses to intervene in care faster and more&#xD;
      frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In the first phase of this study, the investigators will apply the capnography&#xD;
      monitor to children in the recover room and determine how often they experience breathing&#xD;
      difficulties measured by this device. In the second phase, the investigators will educate&#xD;
      staff on the use of capnography and what values are considered abnormal. Children will again&#xD;
      have the capnography cannula placed on them as they enter the recovery room. They will then&#xD;
      be divided into two groups - in one group the nurses in the recovery room will have access to&#xD;
      the capnography monitor for their patients, whereas in the other group the nurses will not be&#xD;
      able to see the readout from the monitor. The investigators will determine if children have&#xD;
      fewer breathing problems and less additional adverse events when nurses use capnography in&#xD;
      addition to the routine monitors already in place in the recovery room as compared to when&#xD;
      nurses use standard monitoring alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact: If capnography can detect breathing problems prior to being identified by&#xD;
      current monitoring devices, staff may be able to intervene more quickly and before more&#xD;
      serious events occur in the children receiving post-operative care. This can reduce adverse&#xD;
      events, improve patient safety, and avert harm in children. The adoption of this device for&#xD;
      routine monitoring of post-operative care has the potential to save lives.&#xD;

      Study Site: Children will be enrolled in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) at Yale-New&#xD;
      Haven Children's Hospital, where capnography is not currently utilized. The pediatric PACU is&#xD;
      a 12-bed monitored unit and a 4-bed perioperative area where patients receive one-on-one&#xD;
      nursing care. Generally, between 20-30 patients are cared for in the PACU each day with a&#xD;
      typical length of stay of approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1b: To determine whether the addition of capnography will lead to a decrease in&#xD;
      the frequency of oxygen desaturations as measured by pulse oximetry and respiratory&#xD;
      depression in children recovering from general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Setting: The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial in the&#xD;
      Yale-New Haven Children's PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identical population, inclusion and exclusion criteria and recruitment procedures will&#xD;
      apply. A random number list will again be generated to guide recruitment. Investigators will&#xD;
      be blinded to group designation prior to consent and enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention and Data Collection: Prior to the onset of this study, PACU nursing staff&#xD;
      will receive focused training on the application and interpretation of capnography. Proper&#xD;
      positioning of the nasal-oral cannula will be demonstrated. Capnography waveforms will be&#xD;
      reviewed including normal respiratory patterns and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) levels that would&#xD;
      indicate hypoventilation, apnea or obstruction. Staff will be instructed that they can&#xD;
      provide interventions when ETCO2 values greater than 50mmHg or less than 30mmHg are obtained&#xD;
      without a concomitant increase in respiratory rate. Simple noninvasive interventions may&#xD;
      include reposition of the head, instructing the patient to take several deep breaths,&#xD;
      physical stimulation, or placing a shoulder roll under the patient. Invasive interventions&#xD;
      may include administration of reversal medications, bag-valve mask assisted ventilation, the&#xD;
      insertion of an oral or nasal airway and endotracheal intubation. Patients who develop oxygen&#xD;
      saturations less than 93% may receive an increased amount of supplemental oxygen at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo routine care and monitoring while in the PACU. As part of this study, a&#xD;
      duo-port nasal-oral cannula for ETCO2 monitoring will be placed in the nostrils and over the&#xD;
      lip of the patient prior to transfer from the operating room to the PACU (Filterline Smart&#xD;
      CapnoLine Plus) and attached to the portable capnography monitor (Capnostream 20 Bedside&#xD;
      Capnography Monitor by Oridion). Subjects will be randomized into 2 groups: those in whom the&#xD;
      responsible nurse and physician are blinded to the capnography monitor (controls), and those&#xD;
      in whom the capnography monitor is viewed by treating staff during the recovery period&#xD;
      (cases). The investigators control group represents the current standard of care for PACU&#xD;
      monitoring. Stratified block randomization will take place. Patients will be stratified by&#xD;
      type of surgery: otolaryngology (ENT) or non-ENT. The randomization sequence will be placed&#xD;
      in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes for each stratum. Although each patient and his/her&#xD;
      family will consent to the study prior to surgery, they will not be officially enrolled until&#xD;
      the patient demonstrates that he/she can tolerate the nasal-oral cannula upon arrival to the&#xD;
      PACU. Thus, when an enrolled subject arrives to the PACU and is successfully tolerating the&#xD;
      nasal-oral cannula the study envelope containing their group designation will be opened by&#xD;
      the research assistant (RA) or principal investigator (PI) for this study and data collection&#xD;
      will commence. All staff will be blinded to group designation until this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the case subjects, alarm settings will be programmed on the monitor to alert the provider&#xD;
      to ETCO2 levels below 30mmHg and above 50mmHg. The monitor will be positioned where it can be&#xD;
      easily viewed by both the treating staff and the RA/PI for this study. For control subjects,&#xD;
      the portable capnography monitor will be positioned by the PI or RA and out of the line of&#xD;
      sight of other treating staff. The alarm function will be turned off so as not to alert staff&#xD;
      to abnormal readings on the monitor. Since the investigators are not mandating that staff&#xD;
      intervene for abnormal ETCO2 values, the RA or PI will be the only participant to view the&#xD;
      capnography monitor in the control group and will not inform the treating staff of any&#xD;
      abnormal values under 2 minutes in length. The Yale Human Investigations committee was&#xD;
      consulted regarding the ethics of withholding information from the control arm of this study&#xD;
      and approves this decision. Instances where the PI or RA had to notify staff of events will&#xD;
      be recorded on the data form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: For the purposes of this randomized controlled trial, heart rate, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, and oxygen saturation will be routinely monitored and recorded on a data sheet every 30&#xD;
      seconds while the patient is in the PACU by the PI or RA who will not otherwise be involved&#xD;
      in patient care. ETCO2 values are recorded by the capnography monitor every 30 seconds and&#xD;
      waveforms are continuously captured. These data will be downloaded from the capnography&#xD;
      monitor at the time of discharge for each patient. Adverse respiratory events as well as&#xD;
      nurse and physician interventions related to airway and ventilatory management will be&#xD;
      documented by the PI/RA. These were described previously. Additional pain or sedative&#xD;
      medications may be administered by nursing staff and will be recorded during this study.&#xD;
      Patient disposition and total length of stay in the PACU will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators primary outcome will be frequency of The investigators previously defined&#xD;
      respiratory events that occur with and without the use of capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations: While the investigators will refine their sample size based on&#xD;
      event rates found in the first cohort of this proposal, the investigators plan to enroll at&#xD;
      least 200 children in this pilot study in order to detect a 30% reduction in adverse event&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Variable distributions will first be examined with descriptive&#xD;
      statistics, including box-plots and histograms. Any missing data due to artifact or equipment&#xD;
      malfunction will be explored for each group. The investigators will describe the two groups&#xD;
      of patients, those with blinded capnography readings vs. those without, in terms of their&#xD;
      age, gender, ethnicity, type of condition for which sedation was required, and physician&#xD;
      performing procedure. The investigators will use Student's t-test for continuous variables&#xD;
      and chi-square/Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Statistically significant (p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05) or clinically meaningful differences (10%) between two randomized groups will be added&#xD;
      to the multivariate analysis of the primary outcome. Groups will then be analyzed by strata -&#xD;
      patients receiving ENT procedures and those receiving other non-ENT procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes, airway or respiratory adverse events, will be summarized by group in&#xD;
      terms of the number and percent of patients in each group who experience these outcomes.&#xD;
      Generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach will be used to model the probability of an&#xD;
      outcome (two separate models for each outcome of interest) with the randomization group&#xD;
      (blinded vs. not to capnography readings) as the main independent predictor. The&#xD;
      investigators will adjust the model with other important predictors, especially the ones that&#xD;
      were different between the two groups. Odds ratios (OR) and surrounding confidence intervals&#xD;
      will be reported for each predictor. The investigators can use the adjusted OR for the group&#xD;
      variable to calculate relative risk (RR).37 Significance will be established with a&#xD;
      two-tailed alpha=0.05. The investigators will use this data to obtain funding for a larger,&#xD;
      randomized trial which will also include cost-effectiveness analyses.&#xD;
