    <textblock>
      Many American Indian (AI) women never receive services for serious mental health problems&#xD;
      resulting from traumatic events, violence exposure and maltreatment. AI women suffer higher&#xD;
      lifetime rates of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (20-23%), that often co-occur with&#xD;
      excessive drinking and risky sexual behaviors. These factors magnify risk for human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted disease (HIV/STI). In full development with&#xD;
      tribal partners, this application, proposes a 3-year project to culturally adapt and pilot an&#xD;
      empirically supported trauma-focused treatment, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for PTSD,&#xD;
      substance use and HIV/STI sexual risk behavior among 50 AI women. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the feasibility, acceptability and treatment fidelity of delivering&#xD;
      CPT via AI community health workers in a resource-limited tribal reservation. This project&#xD;
      brings a culturally responsive intervention to an understudied and highly vulnerable&#xD;
      population. Its significance lies in its potential to advance science in the area of PTSD,&#xD;
      substance use treatment and HIV/STI prevention among AI women. Study data would benefit&#xD;
      tribal and rural communities and the mental health field. Finally, it is geared toward&#xD;
      developing the research infrastructure and mental health treatment capacity serving AI women&#xD;
      living in rural settings, a group at risk for an expanding HIV/AIDS epidemic. If successful,&#xD;
      findings from this pilot will provide evidence for a larger effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AIMS are AIM I. Adapt the evidence-based CPT intervention in full collaboration with&#xD;
      tribal partners. This will be done in accordance with the CDC's Map of Adaptation Process and&#xD;
      involves formative research with tribal leaders, potential consumers, providers, and health&#xD;
      care administrators using qualitative methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2. Assess this intervention delivered by Native American community health workers for&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability in a resource-limited rural reservation setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3. Conduct a two-group, single-site waitlist randomized controlled pilot trial of a&#xD;
      12-session, 6-week CPT intervention among 56 (6 pilot) sexually active and substance using AI&#xD;
      women with PTSD or sub-threshold PTSD. Determine preliminary efficacy and estimate an effect&#xD;
      size in terms of three primary outcomes: (a) PTSD symptomatology; (b) substance use; (c) high&#xD;
      risk sexual behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly one of three American Indian (AI) women can expect to be raped in their lifetime&#xD;
      putting them at great risk for revictimization and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The&#xD;
      high prevalence of sexual and physical assault in Indian country has led Amnesty&#xD;
      International to declare a state of emergency for AI women in the United States. This&#xD;
      application is part of a community led effort by the Yakama Nation to turn this tide in their&#xD;
      tribal community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Situated in the plateau region of Eastern Washington, the Yakama Nation is the largest tribe&#xD;
      in Washington State (comprising over 10,000 members.) Since 2008, Investigators at the&#xD;
      University of Washington have been collaborating with the Yakama Reservation Wellness&#xD;
      Coalition who has mobilized activists and researchers through a community-based participatory&#xD;
      research (CBPR) process to address the trauma and associated mental health concerns&#xD;
      disproportionately affecting community women. This application, in response to &quot;R34&#xD;
      PA-09-146: Pilot and Feasibility Studies in Preparation for Drug Abuse Prevention Trials&quot;&#xD;
      proposes a 3-year project to culturally adapt and pilot an empirically supported&#xD;
      trauma-focused treatment, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD), substance use and HIV/STI sexual risk behavior among 56 AI women in a&#xD;
      resource-limited rural area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will assess the feasibility, acceptability and treatment&#xD;
      fidelity of delivering this CPT via AI community health workers. Based on the investigators&#xD;
      promising preliminary work, their multidisciplinary collaboration includes experienced AI and&#xD;
      non-AI HIV, trauma, health service, and mental health academic researchers and an 8-member&#xD;
      community research team of Yakama Nation tribal leaders, potential consumers, and health care&#xD;
      providers with strong community connections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High rates of comorbidity between substance and alcohol use disorders (SAUD) and PTSD have&#xD;
      been well established especially for women. Moreover, 25-40% of those seeking treatment for&#xD;
      substance use meet criteria for PTSD. Additionally, PTSD is associated with increased&#xD;
      HIV-risk sexual behavior (HRSB) in women. Prevailing theory suggests that alcohol and other&#xD;
      drugs may be used to self-medicate or mitigate PTSD symptoms, which then reinforces more&#xD;
      substance use leading to substance abuse-related consequences and problems, particularly&#xD;
      HIV/STI exposure. Avoidance of trauma-related cues and affect including avoidance through&#xD;
      substance use is thought to maintain PTSD and enhance risky sexual behavior. Therefore,&#xD;
      treatment of PTSD should decrease substance use and risky sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many AI women never receive services for serious mental health problems resulting from&#xD;
      traumatic events, violence exposure and maltreatment. AI women suffer higher lifetime rates&#xD;
      of PTSD (20-23%), and are 2-3 times more likely than the general U.S. population to engage in&#xD;
      excessive drinking which often co-occurs with risky sexual behaviors. These factors magnify&#xD;
      risk for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (HIV/STI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is innovative in both its focus and its methods. It brings a culturally&#xD;
      responsive intervention to an understudied and highly vulnerable population. It will&#xD;
      culturally adapt and modify an evidence-based community health worker delivered intervention&#xD;
      to address health risk behaviors (SAUD and HRSB). Its significance lies in its potential to&#xD;
      advance science in the area of PTSD and SAUD treatment and HIV/STI prevention among AI women.&#xD;
      Study data would be a significant contribution to tribal and rural communities and the mental&#xD;
      health field. Finally, it is geared toward developing the research infrastructure and mental&#xD;
      health treatment capacity serving AI women living in rural settings, a group at risk for an&#xD;
      expanding AIDS and STI epidemic. If successful, findings from this study will inform a larger&#xD;
      efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM I. Adapt the evidence-based CPT intervention in full collaboration with tribal partners.&#xD;
      This will be done in accordance with the CDC's Map of Adaptation Process and involved&#xD;
      formative research with tribal leaders, potential consumers, providers, and health care&#xD;
      administrators using qualitative methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2. Assess this intervention delivered by Native American community health workers for&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability in a resource-limited rural reservation setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2. Conduct a two-group, single-site waitlist randomized controlled pilot trial of a&#xD;
      12-session, 6-week CPT intervention among 56 (6 pilot) sexually active and substance using AI&#xD;
      women with PTSD or sub-threshold PTSD. Determine preliminary efficacy and estimate an effect&#xD;
      size in terms of three primary outcomes: (a) PTSD symptomatology; (b) substance use; (c) high&#xD;
      risk sexual behavior.&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive Processing Therapy-Cognitive (CPT-C) uses education about trauma reactions, emotional processing, and cognitive strategies to reduce trauma-related cognitive distortions. CPT is a manualised 12 session cognitive behavioral treatment for PTSD which offers an alternative to purely exposure based interventions. CPT has a smaller exposure component than imaginal exposure therapy and is therefore potentially more acceptable to clients or practitioners seeking alternatives to purely exposure focused treatments. CPT-C omits the written trauma account, and includes more practice of cognitive techniques during the sessions. The treatment was developed for twice weekly sessions over 6 weeks. It also directly targets associated problems such as depression, guilt and anger.</description>
