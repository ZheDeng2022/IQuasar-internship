      In this proposal the investigators have three Specific Aims using human patient populations&#xD;
      as model systems; 1) identify a role for the Basal Ganglia (BG) in perceptual decision&#xD;
      making; 2) determine whether the Basal Ganglia contribute to decision making under conditions&#xD;
      of visual uncertainty; 3) determine whether the cerebellum plays a role in perceptual&#xD;
      decision-making under conditions of visual uncertainty. The investigators designed&#xD;
      experiments using healthy humans and humans with diseases known to affect the Basal Ganglia&#xD;
      and the cerebellum, Parkinson's Disease, dystonia and non-dystonic cerebellar damage. With&#xD;
      this approach the investigators will test the following hypotheses: 1) Patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease and dystonia will have more difficulty than healthy controls making&#xD;
      perceptual decisions when faced with sensory uncertainty; when sensory information is&#xD;
      certain, patients will show improved decision-making but will still be impaired relative to&#xD;
      healthy humans. Hypothesis 2: If ambiguous sensory information is aided by prior information,&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's Disease and dystonia will be unable to use the prior (bias/memory)&#xD;
      information to inform their decisions. Hypothesis 3: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of Basal&#xD;
      Ganglia structures will improve the ability of patients to use prior information to inform&#xD;
      their decisions when faced with sensory uncertainty. Hypothesis 4: Both cholinergic and&#xD;
      dopaminergic medical therapies will improve the ability of patients to use prior information&#xD;
      to inform their decisions. Hypothesis 5: Patients with non-dystonic cerebellar damage will be&#xD;
      similar to healthy controls in performance of a perceptual decision making task in conditions&#xD;
      of visual uncertainty. The overarching framework of this application is that the same&#xD;
      mechanisms (D1 striatal synaptic plasticity) that operate in reward learning play a role in&#xD;
      learning and using stimulus priors in a perceptual decision-making task when faced with&#xD;
      uncertainty. Because Parkinson's Disease and dystonia share deficits in striatal circuitry,&#xD;
      the patient deficits on this task will be similar. Because non-dystonic cerebellar patients&#xD;
      do not have dysfunction of striatal circuits, they will show no deficits in the ability to&#xD;
      use stimulus priors to guide choices in uncertain conditions. In the event these patients do&#xD;
      show deficits, this is will provide evidence for an unexplored role for the cerebellum in&#xD;
      perceptual decision-making.&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators aim determine whether patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      have altered perceptual decision-making. The results of these experiments will shed important&#xD;
      light on some of the enigmatic symptoms seen in patients with disorders of movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the subjects perform a computer generated visual task which involves reporting&#xD;
      the direction of an arrow that is more or less difficult to see on the computer screen. Eye&#xD;
      movements will be monitored using a video eye tracker. The system is completely non-invasive&#xD;
      and positioned in front, out of the subject's line of sight to avoid interfering with their&#xD;
      ability to perform the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will report their decision with either an eye movement in the same direction as the&#xD;
      perception of the arrow direction. Trials will proceed as follows: a central point will&#xD;
      appear on the screen. Subjects are asked to look at the fixation point. After this random&#xD;
      delay time, a patch of spots will appear in place of the center fixation spot, embedded in&#xD;
      the patch will be an arrow. The contrast between the arrow and the patch will vary from high&#xD;
      values to low. At high contrasts the direction at which the arrow points will be very clear&#xD;
      and at low contrasts it will be unclear. The task of the subject is to make a rapid eye&#xD;
      movement as soon as they decide which direction the arrow points. A sound will be played to&#xD;
      indicate a correct choice. On trials in which the sensory information is ambiguous subjects&#xD;
      will be told to 'make their best guess' to which target the arrow points. Unknown to the&#xD;
      subject the investigators will manipulate the probability that one of the targets is the&#xD;
      correct one. This latter manipulation will test whether subjects can use probability&#xD;
      information to inform their decisions. The investigators are particularly interested in&#xD;
      whether this probability information is used preferentially when the sensory information is&#xD;
      ambiguous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of subjects to be enrolled in the study is approximately 120. Subject groups&#xD;
      are as follows: Healthy humans between the ages of 30 and 80 and those with PD (between ages&#xD;
      of 45 and 80), dystonia (ages 30-80) and cerebellar lesions (ages 30-80) including those who&#xD;
      have undergone DBS surgery to treat their PD or dystonia. The total duration of each session&#xD;
      is approximately 2 hours. Each patient group including those with DBS will perform two&#xD;
      sessions of the same task - one while on medication and one while off medication, hence the&#xD;
      total duration of the study will be 4 hours for these groups (2 different sessions during&#xD;
      different days). These patient groups are free to do these sessions at the same time as their&#xD;
      routine physician visits or any other time that works best for them.&#xD;
