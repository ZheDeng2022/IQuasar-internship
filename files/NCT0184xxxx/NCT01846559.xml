  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelets are the main type of blood cell involved in the formation of blood clots that cause&#xD;
      heart attacks. The investigators give antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, for example) to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of another clot forming in the future and causing another heart attack. Platelets are&#xD;
      known to have a role in inflammation and infection as well as clotting. In a recent large&#xD;
      clinical trial, known as the PLATO study, it was also shown that patients treated with a new&#xD;
      antiplatelet medication (ticagrelor) developed fewer lung infections, as well as fewer heart&#xD;
      attacks, compared to the current standard treatment (clopidogrel). The investigators would&#xD;
      therefore like to investigate the reasons behind this and look at the effect of these&#xD;
      medications on immune response. This may help us develop new drugs that have a better effect&#xD;
      on immune response. The investigators are planning a clinical trial that investigates the&#xD;
      effect of these medications on the immune response of healthy volunteers aged 18 to 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only volunteers with no significant past medical history and not taking any medications will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty volunteers will receive either a normal dose of ticagrelor or clopidogrel or no&#xD;
      antiplatelet medication for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then attend the Sheffield Clinical Research Facility where their immune response&#xD;
      will be stimulated using a safe, well established method. The investigators will do this with&#xD;
      an injection of a low dose of endotoxin, which is part of the surface coating of some&#xD;
      bacteria and has been used extensively in similar studies, in over a thousand volunteers over&#xD;
      the past 20 years to investigate immune response. It is known to cause temporary flu-like&#xD;
      symptoms that last approximately 68 hours. The investigators will take measurements of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, white blood cell function and platelet function and compare the effect&#xD;
      of ticagrelor and clopidogrel on this immune response.&#xD;
