  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telerehabilitation is a promising alternative approach that can help improve access to&#xD;
      rehabilitation services once patients are discharged home after stroke. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore postulate a non-inferiority hypothesis of the telerehabilitation approach compared&#xD;
      to home visits to improve balance problem related to stroke. The platform used will be based&#xD;
      on a technological infrastructure that was developed and tested in previous&#xD;
      telerehabilitation studies. The study is a randomized control trial (RCT).The study&#xD;
      population of interest will target individuals who have had a stroke who stayed in a hospital&#xD;
      or chronic stroke population. Participants will be recruited during the hospitalization&#xD;
      period at each of the three sites or in the community. The investigators expect to recruit&#xD;
      240 participants, 120 per group. The first evaluation will be conducted at recruitment to&#xD;
      establish the baseline measures. The two other evaluations will be conducted 2 months (T2)&#xD;
      and four months (T3) following recruitment.&#xD;

    <description>An individualized exercise program, based on Tai Chi, was developed by our team for previous studies aiming to improve balance in elderly, diabetic individuals and in frail, elderly individuals with balance problems. The exercise program consists of movements based on a combination of alignments and body-specific orientations, weight transfers and changes in direction inspired by Tai Chi. This group will receive this program via telerehabilitation.</description>
