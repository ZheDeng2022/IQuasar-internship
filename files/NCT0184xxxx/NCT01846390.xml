  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because it is not yet known what dose of romidepsin in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) can be given safely to&#xD;
      patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, nor what type and severity of side effects will&#xD;
      result from the combination of these treatments. This research is also being done because it&#xD;
      is not clear if the addition of the new drug romidepsin to treatment with GDP can offer&#xD;
      better results and longer survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of romidepsin that can safely be given&#xD;
      in combination with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) without causing very&#xD;
      severe side effects that are not tolerable. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the&#xD;
      one that does not cause side effects in animals. Patients are given romidepsin and GDP and&#xD;
      watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are&#xD;
      not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then more patients are asked to join the&#xD;
      study and are given a higher dose of romidepsin (with GDP). Patients joining the study later&#xD;
      on will get higher doses of romidepsin (with GDP) than patients who join earlier. This will&#xD;
      continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher&#xD;
      than that will not be given.&#xD;

    <description>Combination of GDP with romidepsin at the maximum tolerated doses of these agents will identify the combination regimen for comparison in the subsequent randomized phase II trial; if romidepsin appears to improve the activity of GDP, then this will move forward to a formal phase III comparison to CHOP.&#xD;
Primary end points are toxicity, the maximum administered dose and the recommended phase II dose.</description>

    <description>A traditional phase I dose escalation design is proposed to assess the feasibility and tolerability of romidepsin in combination with GDP, where treatment will be escalated. Treatment will be given for 6 cycles unless there is evidence of progression prior to completion of the 6 cycles or tolerability to the regimen is not sustained.</description>
