  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate sleep disturbances during Acute uncomplicated&#xD;
      diverticulitis by polysomnography. The investigators hypothesis is the inflammation causes&#xD;
      REM(rapid eye movement)-sleep reduction and this is correlated with plasma cytokine levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of experimental studies have showed that inflammation can induce&#xD;
      disturbances in sleep architecture, mediated by cytokines. Sleep is important both in health&#xD;
      and disease processes and can affect recovery, morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have been done on sleep disturbances after major and minor GI-surgery but never in&#xD;
      relation to none surgical inflammatory diseases, namely acute diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate sleep architecture by Polysomnography and inflammation by levels&#xD;
      of pro inflammatory cytokines in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following methods will be applied&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device: Polysomnograph - Embla Titanium (Natus Medical Incorporated, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF(tumor necrosis factor-alfa)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Plasma CRP(C reactive protein) and leukocytes&#xD;
