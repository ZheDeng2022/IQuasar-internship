      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Resveratrol is a compound found in the skin of red grapes. It is being tested to see if it&#xD;
      can have positive effects on human health. Lab studies show that it may help lower blood&#xD;
      sugar, improve heart and blood vessel health, and prevent cancer. Researchers want to test&#xD;
      different dose levels of Resveratrol to see what kind of effects it has on older overweight&#xD;
      people. It will be tested in healthy volunteers at least 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the effects of different dose levels of Resveratrol on heart and blood vessel&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy overweight nonsmoking volunteers at least 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve a screening visit and four study visits. Some of the study&#xD;
           visits will involve overnight inpatient stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. They will be given a list of foods that they should avoid&#xD;
           eating while on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be separated into three groups. Two groups will take different dose&#xD;
           levels of the study drug. The third group will take a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first study visit, participants will stay in the clinical center overnight for 2&#xD;
           days of tests. They will provide blood and urine samples and have body scans to measure&#xD;
           fat and muscle mass. They will also have exercise tests. A muscle biopsy will also be&#xD;
           performed. At this visit, they will receive their dose of the study drug. They will&#xD;
           continue to take this dose for as long as they are on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second visit will be 16 weeks after the first one. It will take only 2 hours, and&#xD;
           repeat most of the tests from the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third visit will be 16 weeks later. It will involve an overnight stay. Most of the&#xD;
           tests from the second visit will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fourth and final visit will be 16 weeks later. It will involve an overnight stay.&#xD;
           Most of the tests from the initial study visit (including the scans and the exercise&#xD;
           tests) will be repeated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resveratrol is found in the leaves and skin of grapes, in peanuts and in the roots of the&#xD;
      plant polygonum cupsidatum. Although used since early years in Indian Ayurvedic and Chinese&#xD;
      medicine, it came into prominence in the 1990 s as it was believed to be the major reason for&#xD;
      the positive effect of wine on cardiovascular health and the French Paradox. Since then,&#xD;
      studies have shown that resveratrol affects a number of key cellular pathways and molecular&#xD;
      targets with a wide range of biological effects. Noted among these are its effects on the&#xD;
      blood vessels, cancer, blood clotting, blood sugar control, cognition, muscle activity and&#xD;
      inflammation. Resveratrol also may produce some of the same effects as decreased food intake,&#xD;
      perhaps through its action on a molecule in the body called Sirtuin, which is important&#xD;
      because this is one of the only approaches that has consistently demonstrated beneficial&#xD;
      effects on the aging process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resveratrol s action and pharmacology has been extensively studied in test tubes, cells, and&#xD;
      animals but is only now being explored fully in people. The animal studies include a recent&#xD;
      NIA-conducted study in monkeys that demonstrated a reduction in the stiffness of blood vessel&#xD;
      over several weeks. Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies in healthy human volunteers or in patients&#xD;
      with type II diabetes mellitus have begun to identify possible roles for resveratrol as a&#xD;
      dietary supplement and the compound appears to have no harmful effects at doses up to 5 grams&#xD;
      per day. There is also growing interest in pharmacological interventions targeting&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis and type II diabetes to prevent&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a 12-month trial of resVida (an oral preparation of resveratrol) in 120&#xD;
      randomized overweight/obese people over the age of 50 (40 in each group). This is a Phase 1&#xD;
      and 2 double-blind randomized study. One of two doses of study compound (75mg twice daily or&#xD;
      150mg twice daily) or placebo will be self-administered twice a day for 52 weeks to&#xD;
      participants 50 years or older. The primary endpoint will be vascular stiffness (as measured&#xD;
      by Pulse Wave Velocity) and the secondary endpoint will be exercise capacity as measured by&#xD;
      oxygen utilization (VO2max). Testing will be done on the levels of resveratrol in the blood&#xD;
      with different doses of the compound. The study will also include measurements of changes in&#xD;
      blood glucose levels, inflammation, and exercise capacity. Targeted, quantitative&#xD;
      metabolomics assays in blood will be performed to test whether concentrations of small&#xD;
      metabolites previously shown to be associated with arterial stiffness, including free&#xD;
      oxysterols, amino acids, acycarnitines and glycerophospholipids are modulated by resveratrol.&#xD;
      These studies will provide necessary information for further testing of resVida as a compound&#xD;
      that could promote healthy aging.&#xD;
