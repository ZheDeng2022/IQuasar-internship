  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This human pharmacokinetic study investigates, whether processes of drug metabolism and&#xD;
      transport are determined by genetic or hereditary factors. Therefore, approved drugs are&#xD;
      applied to twins and metabolism and transport processes are investigated.&#xD;
