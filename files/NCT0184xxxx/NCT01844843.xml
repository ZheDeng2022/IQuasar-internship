  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to evaluate, after implantation of a drug eluting stent (DES),&#xD;
      coverage of the stent struts by new tissue. The evaluation will be performed by means of&#xD;
      intravascular imaging technology (optical frequency domain imaging, OFDI). Renewed tissue&#xD;
      coverage over the implanted stent struts prevents direct contact between blood and&#xD;
      metal/polymer, which could lead to adverse events: patients need to take blood-thinning drugs&#xD;
      to prevent these events. Ous new stent has drug and polymer only on the outside of the stent,&#xD;
      and the polymer is degraded by the body leaving a bare metal stent after 3-4 months. This&#xD;
      should allow fast coverage of the struts, and might allow to reduce duration of the&#xD;
      supportive medical treatment. Our hypothesis is that &lt;20% of the struts remain uncovered at 3&#xD;
      months after implantation, as assessed by OFDI.&#xD;

      We will enroll patients with multiple coronary lesions, which, as is routine practice, will&#xD;
      be treated with the new DES in 2 sessions (second one approximately 3-5 weeks after the first&#xD;
      one). We will assess lesions by OFDI after the implantation and at the time of 3 months&#xD;
      follow-up, when we will ask patients to undergo a coronary angiography. Patients will then&#xD;
      have a follow-up contact at 1 year after initial implantation.&#xD;
