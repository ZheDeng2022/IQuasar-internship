  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate subjective sleep quality and fatigue during and&#xD;
      after Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis assessed by questionnaires and a sleep-diary. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesis is that subjective sleep and fatigue are correlated with the&#xD;
      inflammatory activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of experimental studies have showed that inflammation can induce&#xD;
      disturbances in sleep architecture, mediated by cytokines. some studies showed that cytokines&#xD;
      also induce daytime fatigue. In this study the investigators aim to describe the patient&#xD;
      experiences of sleep and fatigue during the acute inflammation and the recovery, and the&#xD;
      investigators seek to exam the correlation of fatigue with Polysomnography-measured night&#xD;
      sleep and cytokine levels in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following methods will be applied&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other: Karolinska Sleepiness Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other: Physical Fatigue Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other: Visual Analog Scale and 10 point-scales to measure fatigue, general well-being,&#xD;
           subjective sleep and pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other: Sleep-diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device: Polysomnograph - Embla Titanium (Natus Medical Incorporated, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure: Plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-alfa(tumor necrosis factor))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure: Plasma CRP(C reactive protein) and leukocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device: Wrist-Actigraph - Octagonal Basic Motionlogger, Ambulatory monitoring Inc, New&#xD;
