    <textblock>
      RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patients effectively treated weekly with SC (subcutaneous)&#xD;
      Abatacept will be switched to IV (intravenous) Abatacept and restarted with SC Abatacept four&#xD;
      after IV application. The investigators hypothesize that a switch from SC- to IV-abatacept&#xD;
      and back in patients with low disease activity is safe and not associated with a worsening of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abatacept is a recombinant fusion protein composed of the Fc region of the Immunoglobulin&#xD;
      IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain human cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4)&#xD;
      modified to prevent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement fixation.&#xD;
      Abatacept is a selective co-simulation modulator that inhibits the co-stimulation of T-cells.&#xD;
      Abatacept is currently approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is useful in symptom&#xD;
      reduction and delaying the progression of structural damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease. With the introduction of biological&#xD;
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (biologics), the options for the treatment of&#xD;
      RA have dramatically changed. Abatacept is currently the only biologic to be available in&#xD;
      both, a subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) formulation. The efficacy and safety profile&#xD;
      of IV-Abatacept has been well established in the last years and clinical trials comparing&#xD;
      SC-Abatacept with IV-Abatacept have clearly demonstrated an equal efficacy and safety&#xD;
      profile. Importantly, switching from IV- to SC-Abatacept appears to be associated with a&#xD;
      persisting good efficacy of Abatacept and no increase of adverse events (AE). On the other&#xD;
      hand, however, switching from SC- to IV-Abatacept has not been the subject of clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase IV study is aimed at reviewing both the transition from weekly SC- to a single&#xD;
      IV-Abatacept but also the return to weekly SC treatments after a 4 week break. Holiday&#xD;
      seasons can present a major problem to RA patients treated with weekly subcutaneous&#xD;
      biologics, including SC-Abatacept. Therefore an evaluation into the use of IV-Abatacept&#xD;
      treatment to cover a 4 week break may present an acceptable treatment alternative for this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
