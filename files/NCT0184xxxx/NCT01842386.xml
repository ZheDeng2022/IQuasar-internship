      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy people have white blood cells that protect them against bacteria, viruses, and&#xD;
           fungi. However, some people have diseases which cause the body to make white blood cells&#xD;
           that do not work properly. These white blood cells can attack the body s own proteins.&#xD;
           These types of diseases are called anti-cytokine autoantibody-associated diseases. They&#xD;
           can cause severe illnesses and even death. They are also difficult to treat with&#xD;
           standard drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab is a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It attacks white blood cells&#xD;
           that do not work properly. Currently, it is not approved for treating anti-cytokine&#xD;
           autoantibody-associated diseases. However, researchers think that it may be able to help&#xD;
           treat people with these immune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if rituximab is a safe and effective treatment for anti-cytokine&#xD;
      autoantibody-associated diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have anti-cytokine autoantibody-associated&#xD;
           diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must also be enrolled in a related immune disorder study at the National&#xD;
           Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last 24 months. Participants will take rituximab for 6 months and have&#xD;
           follow-up visits for the remaining 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Other samples will be collected as needed if participants&#xD;
           currently have an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will enter the hospital for 1 week at the start of treatment. They will&#xD;
           have four doses of rituximab given 2 days apart. This first treatment will be monitored&#xD;
           with frequent blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over the next 6 months, participants will have four more doses of rituximab given about&#xD;
           1 month apart. Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and sample&#xD;
           collections as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be four follow-up study visits at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after the last dose&#xD;
           of rituximab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anticytokine autoantibodies are an important and emerging cause of disease. Anticytokine&#xD;
      autoantibody-associated diseases include disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection&#xD;
      caused by anti-interferon- &gt;= autoantibodies, severe mucocutaneous candidiasis caused by&#xD;
      anti-interleukin-17 autoantibodies, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis caused by&#xD;
      anti-granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor autoantibodies. Many subjects&#xD;
      undergoing treatments related to these diseases fail to respond or develop toxicity to long&#xD;
      term therapy. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets antibody-producing B&#xD;
      cells, has been used successfully to treat autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis),&#xD;
      as well as syndromes caused by pathogenic anticytokine autoantibodies (e.g., myasthenia&#xD;
      gravis and pemphigus vulgaris). This is a phase I, single arm, open-label study evaluating&#xD;
      the safety and clinical response to rituximab treatment in subjects (greater than or equal to&#xD;
      18 years of age; n=20) with anticytokine autoantibody-associated diseases who are intolerant&#xD;
      or refractory to conventional treatment. Rituximab will be administered as intravenous&#xD;
      infusions of 1 gram on days 1 and 15, and subsequently if indicated up to once a month for 5&#xD;
      months (plus or minue 5 days for each visit) starting on approximately day 42. Follow-up&#xD;
      visits will occur within 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months (plus or minus 2 weeks for each&#xD;
      visit) after the last infusion. Subjects will be maintained on a background of appropriate&#xD;
      therapy for their respective diseases. The safety and clinical response to rituximab will be&#xD;
      assessed by clinical and laboratory parameters while subjects are receiving rituximab, and&#xD;
      for an additional year and a half after completion of treatment. Patients may be retreated at&#xD;
      the discretion of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
