  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the accuracy of actigraph measured sleep compared&#xD;
      to the golden standard (polysomnography) during Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is the actigraph is accurate for sleep-monitoring for this group of patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The actigraph has been proven to measured sleep data with an accuracy about 80% (compared&#xD;
      with Polysomnography) in patients who have undergone surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But this accuracy has not been validated in relation to none surgical inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
      This study will investigate the accuracy of actigraph measured sleep in diverticulitis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following methods will be applied&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device: Wrist-Actigraph - Octagonal Basic Motionlogger, Ambulatory monitoring Inc, New York,&#xD;
      USA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other: Sleep-diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device: Polysomnograph - Embla Titanium (Natus Medical Incorporated, USA)&#xD;
