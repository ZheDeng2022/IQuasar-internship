  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of a self directed video strategy will be compared to a face to face neonatal&#xD;
      resuscitation training program. The hypothesis is that both strategies are equivalent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NRP is becoming more and more a self learning program followed by a written test and&#xD;
      practical hands-on evaluation; but the way the practical skills are taught and practiced has&#xD;
      not been uniformly determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current strategies for teaching involve resuscitation instructors. There are several&#xD;
      difficulties in the developing world to achieve the objective of having a provider trained in&#xD;
      neonatal resuscitation in every delivery. Part of this problem is due to the lack of&#xD;
      instructors and-or budget constraint in addition to logistic difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Hypothesis is that a well developed self administered video complemented by a self&#xD;
      practice using a mannequin will allow providers to reach at least similar performances on the&#xD;
      initial steps and mask ventilation for neonatal resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that a self administrated video jointly with&#xD;
      a mannequin give similar results than the current Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP), a&#xD;
      pre-validated Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)hands-on course provided by a&#xD;
      certified instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effectiveness of two different teaching strategies on the quality of the&#xD;
      ventilation of a mannequin, using a mask by NAÏVE providers. In two different moments,&#xD;
      approximately 15 minutes after having taken the course and at a mean of 3 months afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different groups of novice providers will be randomly selected to receive one of the&#xD;
      following teaching strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. A Video based Self instruction with simultaneous video triggered practice with a mannequin&#xD;
      without instructor feedback (Spanish in South America, English in North America) on initial&#xD;
      steps and adequate mask ventilation for neonatal resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. A pre standardized hands on lesson will be offered by a NRP certified instructor followed&#xD;
      by a debriefing session per a pre-validated OSCE protocol (current standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, all the subjects will be invited to ventilate a mannequin with a standardized&#xD;
      instruction (tbd for example…2 minutes ventilation, rate 40 to 60 and the necessary pressure&#xD;
      to slightly reach chest rising). This performance will be digitally recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two independent certified instructors will evaluate the performance, blinded to the assigned&#xD;
      group. A previously validated OSCE (objective structured clinical evaluation) performance&#xD;
      evaluation grid will be used. The gold standard will consist on a high quality performance&#xD;
      done by an NRP instructor.&#xD;
