  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis is an important pathophysiological response to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and&#xD;
      modulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Recent studies have suggested that endogenous&#xD;
      angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin/collagen XVIII might play an important role in the&#xD;
      secondary brain injury following TBI. The aim of this study was to investigate early changes&#xD;
      in the concentrations of CSF endostatin/collagen XVIII after TBI and evaluated the relations&#xD;
      of endostatin/collagen XVIII to injury severity and clinical outcome. Endostatin/collagen&#xD;
      XVIII concentrations were measured serially for 1 week after hospitalization by using the&#xD;
      enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method in the cerebrospinal fluid of 30 patients with TBI&#xD;
      and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less on admission. Comparative analysis were used to&#xD;
      determine if its serial changes correlate with the GCS score and prognosis. Receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic curve was used to appraise the value of CSF endostatin/collagen&#xD;
      XVIII levels in predicting the prognosis of patients with severe head injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less) requiring continuous lumbar&#xD;
      drainage of CSF were included in the study. Patients delivered within 4 h whose highest&#xD;
      abbreviated injury score was 3 or less (other than head injury) were considered to be&#xD;
      isolated TBI cases and were included. To avoid interfering factors, patients who suffered&#xD;
      open or combined injuries, had existing prior neurological disease were excluded. Those who&#xD;
      died within the first week of hospitalization and/or whose serial cerebrospinal fluid samples&#xD;
      could not be obtained were also excluded as having incomplete data. Accordingly, 30 patients&#xD;
      were analyzed in this study. Demographic data, including age, gender, mechanism of trauma and&#xD;
      GCS score at admission were documented when the patients arrived at the emergency room. The&#xD;
      control group comprised 20 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid was examined via lumbar&#xD;
      puncture for investigation of suspected neurological disease. All patients had normal&#xD;
      neurological examination, negative imaging studies, and none had evidence of trauma or&#xD;
      preexisting neurological disease, including tumors, vascular anomalies, or abnormalities of&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid. The study had approval from the hospital ethics committee and informed&#xD;
      consent for participating in the study was obtained from an appropriate member of each&#xD;
      patient's family before performance of lumbar drainage.&#xD;

        Of the 30 patients with severe TBI, twenty were male and ten were female. The patients' age&#xD;
        ranged from 16 to 82 years, with mean age of 51.1 years. The mechanisms of trauma included&#xD;
        motor vehicle collisions, falls, heavy strikes (patients who were hit by heavy objects such&#xD;
        as bricks, sticks, or falling objects) and assaults. Types of lesions, as evidenced by&#xD;
        radiologic and neurologic symptoms or signs, included cerebral contusions/lacerations,&#xD;
        intracranial hematomas, brain stem injury and diffuse axonal injury.&#xD;
