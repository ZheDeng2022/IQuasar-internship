    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating patients with hairy cell&#xD;
      leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR])&#xD;
      of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) at 32 weeks after beginning therapy with single-agent ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the toxicity and tolerability of single-agent ibrutinib when administered&#xD;
      to patients with HCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of single-agent&#xD;
      ibrutinib when administered to patients with HCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the rate of molecular remission (minimal residual disease [MRD]-negative&#xD;
      CR) among all patients, defined as resolution of all detectable disease below the limits of&#xD;
      detection by immunohistochemistry and/or 4-color flow cytometry assay at 32 weeks after&#xD;
      beginning ibrutinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize immunologic outcomes during single agent ibrutinib administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore the effect of ibrutinib (PCI-32765) on traditional and new biomarkers in HCL&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Va. Confirmation of expression BRAFV600E in leukemia cells Vb. Pharmacodynamic effects of BTK&#xD;
      inhibition on phosphorylated (phospho) ERK regulation, as well as other potential protein&#xD;
      kinase targets of ibrutinib (exploratory) Vc. Serum soluble IL-2 receptor correlation with&#xD;
      response to ibrutinib therapy Vd. Documentation of and quantification of minimal residual&#xD;
      disease following maximal response, with flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemical&#xD;
      stains of the bone marrow, as predictors of remission duration after ibrutinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 8 cycles if lack of response to therapy, up to 12 cycles if failure to achieve&#xD;
      an objective response (CR/PR), or continually at per physician discretion in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

             exceeding 10% of body weight over the preceding 6 months, Cancer Therapy Evaluation&#xD;
             Program (CTEP) active version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
             (CTCAE) grade 2 or 3 fatigue, fevers &gt; 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit (F) or night sweats&#xD;
             for greater than 2 weeks without evidence of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with classic hairy cell leukemia may receive therapy under the following&#xD;
             conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  After at least 1 prior purine nucleoside analog-containing regimen (fludarabine,&#xD;
                  pentostatin, or cladribine), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relapsed or de novo disease if deemed medically unfit for therapy with a purine&#xD;
                  nucleoside analog&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Because there is no recognized standard of care for patients with variant&#xD;
                       hairy cell leukemia, both previously treated and previously untreated&#xD;
                       patients with this diagnosis will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL, and/or creatinine clearance (estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rate [GFR] [Cockcroft-Gault]) &gt;= 30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless disease related or due to&#xD;

             x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients with HCL are typically pancytopenic at presentation for treatment,&#xD;
             patients will be eligible without respect to baseline peripheral blood cell counts if&#xD;
             they otherwise meet inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ibrutinib on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason,&#xD;
             and because tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry; female patients who are of&#xD;
             non-reproductive potential (i.e., post-menopausal by history - no menses for &gt;= 1&#xD;
             year; or history of hysterectomy; or history of bilateral tubal ligation; or history&#xD;
             of bilateral oophorectomy); female patients of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry; male and female patients who agree to&#xD;
             use highly effective methods of birth control (e.g., condoms, implants, injectables,&#xD;
             combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices [IUDs], complete sexual&#xD;
             abstinence, or sterilized partner) during the period of therapy and for 90 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of study drug; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy =&lt; 21 days prior to first administration of study treatment and/or&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody =&lt; 6 weeks prior to first administration of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition as ibrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ibrutinib is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4/5; patients who received a strong&#xD;
             cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor within 7 days prior to the first dose of ibrutinib&#xD;
             or patients who require continuous treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor; therefore,&#xD;
             any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 should be&#xD;
             discontinued; patients unable to change these medications must be excluded from&#xD;
             participation; because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is&#xD;
             important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list; medical reference texts such&#xD;
             as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information; as part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements; recent infections requiring systemic treatment need to have&#xD;
             completed therapy &gt; 14 days before the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with ibrutinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with ibrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients will be eligible unless they have&#xD;
             been previously diagnosed with an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining&#xD;
             illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin) or who have taken&#xD;
             warfarin within 28 days prior to enrollment are not eligible due to a potential&#xD;
             increased risk of hemorrhage; patients who are currently taking vitamin K antagonists&#xD;
             are also ineligible for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring daily corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent of &gt;= 20 mg daily&#xD;
             should not be enrolled; if corticosteroids can be discontinued (or reduced to &lt; 20 mg&#xD;
             per day of prednisone or equivalent), the discontinuation or dose reduction should be&#xD;
             done at least 7 days prior to first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of prior malignancy, with the exception of the following:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Currently active clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as: uncontrolled&#xD;
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as&#xD;
             defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification or history of&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months&#xD;
             prior to first dose with study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is unable to swallow capsules, or has disease significantly affecting&#xD;
             gastrointestinal function or resection of the stomach or small bowel, or symptomatic&#xD;

             hepatitis C antibody must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to&#xD;
             enrollment; (PCR positive patients will be excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy other than corticosteroids (e.g.,&#xD;
