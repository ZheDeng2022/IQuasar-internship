  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goals of this proposal are to 1) identify the network of brain regions&#xD;
      specifically activated by personal smoking environment cues and 2) to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      exposure to these cues on smoke self-administration and subjective reactivity. The results of&#xD;
      this study will inform the development of novel and more efficacious cue-exposures therapies&#xD;
      targeted at helping smokers quit smoking and will provide novel mechanism information&#xD;
      regarding the influence of environmental context on drug taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesizes that cue-exposure treatments (CETs), in which drug use is&#xD;
      prevented during exposure to drug cues (e.g. lit cigarette) have been of limited efficacy in&#xD;
      part because they have not included cues representative of the contexts in which drug use&#xD;
      occurs. By demonstrating that context cues have a differential and robust influence on brain&#xD;
      and behavioral responses, we will have provided a substantial basis for including such&#xD;
      stimuli in the context of treatment. At the same time, we will have identified novel&#xD;
      mechanisms by which such stimuli promote continued drug use and relapse.&#xD;
