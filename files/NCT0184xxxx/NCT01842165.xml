      The purpose of this study is to determine if 68Gallium-octreotate and 18Fluorodesoxyglucose&#xD;
      uptake, apparent diffusion coefficient and post 177Lu-octreotate SPECT/CT dosimetry are&#xD;
      reliable predictors for lesion-by-lesion treatment outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study evaluating the use of 177Lutetium-octreotate in the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced refractory Neuroendocrine Tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary (on a lesion basis): To assess the value of the following parameters (obtained&#xD;
           through functional and molecular imaging) for predicting the lesion-by-lesion PRRT&#xD;
           treatment outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  18FDG uptake on 18FDG PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  68Ga-octreotate uptake on 68Ga-octreotate PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Apparent diffusion coefficient on diffusion weighted MRI (for these 3 parameters,&#xD;
                absolute values at baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tumor dosimetry on post 177Lu-octreotate SPECT/CT after each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary (on a patient basis): To generate a patient-based response model based on the&#xD;
           previously defined parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploratory (on a lesion basis): To assess the value of the parameters mentioned in the&#xD;
           primary objective for predicting the lesion-by-lesion PRRT treatment outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  absolute values of the three imaging parameters and their relative changes after&#xD;
                each cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  serial tumor dosimetry on post-177Lu-octreotate SPECT/CT after each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will consist of 177Lu-octreotate injections in fixed activities of 7,4 GigaBecqurel&#xD;
      each, given 11-13 weeks apart, injected intravenously with simultaneous infusion of an amino&#xD;
      acid solution. (Before amino acid nephroprotection, ondansetron, methylprednisolone and&#xD;
      metoclopramid, are given intravenously in order to prevent nausea or vomiting). Approximately&#xD;
      30 min after the beginning of the amino acid solution, 177Lu-octreotate is co-infused over&#xD;
      15-30 minutes. The amino acid infusion is continued at the same rate for 3-5 more hours&#xD;
      (total infusion lasts 4-6 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 4 cycles (= injections of 177Lu-octreotate) are planned. However, the total number&#xD;
      of administered cycles will be limited by critical organ (kidneys and bone marrow) threshold&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment efficacy will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on a lesion-basis (change of longest transversal diameter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on a patient-basis using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
