  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take part because they have melanoma that has spread to other&#xD;
      organs in their body (metastatic). As part of this study, patients will receive radiation&#xD;
      therapy and an approved drug (Vemurafenib).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with vemurafenib plus radiation therapy (RT) based upon the&#xD;
      administration schedule. The starting dose of vemurafenib will be the patient's baseline&#xD;
      tolerating dose, between 720 - and 960 mg by mouth. Patients must be tolerating at a minimum&#xD;
      720mg for one cycle (28 days) prior to enrollment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of BRAFV600 mutated Stage IV or unresectable Stage III melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Actively receiving treatment with vemurafenib as single agent and tolerating at least&#xD;
             720 mg bid for one cycle (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigator, patients who are progressing in an area where&#xD;
             radiation may provide benefit from either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptom control&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oligo-progression, defined as progression in up to 3 areas where focal treatment&#xD;
                  would provide benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases will be allowed provided they meet all of the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Small, &lt; 1cm metastases which are untreated are allowed so long as in the opinion&#xD;
                  of the investigator they do not require immediate treatment by radiation or&#xD;
                  surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Asymptomatic, treated brain metastases which are stable for 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  study entry are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If patients are requiring steroids for their brain metastases, they must be on a&#xD;
                  stable dose for two weeks prior to study entry, and maintain that steroid dosing&#xD;
                  during the radiation treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function as defined by: ANC &gt; 1.0 k/uL, Platelets &gt; 75 k/uL,&#xD;
             Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function: Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit&#xD;
             of normal, ALT/AST &lt; 2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening for women of child bearing potential within&#xD;
             10 days of starting vemurafenib treatment . Women of non-childbearing potential may be&#xD;
             included if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for &gt; 1&#xD;
             year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fertile men and women must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control during&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent to an approved consent form that conforms&#xD;
             to federal and institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  Screening QTc interval &gt; 450 msec on EKG&#xD;

          -  Known HIV positivity or AIDS-related illness, or active HBV, or active HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following within the 6 months prior to study drug administration:&#xD;

             graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring&#xD;
             medication, uncontrolled hypertension, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack, or symptomatic pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malabsorption disorder that would preclude adequate vemurafenib absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical condition present that in the opinion of the investigator will hinder&#xD;
             the subjects ability to complete the study.&#xD;
