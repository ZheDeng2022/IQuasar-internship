      Objective: The investigators aim to evaluate the impact of a &quot; limitations &quot; section in&#xD;
      systematic review's abstract on results' interpretation by readers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized ratio 1:1 controlled trial with two parallel arms. Participants will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in an online survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Eligible participants are corresponding authors of randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      published between 2010 and 2012 and referenced in pubmed Intervention: The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of the presence of a &quot; limitations &quot; section in abstract of systematic&#xD;
      review with meta-analysis. The investigators selected abstracts of meta-analysis published in&#xD;
      the journal Annals of Internal Medicine between 2006 and 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected abstract will be standardised and the treatment's name hidden. The two groups of&#xD;
      abstract will be presented as follow: 1) abstract with &quot; limitations &quot; section and 2)&#xD;
      abstract without &quot; limitations &quot; section: the &quot; limitations &quot; section of the original&#xD;
      abstract will be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected participants are invited by e-mail to answer the survey. After reading one abstract&#xD;
      from his group a randomization they are invited two answer 5 questions about their&#xD;
      interpretation of the meta-analysis's results.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of a &quot; limitations &quot; section in&#xD;
      systematic review's abstract on results' interpretation by readers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study is a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. The study&#xD;
      follows the CONSORT 2010 statements Participant will be invited to participate in an on-line&#xD;
      survey with a secured web site. Participants, after a characteristic description will be&#xD;
      randomized in one of the two arms: 1) abstract with a &quot; limitations &quot; section 2) abstract&#xD;
      without a &quot; limitations &quot; section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY Eligible participants are corresponding authors of randomized trials published&#xD;
      between 2010 and 2012 and referenced in pubmed core set journal&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION We will evaluate the impact of the presence of a &quot; limitations &quot; section in&#xD;
      abstract of systematic review with meta-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION OF ABSTRACTS We will retrieve all systematic review with meta-analysis published in&#xD;
      the journals Annals of Internal Medicine between the years 2006 and 2012, about health care&#xD;
      intervention with a conclusion in favor the experimental treatment or intervention. We&#xD;
      exclude updates, diagnostical, genetical, epidemiological or economical evaluation and&#xD;
      multiple or indirect comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MODIFICATION OF ABSTRACTS All selected abstracts will be standardised. Treatment name will be&#xD;
      replaced with &quot;experimental treatment A&quot;, control treatment will be replaced by &quot;control&#xD;
      treatment B&quot; if necessary in the title and in the abstract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups of abstract will be presented as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Abstract with &quot; limitations &quot; section&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Abstract without &quot; limitations &quot; section: the &quot; limitations &quot; section of the original&#xD;
           abstract will be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES PRIMARY OUTCOME The primary outcome will be, the readers' recommendation of the&#xD;
      experimental treatment A&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES Secondary outcomes will evaluate the interpretation of the results of the&#xD;
      meta-analysis. The readers will answers the following questions, with the choice of answers&#xD;
      based on a 10-point Likert scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How would you rate the quality of the systematic review?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How confident are you in the results of this systematic review?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do you consider that the experimental treatment A is a proven effective treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How confident are you in the validity of the conclusion that the authors draw? NUMBER OF&#xD;
           PARTICIPANT A power analysis was conducted to estimate the number of subject&#xD;
           (participants) needed to achieve a power of 0.9 and an alpha value of 0.05 to discern a&#xD;
           different of effect size of 0.4 between the two versions of abstract. This resulted in&#xD;
           an estimate to the need of recruit a minimum of 133 participants in each arm, either a&#xD;
           total of 266 participants STATISTICAL ANALYSIS We will analyze data with R project&#xD;
           software, in intention to treat. Data for quantitative variables are expressed with&#xD;
           medians and interquartile (IQR) ranges. Qualitative variables are expressed with&#xD;
           frequencies and percentages and missing data Primary analysis will compare means of the&#xD;
           primary outcome between the 2 groups with a Student t test.&#xD;
