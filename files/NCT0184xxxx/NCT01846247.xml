      Phase 3, multicenter, international randomized controlled trial of a Very Early&#xD;
      Mobilization(VEM) care rehabilitation protocol compared to standard post stroke care (SC).&#xD;
      Participants receive either SC and VEM or SC alone in the acute phase of stroke up to a&#xD;
      period of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed up by a blinded assessor at 3 and 12 months post stroke to&#xD;
      determine trial outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who suffer a stroke are often left with disabilities such as weakness, or problems&#xD;
      with speech, thinking, or control or bodily functions. Severe strokes often result in death.&#xD;
      The results of a recent European study indicated that patients who commence mobility training&#xD;
      very early after a stroke (Day 1) recover the ability to walk more quickly and return home&#xD;
      sooner and in greater numbers than those who start training one week or later after stroke.&#xD;
      Recently a phase II (pilot) AVERT study was conducted in which the investigators tested the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of very early mobilisation (European model) Stroke patients in this&#xD;
      study randomly received either standard care or very early mobilisation (VEM). The study&#xD;
      showed that there was no harm to patients in the VEM group compared to those who had standard&#xD;
      care and that delivering VEM was feasible. Consequently, a grant to conduct the larger phase&#xD;
      III study, to test the effectiveness of the intervention was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this next phase III trial, the investigators aim to look at 2104 patients across stroke&#xD;
      care units in city and regional hospitals. Each hospital will be asked to include between 30&#xD;
      and 60 patients per year to the study. All stroke patients admitted to the hospital Stroke&#xD;
      Unit or ward at the hospital will be invited to participate. Medical clearance will be&#xD;
      obtained for all potential participants. Those unconscious or too ill, together with those&#xD;
      already participating in acute drug trials will be excluded. Patients who are able will&#xD;
      provide their own consent to participate. Those who are not able to consent for themselves&#xD;
      will have a third party (usually a relative) acknowledge their participation in the study. As&#xD;
      this is a blinded controlled trial, keeping the assessor and patients unaware of their&#xD;
      treatment group is important. The investigators will inform patients that they will have a&#xD;
      50% chance of receiving one of two rehabilitation types during their hospitalization if they&#xD;
      decide to participate. Patients in the VEM group will commence treatment within 24 hours of&#xD;
      admission to hospital. VEM will be provided by a trained AVERT physiotherapist, and AVERT&#xD;
      study nurse and aims to improve functional mobility. The mobilization activities will depend&#xD;
      on the patient's functional ability and tolerance to exercise. Patients will be closely&#xD;
      monitored prior to mobilization and will only be mobilised if they meet requirements for&#xD;
      blood pressure and other vital signs. The number of sessions and the time spent for each&#xD;
      patient will vary, however specific targets are to be met according to the intervention&#xD;
      protocol. The content and timing of all treatment received by participants in either group&#xD;
      will be recorded. The treatment period for this study is from the time of the patients&#xD;
      consent, until day 14 or discharge from the stroke unit or ward. (Whichever is earlier). All&#xD;
      participants will be assessed at admission to the study, 3 months, and 12 months after their&#xD;
      stroke. Information collected by the AVERT physiotherapists and nurses and the assessor will&#xD;
      be recorded on individual case record forms and on a secure web based data base. Therapists&#xD;
      also add some information to a palm pilot, and then download it onto the secure website. All&#xD;
      information collected from patients will be treated as confidential in line with&#xD;
      international guidelines and local law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for the study is the number of patients dead and disabled at 3&#xD;
      months after stroke. Other secondary outcome measures include the safety of patients, quality&#xD;
      of life, and cost effectiveness. An independent Data Monitoring committee will monitor the&#xD;
      safety, conduct and efficacy of the trial. In addition, an independent outcomes committee&#xD;
      will be reviewing all events that are reported as serious.&#xD;
