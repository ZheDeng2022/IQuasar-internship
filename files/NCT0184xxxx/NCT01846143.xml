  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what effects (good and bad) experimental phosphopeptide&#xD;
      vaccines plus a tetanus peptide and other substances called polyICLC and Montanide ISA-51&#xD;
      have on people with melanoma. The investigators will also look at whether the experimental&#xD;
      reagents cause any changes in the immune system.&#xD;

The vaccines will be administered in two treatment cycles. During cycle one, three vaccines will be administered over a 3-week period on days 1, 8, and 15. During cycle two, three vaccines will be administered over a 9-week period on days 36, 57, 78. Participants will be vaccinated with 100 mcg each of the phosphopeptides and 200 mcg of the tetanus peptide (Peptide-tet). The peptides will be administered subcutaneously (0.5 ml) and intradermally (0.5 ml) in Montanide ISA-51 VG adjuvant at six separate vaccine sites in a minimum of two separate extremities.&#xD;
Poly ICLC: PolyICLC will be administered by a separate 0.5 ml injection (0.25 ml subcutaneously and 0.25 ml intradermally), immediately after, and directly into the precise site where the peptide emulsion was given. We will administer 1 mg per vaccine.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histologically or cytologically proven high-risk or advanced solid malignancies including&#xD;
        melanoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or non small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
        (NSCLC) that meets one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Melanoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Arms A and B: Stage IIIB-IV melanoma rendered clinically free of disease by surgery,&#xD;
        other therapy, or spontaneous remission For Arm C: Stage IIA-IV melanoma rendered&#xD;
        clinically free of disease by surgery, other therapy, or spontaneous remission For all&#xD;
        Arms: Stage III or IV melanoma with disease, for patients who have failed other approved&#xD;
        therapies, are not candidates for approved therapies, or refuse other approved therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Staging will be based on the 7th edition AJCC staging system for melanoma and other&#xD;
        cancers. Staging of mucosal melanomas will be based on the following system modified from&#xD;
        the cutaneous melanoma staging system: IIA: 2.01- 4mm primary, or stage IIB: &gt; 4mm primary,&#xD;
        lymph node metastases = stage III, distant metastases = stage IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Breast cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Metastatic stage IV or unresectable breast cancer on endocrine therapy or on no other&#xD;
        systemic therapy who have had at least one prior therapy for their metastatic disease.&#xD;
        Patients who are metastatic, but with no measurable disease are eligible. Participation in&#xD;
        this study should not preclude the delivery of any approved and appropriate anti-cancer&#xD;
        therapies, but they are not to be delivered concurrent with this trial, except that&#xD;
        patients may participate while taking endocrine-only therapy (eg: aromatase inhibitors or&#xD;
        tamoxifen or Lupron). Patients may also participate during pre-planned chemotherapy&#xD;
        holidays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients after resection for stage IIIA to IV breast cancer (any ER, PR, or Her2 status)&#xD;
        after surgery, radiation therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or HER2 targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Arm C only: Stage I-II, high risk patients with either triple negative breast cancer or&#xD;
        HER2 positive disease are also eligible if the tumor is larger than 1 cm. Vaccine will be&#xD;
        offered after surgery, radiation therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy (if indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Colorectal cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Metastatic (advanced) colorectal cancer that has failed at least 2 prior chemotherapy&#xD;
        regimens, including 5-FU, ironotecan, and oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        High-risk resected metastatic colorectal cancer after resection of liver metastases and&#xD;
        after approved agents are administered. For patients after surgical resection of liver&#xD;
        metastases,&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility to Arms A and B will be limited to those with at least 3 of the following risk&#xD;
        factors: node-positive primary, disease-free interval less than 1 year, more than 1 liver&#xD;
        metastasis, size of largest liver metastasis greater than 5 cm, and serum CEA greater than&#xD;
        200 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility to Arm C will be limited to those with at least 1 of the 5 risk factors listed&#xD;
        above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ovarian cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ovarian or fallopian tube cancer that is recurrent or treatment refractory with no&#xD;
        remaining alternative, approved therapy options with a reasonable possibility of clinical&#xD;
        response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non small-cell lung cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer who have stable disease or clinical&#xD;
        response (CR/PR) after treatment with chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may have had prior therapy for this cancer in the adjuvant setting and may have&#xD;
        had 1-4 prior systemic therapies for advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may have had multiple primary melanomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with less than or equal to 5 brain metastases may be eligible as long as the&#xD;
        following 3 criteria are true:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The brain metastases have been completely removed by surgery or have been treated&#xD;
             completely by stereotactic radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiotherapy, such as gamma&#xD;
             knife, can be used up to 1 week prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. There has been no evident growth of any brain metastasis since treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No metastasis greater than 2 cm at the time of protocol entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with greater than 5 brain metastases may be eligible if the above 3 criteria are&#xD;
        met and if at least one year has elapsed since the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (Appendix 3) Ability and willingness to give informed&#xD;
        consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have at least one intact axillary and/or inguinal lymph node basin. A patient&#xD;
        with a prior lymph node biopsy may be a candidate if lymphoscintigraphy demonstrates intact&#xD;
        drainage to a node in that basin. A lymphoscintigram may be performed during screening to&#xD;
        ensure that there is drainage to a regional node from a planned vaccine site. If the&#xD;
        lymphoscintigram is performed and a sentinel lymph node is not located, the patient will be&#xD;
        ineligible for this study if no other vaccine sites are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Laboratory parameters as follows: The following laboratory parameters will be required for&#xD;
        all participants. If a lab value appears to be an error or a result of a transient or&#xD;
        treatable condition, the investigator will use his/her clinical judgment to decide if the&#xD;
        test may be repeated. The requirements for inclusion are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-A2+&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC &gt; 1000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total lymphocyte count &gt; 500/mm3. If this value is low on initial test after prior&#xD;
             cytotoxic therapy, the test may be repeated as the patient recovers further from that&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3&#xD;

        ≤ 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serology (within 6 months of study entry) HIV negative Hepatitis C negative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LDH up to 2 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must be 18 years or older at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have recurred or progressed either after or during administration of a cancer&#xD;
        vaccine may be eligible to enroll 12 weeks following their last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;

        inclusion criteria section of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are currently receiving systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, or other&#xD;
        experimental therapy, or who have received this therapy within the preceding 4 weeks. Gamma&#xD;
