  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of viral therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that has returned (come back)&#xD;
      after a period of improvement or has spread to other parts of the body or breast cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to other parts of the body. A virus called encoding thyroidal sodium iodide&#xD;
      symporter, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells without&#xD;
      damaging normal cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intratumoral&#xD;
      administration of an Edmonston strain measles virus genetically engineered to express human&#xD;
      thyroidal sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) (oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium&#xD;
      iodide symporter [MV-NIS]) in patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck&#xD;
      cancer. II. To determine the safety and toxicity of intratumoral administration of MV-NIS in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer and metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess in a preliminary fashion antitumor efficacy of&#xD;
      this approach by following, radiographic response, and time to progression. TERTIARY&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination&#xD;
      and biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with&#xD;
      MV-NIS using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      imaging. II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence&#xD;
      following intratumoral administration. III. To determine humoral and cellular immune response&#xD;
      to the injected virus. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oncolytic&#xD;
      measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter intratumorally (IT) on day 1. After&#xD;
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1&#xD;
      year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;
