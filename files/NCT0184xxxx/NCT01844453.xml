    <textblock>
      The application of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) has provided remarkable opportunities for&#xD;
      infertile couple to conceive in the last four decades. Historically IVF was performed for&#xD;
      patients with bilateral tubal obstruction, but its use is presently widespread. Although the&#xD;
      efficacy of assisted reproductive technology continues to improve, endometrial implantation&#xD;
      remains the limiting step towards a successful pregnancy. Reduced endometrial receptivity and&#xD;
      embryonic defects are the probable primary causes of implantation failure during IVF(1).&#xD;
      Patients with repeated implantation failure despite transferring good-quality embryos&#xD;
      continue to be a major dilemma for clinicians and are a topic of great research interest.&#xD;
      Barash et al. unintentionally discovered and initially reported that an endometrial biopsy&#xD;
      prior to IVF in women who have had one or more implantation failures was associated with an&#xD;
      increased clinical pregnancy (66.7% vs 30.3%, p&lt;0.01) and live birth rates 48.9% vs 22.5%,&#xD;
      p=0.02) compared to a control group(2). The mechanism by which a local endometrial injury&#xD;
      (LEI) may increase the pregnancy rate is still not fully clear. Possible etiologies include&#xD;
      its role in promoting a beneficial local inflammatory response, inducing endometrial&#xD;
      decidualization, or improving endometrial maturation synchrony (3-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Barash et al's publication, several randomized controlled studies confirmed their&#xD;
      findings (7-11). However, there has been extensive heterogeneity among studies, including the&#xD;
      number of biopsies, how the biopsy is performed and the selected patient population. On the&#xD;
      other hand all the studies have in common that the endometrial biopsy was performed prior to&#xD;
      the start of the IVF cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal timing of an endometrial biopsy with respect to an IVF cycle is unknown. There is&#xD;
      reason to suspect that an endometrial biopsy during the follicular phase of an IVF&#xD;
      stimulation cycle may improve pregnancy outcomes, although this has not been directly&#xD;
      examined. We therefore propose a randomized controlled study to evaluate the impact of an&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy on the implantation and pregnancy rate in both the luteal phase prior to&#xD;
      the IVF cycle as well as the follicular phase of the concurrent IVF cycles.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Local endometrial injury improves implantation and pregnancy rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specifically, local endometrial injury during the follicular phase of an IVF cycle&#xD;
           improves the implantation and pregnancy rates in comparison to that in the luteal phase&#xD;
           prior to ovarian stimulation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      •To determine the impact of local endometrial injury on implantation rates in patients&#xD;
      undergoing fresh IVF cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the impact of local endometrial injury on pregnancy outcomes (biochemical&#xD;
           pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and live birth rate) in&#xD;
           patients undergoing fresh IVF cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the optimal timing for local endometrial injury (mid-luteal phase prior to&#xD;
           ovarian stimulation or early follicular phase during ovarian stimulation) to improve&#xD;
           pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if there is a correlation between endometrial biopsy pathology and IVF&#xD;
           pregnancy outcomes among patients randomized to local endometrial injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study will be a randomized controlled study (RCT) and consists of patients&#xD;
      undergoing fertility treatment with their second fresh IVF cycle, which includes ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation with gonadotropin hormones (&quot;microdose flare protocol&quot;), an oocyte collection&#xD;
      procedure and a single embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population will be randomized using computer-generated random table into three&#xD;
      arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Luteal Phase Arm: LEI in mid-luteal phase (day 21-26) prior to the treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proliferative Phase Arm: LEI in early proliferative phase of current treatment cycle&#xD;
           (day 2-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Arm: No LEI will be performed. Patients will undergo a routine fresh IVF&#xD;
           treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than the local endometrial injury, all patients will receive the same treatment and&#xD;
      follow up care as per standard practice at our clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in this study will undergo a &quot;microdose flare protocol&quot; fresh IVF cycle. As part&#xD;
      of this protocol patients are to take oral contraception pills for a month duration prior to&#xD;
      the start of the IVF cycle. Therefore the possibility of an undocumented pregnancy at the&#xD;
      time of the LEI in the luteal phase is minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LEI will be performed using the standard technique using a Pipelle sampling catheter in&#xD;
      the outpatient department. After a speculum examination is performed and the cervix is well&#xD;
      visualized, the Pipelle will be inserted gently through the cervical canal into the uterine&#xD;
      cavity and advanced slowly until resistance is noted. At this point the internal piston is&#xD;
      withdrawn to create negative suction and the Pipelle is gently maneuvered up and down&#xD;
      alongside the uterine cavity wall. The Pipelle catheter is then withdrawn gently and any&#xD;
      obtained specimen (uterine lining) will be sent for histopathological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the embryologist who prepares the embryo and the physician who will transfer the embryo&#xD;
      will not be directly aware of which study arm the patient was allocated to. However all&#xD;
      procedures performed at our clinic, including a LEI, are documented on the patients chart and&#xD;
      therefore are accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per routine practice at our clinic, pregnancy tests will be performed by quantitative&#xD;
      serum beta-hCG level 12 days after embryo transfer. A clinical pregnancy will be confirmed by&#xD;
      using a transvaginal ultrasound 2 weeks after a positive pregnancy test (serum BHCG).&#xD;
