  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the following subjects will be exposed to human rhinovirus (HRV):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  those with classification of mild-moderate asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study the kinetics of HRV-induced inflammatory and remodeling&#xD;
      responses in a well characterized group of asthmatic subjects and compare these outcomes to&#xD;
      those in a healthy, non-asthmatic control group.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although changes in the lungs, known as remodeling, are a feature of asthma, the causes and&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the process have not yet been found. Recently, it has been established&#xD;
      that remodeling can be observed in children prior to a formal diagnosis of asthma. Clinical&#xD;
      studies indicate that HRV, &quot;common cold&quot; infections, are a common cause of recurrent&#xD;
      respiratory illnesses in childhood, and children with HRV-associated wheezing episodes have&#xD;
      an increased risk of developing asthma. This led to the hypothesis that HRV infections may&#xD;
      play a central role in the start of the airway remodeling leading to asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine if alterations in relevant airway remodeling growth&#xD;
      factors differ between healthy controls and asthmatic subjects, pre- and post-HRV infection.&#xD;
      These growth factors will be assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and endobronchial&#xD;
      biopsy tissues and correlated with viral levels in both nasal lavage and BAL fluid.&#xD;
