      This is an open-label, single center clinical investigation to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Heparin-induced Extracorporeal Lipoprotein Precipitation (H.E.L.P.) Therapy as a&#xD;
      treatment for non-exudative (dry) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). A total of 14&#xD;
      clinic visits are scheduled, one baseline visit, 8 visits for H.E.L.P. therapy treatments (to&#xD;
      be performed over a period of 12 weeks for each patient) and 5 follow-up visits to be&#xD;
      performed one week following the 4th H.E.L.P. therapy session and 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36&#xD;
      weeks and 52 weeks after the final H.E.L.P. therapy session.&#xD;
