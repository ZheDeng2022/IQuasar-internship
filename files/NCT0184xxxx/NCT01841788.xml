  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A disposable, air-activated, adhesive backed heat patch is being developed to provide&#xD;
      temporary relief from minor muscular ache and joint pains associated with overexertion&#xD;
      strains and sprains as well as minor pain associated with arthritis. The aim of the study is&#xD;
      to determine the safety and tolerability of the patch during normal wear conditions.&#xD;
