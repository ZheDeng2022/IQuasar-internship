  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients&#xD;
      receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy for in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not well documented. The&#xD;
      contribution of prednisolone to CINV control in the R-CHOP regimen is also unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the overall effectiveness of antiemetic control using a&#xD;
      standardised 5HT3 (5-Hydroxytryptamine 3) antagonist-containing regimen (e.g. ondansetron) in&#xD;
      a heterogeneous group of patients receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy (Rituximab Doxorubicin&#xD;
      Vincristine Cyclophosphamide Prednisolone).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to investigate the incidence and severity of CINV in patients&#xD;
      receiving R-CHOP for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and standardised antiemetic&#xD;
      prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesises that the control of delayed nausea and emesis is suboptimal in a&#xD;
      proportion of patients receiving R-CHOP regimens and that delayed CINV is not prevented by&#xD;
      use of 5HT3 antagonists beyond the first day of use post-chemotherapy administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating institutions will prospectively collect data on the incidence of CINV, the&#xD;
      severity of CINV, the use of break through/rescue medication for episodes of CINV&#xD;
      uncontrolled by prescribed regular antiemetics, the effectiveness of additional measures used&#xD;
      when previous CINV control has been inadequate (for example the use of aprepitant as an&#xD;
      additional measure in subsequent cycles) and the major side-effects likely to be related to&#xD;
      the antiemetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of these results will determine the incidence and severity of CINV in patients&#xD;
      receiving R-CHOP and the effectiveness of the prescribed antiemetic regimens. Analysis will&#xD;
      also determine if the control and incidence of CINV is a significant problem in defined&#xD;
      subgroups of patients receiving R-CHOP and could inform the design of future research (or an&#xD;
      extension of the current protocol) in this area. Sub groups for investigation will include&#xD;
      patients with advanced disease, those with abdominal involvement, those receiving R-CHOP&#xD;
      every 14 days versus every 21 days (R-CHOP14 versus R-CHOP21), those receiving 6 or 8&#xD;
      treatment cycles of R-CHOP, older patients, younger females etc. A potential randomised study&#xD;
      evaluating the role of aprepitant could be contemplated in high risk groups.&#xD;

    <description>This is a single arm study.&#xD;
All patients receive R-CHOP every 14 or 21 days for a minimum of 3 cycles. Standard anti-emetics will be used as follows:&#xD;
5HT3 (5-Hydroxytryptamine 3) antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron or tropisetron) used as the local institutional standard of care will be permitted, although the preferential use of ondansetron or granisetron will be encouraged.&#xD;
Dexamethasone will not to be used as patients receive hydrocortisone and oral prednisolone in R-CHOP. In this study, the use of oral prednisolone on day 1 will be regarded as equivalent to dexamethasone. Prednisolone will be given PRIOR to the chemotherapy with the 5HT3 antagonist.&#xD;
Anti-emetics (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine and lorazepam) may be prescribed to be used 'as needed' for breakthrough emesis.&#xD;
Patients 'failing' the standard Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting prophylactic regimen will be eligible to receive aprepitant (Days 1 to 3) for subsequent cycles.</description>
