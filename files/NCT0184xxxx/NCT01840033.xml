  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is the reference treatment for anatomic or fonctionnal&#xD;
      chronic intestinal failure. Nutritionnal catheter must follow two rules: low infection rate&#xD;
      and be able to preserve the permeability of the central vein. Today, in europeen guidelines,&#xD;
      two types of central devices are recommended: tunnelled central catheter with cuff and&#xD;
      implanted ports. However, their insertion is not without risk. Since many years, we have seen&#xD;
      a new generation of catheter - peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line)- which have&#xD;
      many advantage over other central catheter. ESPEN guidelines accept the use of PICC line in&#xD;
      short and moderate-term for HPN, but no prospective study have look for long-term used in&#xD;
      HPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to evaluate in a prospective randomised monocenter study the&#xD;
      no-inferiority of PICC line to tunnelled central catheter with cuff for serious catheter&#xD;
      related-complications such as infection and thrombophlebitis for patient on HPN over 1 month&#xD;
      of duration. The secondary objectives are to: evaluate the number of patients with at least&#xD;
      one serious complications related in 1000 days of used, the rate of minors and majors&#xD;
      complications, number of catheter inserted, the satisfaction of patients and doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is held in CHU Nice and will be proposed to hospitalized patients who will need&#xD;
      HPN. After consent, patients will be randomized to receive PICC Line (group A) of nutritional&#xD;
      central catheter with cuff (group B). Echography of vessels will be held at the beginning, 3&#xD;
      months and 12 months. Follow-up will be conduct at regular interval (month 0-1-3-6-9-12). The&#xD;
      duration of follow-up will be of 12 months and the global duration of the study will be 36&#xD;
      months. One major complication will conduct to withdrawal of the study. There will be 55&#xD;
      patients in each group.&#xD;
