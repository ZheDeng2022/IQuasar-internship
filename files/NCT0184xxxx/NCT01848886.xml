  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using the radial artery (RA) has since the nineties&#xD;
      gone through a revival. The initially reported worse outcome in RA graft patients compared to&#xD;
      patients grafted with the saphenous vein (SV) has since been corrected. Studies have shown&#xD;
      better patency when using RA, so the RA is going to be preferred more and more especially in&#xD;
      younger patients where long time patency is critical. During the last 10 years endoscopic&#xD;
      techniques to harvest the RA have evolved. Multiple different techniques have been used, but&#xD;
      now the equipment and technique have been refined and are highly reliable. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the endoscopic technique has less complications and a just as good patency&#xD;
      as open harvest. There are also two possible ways to use the RA as a graft. One way is sewing&#xD;
      it onto the aorta and another way is sewing it onto the mammarian artery. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that using it on the mammarian artery is superior as a revascularisation&#xD;
      technique with just as good a patency as sewing it directly onto the aorta.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present trial will in patients undergoing CABG (1) evaluate the complications in&#xD;
      endoscopic versus traditionally harvested radial arteries, (2) evaluate graft patency in&#xD;
      endoscopic harvested radial arteries versus open technique, and (3) evaluate the use of&#xD;
      mammario-radial grafting versus aorto-radial grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and trial size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NEO Trial is a randomised clinical trial with a 2x2 factorial design. We plan to&#xD;
      randomise 300 participants into four intervention groups: (1) mammario-radial endovascular&#xD;
      group; (2) aorto-radial endovascular group; (3) mammario-radial open group and (4)&#xD;
      aorto-radial open group. A subgroup of 100 participants will be selected to undergo a special&#xD;
      scanning of the vascular perfusion of donor and control hands (MIBI scan). The evaluation of&#xD;
      graft patency and ischaemia in the arm will be blinded but the assessment of the primary&#xD;
      outcome of handfunction at three months is non-blinded evaluated by questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 1: The experimental procedure in this trial will be endoscopic radial artery harvest&#xD;
      (ERAH). The control intervention will be open radial artery harvest (ORAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 2: The experimental procedure in this trial will be the technique where the radial&#xD;
      artery is sewn onto the mammarian artery as a mammario-radial anastomosis&#xD;
      (composite/Y-graft). The control intervention will be the technique of sewing the radial&#xD;
      artery directly onto the aorta as an aorto-radial anastomosis (free radial artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred to our department for sub acute or elective coronary bypass operation&#xD;
      will be eligible for trial inclusion. Inclusion criteria are: 18 years or older; able and&#xD;
      willing to give informed consent; multi-vessel disease. Exclusion criteria are: off-pump&#xD;
      procedure; multi-procedure (i.e. concomitant valve surgery); contrast allergy; geographically&#xD;
      not available for follow-up; Allen's test with insufficient ulnary artery perfusion; no&#xD;
      informed consent; acute operation; dialysis; preoperative neurological deficit on the donor&#xD;
      arm; left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 20%; former sternotomy and malignant&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 1: The primary outcome will be evaluation of hand function at three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will be: occurrence of neurophysiological defects in the donor arm&#xD;
      assessed by examination of cutaneous sensibility and measurements of the sensory and motoric&#xD;
      nervous conduction velocity preoperatively and after three months; change in subjective&#xD;
      cutaneous sensibility assessed by a clinical examination after three months; complications&#xD;
      assessed as a composite of haematoma formation, wound dehiscence or infection registered&#xD;
      before discharge and after three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also assess a number of exploratory outcomes (serious adverse events, reoperation for&#xD;
      bleeding, revascularisation, myocardial infarction, stroke or death, handgrip strength,&#xD;
      muscular function in the hand, scar evaluation, vascular supply to the hand, graft patency&#xD;
      and participants subjective evaluation of hand function after 1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 2: The primary outcome will be the occurrence of cardio- or cerebrovascular events&#xD;
      during the first year after surgery comparing mammario-radial versus aorto-radial grafts. As&#xD;
      an exploratory outcome we will also assess graft patency by multi-slice computer tomography&#xD;
      (MSCT) comparing mammarioradial versus aortoradial grafts one year after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will commence after 15th of May 2013. The inclusion period of altogether 300&#xD;
      participants is expected to last three years.&#xD;
