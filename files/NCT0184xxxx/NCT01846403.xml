  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the potential of semi-quantitative pregnancy tests as part of assisted fertility care,&#xD;
      we would like to document the feasibility and acceptability of a semi-quantitative pregnancy&#xD;
      test as an adjunct to or replacement of current monitoring protocols to offer women and&#xD;
      health care providers a new choice of diagnostic tools to confirm early pregnancy. The pilot&#xD;
      will help us to better understand how this tool complements existing monitoring protocols. If&#xD;
      a suitable addition, replacement to repeat blood draws for serum hCG assessment, the SQPT&#xD;
      could also contribute to efforts to make assisted fertility treatments more patient-friendly.&#xD;
      This study seeks to test this innovation by asking women assigned to perform a dBestÂ®&#xD;
      semi-quantitative urine panel test (AmeriTekInc, Seattle WA, USA)at home on a weekly basis&#xD;
      for up to 4 weeks after embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the test, which can be used at home by women, will provide confirmation&#xD;
      of the presence of a pregnancy compared with standard serum hCG testing because 1) it has&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity that correlates well with serum testing, and 2) it can be used at&#xD;
      home and thus earlier to determine presence of hCG. Furthermore, a pregnancy can be assured&#xD;
      only when a yolksac or embryo could be identified thus women have to wait for a period of 2-3&#xD;
      weeks after the next menses expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that women seeking assisted fertility treatments will be able to monitor their&#xD;
      hCG at home as well. Further, we plan to develop revised instructions to better suit the&#xD;
      needs and questions we think would be relevant to women desiring to use this test as part of&#xD;
      assisted fertility services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the simple instructions we will develop for use in this study will enable&#xD;
      women to use the test on their own. Provider counseling will complement these instructions&#xD;
      and contribute to overall quality of care given to each participant.&#xD;
