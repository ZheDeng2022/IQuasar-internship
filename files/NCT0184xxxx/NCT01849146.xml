      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of adavosertib when given together&#xD;
      with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with glioblastoma that is newly&#xD;
      diagnosed or has come back. Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving adavosertib, radiation&#xD;
      therapy, and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma compared to radiation therapy and temozolomide alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination&#xD;
      with the current standard of care (radiotherapy/temozolomide for concomitant therapy and&#xD;
      temozolomide for adjuvant therapy) for treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the MTD of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination with 6 weeks of daily&#xD;
      (Monday-Friday [M-F]) radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) administered at 75&#xD;
      mg/m^2/day in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. (Arm 1) III. To define the MTD of&#xD;
      AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination with adjuvant TMZ administered at 150 mg/m^2/day-200&#xD;
      mg/m^2/day for 5 days every 28 days in patients with glioblastoma after concurrent RT/TMZ.&#xD;
      (Arm 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety profile of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination with RT and&#xD;
      concomitant TMZ (Arm 1) and AZD1775 (adavosertib) with adjuvant TMZ (Arm 2) in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination with&#xD;
      upfront radiation/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRATUMORAL CORRELATIVES/PHARMACOKINETICS OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the intratumoral concentration of AZD1775 (adavosertib) achieved in patients&#xD;
      treated with the putative MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the time course of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in extracellular fluid within&#xD;
      brain tumors following a single oral dose of drug by microdialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of AZD1775 on tumor through&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of pRb (S807/811), proliferation (e.g. Ki-67), pCDC2,&#xD;
      Wee1, and apoptosis (e.g. cleaved caspase 3) on resected tumors exposed to drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize MGMT methylation and P53 pathway status, also P-gp and wee1 expression&#xD;
      levels in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with standard therapy in&#xD;
      combination with AZD1775 (adavosertib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore and analyze adaptive resistance mechanisms to AZD1775 using proteogenomics, and&#xD;
      connect this data to spatially resolved drug distribution through targeted, imaging-based&#xD;
      quantification of drug efficacy and tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INITIATION CYCLE: Patients receive adavosertib orally (PO) on days 1, 3, and 5 or days 1-5&#xD;
      weekly and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) for 6 weeks. Patients also undergo concurrent&#xD;
      radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE CYCLES: Beginning in week 10, patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive adavosertib PO QD on days 1, 3, and 5 or 1-5 weekly, and&#xD;
      temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements, are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD1775 (adavosertib) has&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacients effects; because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with AZD1775 (adavosertib), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother&#xD;
             is treated with AZD1775 (adavosertib)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             AZD1775 (adavosertib); in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy&#xD;
