    <textblock>
      Chronic cervical pain is a common problem in rehabilitation clinic, but the treatment is time&#xD;
      consuming and the effect unsatisfactory. Noxipoint® Therapy, developed by Dr. Charles C. Koo,&#xD;
      is a unique electrical stimulation precisely on corresponding &quot;Noxipoints®&quot; of each injured&#xD;
      soft tissue, with specific duration and intensity of TENS that induce C-fiber nerve ending&#xD;
      sensation. Each application typically last for 2 to 5 minutes. Based on observations of the&#xD;
      clinical application, Noxipoint® Therapy appears to relieve chronic neck and shoulder pain&#xD;
      significantly with lasting effect, and effectively improves the range of motion. However,&#xD;
      large-scale double-blinded, randomized control study on the therapy is not available yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Noxipoint® Therapy and physical therapy&#xD;
      (including the current TENS application) on patients with chronic neck pain. This study is a&#xD;
      prospective stratified randomized control trial. Eighty subjects with chronic cervical pain&#xD;
      will be recruited from the Rehabilitation Department or the Physical Therapy Center of&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). The qualified subjects will be stratified and&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two arms, 40 persons in each:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical Therapy group (PT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Noxipoint Therapy group (NT) Subjects in either group will be treated for up to 6&#xD;
           sessions within 3 weeks, about 1.5 hours per session. The treatment will terminate after&#xD;
           six sessions or earlier if the patient shows no symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated before and after the first treatment session and followed up at&#xD;
      about 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures are (1) the pain scale in the Brief Pain Index, (2) cervical Range of Motion&#xD;
      (ROM), (3) Quality of Life (QoL) measured with the Interference of Pain to Life section in&#xD;
      the Brief Pain Index (BPI) and (4) ultrasound elastogram. Pain scale, ROM and QoL measures&#xD;
      will be taken before and after the first treatment session, and at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12&#xD;
      weeks after the first session. Elastogram will be taken before the first treatment, and about&#xD;
      four weeks after the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: The effects of PT and NT will be compared based on two-sample hypothesis testing&#xD;
      methods. All the estimated P-values are two tailed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Purpose To compare the effect of Noxipoint™ Therapy and physical therapy on subjects with&#xD;
      chronic neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background There are many interventions for managing the chronic neck pain. The approaches&#xD;
      include physical therapy, medication and local corticoid injection, of which physical therapy&#xD;
      (PT) is the most prevalent treatment. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is&#xD;
      one of the regular treatments of PT and usually used in chronic neck pain as an adjunct&#xD;
      therapy. However, the application of TENS, including the location, duration and intensity of&#xD;
      stimulation, is only loosely defined and largely decided by physical therapists and thus vary&#xD;
      substantially from one application to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the long history of TENS uses, the results of existing studies, including&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs), have been inconclusive, with some showing benefits of&#xD;
      TENS, and others showing none. Moreover, the studies that cite some positive effect of TENS&#xD;
      over placebo also found that the effect does not last in the long run. The only conclusion&#xD;
      that could be drawn is that TENS sometimes relieves pain in the short term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noxipoint™ Therapy, a particular combination of precise location, intensity and duration of&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, invented by Charles Koo, the Co-PI of this protocol, may relieve&#xD;
      general muscular-skeletal pain and recover the muscle function permanently. Based on&#xD;
      observations of clinical application of Noxipoint Therapy on the neck and the shoulder pain,&#xD;
      Noxipoint Therapy showed rapid relief and lasting effect several months after the treatment.&#xD;
      However, a large-scale randomized control study is not available yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key point of Noxipoint Therapy is that the location of stimulation is the determining&#xD;
      factor of the efficacy of the pain treatment. In addition, the intensity, wave pattern and&#xD;
      duration of stimulation also play important roles. The patient's compliance with the&#xD;
      instruction to avoid stressing the newly recovered muscle/tissue during the &quot;rest period&quot; is&#xD;
      also mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Noxipoint Therapy and physical therapy&#xD;
      on patients with chronic neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective, patient- and assessor-blinded, stratified, randomized control trial.&#xD;
           Stratification factor is the patient-reported primary measure (the pain scale) as&#xD;
           described below. Patients will be assigned to two tiers before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Outcome measures: (1) pain scale measured in Brief Pain Index (BPI) from 0 to10 (2)&#xD;
           cervical Range of Motion (ROM), (3) Quality of Life (QoL) using BPI Interference of&#xD;
           Function, and (4) ultrasound elastogram. The primary outcome is BPI-at-its-Worst.&#xD;
           Cervical ROM is used to measure functional restoration, BPI Interference of Functions is&#xD;
           used to measure the quality of life, and elastogram is used to evaluate the myofascial&#xD;
           condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject's inclusion criteria: (1) 20 to 70 years of age, (2) diagnosed as chronic&#xD;
           cervical pain syndrome (ICD9: 723.1) (3) having no less than 6 months of the pain&#xD;
           history, (4) the pain level &gt;＝ 5 in BPI and (5) with trigger points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject's exclusion criteria: (1) cervical spondylosis, (2) local corticoid injection&#xD;
           within last two weeks, (3) signs of psychosomatic illness, (4) unwilling to be&#xD;
           randomized, (5) pregnant woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.80 subjects will be recruited from the Rehabilitation Department or the Physical Therapy&#xD;
      Department of National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). After initial evaluation, qualified&#xD;
      subjects will be stratified and randomized into the following two arms, about 40 subjects in&#xD;
      either arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical Therapy group (PT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Noxipoint Therapy group (NT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Physical therapy arm (PT):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The TENS device used: FDA K071951&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patients will be treated with standard physical therapy, including the&#xD;
                     electrical stimulation. Manual therapy, cold/heat therapy or exercise will be&#xD;
                     applied at the discretion of the physical therapist for about 60 minutes in&#xD;
                     each session. Patient education and self-care instructions will be provided.&#xD;
                     TENS will also be performed in each session for about 30 minutes based on the&#xD;
                     typical PT guidelines, which will serve both as a part of the standard of care&#xD;
                     and as a placebo equivalent. It will typically be set at Normal mode and 120&#xD;
                     Hertz rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Noxipoint Therapy arm (NT): Patients will be treated with electrical stimulation&#xD;
                following Noxipoint Therapy guidelines as highlighted below:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The TENS device used is the same as in PT. Each is calibrated to allow for&#xD;
                     maximum range in the specifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The pair of electrode pads is placed at the skin surface locations of the&#xD;
                     corresponding pair of Noxipoints of the injured muscle/soft tissue, for about&#xD;
                     2- 5 minutes during each application of the electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The electrical stimulation is set to induce the C-fiber response (i.e., dull&#xD;
                     pain, soreness, or achiness) based on the feedback of the patient during the&#xD;
                     stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the corresponding pain is not eliminated or at least reduced after a couple&#xD;
                     of applications on correct Noxipoints, apply an ice pack for about 10-15&#xD;
                     minutes on site before and during the next Noxipoint stimulation to alleviate&#xD;
                     excessive inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  For severe chronic neck pain patients, cervical braces are recommended within&#xD;
                     the first 2-3 days of each treatment session. The patient has to avoid using&#xD;
                     the treated tissues/muscles during the &quot;Rest Period&quot;: Similar to all other&#xD;
                     cells, the muscle cell healing or regeneration takes time. Patients are&#xD;
                     instructed not to use the newly recovered muscle/tissue during the &quot;Rest&#xD;
                     Period&quot;, which is about three days if they are forty or younger, plus about&#xD;
                     one extra day for every 10 additional years of age. If the patient has&#xD;
                     extensive injured muscles, take two more days of rest. Ice packs may be used&#xD;
                     during or soon after the session to prevent Delayed Onset of Muscle Soreness&#xD;
                     (DOMS) from the TENS stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Placebo effect consideration: TENS is included in both arms to obfuscate the&#xD;
                     process. Using TENS in the PT arm serves both as a sham-therapy-equivalent to&#xD;
                     what is used in the NT arm to neutralize placebo bias, and as a meaningful&#xD;
                     therapeutic remedy. The subject is thus blinded. Placebo effect consideration:&#xD;
                     TENS is included in both arms to obfuscate the process. Using TENS in the PT&#xD;
                     arm serves both as a sham-therapy-equivalent to what is used in the NT arm to&#xD;
                     neutralize placebo bias, and as a meaningful therapeutic remedy. The subject&#xD;
                     is thus blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Subjects in either group will be treated for up to 6 sessions within 3 weeks, about&#xD;
                1.5 hours per session. The treatment will terminate after six sessions or earlier&#xD;
                if the patient shows no symptoms. No additional treatments will be provided after 6&#xD;
                sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation: Pain scale, ROM and QoL will be measured before and after the first&#xD;
           treatment and at about 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the first treatment. Pain scale and QoL&#xD;
           may be measured before each session, and at 12 weeks (by phone) after the first&#xD;
           treatment. Elastogram will be taken before the first treatment and 4 weeks after the&#xD;
           first treatment. See attached Time Table at the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistics: The effects of PT and NT will be compared based on two-sample hypothesis&#xD;
           testing methods. The significant level is set at 0.05. All the estimated P-values are&#xD;
           two tailed. Missing data will be treated using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)&#xD;
           method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety: Noxipoint Therapy is as safe as any other TENS application, since it is used&#xD;
           within the general guidelines of TENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient Data Security Measure: The principle investigators will monitor the data safety&#xD;
           with measures, such as keeping the study data separately from its medical data. The&#xD;
           mapping table between the subject's identity and a randomly assigned identity will be&#xD;
           maintained separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Compensation: Each subject will be compensated NT$400 for the time/transportation cost;&#xD;
           half of which will be for the treatment and the other half for the follow-up. Dropout&#xD;
           subjects will be paid pro rata.&#xD;
