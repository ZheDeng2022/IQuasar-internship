    <textblock>
      This phase II trial will test whether the Hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor PF-04449913&#xD;
      can decrease disease relapse in high-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia after donor&#xD;
      stem cell transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease relapse is the most common cause of death after allogeneic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      for acute myeloid leukemia. Patients at high risk for relapse may benefit from a novel,&#xD;
      biologically rational therapeutic intervention to prevent this outcome. PF-04449913 is a&#xD;
      small molecule inhibitor of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway that inhibits the protein Smoothened&#xD;
      (SMO). Aberrant Hh signaling may contribute to the survival and expansion of the leukemia&#xD;
      stem cell, and inhibiting the Hh pathway can eliminate these cells. Therefore, targeting Hh&#xD;
      may be a logical intervention in the post-transplantation setting for those with high risk of&#xD;
      relapse. The investigators propose a phase 2 study of PF-04449913 in patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia who have received an allogeneic stem cell transplantation and are at high&#xD;
      risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, phase 2 study employing PF-04449913 in acute myeloid leukemia patients&#xD;
      who received an allogeneic stem cell transplantation and are at high risk of relapse.&#xD;
      Patients will receive consecutive 28-day cycles of PF-04449913 at 100 mg/day, beginning on&#xD;
      post-transplantation day 80 +/- 10 days, after their routine post-transplant bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsy. Treatment will continue for up to one year or until they experience toxicity or&#xD;
      disease relapse. 50 patients will be required for a 90% power to detect a 20% difference in&#xD;
      one-year relapse-free survival.&#xD;
