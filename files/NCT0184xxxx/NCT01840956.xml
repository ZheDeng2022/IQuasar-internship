  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel, tissue-engineered&#xD;
      vascular prosthesis, the Human Acellular Vascular Graft, HAVG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HAVG is intended as an alternative to synthetic materials and to autologous grafts in the&#xD;
      creation of vascular access for dialysis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HAVG is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, acellular tubular graft composed of human collagens and&#xD;
      other natural extra-cellular matrix proteins. Upon implantation, it is anticipated (based on&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies) that the collagen-based matrix comprising the graft will be infiltrated&#xD;
      with host cells and re-modeled by the host. This will result in a vascular structure more&#xD;
      similar to the histological composition of the native vascular tissue that may improve graft&#xD;
      longevity and be less likely to become infected.&#xD;
