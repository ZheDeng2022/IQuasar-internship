    <textblock>
      Currently, six Public Health Units (PHUs) in Southwestern Ontario are taking part in the&#xD;
      developed and implementation of a social marketing intervention campaign aimed at lowering&#xD;
      the incidence of falls to children in the home; City of Hamilton - Public Health Services&#xD;
      (Control), Durham Public Health, Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit, Niagara Region Public Health,&#xD;
      Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health and Windsor Public Health (Control). This campaign&#xD;
      is based on community-based intervention research and 'best practices' for improving parent&#xD;
      attitudes and behaviours toward child safety. The campaign will focus on increasing parents'&#xD;
      awareness and knowledge of fall injuries, positively impact parental attitudes to motivate&#xD;
      them to want to implement strategies to reduce fall risks, and increase parental safety&#xD;
      practices that would counteract the most common mechanisms that contribute to home falls for&#xD;
      children at these young ages. The campaign will run from September 2013 through August 2014.&#xD;
      The PHUs' social marketing campaign will strategically disseminate different materials to&#xD;
      their respective communities: printed materials (posters, pamphlets), video modules about&#xD;
      parenting safety, safety information through an e-Health website, and direction communication&#xD;
      with parents through Family Health Team practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research project will request archival data from Canadian Institute of Health&#xD;
      Information (CIHI), specifically from their National Ambulatory Care Reporting System&#xD;
      (NACRS), on frequency of falls in the home to determine the extent to which the social&#xD;
      marketing campaign is effective. Comparing pre-, during and post-intervention levels in the&#xD;
      PHU communities will determine if and which social marketing strategies were effective.&#xD;
      Additionally, random digit dialing will be used to assess pre vs post parental fall related&#xD;
      attitudes, behaviors and intervention exposure. This evaluation will provide the first ever&#xD;
      test of a community level intervention to reduce childhood falls in the home in Canada and&#xD;
      will provide valuable information about what constitutes 'best practices' for preventing&#xD;
      falls in the home among children 1 through 4 years of age.&#xD;
