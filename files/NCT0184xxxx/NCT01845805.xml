      To improve progression free survival in high risk patients with resected pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma who have node positive disease, margin positive disease, and/or elevation in&#xD;
      CA 19-9 treated with CC-486 (oral azacitidine) as compared to observation after completion of&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is for patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have concluded&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy or were deemed unable to receive adjuvant therapy with an elevated CA 19-9&#xD;
      or node positive or margin positive disease. CA 19-9 elevation is defined as two levels &gt; the&#xD;
      institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) taken at least 2 weeks apart. These levels should&#xD;
      be measured after adjuvant therapy has concluded or upon the decision that adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      will not be offered. Patients will be randomized to one of two arms. Subjects enrolled due to&#xD;
      node + disease or R1 resection must be able to undergo randomization within 3 months of&#xD;
      finishing adjuvant therapy or the decision that they are unable to take adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
      Patients enrolling due to CA 19-9 elevations can enroll any time after adjuvant therapy has&#xD;
      completed. Group A, the treatment arm, will be started on CC-486 (oral azacitidine). Group B,&#xD;
      the control arm, will receive no additional therapy. Both Arms will evaluate CA 19-9 and have&#xD;
      CT scans every 3 months. When patients have visible disease recurrence on imaging, CC-486&#xD;
      will be stopped and both groups will start first-line chemotherapy (possibly abraxane or&#xD;
      gemcitabine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve progression free survival in high risk patients with resected pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma who have node positive disease, margin positive disease, and/or elevation in&#xD;
      CA 19-9 treated with CC-486 (oral azacitidine)as compared to observation after completion of&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve response rates to first-line chemotherapy (partial and complete response) after&#xD;
      recurrence in patients treated with CC-486 after completing adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve overall survival in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with&#xD;
      CC-486.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate resected pancreatic cancer tissue and biopsies at time of recurrence for&#xD;
      epigenetic and genetic alterations to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of CC-486.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate resected pancreatic cancer tissue to identify predictive signatures of possible&#xD;
      recurrence and the benefit of hypomethylating therapy.&#xD;
