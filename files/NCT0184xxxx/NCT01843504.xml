  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find an effective treatment for chronic patellar tendinopathy&#xD;
      (PT). Investigators will conduct a 32-week randomized controlled clinical trial to determine&#xD;
      whether platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections improve disease-specific clinical outcomes with&#xD;
      correlation to a new method of ultrasound (US) imaging assessment called Acoustoelastography&#xD;
      (AE). Positive findings of PRP compared to control would suggest future larger scale studies&#xD;
      to help establish an optimal protocol for the nonsurgical management of PT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, single-blinded controlled trial. Adult subjects, aged 18-65 with&#xD;
      chronic patellar tendinopathy (PT), will be recruited through the University of Wisconsin&#xD;
      (UW) Sports Medicine Clinics and the UW Physical Therapy Clinics. 44 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two study arms (22 in each group). Subjects and assessors will be&#xD;
      blinded to the subject group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Group 1 (PRP) will receive a single US-guided injection of 5 mL autologous&#xD;
      platelet-rich plasma at week 0 (baseline). Subjects in Group 2 (saline control) will receive&#xD;
      a single injection of 5 mL 0.9% normal saline at week 0. Subjects in both groups will receive&#xD;
      just one session of injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects invited to participate in the study will be asked to undergo a knee evaluation&#xD;
      examination. Tender areas associated with the patellar tendon will be identified. This exam&#xD;
      will occur at the US Sports Medicine Clinic at Research Park. If patient is being seen by PI&#xD;
      for a routine clinic visit for knee pain, patient may be identified as a potential research&#xD;
      participant. During the clinic visit, the patient will undergo a knee evaluation examination.&#xD;
      If patient is confirmed to have patellar tendinopathy, the PI will introduce the study. If&#xD;
      interested, the PI will conduct a brief in-person interview to determine eligibility via&#xD;
      self-reported inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects who qualify will have written&#xD;
      consent obtained prior to their knee exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then report to WIMR where the ultrasound-guided procedures and follow-up&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging will be conducted. The study coordinator will greet the subjects, remind&#xD;
      them of the details of the study procedure, its potential benefits and risks, and answer&#xD;
      questions. Dr. Lee will then meet the subject, answer any questions and assess vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RN will prepare a 3 mL syringe of 1% lidocaine with a 30G, Â½&quot; long needle for&#xD;
      pre-injection topical analgesia (skin wheal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RN will then perform a blood draw of 15 mL of the subject's own blood from the&#xD;
      antecubital fossa of the elbow using a 20 mL syringe and an 18G needle. There is no side&#xD;
      preference. Control subjects will also undergo phlebotomy to maintain blinding. This is a&#xD;
      small amount of blood; Red Cross donations of one unit of whole blood are typically 450 mL.&#xD;
      The study coordinator will then place the sample in the Platelet Separator System (a&#xD;
      centrifuge) and spin the blood sample in using a two-stage spinning: the 1st separates red&#xD;
      blood cells from platelets, and the 2nd concentrates the platelets. This will be spun by&#xD;
      centrifuge to yield 6 mL of concentrated autologous platelet. All blood and equipment&#xD;
      handling will follow universal precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound will serve as visual guidance for injections. Dr. Lee will perform all&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided injections. The injection technique is identical for subjects in the two&#xD;
      injection groups. The skin will be cleansed with chloraprep. Lidocaine skin wheals will be&#xD;
      placed for local analgesia. The origin of the patellar tendon of the affected knee will be&#xD;
      identified using the ultrasound12MHz linear array transducer. Under continuous ultrasound&#xD;
      evaluation, 1.0-2.0 mL of the prepared PRP or saline solution will be injected onto the&#xD;
      origin of the patella tendon itself using a 22G, 1.5&quot; long needle. Then, 3.0 to 4.0 mL of the&#xD;
      PRP or saline solution will be peppered along a short segment of the tendon into the areas of&#xD;
      palpated tenderness and US-documented pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound guided PRP injections and follow-up ultrasound will be performed at WIMR's&#xD;
      Ultrasound Imaging Research Lab. The WIMR Ultrasound research program will provide the&#xD;
      equipment (Siemens S2000), linear array probes, and supplies for injections. The WIMR&#xD;
      Ultrasound research program will provide the research sonographer (Sarah Kohn). This is&#xD;
      important in maintaining consistency in imaging protocol, image acquisition, and subject&#xD;
      satisfaction, which also influences outcomes of research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the injections, the subjects will rest for 5 minutes and the study coordinator will&#xD;
      then obtain the subject's vital signs. Subjects will be asked to complete outcome&#xD;
      questionnaires. Participants will be given 20 tablets of 500mg acetaminophen for &quot;as-needed&quot;&#xD;
      analgesia and will be telephoned after 2 days to enquire about side effects or adverse events&#xD;
      outcome assessment procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platelet concentration will be analyzed in both samples (whole blood compared to PRP) in&#xD;
      order to verify the concentration factor in PRP. Platelet counts in whole blood vary by&#xD;
      individual. The optimal quantity of platelets and growth factors required for tissue healing&#xD;
      is not known, but a clinically effective concentration has been described as being greater&#xD;
      than 4 times baseline autologous whole blood platelet concentrations. Therefore, platelet&#xD;
      concentration yield may have important implications in clinical outcome correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure, approximately 1 mL of autologous whole blood and 1 mL of unused PRP&#xD;
      will be analyzed using a standard lab automated analyzer, a Horiba ABX Micros 60 hematology&#xD;
      cytometer, at the UW Health Research Park Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete outcome questionnaires at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 32 weeks. The&#xD;
      questionnaires for weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16, along with self-addressed stamped envelopes will be&#xD;
      provided to study participants at the time of enrollment in their study folder.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be returned at the time of the indicated due date at the top of the&#xD;
      questionnaires. If subjects do not return their questionnaires, a member of the study team&#xD;
      will contact the subjects by phone as a reminder, and the participant will be invited to&#xD;
      complete the survey by phone. Ultrasound imaging will be performed at baseline and 32 weeks.&#xD;
      On the final visit, participants will report for a scheduled visit to the WIMR clinic for&#xD;
      their 32 week ultrasound visit. Subjects will complete their 32 week questionnaires at that&#xD;
      time if subjects have not already done so.&#xD;
