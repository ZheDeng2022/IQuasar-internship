    <textblock>
      The investigators have created a way of quickly collecting information in a large scale young&#xD;
      population regarding the presence of some severity indicators that may allow us to classify&#xD;
      them into: seemingly &quot;low risk&quot; and possible &quot;elevated risk&quot; for the presence of heart&#xD;
      disease. It would have to be a short questionnaire, in order to receive a great adherence but&#xD;
      that could simultaneously provide precise information, with an adequate description of&#xD;
      symptoms and warning signs, in a way that a triage in the young adult population could be&#xD;
      performed in the general young adult population in order to select individuals with an&#xD;
      indication for personalized clinical evaluation and possible need of complementary diagnostic&#xD;
      means. Based on this premise the investigators have developed a fast-response questionnaire&#xD;
      named the Sudden Cardiac Death Screening Of risk factorS (SCD-SOS). This questionnaire has&#xD;
      already been tested in a population of approximately 1500 young adults, and some changes have&#xD;
      been introduced in order to refine its performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To best of the investigators knowledge, there are no large scale European surveys estimating&#xD;
      the prevalence of cardiac disease and associated clinical symptoms in a non-selected&#xD;
      (non-athlete) population of this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To screen a young adult population from central regional of Portugal for heart&#xD;
      disease possibly associated to a high risk of Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the national prevalence of clinical symptoms of heart disease and of heart&#xD;
      disease with increased risk for SCD in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect young adults in risk of SCD and with an indication for evaluation by a&#xD;
      cardiologist, and possible need of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  electrophysiologic (EP) study and percutaneous ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an implantable cardiovertor defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other type of specialized cardiac intervention&#xD;

        Recruitment will include mainly university students but also young adults involved in sport&#xD;
        practice (professional, semi-professional and amateur athletes) or in other activities&#xD;
        (sales, industry, etc). This way, the places for sample collection will the university&#xD;
        departments or technical schools, students associations and other places that gather&#xD;
        university students, shopping centers, gyms, sports venues, factories in the city&#xD;
        surroundings. Information collection in these places will be performed under the&#xD;
        authorization of proper entities.&#xD;
