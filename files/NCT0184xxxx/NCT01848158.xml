  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether acupuncture is effective at improving&#xD;
      comfort in children on a ventilator in the intensive care unit. Our hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      patients receiving acupuncture will require less medications to keep them comfortable than&#xD;
      those who receive sham or fake acupuncture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale: Use of narcotics and benzodiazepines is common in the pediatric intensive care&#xD;
      unit (PICU) to alleviate pain and anxiety, especially for patients who are mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated. Pain control and sedation decrease oxygen consumption, facilitate mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, ensure patient safety and help patients tolerate nursing care. However, these&#xD;
      medications can also have negative consequences. Patients receiving greater amounts of&#xD;
      pharmacologic sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) have longer duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and ICU length of stay. In fact, daily interruption of sedation shortens duration&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. Sedatives have also been associated with&#xD;
      development of delirium in ICU patients and linked to delusional and disturbing memories and&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after recovery from critical illness. Benzodiazepines&#xD;
      and opiates are associated with abnormal sleep architecture. Furthermore, patients experience&#xD;
      tolerance, physical dependency and withdrawal from these agents. Lastly, there is evidence&#xD;
      that sedatives, anesthetics and opiates are associated with neurotoxicity in animal studies&#xD;
      leading to growing concern about the potential effects of these agents on the developing&#xD;
      brains of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel Approach: In light of these negative aspects of pharmacologic sedation, we are looking&#xD;
      for alternative ways to provide comfort to critically ill children in the PICU. Acupuncture&#xD;
      has been found to be effective in reducing anxiety, acute pain, procedural pain,&#xD;
      post-operative pain, chronic pain, headache, infant colic, and has been found to reduce&#xD;
      anesthetic requirement during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: We plan to randomize patients 6 months - 17 yrs old who are receiving mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation in the PICU to either acupuncture or sham acupuncture as an adjunct to standard&#xD;
      of care pharmacologic sedation as prescribed by the PICU medical team caring for the&#xD;
      patients. Our hypothesis is that those patients receiving acupuncture will require less&#xD;
      medications to keep them comfortable. Our study is powered (80%) to detect a 33% decrease in&#xD;
      pharmacologic sedation/analgesia.&#xD;

    <description>To capture a global view of sedation and account for the combination of medications received, we also calculated an average daily 'sedation score' normalized for weight from the time of first treatment through extubation. The sedation score is a summary measure of sedative and analgesic exposure for mechanically ventilated children in the ICU. This score incorporates opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, chloral hydrate, propofol, and antihistamines. Morphine and midazolam equivalents of 0.1 mg/kg, pentobarbital 2 mg/kg, chloral hydrate 50 mg/kg, any propofol use, and any phenobarbitol use are each allocated one point, while any antihistamine use receives a score of 0.5 (Randolph 2002, Curley 2005). We modified this score to include dexmedetomidine, assigning 1 point for 1 Î¼g/kg of dexmedetomidine. The minimum value possible is zero, and there is no pre-defined maximum value. A higher score indicates higher dose of sedation medications (normalized by weight).</description>

        <title>Average Daily Sedation Score</title>
        <description>To capture a global view of sedation and account for the combination of medications received, we also calculated an average daily 'sedation score' normalized for weight from the time of first treatment through extubation. The sedation score is a summary measure of sedative and analgesic exposure for mechanically ventilated children in the ICU. This score incorporates opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, chloral hydrate, propofol, and antihistamines. Morphine and midazolam equivalents of 0.1 mg/kg, pentobarbital 2 mg/kg, chloral hydrate 50 mg/kg, any propofol use, and any phenobarbitol use are each allocated one point, while any antihistamine use receives a score of 0.5 (Randolph 2002, Curley 2005). We modified this score to include dexmedetomidine, assigning 1 point for 1 Î¼g/kg of dexmedetomidine. The minimum value possible is zero, and there is no pre-defined maximum value. A higher score indicates higher dose of sedation medications (normalized by weight).</description>
