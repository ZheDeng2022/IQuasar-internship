    <textblock>
      Patients' comprehension in the emergency department (ED) is relatively low. This is more&#xD;
      evident for in-patients with more complex diseases. The preliminary study conducted suggests&#xD;
      that patients' comprehension was improved by the use of standardized information and by&#xD;
      opening a dialogue. This study however had its limits. It does not deliver proper information&#xD;
      guideline to physicians working in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is reproduced on a larger scale for in-patients in the ED concerning their&#xD;
      comprehension about the medical information given and thus improving the scientific evidence.&#xD;
      This study has been conducted on a national level in 2 phases with 14 investigating centers&#xD;
      spread in Paris and other provinces:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, an observational period was conducted during 2 weeks in each center in order to&#xD;
      document their homogeneity. At the same time, this period permitted to have a reference level&#xD;
      of comprehension. During this period, investigators continued to give medical information to&#xD;
      their patients as usual. The aim is to adjust the results of the comprehensions levels in 2&#xD;
      groups after the experimental study on the &quot;baseline&quot; data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, an experimental period of 4 weeks: 7 centers are identified as &quot;formal procedure&#xD;
      group&quot; and their investigators are provided with formal procedures on the patient's&#xD;
      comprehension in the ED based on updated literature data. At the same time, recommendations&#xD;
      are given on the information given to patients. 7 other centers &quot;control group&quot; only formal&#xD;
      presentation on the patient's comprehension in the ED on updated literature data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the center where the patient is included, he will be either in the &quot;formal&#xD;
      procedure group&quot; or the &quot;control group&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among all in-patients in the ED, it is planned to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  700 patients in the observational period (50 in each center)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1400 patients in the experimental period (700 in the formal procedure group and 700 in&#xD;
           the control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in the information given to patients is expected due to the participation of the&#xD;
      centers in this study. This improvement is expected in both arms only due to the fact of&#xD;
      their participation. Better information level is expected in the &quot;formal procedure group&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study proves a better information in the procedure group, then our aim will be to&#xD;
      propose recommendations to ED physicians to improve the information given to in-patients in&#xD;
      the ED.&#xD;
