      The purpose of this study is to correlate in an elderly population (≥ 65 years), the&#xD;
      different levels of serum TSH, with cardiopulmonary capacity, quality of life, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and cognition. And assess whether the increased serum TSH to the upper half of the&#xD;
      normal range, through the use of antithyroid drugs, is associated with improvements in these&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the cardiopulmonary capacity in elderly people with 65 years old or more, in&#xD;
      different quartiles of normal range for serum TSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the quality of life, mini mental health status and depression scale in seniors aged 65&#xD;
      or older, in different quartiles of normal range for serum TSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantify the possible effects related to the use of antithyroid drugs in cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      capacity, quality of life, mini mental health status and depression scale in elderly people&#xD;
      aged 65 or more, with the initial serum TSH at the lower limit of the normal range (1.0&#xD;
      milli-International unit/ml) (mIU/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite evidence that in the elderly population the mean serum TSH tends to be higher as&#xD;
      compared to younger adults, there isn't a curve of normal range of TSH for this specific&#xD;
      population (more shifted to the right, which would increase the number of diagnoses for&#xD;
      subclinical hyperthyroidism).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, elderly individuals, even when classified as euthyroidism, but presenting TSH in the&#xD;
      normal lower range, may present at a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and therefore,&#xD;
      may have indication for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings motivate and justify this study design, which may have great clinical&#xD;
      relevance in the scientific community for its originality, and important clinical&#xD;
      applicability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient agrees to participate, an appointment will be scheduled at HUCFF that will be&#xD;
      made: anamnesis, review of medical records, clinical examination and signing the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, they will be guided and directed to: laboratory analysis for serum dosage of TSH&#xD;
      and free thyroxine (FT4), cardiopulmonary exercise testing and application of the&#xD;
      questionnaires of quality of life, mini mental health status and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprised of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Sectional:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample as a whole and according to the quartiles of the reference range for serum TSH,&#xD;
           with comparisons between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1st Quartile: TSH: 0.4 to 1.0 mIU / ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2nd Quartile: TSH: 1.0 to 2.0 mIU / ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3rd Quartile: TSH: 2.0 to 3.0 mIU / ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4th Quartile: TSH: 3.0 to 4.0 mIU / ml Phase 2: Clinical uncontrolled. Patients with&#xD;
           serum TSH initially on the 1st. Quartile (TSH: 0.4 to 1.0 mIU / ml) will receive&#xD;
           treatment with Methimazole (initial dose of 5mg/day) with the goal of raising the TSH&#xD;
           values to range between 2.0 and 4.0 mIU / ml (the half upper range of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After six months with TSH in the target range (2.0 and 4.0 mIU / ml), these patients will be&#xD;
      subjected to the same examination protocol performed at baseline and assessed to the effects&#xD;
      of treatment on outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables considered in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TSH and FT4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire of Quality of life for older adults (WHOQOL-OLD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini-Mental State Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geriatric Depression Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiopulmonary exercise testing - cardiopulmonary capacity Variables to be analyzed at&#xD;
           rest, peak of the exercise and recovery: Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to be assessed at peak effort: pulmonary ventilation, oxygen consumption, carbon&#xD;
      dioxide production, ventilatory equivalent for oxygen and carbon dioxide, respiratory&#xD;
      quotient, oxygen pulse, fraction of expired oxygen and carbon dioxide.&#xD;
