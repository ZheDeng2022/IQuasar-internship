      This present randomized trial is designed to evaluate the postoperative pain,inflammatory&#xD;
      marker, postoperative analgesic medication, length of hospital stay and the modifications of&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair using local, spinal or&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After approval by Siriraj Institutional Review Board, a prospective randomized study in&#xD;
      patients scheduled to undergo elective unilateral inguinal hernia repair at Siriraj Hospital&#xD;
      will be undertaken. Patients, ASA I-III, greater than 18 years old will be approached in the&#xD;
      outpatient surgical department and recruited in this study. Informed written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from each of them. Exclusion criteria are allergy to any medication used this study,&#xD;
      femoral hernia, recurrent hernia, bilateral hernia, bleeding abnormalities, severe hepatic,&#xD;
      renal or cardiovascular disease, chronic use of opioid, history of using steroidal or&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the past 6 months, inability to communicate in Thai&#xD;
      or to understand the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be admitted one day before operation as routine and receive no&#xD;
      premedication. Patients will be randomly allocated in the morning of the operation to receive&#xD;
      one of the three anesthetic techniques: local anesthesia (LA), spinal anesthesia (SA) or&#xD;
      general anesthesia (GA) for their inguinal hernia repair. The randomization process will be&#xD;
      done by the use of a computer-generated number sealed in a brown envelope. All the patients&#xD;
      will undergo standardized inguinal hernia repairs by three surgeons, A Trakarnsanga; V&#xD;
      Chinsawangtanakul; T Akaraviputh, who agree to follow a precise protocol using Lichtenstein&#xD;
      technique as described by Amid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the LA group, patients will receive local anesthesia similar to that described by Amid et&#xD;
      al. except that 1% lidocaine with adrenaline (1:200,000) will be used instead of a mixture of&#xD;
      lidocaine and bupivacaine. Surgeons will be taught to do the local anesthetic technique in a&#xD;
      standardized manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SA group, patients will be positioned in the lateral position and a Whitacre 25 G&#xD;
      needle will be inserted at L3-4 intervertebral space and then heavy bupivacaine 0.5% 15 mg&#xD;
      will be injected. Sensory block (T4 and below dermatomes) to cold and pinprick will be tested&#xD;
      before starting operation. An incremental dose containing 1 mg of midazolam and 25 mcg of&#xD;
      fentanyl will be intravenously given if patients in the LA and SA group require.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the GA group, patients will be induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 1.5 µg /kg. They&#xD;
      are then allowed to breathe spontaneously with sevoflurane 2% to 2.5% in a mixture of 60%&#xD;
      oxygen through a laryngeal mask. End-tidal concentration of sevoflurane will be adjusted to&#xD;
      keep end-tidal sevoflurane 1MAC. Supplemental doses of 25 µg of fentanyl will be administered&#xD;
      if intraoperative heart rate and blood pressure are greater than 20% of baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For postoperative analgesia, all groups will receive infiltration 10 ml of 0.5% into the&#xD;
      surgical wounds. They will also receive oral acetaminophen two tablets every 6 hours and&#xD;
      Arcoxia® (etoricoxib) 60-90 mg daily unless contraindicated for the duration of their&#xD;
      hospital stay. Intravenous morphine 1-2 mg will be provided every 4 hours as a breakthrough&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hospital discharge, patients will be allowed to discharge home when they fulfill&#xD;
      criteria: obtain and self-administer medications; perform self-care activities; eat an&#xD;
      appropriate diet or otherwise manage nutritional needs; follow-up with designated providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample 7 mL will be taken at antecubital vein with aseptic technique, proper&#xD;
      decontamination procedures and needle 22-gauge on the preoperative day, at 8 and 24 hours&#xD;
      after completion of the surgery. Blood samples will be collected in tubes without&#xD;
      anticoagulant to perform interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6 and IL-10 assays. All blood&#xD;
      samples will be centrifuged for 15 min at 1000g. Serum will be stored at -80 °C until&#xD;
      performing assay for cytokines. The IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-10 will be assessed in the serum&#xD;
      with LEGEND MAX Human Interleukin ELISA Kit (Biolegend, USA). Briefly, the quantitative&#xD;
      sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique uses monoclonal antibodies specific for IL-1 beta or&#xD;
      IL-6 or IL-10. Serum concentrations will be calculated by using regression analysis with&#xD;
      standard curves and expressed as picograms per milliliter (pg /ml). All samples will be&#xD;
      measured in duplicate, with averages used in the statistical analyses. The minimum detectable&#xD;
      concentrations IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-10 are 0.5 pg /ml, 1.6 pg /ml and 2 pg /ml,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the perioperative data will be collected from patients' chart and filled in case record&#xD;
      form by one of the authors. The ward nurses round and the postoperative anesthetic nurses&#xD;
      round will follow the care pathway as routine. Patients have no restrictions on activities,&#xD;
      and they are encouraged to resume work and normal daily activities as soon as possible.&#xD;
      Patients are discharged in accordance with routine at our respective hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected: demographic characteristics, diagnosis, duration of&#xD;
      anesthesia and surgery, conversion to other anesthetic techniques or other operations,&#xD;
      quality of pain relief, postoperative use of analgesics and amount of analgesic medication,&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative complications, incidence of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV), length of postoperative hospital stay, acute inflammatory markers, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, incidence of complications and readmission rate during 30 days after the&#xD;
      operation. Complications are defined as bleeding or hematoma necessitating reoperation or&#xD;
      compression bandage, urinary retention that requires catheterization, fever &gt; 38°Celsius&#xD;
      requiring medication treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are postoperative pain at rest and on mobilization at postoperative 8 and 24&#xD;
      as measured with verbal rating score (VRS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures are acute inflammatory markers. Intermediate outcomes include duration of&#xD;
      anesthesia and surgery, conversion to other anesthetic techniques, postoperative use of&#xD;
      analgesics and amount of analgesic medication, incidence of nausea and vomiting, length of&#xD;
      postoperative hospital stay in the unit of hour, patient satisfaction measured with verbal&#xD;
      rating score (VRS) from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), incidence of complications and readmission&#xD;
      rate during 30 days after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is postoperative pain on mobilization at 24 after the operation. The&#xD;
      sample size is based on two previous studies, which the pain scores of patients having local&#xD;
      anesthesia is 5.2 (SD=4.38), spinal anesthesia is 4.0 (SD=2.08) and general anesthesia is 7.2&#xD;
      (SD=1.73), a calculation is done to obtain a type I error of 0.05 and a power of 80% with a&#xD;
      balanced Analysis Of Variance test (ANOVA) using nQuery Advisor version 7.0 (Statistical&#xD;
      Solutions, Cork, Ireland).2, 4 The calculated sample size per group is 15 patients and the&#xD;
      number is increased to 18 patients per groups to include 20% dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables are analyzed by X2 test. Continuous variables are presented as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) when data are not normal&#xD;
      distribution. Comparison between groups used either ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test or&#xD;
      Kruskall Wallis test when data are not normally distributed. All statistical tests are two&#xD;
      tailed and P value less than 0.05 is considered significant for all data. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis is performed using SPSS version 18 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;
