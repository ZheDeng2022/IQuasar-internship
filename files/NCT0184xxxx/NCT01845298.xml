  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' objective is to describe the variability of rifampicin absorption, markers&#xD;
      of inflammation and gut damage, intestinal absorptive capacity, and intestinal permeability&#xD;
      among HIV-infected volunteers. Rifampicin is the least well absorbed of the first-line&#xD;
      anti-tuberculosis drugs. Rifampicin malabsorption is frequently observed in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients with active tuberculosis, but cannot be predicted by patient factors such as CD4+ T&#xD;
      cell count, viral load, or the presence of diarrhea. The mechanisms for rifampicin&#xD;
      malabsorption in HIV-infected patients are unknown. An understanding of mechanisms for&#xD;
      rifampicin malabsorption could eventually lead to new therapeutic targets, with the ultimate&#xD;
      goal of improving HIV/tuberculosis treatment outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dosing scheme for rifampicin for the treatment of tuberculosis was developed in the&#xD;
      pre-HIV era, and achieving target concentrations at the site of infection is important for a&#xD;
      successful outcome. Rifampicin is the least well absorbed of the first-line anti-TB drugs and&#xD;
      may depend on active transport across the intestinal barrier. Rifampicin malabsorption is&#xD;
      frequently observed in HIV/tuberculosis patients, but cannot be predicted by patient factors&#xD;
      such as CD4+ T cell count, viral load, or the presence of diarrhea. Most importantly, loss of&#xD;
      rifampicin absorptive capacity in the setting of HIV infection would explain the inferior&#xD;
      treatment outcomes that are characteristic of HIV-associated tuberculosis, including early&#xD;
      mortality, relapse after the completion of therapy, and the development of&#xD;
      rifampicin-resistant infection during anti-tuberculosis therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut-associated lymphoid tissue is the site of early and dramatic lymphocyte depletion in&#xD;
      HIV+ patients, with near complete loss of intestinal CCR5+ CD4+ T cells within the first few&#xD;
      weeks of infection. Lymphocyte depletion is accompanied by the loss of intestinal epithelial&#xD;
      barrier integrity, and recent attention has focused on potential role of bacterial&#xD;
      translocation across the damaged (&quot;leaky&quot;) intestinal barrier. In support of this model,&#xD;
      systemic immune activation markers have been shown to predict HIV progression better than&#xD;
      CD4+ T cell count or HIV viral load. Independent of the potential role of bacterial&#xD;
      translocation, the damage to gut epithelium may have other profound consequences for the&#xD;
      HIV-infected patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of this disease progression on the enterocyte's capacity to absorb specific drugs&#xD;
      and nutrients has not been adequately explored. Loss of rifampicin absorptive capacity in the&#xD;
      setting of HIV infection would explain the inferior treatment outcomes that are&#xD;
      characteristic of HIV-associated tuberculosis, including early mortality, relapse after the&#xD;
      completion of therapy, and the development of rifampicin resistant infection during&#xD;
      anti-tuberculosis therapy. Therefore, we propose a pilot study of the relationship between&#xD;
      immune activation, rifampicin absorption, and intestinal capacity for carrier-mediated&#xD;
      transport and permeability, which will lay the foundation for a K23 Career Development Award&#xD;
      application to the Division of AIDS, NIAID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifampicin is an-antibacterial compound from the rifamycin family that is used for the&#xD;
      treatment of certain bacterial infections, and is the cornerstone of the first-line treatment&#xD;
      regimen for tuberculosis. Polymorphisms in a specific drug uptake transporter gene, SLCO1B1,&#xD;
      lead to significant variability in the pharmacokinetics of rifampicin. Other host factors&#xD;
      that negatively influence rifampicin absorption are not well understood, particularly in the&#xD;
      high-risk group of HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term use of rifampicin is rarely associated with adverse effects that include a flu-like&#xD;
      illness and anemia. Both of these effects cease after termination of the drug. Neither of&#xD;
      these effects has been reported after a single dose administration. Hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions presenting with rash have also been reported after prolonged use of rifampicin, but&#xD;
      would be rare after a single-dose administration. The risks associated with rifampicin have&#xD;
      been minimized by studying pharmacokinetics after administration of a single dose, rather&#xD;
      than after prolonged use. Rifampicin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system&#xD;
      that is involved in the metabolism of many commonly used therapeutic compounds. For this&#xD;
      reason, we will exclude participants who are receiving any prescription medications with&#xD;
      clinically significant drug-drug interactions with rifampicin.&#xD;
