      This study will examine the effects, if any, of using muscle stimulation on the quadriceps&#xD;
      following a total knee replacement. Secondary objectives will be to evaluate and compare pain&#xD;
      levels, qualitative outcomes, and the impact of NMES on pain medication requests between&#xD;
      groups. It is possible that strengthening the quadriceps muscles and improving their&#xD;
      activation will reduce postoperative pain and help patients return to activities sooner than&#xD;
      with standard therapy alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for muscle strengthening and training has been in&#xD;
      use since the 1970s, but questions still remain regarding its effectiveness with different&#xD;
      patient populations, the duration of use and specifics regarding the stimulation itself, such&#xD;
      as length and type of electrical impulse. NMES works by passing electrical impulses through&#xD;
      the muscles to get them to contract. These impulses mimic the body's natural neural activity&#xD;
      (action potential) to cause a contraction. The goal with NMES is to strengthen the muscle&#xD;
      sooner by using muscle re-education. The quadriceps is weakened and sometimes slow to respond&#xD;
      after knee surgery. A weak quadriceps muscle after surgery can be a contributing factor to&#xD;
      dissatisfaction with the surgical result. When the quadriceps are weak or not firing&#xD;
      properly, forces are transferred to areas such as the knee joint placing an additional strain&#xD;
      on the replaced joint and contributing to knee pain, swelling and inflammation. If we can get&#xD;
      patients' quads firing better and sooner, we hope we would also see better short-term and&#xD;
      long-term functional outcomes and more long-term satisfaction than is presently reported.&#xD;
      Study Enrollment We are looking for 60 patients to participate. We are randomly assigning 30&#xD;
      participants to receive the standard therapy regimen and 30 to follow the standard therapy&#xD;
      regimen with the addition of using an NMES treatment twice a day, every day, for a ten-week&#xD;
      period. Patients in the therapy with NMES treatment group will keep a tracking log of their&#xD;
      use at home and will turn in the units at the 10-week appointment. The unit is easy to use&#xD;
      and all participants are given specific instructions on its use. All participants complete&#xD;
      baseline muscle testing before their surgery and then again at two-week, six-week, ten-week,&#xD;
      and one-year appointments. The muscle testing consists of a battery of functional measures to&#xD;
      assess the quadriceps such as the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Six Minute Walk test (6MWT),&#xD;
      Single Limb Stance (SLS) and others. All testing is conducted at Indiana Orthopaedic Hospital&#xD;
      South's physical therapy department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When designing this study we worked closely with the department to make sure the intended&#xD;
      tests were appropriate both for our study and the facility; the input from the staff was and&#xD;
      continues to be integral to this study's success. It is too early to report any findings and&#xD;
      we are still enrolling patients. If effective, the NMES treatment should improve quadriceps&#xD;
      activation and functioning early on after surgery, which will hopefully allow the patient to&#xD;
      experience less pain and have a quicker functional recovery than a patient who did not use&#xD;
      the NMES. Only time will tell if this is a logical conclusion and if NMES as a standard&#xD;
      postoperative therapy would be beneficial for our patients. We anxiously await the outcome of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Quadriceps Force</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1-year Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quadriceps force is the difference between average quadriceps force measurements (in Newtons) obtained at the 1-year postoperative follow-up minus the average quadriceps force measurement at baseline. Averages are stratified by study arm. Negative values indicate a reduction in quadriceps force from baseline measurement to 1-year.</description>

    <measure>Change in VAS Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1-year Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Average Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores were computed for baseline and 1-year visits for each study arm. This measure is the difference between the average pain score at the baseline and 1-year follow-ups (1-year minus Baseline), stratified by study arm. The scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 being &quot; Pain as bad as it could possibly be.&quot; Lower scores indicate lower levels of reported pain. Negative scores indicate a reduction in pain from baseline to 1-year.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will use a Compex® Rehab unit for neuromuscular electrical stimulation starting with postoperative at-home day 1 and continue using the unit twice a day, every day, until a 10-week follow-up is reached. The unit produces a 380 microsecond biphasic curve and utilizes a four phase process for the treatment (&quot;Warm-up&quot;, &quot;Work&quot;, &quot;Relaxation&quot;, and &quot;Recovery&quot;) for a total treatment time of 20 minutes and 5 seconds per session. All frequencies are delivered at the maximum subjective tolerable intensity. Participants will control this intensity and be asked to select a level that is tolerable although mildly uncomfortable; they will be instructed to increase this intensity as tolerated.</description>

        <title>Change in Quadriceps Force</title>
        <description>Change in quadriceps force is the difference between average quadriceps force measurements (in Newtons) obtained at the 1-year postoperative follow-up minus the average quadriceps force measurement at baseline. Averages are stratified by study arm. Negative values indicate a reduction in quadriceps force from baseline measurement to 1-year.</description>

Compex Rehab: Participants in this arm will use a Compex® Rehab unit for neuromuscular electrical stimulation starting with postoperative at-home day 1 and continue using the unit twice a day, every day, until a 10-week follow-up is reached. The unit produces a 380 microsecond biphasic curve and utilizes a four phase process for the treatment (&quot;Warm-up&quot;, &quot;Work&quot;, &quot;Relaxation&quot;, and &quot;Recovery&quot;) for a total treatment time of 20 minutes and 5 seconds per session. All frequencies are delivered at the maximum subjective tolerable intensity. Participants will control this intensity and be asked to select a level that is tolerable although mildly uncomfortable; they will be instructed to increase this intensity as tolerated.</description>

        <title>Change in VAS Pain Scores</title>
        <description>Average Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores were computed for baseline and 1-year visits for each study arm. This measure is the difference between the average pain score at the baseline and 1-year follow-ups (1-year minus Baseline), stratified by study arm. The scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 being &quot; Pain as bad as it could possibly be.&quot; Lower scores indicate lower levels of reported pain. Negative scores indicate a reduction in pain from baseline to 1-year.</description>
