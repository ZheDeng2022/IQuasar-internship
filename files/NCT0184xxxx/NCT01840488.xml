    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal biological dose (OBD) of Irosustat&#xD;
      (BN83495) in postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer with disease progression after prior hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to provide necessary information on safety and dose response of&#xD;
      BN83495, when given by repeated once daily oral administration, while achieving a maximal STS&#xD;
      inhibition and a maximal reduction in plasma oestradiol (E2) and adiol levels. The data&#xD;
      obtained will be used to plan further clinical studies.&#xD;
