      This research project deals with stress treatment in the form of garden therapy in the&#xD;
      therapy garden Nacadia. The therapy Garden Nacadia has an evidence-based design that is&#xD;
      specially designed for the treatment of stressed people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nacadia-therapy can be described as a process in which the patient's health and well-being is&#xD;
      assumed to enhance by the presence of the natural environment and through participating in&#xD;
      meaningful gardening activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEST concerns research on the effect of Nacadia-therapy. The study consists of randomized and&#xD;
      longitudinal studies of the effects of Nacadia-therapy compared to acknowledged cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures for example consist of: ability to return to work, health care use,&#xD;
      psychological measurements related to stress, health, quality of life and changes in&#xD;
      medication use. Further, exploratory studies of the garden therapy in the form of&#xD;
      observations and interviews will be performed, to get a better understanding of the garden&#xD;
      and the garden activities' importance for the therapeutic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - garden therapy, in a designed natural environment, will lead to improved health and&#xD;
      well-being for people who are off sick with stress-related disorders&#xD;

      In order to strengthen the project's quality as evidence-based research, the intervention is&#xD;
      designed as a randomized controlled trial comparing two treatments on repeated measurements&#xD;
      of the same variables over a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment options in this study is Nacadia-therapy (garden therapy) and cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT - control group). Because the Nacadia-therapy uses a large number of&#xD;
      hours, it has been decided to compare it with the longest conventional treatment that can be&#xD;
      offered through the public health insurance of stress-related disorders such as anxiety and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of participants (N): 80&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 40 (n) Nacadia Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 40 (n) CBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type of environment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The therapy garden Nacadia (outdoors or greenhouse)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Clinic (indoors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Therapists and staff&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 2 psychologists and a gardener&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 2 psychologists&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Length of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 10 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 10 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment content&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 96 hours of Nacadia-therapy (including 79 hours of gardening therapy, 10x½ hour&#xD;
                individual conversations, and 4x3 hours of transition conversation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 20 hours individual CBT (including 16 hours of treating conversational therapy and&#xD;
                4x1 hour of transition conversation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Treatment set-up&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Group of 8&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Individual&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent factors in the two treatment options:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The psychologists involved in both therapy types are authorized, and trained in CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conversational therapy: Psychotherapeutic conversations in both treatments are primarily&#xD;
           based on CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatments have the same length of time of 10 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diverging factors in the two treatment options:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Environment: In the Nacadia-therapy the treatment is taking place in a designed natural&#xD;
           environment, and in CBT the treatment takes place in the psychologists' treatment rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of hours: In Nacadia-therapy the individual sessions last three hours, with&#xD;
           two sessions per week the first and last week and three sessions a week in week 2-9.&#xD;
           This gives a total of 96 hours, including 4 x 3 hours transition conversation and 10 x ½&#xD;
           hour individual interviews. In CBT, the duration of the individual sessions are one&#xD;
           hour, and there are 1-2 sessions per. week, totaling 20 hours, incl. 4 hours of&#xD;
           transition conversations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment content: in Nacadia-therapy experiences and activities related to the garden&#xD;
           environment are integrated with mindfulness exercises. The individual conversations in&#xD;
           the Nacadia-therapy will be mindfulness-based CBT, whereas in the control group the&#xD;
           conversations will be exclusively CBT-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of hours for conversational therapy: 20 hours of individual psychotherapy in CBT,&#xD;
           10 x ½ an hour for individual psychotherapy in Nacadia-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is targeted at citizens who are severely burdened by stress (including ICD&#xD;
      categories, F 43.0-9(minus 1 = PTSD), and F45.3), which can be expected to correspond to 6-24&#xD;
      months sick leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection will be carried out through questionnaire surveys (at the beginning and&#xD;
      ending of the treatment, and 3, 6, and 12 months after the treatment) as well as as well as&#xD;
      from National Data Registers on use of Health care, medicine, and on amount of sick leave.&#xD;
      This data will be retrieved three years before treatment and one year after treatment.&#xD;
