  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity seems to be a prognostic factor for quality of life and survival in&#xD;
      patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Whereas their exercise capacity has been assessed through&#xD;
      medical examination, their daily physical activity has been little studied. Activity monitors&#xD;
      have measured physical activity only in a few studies which considered mainly respiratory&#xD;
      status and more recently bone mineral density and body composition. Determinants of physical&#xD;
      activity in patients with CF remain largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to measure daily physical activity with activity monitors in&#xD;
      adult patients with CF and to investigate the determinants of physical activity, with a focus&#xD;
      on extra-respiratory factors (nutritional status, diabetes, bone mineralization, anxiety&#xD;
      and/or depression, cardiac impairment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy adult patients with CF, regularly cared at the Cochin adult CF centre, will be&#xD;
      recruited in a stable period during their annual review. During this assessment, laboratory&#xD;
      tests will be carried out (especially parameters for nutritional status), as well as&#xD;
      measurement of body composition and bone mineral density, respiratory function tests and a 6&#xD;
      minute walk test, and echocardiography. Patients will wear for 7 consecutive days a&#xD;
      multi-sensor armband SenseWear on the arm, to assess the intensity of physical activity in&#xD;
      metabolic equivalents (METS) and steps per day. Finally, patients will complete three&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaires: Quality of Life (CFQ14 +), hospital anxiety depression&#xD;
      scale and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a descriptive analysis of the study cohort, we will study qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      criteria related to physical activity (assessed quantitatively by the number of steps/day or&#xD;
      metabolic equivalents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear regression models will then be developed to assess the independent factors associated&#xD;
      with physical activity, adjusting for different variables of interest related to patients&#xD;
      demographic, behavioral, clinical (respiratory and non-respiratory ) and biological&#xD;
      parameters. Conversely, the &quot;predictive&quot; independent aspect of physical activity will be&#xD;
      studied according to respiratory function, nutritional status and quality of life.&#xD;

      Ambulatory adult CF patients are recruited at time of their yearly evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotypic patients' characteristics Age, gender, CFTR genotype, pancreatic status (presence&#xD;
      or absence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency), number of IV antibiotic courses and number&#xD;
      of hospitalization over the previous year, are reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity measurement Physical activity is measured over 7 consecutive days using a&#xD;
      multisensor armband (SenseWear Pro Armband; BodyMedia, Inc.,Pittsburgh, PA) that is worn on&#xD;
      the upper right arm over the triceps muscle. It incorporates a biaxial accelerometer that&#xD;
      records steps per day, and physiologic indicators of energy expenditure that enable the&#xD;
      investigator to determine the physical activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of respiratory function and cardiovascular status Patients will perform a&#xD;
      respiratory function test to evaluate FVC and FEV1 and six minutes walk test. Arterial blood&#xD;
      gases will be done at the beginning and at the end of walk and the walking distance will be&#xD;
      indicated in meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography will be performed to look for left or right cardiac dysfunction and measure&#xD;
      systolic pulmonary artery pressure. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP)&#xD;
      will be used as a systemic biomarker of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition They are measured by X-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DEXA) on the lumbar spine, femur and whole body, and measurement of lean and fat mass (Lunar&#xD;
      Prodigy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional evaluation Weight and height are measured and body mass index (BMI) is&#xD;
      calculated. As part of the annual dietary assessment, there will be an evaluation of the&#xD;
      amount of ingested nitrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn to measure: albumin, prealbumin, vitamin E, vitamin A and vitamin&#xD;
      25(OH)D3, HbA1c. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen will be measured as indicators of&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinalysis will measure: creatinine, nitrogen and 3-methylhistidine. Oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test will be performed (fasting blood glucose and blood glucose 2 hours after ingesting 75 g&#xD;
      of glucose) in pancreatic insufficient patients with unknown diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-administered questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will answer 3 questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. quality of life CFQ14+ questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. hospital anxiety depression (HAD) scale validated in French&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baecke physical activity questionnaire&#xD;
