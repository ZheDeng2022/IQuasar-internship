  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with congenital heart disease have significant morbidity including low cardiac&#xD;
      output syndrome and subsequent organ dysfunction that may be prevented by optimization of&#xD;
      circulatory function. More than half of these children receive milrinone. Clinical evaluation&#xD;
      cannot distinguish between patients with sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, and toxic milrinone&#xD;
      drug levels. Consequently children who require pharmacologic circulatory support may be&#xD;
      receiving sub-optimal dosing, and children who do not need milrinone may be receiving&#xD;
      milrinone unnecessarily. The primary objective of this study is to determine if optimizing&#xD;
      milrinone levels with therapeutic drug monitoring in critically ill children following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery improves clinical outcomes and reduces the duration of milrinone infusion.&#xD;
      This study hypothesizes that optimizing milrinone levels with therapeutic drug monitoring in&#xD;
      critically ill children following cardiac surgery will improve clinical outcomes and reduce&#xD;
      the duration of milrinone infusion.&#xD;

      The proposed trial is a pilot of an open label, randomized trial of milrinone therapeutic&#xD;
      drug monitoring in patients &lt; 18 years treated with milrinone following open-heart surgery&#xD;
      for congenital heart disease at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. We will randomize&#xD;
      patients to (1) receiving therapeutic drug monitoring or (2) control patients who receive&#xD;
      standard care. Standard care involves titration of milrinone infusion based on clinical&#xD;
      examination by the treating team. Control patients will have milrinone plasma levels drawn&#xD;
      but not analysed until the end of the study. The intervention is (1) regular measurement of&#xD;
      milrinone levels; and (2) physician feedback of plasma levels in experimental arm by the ICU&#xD;
      pharmacist. After obtaining consent, eligible subjects will be allocated to a trial group by&#xD;
      random assignment (sealed envelopes) within 3 strata in a 1:1 allocation. These strata are &lt;&#xD;
      2 years, 2- 10 years and &gt; 10 years to ensure equal distribution of these age ranges in each&#xD;
      group for pharmacokinetic analysis. For the intervention group, sampling for milrinone levels&#xD;
      will occur at 0 hours (upon arrival to ICU with routine admission blood collection) and&#xD;
      approximately every 6- 8 hours (whenever the line is accessed for routine blood work). The&#xD;
      last sample will be taken 6-8 hours after cessation of infusion, or if the patient leaves the&#xD;
      ICU, or the maximum amount of blood sampling has been reached or after 7 days for children&#xD;
      weighing more than 8 kgs (or 5 days for children weighing less than 8 kgs), which ever comes&#xD;
      first. Follow-up will be exclusively during the period of hospitalization in the ICU until&#xD;
      ICU discharge. An optional algorithm with a proposed titration for milrinone will be provided&#xD;
      for use at the discretion of the treating team. Clinical outcomes will be measured as a&#xD;
      composite outcome of dysrhythmia, LCOS and death.&#xD;
