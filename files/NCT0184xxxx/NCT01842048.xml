  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goals of deep hyperthermia combined with external beam radiation (EBRT) on bone&#xD;
      metastases are the response on pain relief, duration of response and time to achieve complete&#xD;
      pain relief.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct comparative data on the efficacy of low temperature&#xD;
      (40-43℃ range) deep hyperthermia adding on external beam radiation for treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic bone tumors. There are 3 reasons of conducting this clinical trial. Firstly,&#xD;
      radiotherapy is most effective modality for bony metastases treatment, but only limited&#xD;
      radiation dose can be delivered to metastatic bony metastatic sites with relatively short&#xD;
      response duration observed clinically. Since it is a palliative treatment for pain relief,&#xD;
      some patients develop recurrent pain at the same lesions a few months later. Most patients&#xD;
      must accept their hopeless conditions and accept toward the end of their lives due to&#xD;
      difficulty of reirradiation. There is urgently need for more effective treatment. Secondly,&#xD;
      most combination of hyperthermia and radiation trials were relatively high dose of radiation,&#xD;
      with the basic idea of hyperthermic radiosensitization, the combination of hyperthermia and&#xD;
      radiotherapy on bone metastasis is warrant. Clinical trials experiences on relatively less&#xD;
      deep tumors such as breast, head and neck cancers, extremity sarcoma or melanoma may not be&#xD;
      applied on deep seated tumors. Bony metastases are usually deep seated lesions with hard&#xD;
      cortex bone surrounded. The real benefit of hyperthermia can be highlighted on bony&#xD;
      metastases. Thirdly, metastatic bony microenvironment are critical for the providing of bone&#xD;
      marrow-derived immune suppressor cells circulating to systemic tumor microenvironment, mild&#xD;
      thermal therapy to metastatic bony microenvironment may have dual immunomodulatory effects:&#xD;
      direct enhancement of immune cell activity through thermally sensitive molecular pathways&#xD;
      associated with immune cell function/activation, and, indirect enhancement of&#xD;
      immunosurveillance through a reduction in hypoxia-induced immune suppressor cells around&#xD;
      metastatic foci via improved tumor vascular perfusion. An unexpected survival benefit may&#xD;
      demonstrated from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to solitary or multiple sites, primary cancer type (Breast&#xD;
      or prostate vs others), and severity of pain (i.e., worst pain score in the last 24-hour&#xD;
      period) (4-6 vs 7-10). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol A was designed to compare the response of matched tumors in the same&#xD;
      patient treated by radiation alone or by radiation combined with hyperthermia when the&#xD;
      patient had multiple tumors. Two tumors of comparable size were treated with either protocol&#xD;
      A or B, and the responses were compared. The tumor size was computed as the product of&#xD;
      maximum length times maximum width.&#xD;
