    <textblock>
      Investigators propose a feasibility and pilot study for a cluster randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial. The proposed trial will evaluate the effects of an economic intervention&#xD;
      (microfinance) in self-help groups of poor and marginalised women in three provinces in&#xD;
      northern India, upon the health of these communities, with a focus on children under five&#xD;
      years. This feasibility and pilot study will determine whether accurate data can be collected&#xD;
      on mortality by means of a house to house survey or from the register of births and deaths.&#xD;
      The feasibility stage will also determine whether village volunteers can accurately weigh&#xD;
      children under five and record their weights alongside the financial data already recorded by&#xD;
      the self-help group. If these data are accurate and can be collected reliably, the&#xD;
      investigators will calculate the power and sample size needed for a future cluster randomised&#xD;
      trial, as well as analysing preliminary results from the current project. The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate health outcomes, relating to two Millennium Development Goals: number of&#xD;
      children under five years of age who are underweight and the under five mortality rate.&#xD;

      Background Microfinance is a process whereby small loans are given to the poorest families in&#xD;
      developing countries to help overcome short term economic shocks (natural disasters or ill&#xD;
      health) or to make small investments to improve their standard of living (eg in livestock.&#xD;
      Microfinance has been shown to contribute to reducing poverty (particularly of female&#xD;
      participants) and to improve the health of village economies. The Rojiroti scheme of&#xD;
      microfinance has been running in several impoverished states in Northern India for ten years.&#xD;
      This low cost scheme has been active in the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh&#xD;
      and serves much poorer beneficiaries than those reached by mainstream microfinance. It works&#xD;
      through establishing self-help groups (predominantly women from scheduled castes). Initially&#xD;
      the members of these groups contribute their own money - a very small sum per week. After 3-6&#xD;
      months they become eligible for emergency loans for medical emergencies and general purpose&#xD;
      loans, for investment in livestock etc.. These loans are administered locally by the charity&#xD;
      &quot;Centre for Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods&quot; (CPSL). Rojiroti UK have just received a grant&#xD;
      from the Department for International Development (DfID) for a 3 year expansion of the&#xD;
      Rojiroti programme. Most of the participants in the Rojiroti scheme live in rural hamlets or&#xD;
      &quot;tolas&quot;, comprising several hundred people who earn a living by share cropping, as tenant&#xD;
      farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the feasibility of collecting mortality data (both directly&#xD;
      in the tola and through registered deaths) and the feasibility of a village volunteer&#xD;
      weighing children under five and recording their weights, along with other self-help group&#xD;
      data. If data collection proves feasible, the investigators will conduct a pilot cluster&#xD;
      randomised trial of immediate vs. delayed microfinance in 50 tolas in Bihar. Trial outcomes&#xD;
      will be mortality and weight for age Z score, weight for height z-scores and mid upper arm&#xD;
      circumference in children less than 5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main centres Rojiroti is already established in northern Indian provinces of Bihar, Madhya&#xD;
      Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. In this study, the investigators plan to enrol tolas from Bihar.&#xD;
      In the feasibility study there will be 10 tolas in each arm. If the data reach acceptable&#xD;
      standards of accuracy and completeness, the investigators will continue the study in a&#xD;
      further 40 tolas in each arm (total 50 tolas per arm, 100 altogether). The data analysis will&#xD;
      be undertaken in the School of Medicine, University of Nottingham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A feasibility and pilot study for a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). The&#xD;
      unit of randomisation is the tola. A control tola, paired with each intervention tola, will&#xD;
      be randomly selected to have similar characteristics (size and agroeconomic zone) to the&#xD;
      early intervention tola. The control tola will be at least 15km away from the intervention&#xD;
      site (to avoid self-help groups being set up by word of mouth) but close enough to be&#xD;
      practical for data collection. The control tola will receive the microfinance intervention 18&#xD;
      months after randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and randomisation of intervention sites The investigators will select tolas in&#xD;
      Bihar province for the feasibility study (10 intervention and 10 control). It is important to&#xD;
      include the control tolas at the feasibility stage, as the investigators think the challenges&#xD;
      to complete and accurate data collection will be greater in the control tolas. Pairs of tolas&#xD;
      will be selected by CPSL and the details provided to the team at the University of Nottingham&#xD;
      in a secure, password protected spreadsheet, with each tola identified by a code number. The&#xD;
      Nottingham team will randomise one of each pair to intervention or control group.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified by agroeconomic region (low, moderate and heavy annual&#xD;
      rainfall).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent and randomisation Initial discussions will take place between CPSL staff and women in&#xD;
      the tolas prior to randomisation. The project will only proceed in that tola if sufficient&#xD;
      village women (around 10) have expressed an interest in participating in self-help groups.&#xD;
      The idea of the immediate and delayed intervention groups will be discussed with the women,&#xD;
      by the CPSL staff. Women will have the option to agree to go ahead with the self-help groups,&#xD;
      with or without randomisation and collection of health outcome data. The investigators will&#xD;
      keep a record of the demographic characteristics of any tola which does not take part as well&#xD;
      as those which do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolas agree to participate before they are randomised to immediate or delayed intervention&#xD;
      groups. Randomisation will take place remotely and tolas are then informed through CPSL to&#xD;
      which study arm they have been randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the accuracy and completeness of data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than one self-help group may be set up in each tola but outcome data will be collected&#xD;
      for the tola as a whole, in order to measure the effects of the intervention on those&#xD;
      families in the self-help group and any the indirect effects on tola dwellers who are not&#xD;
      part of the groups. Accuracy of data collection and recording will be evaluated through a&#xD;
      field visit by CPSL staff. At this baseline visit, the CPSL staff and the village volunteer&#xD;
      will independently:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate, using a questionnaire, the total population (and population under 5 years) of&#xD;
           the tola and the number of deaths in the last year (and deaths in children under 5&#xD;
           years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the weight, height and mid upper arm circumference and age of each child under 5,&#xD;
           using scales and measures provided by CPSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will then be entered in a spreadsheet by CPSL staff and transferred to the team in&#xD;
      Nottingham who will calculate the percentage concordance. Concordance of 75% or greater&#xD;
      between the records of the CPSL worker and the village volunteer for population and mortality&#xD;
      data will be deemed of acceptable accuracy. Concordance of the under five weights (to one&#xD;
      decimal place) for 75% of children will be taken as acceptable. As well as checking the&#xD;
      accuracy of weighing and weight recording, the CPSL staff will determine the number of&#xD;
      children under five have not been weighed (e.g. children who are temporarily absent from the&#xD;
      village and those who are ill). Data will also be collected on immunisation rates. The&#xD;
      investigators will apply for access to data on registered deaths in each tola, from the&#xD;
      provincial government and the investigators will use these to check the validity of the&#xD;
      mortality data obtained from questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan Sample size and power calculations: This will be performed to&#xD;
      inform a future RCT, using the data collected as part of the current study. If there are&#xD;
      sufficient, reliable data available at the end of the feasibility stage, a preliminary power&#xD;
      calculation will be performed to determine whether the pilot study might detect a clinically&#xD;
      important difference in mortality, proportion underweight or weight for age z score. If so,&#xD;
      the trial will move from pilot status to definitive trial. Published estimates of nutrition&#xD;
      in Bihar date back to 2006 and suggest that 55% of under fives in Bihar are underweight (61%&#xD;
      amongst children from scheduled castes). This may well have changed considerably in the last&#xD;
      6 years. This pilot study will provide a current estimate of the baseline prevalence of&#xD;
      mortality and underweight. The sample size calculation for cluster randomised trials&#xD;
      described by Hayes et al will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of analysis: In the pilot study and any future trial, intention to treat analysis will&#xD;
      be used where possible i.e. where a tola has been randomised to receive microfinance early or&#xD;
      late, their data will be included irrespective of whether the self-help group and&#xD;
      microfinance have run successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics tests: We will compare the proportion of children who are underweight and the&#xD;
      mortality rate in the last year (deaths in the past year / population of the tola) in&#xD;
      intervention and control tolas. This will be done at baseline and 18 months after the&#xD;
      establishment of a self-help group in the early intervention tola. In order to estimate&#xD;
      current tola population, the investigator will use a questionnaire administered by the CPSL&#xD;
      worker when the children are weighed. An adjusted risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval will be calculated, allowing for potential confounding effects of the&#xD;
      pre-intervention prevalence of underweight or the mortality rate. As this is a cluster&#xD;
      randomised trial based in small population units (tolas), the investigators will allow for&#xD;
      correlation within zones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned exploratory analyses: The investigators will explore whether data can be collected on&#xD;
      maternal literacy and years of schooling received. If the data are available, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare the effectiveness of the intervention according to whether the&#xD;
      mother was literate or illiterate and whether or not she had received at least 5 years of&#xD;
      schooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in primary outcome: In the initial study protocol, the primary outcome measures were&#xD;
      mortality rate among children under five years of age and the overall mortaility in the tola.&#xD;
      However, on further consideratation, this was changed to mean weight for height z-score (WHZ)&#xD;
      if children under five years of age. Given the short duration of the study period (18&#xD;
      months), it was thought that any effect of the intervention on mortaility rates may not be&#xD;
      evident in the study period. WHZ is a marker of acute malnutrion and wasting and Children&#xD;
      with severe wasting (WHZ &lt; -3 SD) have a 9.4-fold higher chance of dying while those with&#xD;
      moderate wasting (WHZ -3 to -2 SD) have a 3.0-fold higher chance of dying when compared with&#xD;
      their nonmalnourished counterparts. WHZ was therefore selected to be the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure as it is strongly associated with mortality and may be affected by the intervention&#xD;
      within the short duration of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This change in protocol was made prior to randomisation and baseline data collection and is&#xD;
      reported in the protocol publication.&#xD;
