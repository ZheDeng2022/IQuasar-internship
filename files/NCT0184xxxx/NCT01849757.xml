      The purpose of the study is to determine which priming fluid is the safest for use for&#xD;
      priming the heart-lung machine used during cardiopulmonary bypass for patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. The fluids to be compared are albumin and voluven. A control group will&#xD;
      receive only crystalloid.&#xD;

      Comparison of priming constituents in patients undergoing CPB assisted cardiac surgery: 6%&#xD;
      HES 130/0.4 or Albumen 5%&#xD;

&#xD;
      Research will be conducted at: the cardiac operating rooms of the Royal University Hospital,&#xD;
      and affiliated hospitals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis It is hypothesized that the use of an artificial colloid (6% hydroxyethyl starch&#xD;
      130/0.4) (HES) as a priming constituent is more disruptive to the coagulation and renal&#xD;
      systems compared to the use of human derived albumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is further hypothesized that patients who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with HES&#xD;
      130/0.4 as a priming constituent will demonstrate decreased creatinine clearance and&#xD;
      increased post-operative bleeding and transfusion requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Academic validity Permissive hemodilution results when crystalloids and colloids are&#xD;
      substituted for blood as priming fluids in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. While there&#xD;
      are obvious benefits to decreasing autologous blood exposure to the patients undergoing CPB,&#xD;
      determining the most physiological substitution has not been conclusively resolved.&#xD;
      Historically, available HES had a greater molecular weight then the product currently in use&#xD;
      and was associated with detrimental adverse events when compared to saline as fluid&#xD;
      replacement therapy (5.3% vs. 2.8%, p &lt; 0.001). (1) When albumin was compared to HES 450/0.7&#xD;
      and HES 200/0.05 for fluid management in adult CPB surgery, (18 trials of 970 patients) HES&#xD;
      increased transfusion of red blood cells by 28.4% (p = 0.027), increased the transfusion of&#xD;
      fresh-frozen plasma by 30.6% (p = 0.008) and increased the transfusion of platelets by 29.8%&#xD;
      (p = 0.027). HES 130/0.4 could not be compared to albumen in this same study because there&#xD;
      was insufficient data collected. However, no significant differences were found when&#xD;
      comparing transfusion requirements between HES 450/0.7, HES 200/0.05 and HES 130/0.4. (2)&#xD;
      Viscoelastic device analysis concluded that the administration of HES 130/0.4 in patients or&#xD;
      healthy volunteers resulted in a weaker and smaller clot. (3) Short-time infusions of HES&#xD;
      200/0.5 and HES 130/0.4 after cardiac surgery produced a temporary impairment of fibrin&#xD;
      formation and clot strength while human albumin had no effect. (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In regards to the association between HES and renal failure, on the one hand use of HES&#xD;
      130/0.4 as a priming fluid used in children undergoing CPB did not result in any negative&#xD;
      effects on renal function and was safe to use in the pediatric population. (5) On the other&#xD;
      hand, when used for resuscitative measures in 7000 randomly assigned patients admitted to&#xD;
      intensive care, though there was no difference in 90 day mortality between the group assigned&#xD;
      HES 130/0.4 and the group assigned saline, more patients assigned HES 130/0.4 required renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy. (1) When used immediately after CPB in a double-blind clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing 4% gelatin, Ringer's solution and HES 130/0.4, it was found that significantly&#xD;
      lower mean creatinine levels were found in the HES 130/0.4 group compared to the other two&#xD;
      groups. (6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research is directed toward determining conclusively if HES 130/0.4 has a similar risk&#xD;
      profile to HES 450/0.7 and HES 200/0.05 when used as a priming constituent for the CPB&#xD;
      circuit. Additionally we will determine if an albumin/crystalloid prime is superior to a HES&#xD;
      130/0.4/crystalloid prime. A fully crystalloid prime control group will be included for a&#xD;
      controlled comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design/Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The will be a randomized, control trial. Three groups of subjects will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: Crystalloid prime&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 L crystalloid prime,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2.5 mL/kg Mannitol 20%,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 ampoule of NaHCO-3 (50 mL),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  10,000 iu heparin&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Voluven (light?):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HES 130/0.4 prime 500 mL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  balance of crystalloid&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2.5 mL/kg Mannitol 20%,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 ampoule of NaHCO-3 (50 mL),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  10,000 iu heparin&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Albumin:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Human albumin 500 mL 5%&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  balance of crystalloid&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2.5 mL/kg Mannitol 20%,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 ampoule of NaHCO-3 (50 mL),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  10,000 iu heparin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis We would like to have 7000 subjects included in this research project.&#xD;
      Study populations and outcomes for patients undergoing CPB assisted cardiac surgery are&#xD;
      extremely varied. An extremely large population size will be necessary to answer the research&#xD;
      question proposed as the priming differences in question result in very subtle outcome&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo CPB assisted cardiac surgery. Blood samples will be drawn at&#xD;
      routine intervals from each subject. Blood will be sampled upon entering the operating room,&#xD;
      at the completion of surgery, and at 24 hours post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of blood drawn will not be above and beyond the usual tests and analyses related&#xD;
      to the care of all affected patients undergoing CPB assisted cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  greater than 50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will be afflicted with co-morbidities associated with cardiac disease (increased&#xD;
           cholesterol, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, previous myocardial infarctions and&#xD;
           decreased ejection fraction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  emergencies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dialysis dependent&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiac center involved to date is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RUH Saskatoon The goal is recruitment of all cardiac centers in western Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-points: are postoperative bleeding and transfusion of autologous units of red&#xD;
      blood cells, frozen plasma and platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points: Post-operative renal function parameter creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be ongoing. Interim analysis will be completed once half the patients&#xD;
      have been recruited with final statistical analysis to be conducted once data capture is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Significance/Justification CPB assisted cardiac surgical outcomes have improved&#xD;
      tremendously since the first such procedure was done in 1953. Outcome improvements have&#xD;
      always come from small changes that were evidence based. This research project means to&#xD;
      determine the safest prime for a procedure, which occurs roughly 2,000,000/year throughout&#xD;
      the world. In regards to the cost of the study solutions in question, there is a $4.10&#xD;
      difference between the cost of 500 mL of HES 130/0.4 prime and 500 mL of 5% Albumin with HES&#xD;
      130/0.4 being more expensive.&#xD;

The chest tubes are attached to a blood collection apparatus which measures the amount of blood loss. Too much post-operative blood loss results in a transfusion requirement of red blood cells, plasma and/or platelets.</description>
