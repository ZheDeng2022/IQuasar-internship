  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic disturbances, obesity and life-shortening cardiovascular morbidity are major&#xD;
      clinical problems among antipsychotic-treated patients. Especially two of the most&#xD;
      efficacious antipsychotics, clozapine and olanzapine, cause weight gain and metabolic&#xD;
      disturbances and can rarely be replaced by other drugs due to the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      compounds. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has improved glycemic control among patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. The study will investigate whether the beneficial effects of GLP-1 analogues&#xD;
      on glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients, can be extended to a population of&#xD;
      non-diabetic, dysglycemic psychiatric patients, receiving antipsychotic medical treatment.&#xD;

      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 96 participants (48 in each group) was estimated, with two-sided t-testing,&#xD;
      an α of 5% and a power of 90%. The power calculation was based on the primary outcome&#xD;
      measurement: Change in glucose tolerance. The glucose tolerance was estimated by the total&#xD;
      Area Under the Curve (AUC) following a 4-hour 75-g. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). The&#xD;
      expected mean total AUC for the plasma glucose excursion following a 4-hour 75-g. OGTT was&#xD;
      estimated as 1695 (SD 158) and 1800 (SD 158) after 16 weeks of treatment for the liraglutide&#xD;
      and liraglutide placebo group, respectively. The difference in total AUC was based on&#xD;
      unpublished data in individuals with and without Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) following a&#xD;
      4-hour 75-g. OGTT at baseline from the study: &quot;The Impact of Liraglutide on Glucose Tolerance&#xD;
      and the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in Women With Previous Pregnancy-induced Diabetes&quot;.(1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be carried out with the treatment groups still blinded and labeled as&#xD;
      &quot;treatment group A&quot; and &quot;treatment group B&quot;. Before dividing participants into group A and&#xD;
      group B, the statistical plan was completed and uploaded on clinicaltrials.gov, and the data&#xD;
      set was locked. The final unblinding of treatment groups (liraglutide or liraglutide&#xD;
      placebo), will not be carried out until all statistical analyses are performed. All analyses&#xD;
      will be performed using SAS 9.4, with α set at 0.05 and two-sided testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All efficacy analyses will be performed using a modified intention-to-treat principle. All&#xD;
      participants who were randomized, received at least one dose of the trial compound&#xD;
      (liraglutide or liraglutide placebo) and who had at least one assessment after baseline will&#xD;
      be included in the efficacy analyses. All safety analyses will be performed in the&#xD;
      intent-to-treat sample that includes all participants, who were randomized and received at&#xD;
      least one dose of the trial compound (liraglutide or liraglutide placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the change in glucose tolerance following a 4-hour 75-g. OGTT from&#xD;
      week 0 to week 16. During the 4-hour 75-g. OGTT, blood was sampled at fixed time points: -15,&#xD;
      -10, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 minutes. An analysis of&#xD;
      covariance (ANCOVA) will be use to analyze change in glucose tolerance from week 0 to week 16&#xD;
      using mixed model analyses for the plasma glucose levels for the liraglutide and the&#xD;
      liraglutide placebo group, respectively. In case of relevant baseline differences between the&#xD;
      two groups, demographic, illness or treatment parameters will be included in the model as&#xD;
      fixed effects together with the baseline value of the OGTTs as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood was also sampled for analyses of C-peptide, glucagon and incretin hormones in response&#xD;
      to the glucose load at the same fixed time points during the OGTT. Change in secretion of&#xD;
      C-peptide, glucagon and incretin hormones from week 0 to week 16 will also be evaluated using&#xD;
      mixed model ANCOVA analyses for the liraglutide and liraglutide placebo group, respectively.&#xD;
      In case of relevant baseline differences between the two groups, demographic, illness or&#xD;
      treatment parameters will be included in the model as fixed effects together with the&#xD;
      baseline value of the relevant variable as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most secondary endpoints were repeated every 4 weeks. Few secondary endpoints were only&#xD;
      repeated at week 0 and 16. For all repeated measurements a mixed model ANCOVA analyses will&#xD;
      be use to analyze mean change in continuous outcomes from week 0 to week 16 for the&#xD;
      liraglutide and the liraglutide placebo group, respectively. In case of relevant baseline&#xD;
      differences between the two groups, demographic, illness or treatment parameters will be&#xD;
      included in the model as fixed effects together with the baseline value of the relevant&#xD;
      variable as a covariate. Change in categorical outcomes from week 0 to week 16 will be&#xD;
      analyzed using mixed model logistic regression with the same fixed effects and covariates as&#xD;
      described for the continuous outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary endpoints without repeated measurements, missing data imputations will be made&#xD;
      using Multiple Imputation of Chained Equations (MICE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For continuous outcomes without repeated measurements, outcomes will be analyzed using ANCOVA&#xD;
      to detect differences between the liraglutide and the liraglutide placebo group. In the model&#xD;
      baseline demographic, illness or treatment parameters will be included. Categorical outcomes&#xD;
      without repeated measurements will be analyzed using a multiple mixed effect logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis model, where baseline demographic, illness or treatment parameters will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup and sensitivity analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of the primary&#xD;
      analyses. These analyses will be performed using regression analysis for continuous outcomes&#xD;
      and logistic regression for categorical outcomes. The analyses will consider clinically or&#xD;
      mechanistically relevant baseline and intra-treatment variables, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
