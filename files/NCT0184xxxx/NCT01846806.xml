    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study designed to examine the role of bacterial overgrowth and delayed&#xD;
      intestinal transit and the effect of Rifaximin with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This study&#xD;
      is divided into Phase A and Phase B. The purpose of Phase A is to test patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis to determine if they have bacterial overgrowth which may lead to slow intestinal&#xD;
      transit and hepatic encephalopathy. The purpose of Phase B is to investigate whether the&#xD;
      improvement found in patients with hepatic encephalopathy taking Rifaximin is also related to&#xD;
      decreased bacterial overgrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' mental capacity will be assessed at each visit via interview, brief mental status,&#xD;
      questionnaires and psychometric evaluation. Any subject who appears to have lost capacity to&#xD;
      continue participation, as evidenced by HE grade 2 or higher, a lack of attentiveness,&#xD;
      concentration, or understanding of evaluation, will be discontinued from the study. Female&#xD;
      subjects of childbearing potential will be asked to comply with the use of contraception&#xD;
      during the Phase B study period as well as throughout the time they remain on study drug.&#xD;

      This is a prospective study designed to examine the role of bacterial overgrowth and delayed&#xD;
      intestinal transit and the effect of Rifaximin with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This study&#xD;
      is divided into Phase A and Phase B. The purpose of Phase A is to test patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis to determine if they have bacterial overgrowth which may lead to slow intestinal&#xD;
      transit and hepatic encephalopathy. The purpose of Phase B is to investigate whether the&#xD;
      improvement found in patients with hepatic encephalopathy taking Rifaximin is also related to&#xD;
      decreased bacterial overgrowth. The target population is patients with chronic liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis with or without symptoms of HE. Many patients may present with advanced cirrhosis&#xD;
      and may be on the liver transplant list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase A, 20 patients will be asked to sign the informed consent form and will be&#xD;
      assigned a subject number. They will be asked to provide demographic information, medical&#xD;
      history, history of hospitalizations for HE, and HE medication use. They will undergo a&#xD;
      complete physical examination, urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential),&#xD;
      12-lead EKG, grading of ascites, modified Child Pugh Score, MELD Score. They will also&#xD;
      complete the following neuropsychological questionnaires: NCT, D-KEFS Trail Making Test,&#xD;
      California Verbal Learning Test, WAIS-III Digit Symbol-Coding and Block Design, D-KEFS Stroop&#xD;
      Color-Word Test, Evaluation of Constructional Apraxia, , and asterixis. During the evaluation&#xD;
      visit (a minimum of 3 days after the Screening Visit) the following procedures will be&#xD;
      performed: lab tests (chemistry and hematology panels). They will also complete the following&#xD;
      questionnaires: Liver Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire, Fisk Fatigue Impact Score,&#xD;
      Flatulence Survey, Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Finally, they will undergo a Lactulose Hydrogen&#xD;
      Breath Test: This test is designed to evaluate both intestinal transit and bacterial&#xD;
      overgrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Phase B will be administered of 550 mg of Rifaximin two times a day for 14&#xD;
      days. Patients will be scheduled to come in on day 14 of the active study period. The follow&#xD;
      up visit is day 28, where some of the tests described above will be repeated. During Phase B,&#xD;
      patients will be asked to undergo a complete physical examination, a Neurological Examination&#xD;
      [including calculation of modified Child Pugh and MELD Score NCT, and Trail Making Test],&#xD;
      evaluation of constructional apraxia and asterixis. In addition, the researchers will make&#xD;
      sure the patient meets eligibility criteria for participation in open label trial of&#xD;
      Rifaximin. They will be administered the first dose study drug (Rifaximin) by study&#xD;
      coordinator or investigator and they will be dispensed the study drug needed for the&#xD;
      remainder of the trial and a diary for them to record daily flatulence. A urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test will be performed within 48 hours of first study dose (for women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential). During Day 14 and Day 28 visits, patients will have 1 tablespoon of blood drawn&#xD;
      for measurement of the ammonia level and to monitor for potential blood clots. They will&#xD;
      complete the NCT, Trails Test, Digit Symbol-Coding, Block Design, and Stroop Tests. They will&#xD;
      also complete the Liver Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire, Fisk Fatigue Impact Score,&#xD;
      Flatulence Survey (A diary will be provided to the patient with instructions on how to record&#xD;
      flatulence experiences on a daily basis), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaires. In&#xD;
      addition, on Day 14, they will undergo another Lactulose Hydrogen Breath Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' mental capacity will be assessed at each visit via interview, brief mental status,&#xD;
      questionnaires and psychometric evaluation. Any subject who appears to have lost capacity to&#xD;
      continue participation, as evidenced by HE grade 2 or higher, a lack of attentiveness,&#xD;
      concentration, or understanding of evaluation, will be discontinued from the study. Female&#xD;
      subjects of childbearing potential will be asked to comply with the use of contraception&#xD;
      during the Phase B study period as well as throughout the time they remain on study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the study, patients will be categorized by the degree of HE. To&#xD;
      determine whether impaired intestinal transit and bacterial overgrowth are associated with&#xD;
      severity of HE, multivariate analysis will be performed to determine whether the independent&#xD;
      factors of liver disease severity, intestinal transit, and bacterial overgrowth are&#xD;
      significant predictors of the presence and severity of HE. Also, to determine whether&#xD;
      treatment with Rifaximin improves bacterial overgrowth, ammonia levels, and HE, changes in&#xD;
      Breath Test analysis be correlated will be correlated with changes in ammonia levels and HE.&#xD;
