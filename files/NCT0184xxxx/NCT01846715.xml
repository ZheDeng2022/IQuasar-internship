  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and optimal delivery of the&#xD;
      Neo-Kidney Augment (NKA) when implanted at one site in a recipient kidney. NKA is made from&#xD;
      expanded autologous, homologous, selected renal cells (SRC) obtained from the patient's&#xD;
      kidney biopsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic intervention with NKA is intended to delay the need for renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (dialysis or transplant) which at this time, is inevitable in patients with CKD. NKA is&#xD;
      composed of autologous, homologous selected renal cells (SRC) formulated in a Biomaterial&#xD;
      (gelatin-based hydrogel). SRC are the biologically active component of NKA. Proof of&#xD;
      principle for SRC as the biologically active component of NKA was established in multiple&#xD;
      models of CKD. Based on nonclinical efficacy and safety data, a single NKA dose will be&#xD;
      delivered to patients in this FIH clinical trial. This dose provides a minimum of a 1.5-fold&#xD;
      safety margin over doses delivered safely in nonclinical studies. In addition, this dose&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy in a nonclinical disease model.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the occurrence of procedure and/or product related adverse events (AEs) through three months post-implantation. The primary outcome measures are procedure- and/or NK product-related AEs through 3 months post-implantation. Procedure related AEs include events considered related to the surgical procedures, biopsy or implantation of NKA including HARS, and not to other study-specific procedures (e.g., MRI or blood draws).</description>

    <measure>Change in the rate of renal disease progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months post-implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint of the study is the change in the rate of progression of renal insufficiency, as measured by laboratory tests of renal function. The secondary outcome measures are laboratory assessments of renal function to assess changes in the rate of progression of renal insufficiency for each patient. Specifically, eGFR (based on cystatin-C and iohexol clearance), sCr, and ACR will be followed for 6 months to assess the post-implant rate of change compared to pre-implant changes.</description>
