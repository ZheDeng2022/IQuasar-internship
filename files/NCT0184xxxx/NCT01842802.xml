&#xD;
          -  Subjects presenting excess abdominal tissue (fat and skin), are candidates for an&#xD;
             abdominoplasty procedure and are willing to allow the use of this device on their skin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who will allow the excess skin removed as part of the abdominoplasty to be&#xD;
