      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug is effective in treating a&#xD;
      specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that sulindac is still being studied and that&#xD;
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not yet&#xD;
      approved the use of sulindac for your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study must have undergone previous chemotherapy and achieved complete&#xD;
      remission, which is the absence of disease activity in people with a chronic illness, in this&#xD;
      case AML. Unfortunately, a significant number of patients with AML who achieve a complete&#xD;
      remission with initial chemotherapy eventually experience a relapse, often within a few&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research studies have demonstrated that a type of medication frequently used to&#xD;
      treat inflammation, called a COX inhibitor, may suppress and kill leukemia cells. COX&#xD;
      inhibitors work by blocking a class of proteins called COX proteins. Other commonly used COX&#xD;
      inhibitors are ibuprofen and naproxen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators are using a COX inhibitor called sulindac, which has been&#xD;
      FDA approved and used to treat pain and inflammation for many years, and has also been&#xD;
      studied in suppressing certain tumors of the gastrointestinal system. The main goal of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether sulindac can help participants remain in a state of complete&#xD;
      remission following the initial course of chemotherapy for AML, and two cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy that is standard of care for your cancer, called consolidation chemotherapy.&#xD;
      During the course of this study, the investigators will also attempt to learn more about how&#xD;
      COX inhibition suppresses the emergence of leukemia, at the molecular and cellular level, by&#xD;
      studying the participants on this trial.&#xD;

      To determine if you are eligible to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo&#xD;
      some screening tests or procedures. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part&#xD;
      of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out you do not take part in the&#xD;
      research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may&#xD;
      not have to be repeated. These procedures include a medical history, performance status,&#xD;
      medical record review, routine blood tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and research&#xD;
      blood samples. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research&#xD;
      study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you&#xD;
      will not be able to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will begin the study with up to two cycles of chemotherapy that is an accepted approach&#xD;
      treatment of your type of leukemia. This is called consolidation chemotherapy. If you&#xD;
      experience severe side effects, you may only be given one cycle. You will begin to take&#xD;
      sulindac after you complete consolidation therapy. The consolidation therapy that is commonly&#xD;
      used for your type of cancer is a chemotherapy drug called cytarabine. Each cycle of&#xD;
      consolidation chemotherapy will be 28 days, or four weeks. You will receive cytarabine via IV&#xD;
      infusion on Days 1-5 of each cycle, over a period of 3 hours. You will be admitted to MGH for&#xD;
      approximately a week during each cycle of consolidation chemotherapy with cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting sulindac, the same tests and procedures done at the screening visit listed&#xD;
      above will be repeated. This visit is &quot;Day 0&quot;, meaning it takes place prior to study&#xD;
      treatment with sulindac. In addition, you will also have a sample of your bone marrow taken&#xD;
      for research purposes. This sample is related to the study and will help us understand better&#xD;
      the activity of the study drug, sulindac, on leukemia cells and the effect of the body on the&#xD;
      sulindac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take sulindac twice a day. Sulindac comes in the form of tablets and can be taken at&#xD;
      home by mouth. Your first day of taking sulindac will be called day 1. The following tests&#xD;
      and procedures will be one in the outpatient clinic on Day 1 of the study: Blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken at 3 points on day 1. These will occur before the first dose of sulindac, 1 hour&#xD;
      after the first dose of sulindac, and 4 hours after the first dose of sulindac. Approximately&#xD;
      3 teaspoons of blood will be drawn each time. These samples are related to the study and will&#xD;
      help us understand better the activity of the study drug, sulindac, on leukemia cells and the&#xD;
      effect of the body on sulindac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will come into the clinic for dosing on day 2 (Visit 3) of the study. Approximately 3&#xD;
      teaspoons of blood will be drawn before dosing. 3 teaspoons of blood will also be drawn prior&#xD;
      to dosing on days 8, 15 and 28 of study treatment with sulindac. These samples will be stored&#xD;
      for as long as research is ongoing with currently no end date. You will continue sulindac&#xD;
      twice daily for the duration of the study, which will be 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be monitored for bleeding, since COX inhibitors can also decrease platelet function&#xD;
      and affect clotting abilities, and for gastritis or ulcer disease, as COX inhibitors can&#xD;
      damage the lining of the stomach. These occur in the minority of participants, but you will&#xD;
      be monitored closely on this study for these unexpected effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you develop toxicities on therapy, your dose of sulindac may be reduced or if your&#xD;
      symptoms are severe enough, you may be taken off sulindac. If for whatever reason you are&#xD;
      unable to participate in the study or adhere to the schedules and study treatments, you will&#xD;
      be taken off the study treatment and discontinued from the study. You may choose to stop&#xD;
      treatment and come off the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to keep track of your medical condition and overall health following the 12&#xD;
      months of study treatment on study with sulindac. This will not involve any communication,&#xD;
      but only occasional review of your medical record in regards to medical condition and overall&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
