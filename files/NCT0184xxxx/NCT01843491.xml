      This is an open label Phase 1 study of the Ad-PfCA vaccine designed to 1) provide reagents&#xD;
      for the development and refinement of cell-mediated immunoassays for measuring the human&#xD;
      immune response to candidate malaria vaccines (especially protective malaria vaccines such as&#xD;
      DNA/Ad-PfCA where better assays are needed to identify the correlates of protective immunity)&#xD;
      and 2) to provide a repository of antigen-specific PBMCs that can be used as positive and&#xD;
      negative controls in cell mediated immunoassays.&#xD;

      This is an open label Phase 1 study of the Ad-PfCA vaccine designed to 1) provide reagents&#xD;
      for the development and refinement of cell-mediated immunoassays for measuring the human&#xD;
      immune response to candidate malaria vaccines (especially protective malaria vaccines such as&#xD;
      DNA/Ad-PfCA where better assays are needed to identify the correlates of protective immunity)&#xD;
      and 2) to provide a repository of antigen-specific PBMCs that can be used as positive and&#xD;
      negative controls in cell mediated immunoassays. The study group will consist of up to 35&#xD;
      healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years who have been screened to meet inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be eligible for participation regardless of baseline adenovirus 5 serostatus.&#xD;
      At least 6 subjects will be &quot;malaria naïve&quot;, meaning that 1) they have not been the recipient&#xD;
      of a malaria vaccine, 2) they have no history of malaria infection or travel to a malaria&#xD;
      endemic region within 6 months of first leukapheresis procedure or 60mL blood draw, 3) they&#xD;
      have no history of long-term residence (&gt;5 years) in an area known to have significant&#xD;
      transmission of P. falciparum, and 4) they have a negative P. falciparum circumsporozoite&#xD;
      (PfCSP) ELISpot assay at baseline. (From herein, for simplicity, we refer to PfCSP simply as&#xD;
      CSP). The remaining subjects will have no restrictions regarding receipt of malaria vaccines,&#xD;
      travel history or baseline CSP ELISpot results. Although it is more difficult to recruit&#xD;
      &quot;malaria-naïve&quot; subjects, the inclusion of at least 6 such subjects should provide a more&#xD;
      varied array of immune responses; this may be helpful for assay development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive a single administration of the Ad-PfCA malaria candidate&#xD;
      vaccine at a dose of 2 x 1010 pu by intramuscular injection. Approximately 1 month&#xD;
      pre-immunization, study subjects will either have a large number of PBMCs collected by means&#xD;
      of leukapheresis, or a simple 60 mL blood draw, dependent upon initial pre-screening.&#xD;
      Pre-immunization samples designated for the repository do not require large volume sampling&#xD;
      of PBMCs. Rather, a 60 mL whole blood draw is sufficient for repository purposes. Thus,&#xD;
      subjects will be separated into sub-groups, dependent upon initial pre-screening. Subjects&#xD;
      whose samples are designated for the repository will undergo a simple, 60 mL blood draw in&#xD;
      lieu of leukapheresis #1 (sub-group A). Samples assigned for assay development will be&#xD;
      obtained from sub-group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1 month post-immunization, study subjects in both sub-groups will have PBMCs&#xD;
      collected by means of leukapheresis. Consultation with immunology experts after&#xD;
      post-immunization screening will assist to identify those subjects whose samples do not meet&#xD;
      assay development or repository needs. In an effort to eliminate unnecessary procedures for&#xD;
      subjects, these individuals will not undergo a second leukapheresis, but will return for&#xD;
      their safety visit on day 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each leukapheresis/60 mL blood draw, a sample will be tested by CSP-ELISpot and AMA1&#xD;
      ELISpot; the results will be used to categorize samples (see below). Follow up visits will&#xD;
      occur 2, 7, 14, 21, and 84 days following immunization. Depending on guidance from the FDA,&#xD;
      subjects will then be followed annually by phone, email, or mailings up to five years from&#xD;
      the time of immunization per FDA recommendation.&#xD;
