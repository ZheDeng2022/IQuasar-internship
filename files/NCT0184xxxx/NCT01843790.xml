  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline to Week 8 between placebo and GCS-100 treatment. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of GCS-100 administered for 8&#xD;
      weeks relative to placebo. In addition, the study will measure the effect of GCS-100 on&#xD;
      circulating galectin-3 and other markers of disease activity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Galectin-3 contributes to fibrosis, is elevated in patients with ESRD, and correlates with&#xD;
      adverse outcomes (de Boer et. al., 2011, Dang et. al., 2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et. al.,&#xD;
      2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate&#xD;
      a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney (Dang et. al., 2012,&#xD;
      Fernandes Bertocchi et. al., 2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). GCS-100 is a galectin- 3&#xD;
      antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically. Based on the role of&#xD;
      galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at&#xD;
      treating patients with CKD.&#xD;
