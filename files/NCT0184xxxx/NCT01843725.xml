  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective non randomized, non-comparative, dose escalation, two arms open phase I trial to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of capecitabine given in combination with aflibercept in&#xD;
      patients with measurable or evaluable, chemorefractory digestive tumors or breast tumors in&#xD;
      terms of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), To&#xD;
      establish the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of capecitabine in combination with&#xD;
      Aflibercept.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aflibercept has been found to be active with a broad pharmacological index against early and&#xD;
      advanced stage disease in a variety of preclinical solid tumor models including sarcomas, and&#xD;
      ovarian, prostate, mammary, colon, and gastric carcinomas either as a single agent or in&#xD;
      combination with cytotoxic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metronomic chemotherapy, namely administration of continuous low-dose chemotherapy at close,&#xD;
      regular intervals, with no prolonged drug-free interruptions, bases its rationale on the fact&#xD;
      that virtually all classes of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs are designed to damage DNA or&#xD;
      disrupt microtubules of dividing cells. Endothelial cell division takes place during new&#xD;
      blood vessel formation, including tumour angiogenesis. Frequent administration of most&#xD;
      cytotoxic agents at low doses is thought to increase their putative antiangiogenic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This strategy lowers the toxicity and theoretically the risk of emergence of drug-resistant&#xD;
      tumour cells compared to classic maximum tolerated dose (MTD)-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
