  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic populations in the US are dis-proportionally affected by high rates of obesity and&#xD;
      diabetes; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Latinos are the&#xD;
      minority group with the second-highest obesity prevalence in adults. In comparison to the&#xD;
      general female population (61.2%), Mexican American women (73%) have a greater overweight or&#xD;
      obese percentage. In addition, more than 50% of Hispanic men and women are expected to&#xD;
      develop type-2 diabetes over their lifetime, compared to 40% among whites. Hispanics are also&#xD;
      50% more likely to die from diabetes compared to whites. In many cases Hispanic populations&#xD;
      do not have the knowledge, self-confidence and resources to participate in mainstream&#xD;
      physical activity and nutrition interventions, which are usually geared towards the general&#xD;
      population without considering cultural and linguistic differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and communication technologies in the form of Internet and mobile phone access&#xD;
      have grown enormously during the past decade; these technologies have the potential to affect&#xD;
      food intake and physical activity as well as weight loss. Approximately 95% of countries have&#xD;
      mobile telephone networks and about 70% of people worldwide use mobile phones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CareMessage is a Google-backed 501(c)3 nonprofit technology organization based in San&#xD;
      Francisco that uses 'smart' text and voice messaging to enable clinical staff to provide&#xD;
      automated yet personalized support to patients struggling with chronic conditions. The&#xD;
      CareMessage™ Adult Obesity texting program adapts the Health Belief Model by strategically&#xD;
      implementing behavioral concepts to help improve self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will pilot test its effectiveness among a sample of Hispanic women who are&#xD;
      at risk of obesity and diabetes by sending a culturally-sensitive and&#xD;
      linguistically-appropriate text-based message three to 5 times a week, encouraging lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications (diet and exercise education and behavior modification).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will collect data on 40 obese (Body Mass Index 30-45) Hispanic women ages&#xD;
      21 to 65 years. The purpose of this research study is to test the efficacy of a mobile phone&#xD;
      text message-based intervention on weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verifying eligibility and enrolling in the study, participants will come to Washington&#xD;
      University School of Medicine, at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and fill out some questionnaires.&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a brief exam that measures the lean and fat tissue using Dual&#xD;
      Energy x-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) technology and will also do a modified 3-hour oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (MOGTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear an accelerometer (activity monitor) over a 7-day period at the&#xD;
      beginning (before being randomized and enrolled in the intervention) and at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the participants will be randomized to the intervention group. The intervention group&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the CareMessage™ Adult Obesity texting program, which sends a text&#xD;
      message 3 to 5 times a week, encouraging lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise&#xD;
      education, and behavioral strategies) that can lead to healthy weight loss. The control group&#xD;
      will receive an initial talk about weight loss but will not be enrolled in any program or&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After six months have passed, participants will return to Washington University School of&#xD;
      Medicine, regardless of the group they were assigned to, for two final visits (a short one,&#xD;
      to pick up another activity monitor seven days before the study ends, and a longer visit, to&#xD;
      do some final testing and fill out some questionnaires).&#xD;
