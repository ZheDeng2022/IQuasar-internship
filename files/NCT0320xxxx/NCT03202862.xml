  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      500mg Fulvestrant (Faslodex®) in ESR1 mutated postmenopausal women with hormone receptor&#xD;
      positive, HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after previous aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy. Fifty patients will be enrolled and treated with 500 mg Fulvestrant until&#xD;
      disease progression or study closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, unless any of the criteria for treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation are met first. If a patient progresses during the treatment period, the&#xD;
      patient must be withdrawn from the treatment and further treatment will be at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be followed up for disease progression, regardless of whether they have&#xD;
      discontinued treatment, unless they have withdrawn consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be determined based on tumor assessments performed by each investigator&#xD;
      according to RECIST 1.1. Safety will be monitored based on the frequency and severity of&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments will be assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) or X ray if necessary every 12 weeks for all patients until documented evidence of&#xD;
      objective disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities will be done by the investigator in accordance&#xD;
      with CFDA regulations.&#xD;
