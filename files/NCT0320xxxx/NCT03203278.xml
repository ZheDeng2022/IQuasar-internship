  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the effect of a 12 week personalised&#xD;
      exercise programme delivered using a web-based platform, compared to usual care, on glycaemic&#xD;
      control, muscle strength, functional ability, blood lipid profile, blood pressure and quality&#xD;
      of life in adult South Asians with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A mixed method approach involving both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative component will consist of a single blind, randomised controlled trial (RCT),&#xD;
      which will explore the effects of the intervention on glycaemic control (blood sugar levels)&#xD;
      and other secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative component will consist of face to face interviews to explore the views of&#xD;
      participants regarding acceptability and barriers affecting adherence to this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be informed about the study at hospital diabetes clinics,&#xD;
      community health organisations, support groups, places of worship and General Practitioner&#xD;
      (GP) surgeries. Recruitment is estimated to last for 9 months. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      sent a participant information sheet (PIS) in either English or Urdu, depending on their&#xD;
      preference. Those wishing to take part will meet the researcher at a convenient location, for&#xD;
      eligibility screening and consent. If necessary, translation services can be arranged for&#xD;
      those with limited English throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomised to either the intervention or&#xD;
      control group. Participants in the control group will be asked to continue their usual care&#xD;
      and day to day physical activity routine. In addition, they will be given general information&#xD;
      about diabetes management. Participants who wish to use the website for exercise will be&#xD;
      provided with access at the end of all assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the intervention group will be asked to perform a personalised&#xD;
      exercise programme, undertaken three times a week (with no more than two rest days between&#xD;
      sessions) for 12 weeks. Participants will meet the researcher face to face immediately after&#xD;
      randomisation. During this meeting, a brief physical assessment will be undertaken and&#xD;
      exercise goals will be discussed and agreed with participants. The researcher will then&#xD;
      design a personalised exercise programme for each participant using the resources available&#xD;
      on the web-based exercise website. The exercise programme prescription and progression will&#xD;
      be in line with American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American College of Sports Medicine&#xD;
      (ACSM) guidelines (Colberg et al. 2016). The website (www.webbasedphysio.com) will be used to&#xD;
      deliver the intervention. This website has been modified, in collaboration with South Asians,&#xD;
      to be culturally suitable for people of South Asian backgrounds in terms of content and&#xD;
      language (Albalawi et al, under review). The researcher will contact participants every two&#xD;
      weeks via telephone to encourage use of the website, ask about progress, and to deal with any&#xD;
      technical issues that they might face while using the website. Participants will be advised&#xD;
      to contact the researcher to request a change in their programme or if a problem arises. The&#xD;
      researcher will make changes remotely and participants will be informed of any changes by&#xD;
      phone or email. Participants will be asked to meet the researcher face to face to discuss&#xD;
      progression and goals at week 6 (midway). Regardless of groups allocation, all participants&#xD;
      will be assessed three times by a blind assessor at baseline (week=0) , after the end of the&#xD;
      intervention (week=12) and 8 weeks after the end of the intervention (week=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of outcome measures will take place at convenient locations and each visit should&#xD;
      take no more than 90 minutes. Travel expenses will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time&#xD;
      without being obliged to give notice or provide any explanation. Any data collected before&#xD;
      their withdrawal will be considered in the analysis.&#xD;
