    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of VRC01 in&#xD;
      HIV-1-infected infants beginning combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VRC01 is an experimental human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of VRC01 in HIV-1-infected&#xD;
      infants initiating cART within 12 weeks of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infants will be randomly assigned to either receive VRC01 (Arm 1) or not receive VRC01&#xD;
      (Arm 2). Infants in Arm 1 will receive VRC01 at study entry (Week 0) and Weeks 2, 6, and 10.&#xD;
      Infants in Arm 2 will receive no study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend study visits at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 16, 20, 24, 36, and&#xD;
      48. Visits will include physical examinations, blood and urine collection, and specimen&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants' mothers may optionally be enrolled in the study for one-time specimen collection for&#xD;
      exploratory evaluations. Maternal study participation is not required for infant study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration is approximately two years. Accrual is expected to require approximately one&#xD;
      year, and each infant will complete 48 weeks of follow-up.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Infant has any other condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator or&#xD;
             designee, would make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of&#xD;

&#xD;
        Maternal Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The mothers of enrolled infants will be asked to consent to blood collection and storage&#xD;
