      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fanconi anemia is a genetic disease. Some people with it have reduced blood cell counts. This&#xD;
      means their bone marrow no longer works properly. These people may need blood transfusions&#xD;
      for anemia (low red blood cells) or low platelet counts or bleeding. Researchers want to see&#xD;
      if a new drug will help people with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if a new drug, eltrombopag, is effective in people with Fanconi anemia. To know&#xD;
      how long the drug needs to be given to improve blood counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People at least 2 years old with Fanconi anemia with reduced blood cell counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with blood and urine tests. They will repeat this before&#xD;
      starting to take the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take eltrombopag pills by mouth once a day for 24 weeks. They will be&#xD;
      monitored closely for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood tests every 2 weeks while on eltrombopag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit NIH 3 months and 6 months after starting eltrombopag. At these&#xD;
      visits, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answer questions about their medical history, how they are feeling, and their quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a bone marrow sample taken by needle from the hip. The area will be numbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants blood cell counts improve, they might join the extended access part of the&#xD;
      study. They will continue taking eltrombopag for 3 years and sign a different consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 24 weeks of treatment, if there is no improvement in blood cell counts, participants&#xD;
      will stop taking eltrombopag. They will return for an optional follow-up visit that repeats&#xD;
      the study visits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disease that often presents as a bone marrow failure&#xD;
      (BMF) syndrome but also can affect any other organ. Etiologically, loss of function mutations&#xD;
      in more than 21 different gene members of the FA core complex (i.e. FANCA-FANCV) have been&#xD;
      associated with FA. The FA core complex is involved in interstrand cross-link DNA damage&#xD;
      repair during cell division. Impaired DNA repair causes genomic instability which&#xD;
      consequently can cause apoptosis of the cell or malignant transformation. In addition to&#xD;
      impaired DNA repair mechanisms, FA cells exhibit increased sensitivity to pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (e.g. IFN- &gt;=, TNF- ) and elevated levels of these cytokines have been associated&#xD;
      with bone marrow failure in subjects with FA and other inherited bone marrow failure&#xD;
      syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with FA may present with congenital anomalies, such as microcephaly or short&#xD;
      stature. However, the failure of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment to produce&#xD;
      sufficient numbers of peripheral blood cells, and progression to myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia are the greatest risk factors for morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, particular in young patients with FA In a few reported cases, spontaneous somatic&#xD;
      reversion of inherited mutations has resulted in a selective growth advantage of corrected&#xD;
      HSCs that subsequently restored hematopoiesis. However, therapeutic options are limited in&#xD;
      FA. Although HSC transplantation outcomes have significantly improved over the past two&#xD;
      decades, donor availability, graft failure, and FA-specific transplant toxicities are still&#xD;
      significant hurdles towards a curative treatment of FA-associated BMF. Moreover, attempts at&#xD;
      genetic correction of FA are not yet ready for patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetic eltrombopag (EPAG) has recently been shown to be effective&#xD;
      in restoring tri-lineage hematopoiesis in patients with treatment refractory acquired severe&#xD;
      aplastic anemia (SAA). Of particular interest for patients with FA is the observation that&#xD;
      EPAG also improves the repair of double strand DNA breaks, a mechanism that is impaired in&#xD;
      patients with FA. Additionally, our pre-clinical studies indicate that EPAG evades INF- &gt;=&#xD;
      blockade of signal transduction from the TPO receptor (c-MPL) resulting in improved survival&#xD;
      and proliferation of HSCs. Based on these clinical and pre-clinical studies, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that EPAG will improve peripheral blood cell counts in patients with FA and thus positively&#xD;
      affect morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II clinical trial proposes to treat patients with FA for 6 months with EPAG to&#xD;
      assess safety and efficacy at improving hematological manifestations of FA. Responders at 6&#xD;
      months will be able to continue EPAG on the extension part of this protocol for an additional&#xD;
      3 years. During this time frame we anticipate further improvement of peripheral blood cells&#xD;
      counts that will eventually result in the discontinuation of EPAG after a tapering period.&#xD;
      Translational studies will explore EPAG effects on DNA repair activity, apoptosis, global&#xD;
      transcriptome and TPO signaling pathways in patient s hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells&#xD;
      (HSPCs).&#xD;

                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In&#xD;
                  the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman&#xD;
                  has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of&#xD;
