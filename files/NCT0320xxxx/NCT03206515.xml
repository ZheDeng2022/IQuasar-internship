  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) has been considered as the first-line choice for the&#xD;
      management of &gt;20mm kidney stones. Microchannel percutaneous nephrolithotomy (Mini PCNL)&#xD;
      which takes nephrolithotomy channel size less than or equal to 18, was first used in the&#xD;
      treatment of children with kidney stones in 1997, then gradually applied to adult, aims to&#xD;
      achieve the similar stone clearance rate as the standard channels, at the same time, reduce&#xD;
      the complications. At present, the use of percutaneous renal surgery in our country is more&#xD;
      than 18F plastic peel-away sheath, with the access sheath with a suction-evacuation function&#xD;
      was first used by Guohua Zeng and so on. But there is still a lack of high quality evidence&#xD;
      of Evidence-based medical evidence to compare the two kinds of sheath for the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness. Therefore, this study provides a reliable theoretical basis for the choice of&#xD;
      the sheath for the treatment of 2-5cm size Kidney, and ultimately benefit patients with 20mm.&#xD;
