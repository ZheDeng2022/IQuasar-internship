      A randomized controlled trial was conducted in cardiology department and smoking cessation&#xD;
      center of University Hospital of Monastir (Tunisia). All smokers Hospitalized for ACS were&#xD;
      included. Participants were randomly assigned to either group &quot;A&quot;, initiating Nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy (NRT) in intra-hospitalization or a control group &quot;B&quot; that received NRT&#xD;
      after hospital discharge. The end point assessment was smoking abstinence at 24 weeks&#xD;
      following randomization, defined as self-reported abstinence in the past week before the 24&#xD;
      week clinic visit confirmed by a measured exhaled carbon monoxide ≤8 ppm. Data were analyzed&#xD;
      by intention to treat.&#xD;

      Background: Smoking is the main preventable cause worldwide of morbidity and premature death&#xD;
      (1). It is a major and independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) (2). More&#xD;
      than two-thirds of sudden cardiac death resulting from acute thrombus occurs in smokers (3).&#xD;
      Compared to non-smokers the odds ratio (OR) for myocardial infarction is about 2.5, and for&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases overall the OR is about 2 (2) (4). Smoking cessation in persons with&#xD;
      known CHD reduces the risk of recurrent myocardial infarctions or cardiovascular death by 30&#xD;
      % to 50 % (5,6) during the subsequent 3 to 7 years (7). Nevertheless, although smoking&#xD;
      cessation is potentially the most effective CHD prevention strategy (5), quitting smoking is&#xD;
      difficult and two-thirds of patients will return to smoking within one year of their acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome (ACS) (8,9). So, being hospitalized for a major cardiac condition, such as&#xD;
      ACS can be an opportunity to prompt many individuals to stop smoking. Through using this&#xD;
      &quot;teachable moment&quot; immediately after an ACS, it may be possible to increase smoking&#xD;
      abstinence in this high-risk population (9). Cessation rates among smokers hospitalized for&#xD;
      ACS, range from 31% without intervention to 60% with sustained intervention post&#xD;
      hospitalization, at one year follow-up (10). Although Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT),&#xD;
      Bupropion, and Varenicline have demonstrated efficacy medical treatment for smoking cessation&#xD;
      compared with placebo (9). NRT improved cessation rates as well with an OR of 1.84 (95% CI&#xD;
      1.71 to 1.99) (2) and no adverse events was found (1). However, the smoking cessation remains&#xD;
      a secondary concern in cardiology departments and there is no well strategies offered to&#xD;
      these smoker patients with established CHD. Furthermore, there were no difference in&#xD;
      cessation rates between this population and the general population despite the proved benefit&#xD;
      of smoking cessation on clinical outcomes in CHD patients (11). Many studies have examined&#xD;
      the benefits of smoking cessation after ACS and the efficacy of smoking cessation&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy's in hospitalized patients with ACS but few randomized controlled trials have&#xD;
      examined the efficacy time of smoking cessation in hospitalized patients with ACS either&#xD;
      during the hospitalization or after hospital discharge. We aimed at comparing, among patients&#xD;
      with ACS, the smoking cessation rates with NRT when began in-hospitalization, against that&#xD;
      began after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design and study population: We have carried out a randomized controlled trial conducted&#xD;
           simultaneously in the smoking cessation center and the department of cardiology at the&#xD;
           University Hospital of Monastir (Tunisia). This study was performed from January 2015 to&#xD;
           Jun 2016 with a mean of 24 weeks of run-up and 24 weeks of follow-up. We have included&#xD;
           patients aged more than 18 years, hospitalized with an ACS actively smoking at the time&#xD;
           of inclusion, motivated to quit smoking, able to provide informed consent and willing to&#xD;
           participate in a clinical study including a follow-up examination every 2 weeks after&#xD;
           hospital discharge. Active smoking was defined as smoking one cigarette or more (or&#xD;
           water pipe) per day during the month preceding the hospital stay. Non-inclusion criteria&#xD;
           were the refusal of assistance of smoking cessation, inability to follow-up clinical&#xD;
           visit (professional, regional or physical hindrance), diagnosis of depression or of&#xD;
           serious health condition at admission (ventilated patient, cardiogenic shock, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size: We hypothesized that nicotine replacement therapy after ACS during&#xD;
           hospitalization would improve the rate of smoking cessation rate comparing to that after&#xD;
           hospitalization discharge from 32.7% up to 51% . This was considered realistic because&#xD;
           of the previous study reported a rate of 51% among smokers who received the NRT&#xD;
           in-hospital smoking cessation intervention (12) and 32.7% among patients receiving&#xD;
           treatments after hospital discharge (13). The expected sample size of 68 participants&#xD;
           would enable us to identify such an increase in the smoking cessation rate with a power&#xD;
           of 0.80 and a two-sided p-value of &lt;0.05. The proportion of patients who dropped out or&#xD;
           withdrew was expected to be 30%. Hence a sample size of 89 was estimate to be adequate,&#xD;
           we have included 99 consecutive patients (14). Computer randomization was performed,&#xD;
           after consent was obtained. Blinding was not possible. Participants randomized to arm&#xD;
           &quot;A&quot; have received a smoking cessation counseling and a Nicotine Replacement Therapy&#xD;
           (NRT) during intra-hospital stay one day after SCA. Those in arm &quot;B&quot; have benefited a&#xD;
           smoking cessation counseling during intra-hospital stay, while the NRT was offered on a&#xD;
           mean of 14 days after SCA in the first clinical visit after hospital discharge. All&#xD;
           patients received a regular follow-up visits in smoking cessation center after hospital&#xD;
           discharge every 2 weeks. Of the 99 patients enrolled in the study, 44 (81.4 %) and 30&#xD;
           (66.6 %) patients had respectively completed the follow-up smoking cessation in arm A&#xD;
           and arm B. Loss to follow up was equivalent in two arms (p=0.1) (Fig 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethical considerations: The study was conducted in accordance with good clinical&#xD;
           practice and the ethical standards described in the Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study protocol and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the hospital-stay: All patients included in the two arms study, received an&#xD;
           individual therapeutic education associated to motivational interview. The therapeutic&#xD;
           education aimed to explain tobacco addiction, psychological, physical and behavioral&#xD;
           tobacco dependence, the efficiency of NRT in the smoking cessation and introduce&#xD;
           examples of behavioral strategies that the patient might adopt when leaving the hospital&#xD;
           to overcome his nicotine dependence. Data was collected through a self-administered&#xD;
           questionnaire. Patients were asked about their socio-demographic status, history of&#xD;
           tobacco use, level of nicotine dependence (Fagerstrom test for Nicotine Dependence:&#xD;
           FTNDs) (15), psychological state (using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)&#xD;
           (16), co-addiction (alcohol, drugs, cannabis) and the level of motivation to quit&#xD;
           smoking (QMAT scale) (17). Participants in &quot;A&quot; arm have start NRT. The first appointment&#xD;
           was scheduled at one week from hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After hospital discharge: Participants in &quot;B&quot; arm have start NRT. In the first clinic&#xD;
           visit, 2 weeks after SCA event. All patients received a second session of therapeutic&#xD;
           education Side effects, symptoms of withdrawal, medication adherence, and smoking status&#xD;
           were assessed during follow-up contacts. Smoking status was assessed by self-report of&#xD;
           smoking in the preceding 7 days. Self-reported abstinence was confirmed using&#xD;
           biochemical validation via exhaled carbon monoxide (ECO) levels. ECO was measured using&#xD;
           the CO Check + (18) manufactured by MD Diagnostics Ltd, England. The threshold of&#xD;
           exhaled carbon monoxide was a value under 8 ppm. Follow-up involved clinic visits every&#xD;
           2 weeks and phone calls to patients missing their meeting, a new consultation was&#xD;
           organized as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A reduction of NRT dose by a third was required every 28 days and NRT dosage adjustment&#xD;
           was done according to signs of under or overdose. During the processing time period, a&#xD;
           close collaboration with a team comprised psychiatrists, psychiatrist in addiction and a&#xD;
           clinical psychologist to manage the delicate cases such as dual addiction, depression&#xD;
           cases and type &quot;A&quot; personalities was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up assessment: The primary end point was 7-day point prevalence smoking&#xD;
           abstinence at 24 weeks following randomization, defined as self-reported abstinence in&#xD;
           the past week before the 24 week clinic visit confirmed by a measured exhaled carbon&#xD;
           monoxide ≤8 ppm. Participants with self-reported abstinence who had exhaled carbon&#xD;
           monoxide values &gt;8 ppm, or who reported any smoking in the last week and exhaled carbon&#xD;
           monoxide ≤8 ppm were classified as current smokers. Secondary endpoints included&#xD;
           measures, by a face-to-face survey, of compliance to medication, the occurrence of side&#xD;
           effects of NRT (allergic skin reaction), the withdrawal symptoms (nervousness, headache,&#xD;
           lack of concentration, insomnia, and craving) and the benefits of smoking cessation&#xD;
           (improvement of respiratory signs, increased appetite, sleep quality improvement,&#xD;
           enhancement of physical activity). Compliance to treatment was defined as good if the&#xD;
           wearing nicotine patches was on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           End Point Assessment: Smoking cessation status was assessed in 24 weeks visit. Phone&#xD;
           survey was performed for patients who have missed their appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical analysis Collect and statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 19.0&#xD;
           statistical software. An initial descriptive analysis involved an examination of the&#xD;
           demographic, smoking, and clinical characteristics of the two treatment groups. The&#xD;
           primary data analysis examined point prevalence smoking abstinence at 24 weeks. All&#xD;
           analyses were intention-to-treat adjusted on the significantly differences between the&#xD;
           two arms. Similar to other smoking cessation trials, our analyses assumed that patients&#xD;
           who withdrew from the study returned to smoking at their baseline rate. Discrete data&#xD;
           are described using proportions, and continuous data are described using means and&#xD;
           standard deviations or, in the presence of skewed distributions, medians and&#xD;
           interquartile ranges. The data analysis examined point prevalence smoking abstinence at&#xD;
           24 weeks with a comparison between the two treatment groups using 95% CIs based on the&#xD;
           binomial distribution. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the factors that&#xD;
           were independent predictors of success smoking cessation. Variables included in the&#xD;
           multivariate analysis were selected at the significance level of 20 % in the univariate&#xD;
           analysis. A p value of 5 % was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
