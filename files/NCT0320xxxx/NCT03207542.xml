  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if daratumumab can help to control B- or&#xD;
      T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The safety of daratumumab will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Daratumumab is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      treatment of multiple myeloma. It is considered investigational to use daratumumab to treat&#xD;
      ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 72 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive daratumumab by&#xD;
      vein over about 4 hours on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1 and 2, Days 1 and 15 of Cycles&#xD;
      3-6, and then on Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond. Your first dose of daratumumab will be given&#xD;
      over about 7 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion&#xD;
      related reaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will get medications, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamine before&#xD;
           the infusion. If you are considered high risk, you may also get medications, including&#xD;
           inhaled steroids, after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if you have a reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may stay overnight in the hospital after the infusion so the study staff can check&#xD;
           your health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may ask the study staff for information about how these drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
      You may also be asked to stay in the hospital overnight to watch you for side effects, if&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive daratumumab for up to 1 year. You will no longer be able to take the study&#xD;
      drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 24 hours before your first dose of study drug, if you can become pregnant, blood&#xD;
      (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks during Cycles 1-6, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for CMV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Cycle 2, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8, 15, 22 of Cycles 1 and 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 3-6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Cycle 3, you will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease. If the disease appears to be responding to the study drug, the study&#xD;
      doctor will decide how often you will have this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycles 3-6, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and CMV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Cycle 7 only, you will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 28-35 days after the last dose of daratumumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will call you to ask how you are doing 1 time each month for the first year&#xD;
      after your End-of-Treatment visit, then every 6 months during the second year after the&#xD;
      visit, and then 1 time every year after that. Each call should last about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 30 and 60 days after your last dose of study drug and then every 2-3 months after that for&#xD;
      1 year:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease appeared to be responding to the study drug, blood (about 2 teaspoons)&#xD;
           will be drawn for routine tests. Every 4-12 weeks, this sample may be used for CMV&#xD;
           testing. If the disease appears to get worse, you will stop having these blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease appeared to be responding to the study drug, you will have a bone marrow&#xD;
           aspirate and/or biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease appeared to be responding to the study drug, you will have an EKG at your&#xD;
           first follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1 year, you may continue to have follow-up visits as part of your routine care. This&#xD;
      will be discussed with you by the study doctor in more detail.&#xD;
