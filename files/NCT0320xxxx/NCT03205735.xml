    <textblock>
      An observational study of a prospective, analytical, monocentric cohort which does not modify&#xD;
      the patient care because the phenotyping of the dihydropyrimidine déshydrogénase DPD&#xD;
      (lymphocyte activity) is already carried out in routine hospital. The analysis will be based&#xD;
      on clinical, radiological and biological criteria.&#xD;

      Used for nearly sixty years, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is the oldest drug prescribed in the&#xD;
      treatment of digestive cancers and, still today, the most prescribed drug in digestive&#xD;
      cancer. 5-FU belongs to the class of anti-metabolites. There is an oral precursor of 5-FU&#xD;
      which is currently available and used in digestive cancer: Xeloda® (capecitabine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem is that fluoropyrimidines are 80% metabolised to 5-fluoro-5,6-dihydrouracil&#xD;
      (5-FUH2) by a key enzyme: dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). There is inter-individual&#xD;
      variability in the activity of this enzyme, partly related to genetic factors [1]. An&#xD;
      abundant literature has already shown that a decrease in the activity of this enzyme results&#xD;
      in an increase in the half-life of 5-FU. Thus, patients with a deficit in DPD activity have a&#xD;
      risk of overexposure to chemotherapy in this class, and consequently an increased risk of&#xD;
      acute, early and severe toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1990th years, many authors have shown that there is considerable inter-individual&#xD;
      variability in the plasma concentration of 5 FU after bolus [5] or continuous infusion [6].&#xD;
      These variations in plasma concentrations of 5FU are probably related to a 5-FU catabolism&#xD;
      variability related to the activity of DPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been shown that there is a correlation between 5FU plasma level, tumor response&#xD;
      and toxicity [7, 8]. A Phase III study showed that there was a significant impact on the&#xD;
      response rate (33.7% VS 18.3%) p = 0.004 if doses of 5-FU were adjusted to plasma levels of&#xD;
      5-FU versus body surface [9]. Median survival was 16 months in the control arm versus 22&#xD;
      months in the experimental arm (P = 0.08), with severe grade 3-4 toxicities statistically&#xD;
      increased in the control arm (p = 0.03). An adaptation of doses of 5-FU to the body surface,&#xD;
      as it is done today, is in conclusion insufficient to obtain reproducible plasma&#xD;
      concentrations due to an interindividual variability of the metabolism, linked to the&#xD;
      activity of the DPD .&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data suggest that DPD activity, by modulating plasma concentration, may be a predictive&#xD;
      factor of fluoropyrimidine response and also a prognostic factor. To our knowledge, there are&#xD;
      no studies that have demonstrated a direct link between DPD activity, tumor response, and&#xD;
      survival impact. Recently, Chamorey and al. [10] showed that the high level of DPD enzyme&#xD;
      activity (&gt; 0.30 nmol / min / mg protein) was significantly correlated with lower overall&#xD;
      survival and progression-free survival. This was a retrospective analysis of 130 patients&#xD;
      treated with fluoropyrimidines regardless of the tumor primitive (digestive, breast, ENT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results, presented in spite of their significance, are the result of a retrospective&#xD;
      study that is subject, as a minimum, to selection bias. It therefore seemed important to make&#xD;
      a prospective study, centered on digestive cancers. The prospective nature will limit&#xD;
      selection bias and restriction to digestive cancers in which fluoropyrimidines have a main&#xD;
      function and limit confunding biases. The selection of the first and second lines of&#xD;
      palliative chemotherapy will increase the population studied and thus the power of the&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the initial results were confirmed, this will allow DPD to be approached from a new angle&#xD;
      and will encourage multicenter controlled prospective studies with the Antoine-Lacassagne&#xD;
      center as the national promotor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we decided to evaluate DPD activity using an enzymatic radio technique that&#xD;
      directly evaluates the activity of the enzyme in blood lymphocytes, which is the original&#xD;
      technique and the oldest.&#xD;
