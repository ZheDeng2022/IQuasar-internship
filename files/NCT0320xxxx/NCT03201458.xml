  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab with or without cobimetinib&#xD;
      works in treating patients with bile duct cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic) and cannot be removed by surgery or gallbladder cancer. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cobimetinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      atezolizumab with cobimetinib may work better at treating patients with bile duct and&#xD;
      gallbladder cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of patients receiving atezolizumab&#xD;
      monotherapy and cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab for unresectable&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the overall survival (OS) of patients receiving cobimetinib in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab and atezolizumab monotherapy for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the objective response rate (ORR), defined as complete plus partial&#xD;
      response, of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab and atezolizumab monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the safety and tolerability of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab&#xD;
      and atezolizumab monotherapy in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the relationship between PD-L1 expression in tumor at baseline and on&#xD;
      treatment, and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of cobimetinib on CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor. II. To&#xD;
      determine the effect of cobimetinib on T cell subpopulations systemically and in tumor,&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 expression on tumor, and MHC 1/2 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the effect of cobimetinib on markers of immune exhaustion and pro-apoptotic&#xD;
      factors in CD8+ effector T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the effect of cobimetinib on local and systemic immune activation pathways and&#xD;
      immune suppressive pathways through expression profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15 and cobimetinib&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AE)s</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. The incidence of AEs will be tabulated by subgroups of interest (e.g. grade 3 or higher, organ class, relationship to study drug). For analyses at the individual level, the highest grade and relationship to study drug will be assumed if multiple events have occurred. Toxicity will be tabulated by type and grade and will be summarized with descriptive statistics. Other safety data will be assessed in terms of physical examination, clinical chemistry, hematology, vital signs, and electrocardiography. Negative binomial regression and Cox proportional hazards models will be used to assess the rate of AE and time to first toxicity, respectively.</description>

             (potent CYP3A4 enzyme inducer) and grapefruit juice (potent cytochrome P450 CYP3A4&#xD;

             patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency&#xD;
                       topical steroids (e.g., hydrocortisone 2.5%, hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%,&#xD;
                       flucinolone 0.01%, desonide 0.05%, aclometasone dipropionate 0.05%)&#xD;

             tomography (CT) scan; history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field&#xD;
             (fibrosis) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to randomization, including, but not limited&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Signs or symptoms of infection within 2 weeks prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to randomization;&#xD;
             patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., for prevention of a urinary tract&#xD;
             infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to randomization or anticipation of need&#xD;
             for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Symptomatic CHF is defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) CHF class II or&#xD;
                  higher disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because both atezolizumab and cobimetinib&#xD;
             are expected to cause fetal harm if used during pregnancy; because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with cobimetinib or atezolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with either therapy; these potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
