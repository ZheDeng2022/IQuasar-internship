  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 B feasibility trial with Galunsertib, a TGFβ inhibitor, in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with newly diagnosed, persistent or recurrent&#xD;
      carcinosarcoma of the uterus or ovary. The objective of the study is to determine whether&#xD;
      this drug combination is safe for this patient population and to see if it is effective in&#xD;
      shrinking cancers, keeping them from growing or helping patients live longer.&#xD;

      Patients who consent to this study will receive treatment for four 28 day cycles unless they&#xD;
      are unable to continue study treatment due to toxicity or disease progression. Paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin will be given intravenously on day 1 of each cycle and galunisertib in pill form&#xD;
      on days 4-17. No medicine will be given on days 17-28 of each cycle. Patients may have the&#xD;
      option of continuing treatment with the study drug if they complete the 4 cycles the study&#xD;
      requires. Subjects will receive tests and procedures that are part of regular cancer care as&#xD;
      well as those required for the purposes of the study. Blood samples will be taken to monitor&#xD;
      the level of study drug in the blood. Patients will have the option of allowing blood and&#xD;
      tumor samples to be used for future research.&#xD;
