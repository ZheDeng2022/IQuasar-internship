  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using cross-sectional samples from over 40 Demographic and Health Surveys, the investigators&#xD;
      studied the association between maternal employment and 3 indicators of Infant and Young&#xD;
      Child Feeding (IYCF): exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) among children less than 6 months old&#xD;
      (N=39,791) and minimum diet diversity (MDD) and minimum meal frequency (MMF) (N=137,208)&#xD;
      among children 6 to 23 months old. Mothers were categorized as formally employed, informally&#xD;
      employed, or non-employed. The investigators first used adjusted logistic regression models&#xD;
      to assess the associations within each country. The investigators then used meta-analysis to&#xD;
      pool associations across all countries and by region.&#xD;

      Data Source and Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators analyzed cross-sectional data from the Demographic and Health Surveys&#xD;
      (DHS). DHS surveys employ standardized questionnaires and nationally representative,&#xD;
      multi-stage cluster sampling to allow for cross-country comparisons (34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study included DHS datasets that were administered between 2010 and April 2017 and that&#xD;
      contained data on women's employment status and indicators of IYCF. Analyses included women&#xD;
      who had at least one child between ages 0-24 months. If mothers had more than one child, the&#xD;
      investigators included the youngest child in the household. Children residing outside the&#xD;
      household were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In models that evaluated MDD and MMF as the dependent variables, the final analytic sample&#xD;
      included 137,208 children aged 6 to 23 months from 50 countries. Small cell sizes were&#xD;
      prohibitive to exploring the employment-EBF associations in 10 countries that met the&#xD;
      aforementioned inclusion criteria; therefore, when modeling EBF as the dependent variable,&#xD;
      the final analytic sample included 39,791 children aged 0 to 5 months in 40 countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Dependent Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBF, MDD, and MMF served as the primary dependent variables of interest as prior literature&#xD;
      suggests changes in women's income and time, stemming from women's employment, may affect&#xD;
      these indicators of IYCF. These indicators were created using data from the 24-hour recall of&#xD;
      foods/food groups available in DHS. EBF, a binary variable, was defined as the proportion of&#xD;
      infants 0 to 5 months of age who were fed exclusively with breast milk. MDD, a binary&#xD;
      variable, was defined as proportion of children 6 to 23 months of age who received foods from&#xD;
      4 or more of the following 7 food groups: grains, roots and tubers; legumes and nuts; dairy&#xD;
      products (milk, yogurt, cheese); flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry and liver/organ meats);&#xD;
      eggs; vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables; and other fruits and vegetables. MMF, a binary&#xD;
      variable, was defined as the proportion of breastfed and non-breastfed children 6 to 23&#xD;
      months of age who receive solid, semi-solid, or soft foods the minimum number of times or&#xD;
      more. For breastfed children, the minimum number of times varies with age (2 times if 6 to 8&#xD;
      months and 3 times if 9 to 23 months). Non-breastfed children ages 6 to 23 months must be fed&#xD;
      4 or more times per day to meet the MMF indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Independent Variable&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators modeled maternal employment as a 3-category variable: formally employed,&#xD;
      informally employed, and non-employed based on prior research which suggests: 1) a large&#xD;
      proportion of women in LMIC are engaged in less formalized employment and 2) wages earned are&#xD;
      more than 60% lower in the informal sector. Women are described as non-employed because this&#xD;
      term includes persons who choose to not seek employment whereas unemployed describes persons&#xD;
      without jobs who are actively seeking employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employment type was defined based on 4 indicators: 1) employment status in the last 12 months&#xD;
      (employed, non-employed); 2) aggregate occupation category (skilled, unskilled); 3) type of&#xD;
      earnings (cash only, cash and in-kind, in-kind only, unpaid); and 4) seasonality of&#xD;
      employment (all year, seasonal/occasional employment). Formal employment included the&#xD;
      following 3 combinations: 1) employed, skilled occupation, cash only earnings, employed all&#xD;
      year; 2) employed, skilled occupation, cash only earnings, seasonal/occasional employment;&#xD;
      and 3) employed, unskilled occupation, cash only earnings, employed all year. Other employed&#xD;
      women were categorized as informally employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confounders and Effect Measure Modifiers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators identified confounding factors a priori using a directed acyclic graph,&#xD;
      which is a causal diagram used to characterize the relationship among variables that&#xD;
      influence the primary independent and the dependent variables based on both theorized and&#xD;
      documented relationships. In all models, confounders included maternal education (&lt; primary&#xD;
      school complete, [Symbol] primary school complete), maternal age (years), marital status&#xD;
      (married or living together versus single, widowed, divorced), parity, morbidity (presence of&#xD;
      diarrhea or fever in the last two weeks), child age (months), and urban/rural status. The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to specify covariates in a way that allowed for the same specification in&#xD;
      each country and for each outcome. For variables that were in their continuous form in the&#xD;
      DHS (maternal age, child age, parity), the investigators assessed their linearity with the&#xD;
      outcomes by specifying disjoint indicator variables. Because variables were approximately&#xD;
      linearly associated with the outcomes in most countries, they were retained in their&#xD;
      continuous form to minimize the number of observations dropped from the model due to small&#xD;
      cell sizes. Marital status and maternal education were dichotomized because there were very&#xD;
      few people in some categories (e.g. divorced).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the employment-diet association would vary by countries'&#xD;
      stage in the nutrition transition. Therefore, the investigators explored differences in the&#xD;
      country-level associations by log-gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, adjusted for&#xD;
      purchasing power parity, a theorized driver of the nutrition transition (41). Data were&#xD;
      obtained from the World Development Indicators database, corresponding to the survey year&#xD;
      (42). GDP-per capita was log-transformed to reflect the expected influence of a percent&#xD;
      increase (e.g. 5%), rather than an absolute dollar increase (e.g. $5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within-country analyses. It is expected that trends in employment (i.e. the percent of women&#xD;
      in formal versus informal employment) as well as diet to differ depending on countries' stage&#xD;
      of the nutrition transition. Therefore, the investigators aimed to keep samples comparable by&#xD;
      selecting countries with a recent DHS (2010-2017) and we allowed for different relationships&#xD;
      in each country by starting with disaggregate, country-specific estimates. The investigators&#xD;
      first employed separate multivariable logistic regression models for each country to test the&#xD;
      association between maternal employment and IYCF indicators (EBF, MDD, MMF). In these&#xD;
      country-specific models, the investigators utilized sampling weights to account for&#xD;
      differential probability of selection and response and Taylor series linearized standard&#xD;
      errors accounted for DHS' clustered design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between-country and region analyses. After obtaining disaggregated estimates for each&#xD;
      country, coefficients for the employment-EBF, employment-MDD, and employment-MMF associations&#xD;
      were entered into a random effects meta-analysis to obtain odds ratios pooled across all&#xD;
      countries and by world region (East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin American&#xD;
      and Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa). Random&#xD;
      effects meta-analysis, used to generate pooled odds ratios (POR), is the statistical&#xD;
      combination of the estimates from separate countries and assumes that the associations&#xD;
      between employment and IYCF may differ by country and/or region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Country-specific beta coefficients were also entered into a random-effects meta-regression to&#xD;
      assess whether the associations between employment and IYCF varied by country-level log-GDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity Analyses. Sensitivity analyses included modeling several alternative outcomes&#xD;
      including: 1) continued breastfeeding at 1 year, 2) diet diversity score, and 3) minimum&#xD;
      acceptable diet. Continued breastfeeding at 1 year, a binary variable, was defined as the&#xD;
      proportion of children 12 to 15 months of age who are fed breast milk (37). Diet diversity&#xD;
      score, a continuous variable estimated among children aged 6 to 23 months, was based on the&#xD;
      aforementioned 7 foods groups used to calculate MDD (37). For each of the 7 food groups,&#xD;
      children received 1 point if any food in the group was consumed (i.e. minimum DDS =0, maximum&#xD;
      DDS =7). Minimum acceptable diet was modeled as a binary variable and was defined as the&#xD;
      proportion of children 6 to 23 months of age who received a minimum acceptable diet as&#xD;
      determined by minimum food frequency, diet diversity, and breastfeeding status (37). Because&#xD;
      in some cases the within-country sample size for the associations between employment and EBF&#xD;
      were somewhat smaller, we also employed a single logistic regression model with all 40&#xD;
      countries to test the association between employment and EBF. In this specification, each&#xD;
      country was included as a fixed-effect, and therefore controlled for baseline country-level&#xD;
      differences; but this model assumes the association between employment and EBF is homogeneous&#xD;
      across countries. Alpha was set to 0.05. Analyses were performed using Stata 14.1 (StataCorp&#xD;
      LP, College Station, Texas). No institutional review board review was obtained given that all&#xD;
      analyses used secondary data.&#xD;
