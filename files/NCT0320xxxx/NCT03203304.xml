  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      External beam photon stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using a linear accelerator to a&#xD;
      total dose of 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered once daily with at least 48 hours between each&#xD;
      fraction. SBRT treatment will be completed within a 21-day window. Starting within 14 days&#xD;
      after completion of SBRT, intravenous nivolumab 240 mg will be given every 2 weeks as&#xD;
      monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks.&#xD;

      1.1 Primary Objective &amp; Hypothesis Determine the safety and tolerability of SBRT followed by&#xD;
      nivolumab or ipilimumab with nivolumab for hepatocellular carcinoma by establishing the rates&#xD;
      of toxicity that occur within 6 months from start of SBRT. Hypothesis: SBRT followed by&#xD;
      nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab will have similar toxicity to historical controls of&#xD;
      SBRT or nivolumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Secondary Objectives and Hypotheses Estimate the investigator determined best overall&#xD;
      response rate. Hypothesis: Combining radiation and nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab will&#xD;
      improve the best overall response rate compared to historical controls with SBRT or nivolumab&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate the rates of long-term adverse events (after 6 months) from the end of SBRT.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Long-term toxicity from SBRT with nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab will be&#xD;
      comparable to that observed with nivolumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarize the distant disease control, progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Disease control and survival will be comparable to (or better than) that observed&#xD;
      with nivolumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarize the local control of the SBRT treated lesion. Hypothesis: Combining SBRT and&#xD;
      nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab will have similar (or better) local control rates as&#xD;
      observed in SBRT only series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Exploratory Objectives Explore changes in inflammatory biomarkers (including, but not&#xD;
      limited to CD8/Treg ratio, total CD4 counts, total lymphocyte count) in pretreatment and&#xD;
      on-treatment serially collected peripheral blood samples. Hypothesis: Changes in inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers after radiation therapy may correlate with a more favorable response to&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by radiation on pre and post treatment&#xD;
      biopsies. Hypothesis: Changes in the tumor microenvironment after radiation therapy will be&#xD;
      observed that may correlate with a more favorable response to immunotherapy.&#xD;
