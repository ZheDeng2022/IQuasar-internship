  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people who have undergone subarachnoid hemorrhage from an aneurysm (an artery of a vein&#xD;
      in the brain) struggle with a pronounced fatigue as well as a number of other sequelae such&#xD;
      as impaired concentration, memory deficits and emotional problems. Exhaustion is often&#xD;
      permanent and can lead to a significant worsening of quality of life and be the cause of&#xD;
      disability. This condition does not only have major consequences for the individual who is&#xD;
      affected, but also for their families and for society. So far no effective treatment for&#xD;
      fatigue has been found. The drug OSU6162 has shown a beneficial effect on fatigue and other&#xD;
      impairments after stroke and after traumatic brain injury. There is good reason to believe&#xD;
      that OSU6162 can also improve fatigue and other impairments after aneurysm bleeding and thus&#xD;
      increase the chance of returning to the level of daily function they had before the bleeding.&#xD;
      The study is double blinded and measures the effect of OSU6162 and placebo on fatigue and&#xD;
      neuropsychological function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of OSU6162 with respect to&#xD;
      sequela after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage with special emphasis on fatigue. The&#xD;
      eventual aim is to find a cure for the debilitating fatigue, cognitive and emotional problems&#xD;
      arising in many of the individuals that have suffered aSAH. Until now, no effective treatment&#xD;
      exists and the final goal is to provide a medical treatment that alleviates these symptoms to&#xD;
      such an extend that aSAH patients can regain a normal quality of live and resume their&#xD;
      pre-morbid occupational status and level of social participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a phase II, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that have undergone aSAH from Health-region South-East. All aSAH patients in&#xD;
      Health-region South-East are treated at Oslo University Hospital, Neuroclinic, at the&#xD;
      Departments of Neurosurgery and the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and&#xD;
      will be recruited from there. 100 patients will be included in this trial (50 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a dose of OSU6162 15 mg or placebo BID. The expected duration of&#xD;
      therapy is 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be change from baseline in Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) after 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment with OSU6162 or placebo, with data collection at weeks 1, 4, 12, and 20&#xD;
      (20=8 weeks after treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints include change from baseline in total score on a number of&#xD;
      questionnaires, with data collection at week 4, 12, and 20 (i.e. at 8 weeks after treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in vital signs, adverse events (+ week 4),&#xD;
      physical examinations, blood and urine samples at week 1 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include change from baseline on a number of neuropsychological tests,&#xD;
      with data collection at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be based on linear mixed models. A mixed model analysis uses all&#xD;
      the available data to compensate for the data missing on a particular patient. Thus any&#xD;
      imputation techniques for missing data points are not necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities&#xD;
      (MedDRA) and tabulated by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established in order to enhance the safety aspect&#xD;
      of the study and its primary function will be to review all registered side-effects at&#xD;
      various points of time along the study and consider if there are indications for early&#xD;
      stopping (either for futility or for positive efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice and applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirements. Registration of patient data will be carried out in accordance with&#xD;
      national personal data laws.&#xD;
