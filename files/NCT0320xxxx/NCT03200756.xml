  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial randomizes patients who plan to attend cardiac rehabilitation to either a&#xD;
      behavioral intervention to specifically reduce sedentary behavior or to usual care which&#xD;
      exclusively focuses on increasing exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation after a cardiac event or procedure is of key importance to physical&#xD;
      and psychological recovery. Cardiac rehabilitation comprises a standardized stepwise approach&#xD;
      to exercise in a supervised setting and is proven to reduce morbidity and mortality after a&#xD;
      cardiac event. However, cardiac rehabilitation does not necessarily change behavior in the&#xD;
      long-term and many do not attend cardiac rehabilitation due to lack of motivation, difficulty&#xD;
      accessing programs, and cost. These individuals loose an important opportunity to improve&#xD;
      their health, sense of well-being and outcomes. The investigators propose to test the effect&#xD;
      of a patient-centered approach to reduce sedentary behavior for aging adults added to usual&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation. In this study, the investigators will identify patients at their&#xD;
      introductory visit to cardiac rehabilitation and randomize to either a program to decrease&#xD;
      in-home sedentary behavior vs. a standard program to increase in-home exercise. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive additional support and encouragement to attend cardiac rehabilitation. Using&#xD;
      motivational interviewing techniques in both groups the investigators will assist the&#xD;
      patients in recognizing their potential and goal-setting. Patients will be monitored using&#xD;
      the ActivPAL monitor, a new technology that quantifies sedentary time and steps/day. Patients&#xD;
      will be monitored four times as they proceed through cardiac rehabilitation for a total of 13&#xD;
      weeks and receive 3 educational and goal setting sessions. Those in the intervention group&#xD;
      will have sedentary behavior change emphasized with feedback from the ActivPAL monitor. The&#xD;
      control group will focus on standard exercise recommendations and feedback from his/her&#xD;
      exercise diary. Outcomes include change in sedentary time and steps/day. Anticipated results&#xD;
      include a significant change in the intervention group vs. the control: a decrease in in-home&#xD;
      sedentary time, an increase in steps/day. The results of this study will provide the basis&#xD;
      for designing a larger randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of an&#xD;
      intervention to reduce sedentary behavior as an adjunct to cardiac rehabilitation especially&#xD;
      for older adults. Additional investigation will be warranted for those who do not attend&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation but are able to follow a post-cardiac event program to reduce in-home&#xD;
      sedentary behavior.&#xD;
