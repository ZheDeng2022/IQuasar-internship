      After gaining verbal consent , Patients included in this study will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. history taking :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  peronal history .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  obstetric history.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  past history&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. general examination including vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. abominal and pelvic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the patient will be examined son graphically at 3 visits&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The first visit at less than 10 weeks gestation :trans vaginal ultrasound with&#xD;
                partially filled bladder to nullify effect of anteversion of the uterus for&#xD;
                assessment of---the site of the intrauterine gestational sac in relation to the&#xD;
                endometrial cavity . For the purposes of this study and to obtain consistent&#xD;
                findings, it was decided to have only five subgroups of gestational site&#xD;
                implantation in relation to the endometrial cavity (Fig. 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. anterior,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. posterior,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Fundal,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. low-lying anterior,\&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. low lying posterior We adopted the definition of implantation site from&#xD;
                     previous publication (Abdallah et al., 2012). The implantation site is&#xD;
                     visualized in the sagittal plane as a hyperechoic ring that occupies one side&#xD;
                     of the implanted gestational sac and protrudes into the endometrial lumen It&#xD;
                     represents the maternal decidual reaction and the beginning of maternal-fetal&#xD;
                     circulation. This area is also believed to be responsible for future placental&#xD;
                     formation and development (Brosens and Gellersen, 2010) Distance between the&#xD;
                     implantation site and the internal cervical ostium (os). This was taken from&#xD;
                     the lower end of the hyperechoic trophoblast ring of the gestational sac to&#xD;
                     the internal cervical os in the sagittal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  doppler assessment of the retro chorionic blood flow in the area behind&#xD;
                          the maximum chorionic tissue to detect sensitivity index (RI),in cases of&#xD;
                          low gestational sac Doppler assessment of peri trophoplastic blood flow&#xD;
                          will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. then the patient will be enrolled during routine ANC till delivery and data&#xD;
                collected at32-34 weeks gestation regarding placental site will be correlated with&#xD;
                1st data and data at delivery&#xD;
