      Objectives: To examine the effect of accelerated infliximab induction in children with&#xD;
      moderate to severe UC. Design: A multi-center, prospective, randomized, open label study.&#xD;
      Setting: Pediatric gastroenterology centers. Participants: Children 6 year to 17 years&#xD;
      (Overall, 84 patients) with moderate to severe UC who are corticosteroid dependent/resistant&#xD;
      thus planned to receive infliximab induction. Intervention: Group 1 (intervention) will&#xD;
      receive an accelerated induction at 0,1,3 weeks (5 mg/kg) and then at week 7,11,15. Group 2&#xD;
      (standard) will receive a per protocol induction at 0,2,6 weeks (5 mg/kg) and then at week&#xD;
      14. Drug levels will be obtained prior to each infusion in each group (up to week 20).&#xD;
      Further maintenance will be planned according to drug levels at weeks 15 and 14,&#xD;
      respectively. Follow-up will continue without further interventions till 52 weeks following&#xD;
      induction. Main outcome measure: Clinical remission, on infliximab at week 20. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures: 1. Colectomy free rates at week 20 and 52. 2. Clinical remission on&#xD;
      infliximab at week 52. 3. Drug levels and anti-drug antibodies prior to last study infusion.&#xD;
      4. Anthropometric and laboratory measures including calprotectin at the end of induction,&#xD;
      week 20 and week 52 5. Changes in fecal microbiome, virome and bile acids content. Sample&#xD;
      size: In order to demonstrate 30% difference in clinical remission rate between groups is&#xD;
      significant, we will need to study 36 children in each group to be able to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis that the failure rates between the groups are equal with probability (power) of&#xD;
      80% and a type I error probability of 0.05.&#xD;

      General intervention scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to start IFX is the sole decision of the treating physician based on the&#xD;
      patient's immediate need. Eligible patients are those who are planned to start IFX. All&#xD;
      patients will undergo clinical and laboratory evaluation for IFX eligibility (PPD, infectious&#xD;
      serology). If the tests have already done in the last 3 months, we will use these data, there&#xD;
      is no need to repeat. Patients must have a negative stool culture, stool for parasites and&#xD;
      clostridium difficile toxin test performed over the last week in order to be eligible. The&#xD;
      screening visit may be performed concomitantly with the enrolment visit if all inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled at the first screening visit. Informed consent will be signed by&#xD;
      both parents is required during enrollment. Informed assent will be offered for patients 14&#xD;
      years old and older. Eligible patients, ambulatory UC patients, requiring IFX for&#xD;
      corticosteroid dependent or refractory moderate to severe disease (excluding acute severe&#xD;
      UC), meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, after obtaining informed consent, will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1 ratio in blocks of four, stratified by immunomodulators use) at enrollment&#xD;
      visit (week 0, prior to IFX initiation) to either group 1 or group 2 using opaque, numbered&#xD;
      and sealed envelopes. Prior corticosteroid treatment is allowed as a taper-down schedule&#xD;
      during induction with IFX and must be terminated by week 10 (otherwise will be defined as&#xD;
      induction failure). At each visit all patients will be examined and have height, weight, and&#xD;
      PUCAI performed as well as comprehensive laboratory examinations including CBC, albumin, AST,&#xD;
      ALT, ESR and CRP (CRP will be measured and registered in mg/dL) and fecal samples (4 grams)&#xD;
      for bile acids and microbiome/virome. Fecal sample for fecal calprotectin (FC) will be&#xD;
      obtained as well at weeks 20 and 52. Extent of disease will be registered using the Paris&#xD;
      classification (Levine A et al, IBD, June 2011) and will be based on the latest colonoscopic&#xD;
      evaluation (described only by macroscopic involvement). Patients who undergo a colonoscopy at&#xD;
      any time as standard of care before initiating biologic therapy should register the results&#xD;
      of colonoscopy (according to the Mayo score- A score of ≤1 is considered complete mucosal&#xD;
      healing). In addition, every colonoscopy that will be performed during the study period based&#xD;
      on physician discretion, should be register in the CRF (Colonoscopy is not part of this&#xD;
      specific protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period is composed of two distinctive phases: Intervention phase: week 0-20 and&#xD;
      follow-up phase: week 21-52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (intervention group): Patients in group 1 will receive an accelerated induction at&#xD;
      0,1,3 weeks (5 mg/kg) and then at week 7,11,15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (control group): Patients in group 2 will receive a per protocol induction at 0,2,6&#xD;
      weeks (5 mg/kg) and then at week 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensification by shortening intervals between infusion rather than dose increment was&#xD;
      chosen based on the pharmacokinetics of IFX in severe disease favoring this strategy in-order&#xD;
      to maintain adequate trough drug-levels and avoid intermittent exposure (23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug levels will be obtained prior to each infusion in each group in the intervention phase.&#xD;
      Further maintenance will be planned according to drug levels at weeks 15 and 14,&#xD;
      respectively. A visit concluding the intervention phase will be performed at week 20. The&#xD;
      follow-up phase will continue without further interventions till week 52. During the&#xD;
      follow-up phase (maintenance) treatment will be administered according to the treating&#xD;
      physician discretion, with no restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with induction failure in the control arm (defined as a lack of improvement of at&#xD;
      least 20 points from the baseline PUCAI score OR PUCAI≥35 at 3 weeks following induction)&#xD;
      will be able to undergo treatment intensification by decreasing infusion intervals according&#xD;
      to the treating physician discretion.&#xD;
