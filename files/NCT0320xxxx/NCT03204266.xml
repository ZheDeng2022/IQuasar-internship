  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the supplements Pro-Stat (which has&#xD;
      l-arginine and also contains protein) and omega-3 fatty acids will be well tolerated in&#xD;
      patients who have radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Researchers also want to learn how&#xD;
      these medications affect inflammation and recovery for these surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Pro-Stat is not FDA-approved to treat any specific&#xD;
      condition or disease. Omega-3 fatty acids are FDA-approved to treat high triglyceride levels.&#xD;
      Their use to treat inflammation and help improve recovery after bladder cancer surgery is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the supplements are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 46 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to perform a few tasks to learn&#xD;
      about your strength, memory, and nutrition. These should take about 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) into 1 of 2 study groups. This is&#xD;
      done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive the Pro-Stat and omega-3 fatty acid supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will not receive the Pro-Stat and omega-3 fatty acid&#xD;
           supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to write down any supplements you take in a diary that will be provided to&#xD;
      you. You should write down any supplements you take for the week before and 2 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery. Please bring this diary to your follow up appointment after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplement Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will receive the omega-3 fatty acids in a pill bottle and the&#xD;
      Pro-Stat in foil packets. You should take each supplement 4 times daily. Omega-3 fatty acid&#xD;
      capsules should be swallowed whole and should not be opened, chewed, or crushed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Packets of Pro-Stat may be mixed with other liquids or food. If vomiting occurs, do not&#xD;
      replace the vomited dose. If you miss a dose, you may take an extra dose that same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should bring all supplements you haven't taken with you to your 14 day visit after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your doctor may lower the dose of the supplements if you experience any serious side effects&#xD;
      that may be related to the supplements. If these side effects continue after the dose has&#xD;
      been lowered, you will no longer be able to take the supplements. You may also be taken off&#xD;
      study if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have your standard-of-care surgery. You will receive a separate consent for the&#xD;
      surgery that explains the procedure and the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study/Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 8 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, protein testing, biomarker&#xD;
           testing, to check your cholesterol, liver function, your amino acid levels, and to test&#xD;
           for inflammatory markers. Biomarkers are found in the blood and may be related to your&#xD;
           reaction to the supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will also be drawn and stored at MD Anderson for future&#xD;
           testing as a part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 After Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will also be drawn and stored at MD Anderson for future&#xD;
           testing as a part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 After Surgery, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 After Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will also be drawn and stored at MD Anderson for future&#xD;
           testing as a part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On your Day of Discharge from the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 14 After Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your cholesterol,&#xD;
           your liver function, and your amino acid levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will also be drawn and stored at MD Anderson for future&#xD;
           testing as a part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You weight will be measured at all of the above visits and information will be collected from&#xD;
      your medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 90 After Surgery, you will have a physical exam and your weight will be recorded.&#xD;
