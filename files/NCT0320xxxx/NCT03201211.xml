  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this long-term follow-up of a Phase I study is to evaluate the kinetics of the&#xD;
      antibody response to NTHi-Mcat antigens and long-term safety, in subjects aged between 50-71&#xD;
      years at the time of enrolment in the NTHi-Mcat-001 study. These subjects were previously&#xD;
      exposed to two adjuvanted formulations of the NTHi-Mcat vaccine administered according to a&#xD;
      0, 2 months schedule in the NTHi-Mcat-001 (201281) study. The subjects that had received&#xD;
      saline placebo controls will also be included in this follow-up study to make comparisons&#xD;
      with the investigational vaccines. No vaccinations will be administered in this trial.&#xD;

          -  Subjects who previously participated in STEP 2 of study NTHi-Mcat-001 (201281), and&#xD;
             performed the last study visit (Month 14) and received the 2 study vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the protocol (e.g. return for follow-up visits). And subjects' Legally&#xD;
             Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and&#xD;
             will comply, with the requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject/ LAR(s) of the subject prior to&#xD;
             performance of any study specific procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) during the&#xD;
             period starting 30 days before the first follow-up study visit (Month 19 to Month 20),&#xD;
             or planned use during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants&#xD;
             or other immune-modifying drugs since the end of the NTHi-Mcat-001 study. For&#xD;
             corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and&#xD;
             topical steroids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs at any time during the study&#xD;
             period (e.g. infliximab).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study&#xD;
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a&#xD;
             non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting&#xD;
             3 months before the first follow-up visit or planned administration during the study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current alcoholism and/or drug abuse.&#xD;

          -  Has significant disease (including significant neurological or psychological&#xD;
             disorders), in the opinion of the investigator, likely to interfere with the study&#xD;
             and/or likely to cause death within the study duration.&#xD;
