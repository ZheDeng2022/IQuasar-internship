  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with a known diagnosis of peripheral artery disease as measured by an abnormal ankle&#xD;
      brachial index (&lt;.9 or &gt;1.1) will undergo a single 5 min exposure of 670 nm light, 1 cm above&#xD;
      the gastrocnemius muscle. Blood flow will be measured by infusion of ultrasound contrast and&#xD;
      subsequent acquisition of ultrasound images. 2 blood samples will be collected for&#xD;
      measurement of nitric oxide metabolites.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this protocol is to measure blood flow in the gastrocnemius muscle in patients&#xD;
      with documented peripheral artery disease before and after exposure to 670 nm light energy.&#xD;
      The study consists of one visit. Blood flow measurement will be performed using contrast&#xD;
      enhanced ultrasound, a method by which ultrasound contrast is continuously infused into the&#xD;
      blood stream. Ultrasound records images in the area of interest and flow is related to the&#xD;
      intensity of the contrast in each image. Blood will be drawn to measure nitric oxide&#xD;
      metabolites. The study is designed to consist of one visit. However, if the protocol changes&#xD;
      or the data quality initially collected is uninterpretable, subjects may be asked to return&#xD;
      to allow for a standard methodology across all participants. In this case, the subjects who&#xD;
      are asked to return will be subject to the same informed consent process a second time. The&#xD;
      two visits will be at least one week apart to further reduce the already minimal risks of the&#xD;
      study. This will also limit the number of study participants required to gather the necessary&#xD;
      data to complete the study, thereby limiting the risks of the study to a smaller number of&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
