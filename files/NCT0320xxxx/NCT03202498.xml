  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), bacterial fragments leak from the gut&#xD;
      into the blood and cause harm. This study looks into a new way to lower the leakage of&#xD;
      bacterial fragments into the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yaq-001 is a new type of carbon that in previous laboratory studies has been shown to have&#xD;
      the ability to bind these bacterial fragments and so confine them to the gut. The purpose of&#xD;
      this clinical trial is to test the product Yaq-001 for the first time in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will assess if the treatment with Yaq-001 is safe, is well tolerated, and if it&#xD;
      helps improve the overall health status of the cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate patients must be at least 18 years old and have a clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis&#xD;
      for any cause. Only postmenopausal women or with surgical sterilisation are eligible.&#xD;
      Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria of medical nature will be determined with the&#xD;
      investigator at the screening visit, by means of standard care routines plus an additional&#xD;
      test to assess the bowel transit time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly grouped to receive standard care treatment plus Yaq-001,&#xD;
      or standard treatment plus placebo (non-active treatment). The use of placebo is necessary to&#xD;
      better understand how safe and tolerable Yaq-001 really is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment lasts for 12 weeks. During treatment, the patient will be visited by a study&#xD;
      doctor 5 times. At all the visits the patients will undergo a routine physical examination,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, collection of blood and urine samples. On three occasions the patients&#xD;
      will be asked to provide additional samples of blood, urine and stool for analysis outside&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      56 patients from 9 hospitals in UK, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland will&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      First-in-human clinical investigation with Yaq-001. This is a multicentre, randomized, double&#xD;
      blinded, placebo controlled trial to intended to evaluate safety and tolerability of oral&#xD;
      administration of Yaq-001 therapy in two dosing cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      56 cirrhotic patients with diuretic-responsive ascites will be enrolled. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to two dosing cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (1:1 randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard medical treatment + Yaq-001 (4 g/ day) - n= 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard medical treatment + placebo-control (placebo for 4 g of Yaq-001/ day) - n= 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (1:1 randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard medical treatment + Yaq-001 (8 g/ day) - n= 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard medical treatment + placebo-control (placebo for 8 g of Yaq-001/ day) - n= 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be dosed daily with Yaq-001 (or an equivalent quantity of placebo) for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Assessments of DSMB will take place after 4 and 12 weeks. Investigational centres&#xD;
      specialized in the management of patients with liver cirrhosis will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the study duration will be up to 17 weeks, including the screening (up to 4&#xD;
      weeks), treatment (12 weeks) and 7-day follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration is estimated to be approximately 6 months from screening of first&#xD;
      patient until study completion of the last patient.&#xD;

      innovation programme under grant agreement No 634579.&#xD;
