  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the currently proposed phase I/II study, the investigators aim to treat patients with&#xD;
      relapsed and/or relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have progressed on&#xD;
      carfilzomib-based therapy with an FDA approved c-MET inhibitor, cabozantinib. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the additional rescue blockade with cabozantinib added to the carfilzomib will (1) be&#xD;
      safe and tolerable and (2) will show activity by demonstrating objective response to&#xD;
      combination carfilzomib/cabozantinib therapy. In correlative studies, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to show that (1) the serum and marrow MUC20 levels which will be judged by genomic and flow&#xD;
      cytometric studies will directly correlate with primary plasma cell MUC20/c-Met pathway&#xD;
      activation and inversely correlate with protease inhibitor (PI) resistance; and (2) a&#xD;
      correlation of the gene and MUC20 expression profiles of patients with clinical outcomes may&#xD;
      confirm the biomarker MUC20 as a predictor of disease sensitivity to PI, and allow future&#xD;
      personalization of c-Met-targeted therapies, as well as combination approaches based on c-Met&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for this study, patients must have been previously diagnosed with&#xD;
      histologically or cytologically confirmed symptomatic MM, must have measurable disease and&#xD;
      have had at least two, but not more than four prior lines of therapy for their disease, with&#xD;
      lines of therapy being separated by the presence of documented disease progression.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients eligible will be those who have failed carfilzomib either as a single&#xD;
      agent as the last form of therapy, or carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone, or&#xD;
      carfilzomib in combination with revlimid and dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I of this study the investigators will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      among three doses. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be based solely on adverse events&#xD;
      that occur during cycle 1. The initial dose of cabozantinib for all patients treated on this&#xD;
      study will be 20 mg P.O. daily, which is designated dose level -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response assessment will be performed at start and after cycle 2 using the serum and/or urine&#xD;
      protein electrophoresis with immunofixation and serum free light chains to assess disease&#xD;
      burden. Disease response quality will also be assessed after completion of three cycles of&#xD;
      therapy, and then every cycle after that. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be performed&#xD;
      after the baseline sampling only to confirm the achievement of a complete remission (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be closely followed for toxicity from the time of informed consent until 30&#xD;
      days after last administration of study medication. Adverse event and serious adverse events&#xD;
      will be followed until baseline or less than or equal to grade 1 levels. Every subject who&#xD;
      fulfills all aspects of patient eligibility who receives a partial or complete course of&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be evaluable for dose limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Phase I response to treatment was not as expected and the myeloma field in treatment has&#xD;
    changed since initiating the study, so investigators felt the study should not be pursued into&#xD;

    <description>Response will be determined by the IMWG response criteria guidelines. All subjects in phase I that receive the MTD will be included in phase II study analysis. The investigators will use a Simon two-stage design to compare response rates of 0.25 versus 0.05 with alpha=0.05 and power of 0.8083. Nine patients will be enrolled in the first stage. The hypothesis will be rejected and enrollment will cease if no response is seen in the first 9 patients enrolled on the Phase II portion of the study. Otherwise, another 14 patients will be accrued for a total of evaluable 17 patients.</description>

         17. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at screening. Female&#xD;
             patients must be either postmenopausal, free from menses for â‰¥2 years, surgically&#xD;
             sterilized, or willing to use two adequate barrier methods of contraception to prevent&#xD;
             pregnancy, or must agree to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout the study.&#xD;
             Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (bHCG) or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy before the first dose of cabozantinib or carfilzomib.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are receiving any concurrent investigational agent with known or&#xD;
             suspected activity against MM, or those whose adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier have not recovered to grade 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have known CNS involvement with MM&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have previously been treated with another agent targeting the MUC20/c-Met&#xD;
             axis, including either monoclonal antibodies to MUC20 or c-Met, or small molecule&#xD;
             inhibitors of c-Met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a known history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to cabozantinib.&#xD;

             carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort)&#xD;
             should be avoided because it may significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations.&#xD;
             If patients are taking any strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, alternate medications with no or&#xD;
             minimal CYP3A4 inhibitors should be sought prior to trial enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled or ongoing/active infection, or patients with the following history:&#xD;
             recent history of hemorrhage or hemoptysis; dehiscence or wound healing complications&#xD;

             pressure of &gt; 150 systolic or &gt; 100 diastolic mm) with anti-hypertensive therapy&#xD;

             count of 2 x 109/L, known amyloidosis, or known POEMS syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who have required plasmapheresis and exchange less than 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             initiation of therapy with cabozantinib&#xD;

             and/or C infection&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients are not considered to have a&#xD;
             &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy for a prior malignancy,&#xD;
             are disease free from prior malignancies for &gt;5 years, and are considered by their&#xD;
             physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse. Also, patients with basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin, superficial carcinoma of the bladder, carcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
             with a current PSA value of &lt;0.5 ng/mL, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are&#xD;
             eligible. Patients who are on hormonal therapy for a history of either prostate or&#xD;
             breast cancer may enroll, if there has been no evidence of disease progression during&#xD;
             the previous 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Allergy to carfilzomib or cabozantinib or any excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other&#xD;
             conditions, psychiatric illness/social situations that would compromise the patient's&#xD;
             ability to understand the patient information, to give informed consent, to comply&#xD;
             with the study protocol or to complete the study or, in the judgment of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for study participation.&#xD;

&#xD;
             - Three ECGs must be performed for eligibility determination. If the average of these&#xD;
             three consecutive results for QTcF is â‰¤ 500 msec, the subject meets eligibility in&#xD;
             this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Inability to swallow intact tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. The subject has PT/INR or PTT test â‰¥ 1.3 x the laboratory ULN within 7 days before the&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Concomitant anticoagulation at therapeutic doses with oral anticoagulants (eg,&#xD;
             warfarin, direct thrombin and Factor Xa inhibitors) or platelet inhibitors (eg,&#xD;
             clopidogrel);&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subjects who have Carfilzomib-related posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome&#xD;
