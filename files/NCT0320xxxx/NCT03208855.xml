    <textblock>
      Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) and insomnia are major public health concerns, and each are&#xD;
      independently linked to reduced quality of life, disability, and high healthcare costs.&#xD;
      Insomnia, characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative&#xD;
      sleep, is prevalent in 10% of the general population and is co-morbid in 70% of patients with&#xD;
      SUDs. Primary insomnia and SUDs are chronic, unremitting diseases and have a complex&#xD;
      bidirectional relationship. Insomnia symptoms may predate the onset of SUDs and may explain&#xD;
      high prevalence of self-treatment. Insomnia may also be a direct effect of intoxication,&#xD;
      withdrawal, or abstinence from the substance of abuse. Subjective and objective measures of&#xD;
      sleep disruption have been shown in various stages of abuse and recovery. Insomnia is the&#xD;
      most well documented predictor of substance use relapse. Treatment specifically targeting&#xD;
      chronic insomnia is essential for improved clinical outcomes. Although, chronic insomnia is a&#xD;
      well-established, modifiable risk factor, to our knowledge, there are no interdisciplinary&#xD;
      residential treatment programs that specifically treat chronic insomnia during acute SUDs&#xD;
      treatment. We propose that improved treatment of insomnia as part of a comprehensive&#xD;
      reinforcement-based outpatient treatment program will provide an efficient and cost effective&#xD;
      opportunity to improve standard outpatient SUD. Converging evidence suggests that&#xD;
      prophylactic CBT-I during SUD treatment may have short and long-term efficacy for sleep, and&#xD;
      improve attrition. In the proposed study, patients with co-morbid SUDs and insomnia will&#xD;
      engage in an 8-week group CBT-I (gCBT-I) program in addition to receiving treatment as usual&#xD;
      for SUDs. This study may provide new hope to effectively treat insomnia in SUD and lead to a&#xD;
      new standardization of outpatient care. We hypothesize that a CBT-I intervention can be&#xD;
      implemented as part of an evidence-based SUD treatment program within a residential facility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a leading cause of global disease burden with significant&#xD;
      epidemiological and economic consequences. Sleep disturbances (i.e., difficulty initiating or&#xD;
      maintaining sleep) are nearly ubiquitous in individuals with SUDs and may arise from direct&#xD;
      effects of the substance or from withdrawal of the substance. Sleep disturbances are reported&#xD;
      in up to 70% of individuals entering both detoxification and early recovery programs and may&#xD;
      persist for months to years during abstinence. Objective and subjective measures of sleep&#xD;
      disturbances are among the best predictors of relapse. Treatment of insomnia (i.e.,&#xD;
      difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, with significant daytime impairment) during early&#xD;
      recovery may improve relapse rates. Insomnia is a modifiable risk factor and responds to&#xD;
      psychological interventions. Given the abuse potential of many medications utilized for sleep&#xD;
      disturbances and the likelihood of drug-drug interactions over the course of detoxification,&#xD;
      a non-pharmacological approach to insomnia remains promising. To date, few studies have&#xD;
      evaluated non-pharmacological approaches to insomnia during early substance abuse recovery.&#xD;
      One study has evidenced improved self-reported sleep quality in men who were assigned to 2&#xD;
      weeks of daily progressive muscle relaxation training. Robust evidence indicates that&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective, and in fact is first line&#xD;
      treatment for primary insomnia. A preponderance of randomized controlled trials of CBT-I in&#xD;
      co-morbid populations suggests it is efficacious to address insomnia in context of ongoing&#xD;
      medical and psychiatric illnesses. Despite the possibility that treating insomnia may improve&#xD;
      relapse and attrition rates, and evidence that CBT-I is efficacious in improving sleep, there&#xD;
      is a dearth of empirical data regarding the prophylactic benefit of initiating CBT-I as part&#xD;
      of acute abstinence treatment. This study aims to test the feasibility of implementing a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological insomnia intervention for individuals at the Cornerstone clinic at the&#xD;
      Helping Up Mission, a residential SUD residential recovery program for men in Baltimore, MD.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Cornerstone clinic, an accredited behavioral health&#xD;
      clinic directed by Johns Hopkins faculty and staff, which provides evidence-based SUD&#xD;
      treatment to residents of the Helping Up Mission. CBT-I will be incorporated into the&#xD;
      outpatient reinforcement-based SUD treatment. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      implementation of CBT-I during early SUD recovery is feasible and will lead to improved sleep&#xD;
      parameters and improved clinical outcomes compared with those receiving treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU). The investigators propose a proof of concept study which would first demonstrate&#xD;
      feasibility of administering CBT-I for individuals residing in a men's homeless shelter, and&#xD;
      will further evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy of CBT for insomnia in individuals&#xD;
      with SUDs. This investigation will provide important and novel information regarding&#xD;
      potential psychological interventions that may be incorporated into evidence-based SUD&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
