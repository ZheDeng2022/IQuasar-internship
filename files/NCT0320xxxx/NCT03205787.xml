  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human safety studies were carried out to test whether red clover botanical dietary&#xD;
      supplements used by peri- and post-menopausal women are safe to use with Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. To test this, a red clover dietary supplement&#xD;
      (previously tested in women at the University of Illinois at Chicago without any harmful&#xD;
      effects) was given with four selected FDA-approved drugs to determine if the red clover&#xD;
      supplement can increase or decrease how these medications are absorbed, metabolized and&#xD;
      excreted by the human body. Preclinical studies predicted that the red clover supplement&#xD;
      might affect the metabolism or break down of these probe drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the start of a study, subjects were administered low doses of a mixture of four&#xD;
      FDA-approved drugs (caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and alprazolam), and serial&#xD;
      blood samples were drawn and analyzed for the concentration of each drug over time.&#xD;
      Afterwards, participants took the red clover dietary supplement twice orally daily for 14&#xD;
      days to allow for potential inhibition or induction of drug metabolizing enzymes and&#xD;
      transporters. Thereafter, the same drugs were taken again to obtain a second measure of drug&#xD;
      concentrations in blood over time. Changes in the concentration-time curve values for each&#xD;
      probe drug obtained before and after ingestion of the supplement were evaluated to determine&#xD;
      if metabolism of the probe drugs was impacted by the red clover dietary supplement.&#xD;
