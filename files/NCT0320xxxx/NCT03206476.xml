  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy of a nutritional intervention&#xD;
      based on the Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoric Model in the favorable modification&#xD;
      of eating habits in adolescents of secondary education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis was that secondary school adolescents receiving a nutritional intervention&#xD;
      based on Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoric Model presented more favorable&#xD;
      modifications in their eating habits than adolescents who only received nutritional&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A community trial was conducted with pilot testing for the validation of the study&#xD;
      instruments. Adolescents from the second grade of the afternoon shift of the Jalisco&#xD;
      Technical High School Nº46 participated in the 2015-2016 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-completed questionnaires evaluated socioeconomic variables, physical activity habits,&#xD;
      stage of change (Transtheoric Model), constructs of the Social Cognitive Theory and five&#xD;
      eating habits: consumption of fruits and vegetables, natural water, dairy products, sugary&#xD;
      drinks and processed foods ; As well as anthropometric variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group had twelve workshops on healthy eating habits and two sessions for&#xD;
      parents. The control group received three sessions of nutritional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables were measured again at the end of the intervention to evaluate results in the&#xD;
      short term and three months later to know results in the medium term.&#xD;

      DESCRIPTION OF THE DESIGN: The present study is a community trial, since there was control&#xD;
      group and intervention group, random group assignment, intervention at group level, pre-test&#xD;
      and at least one post-test (López, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study counted with pre-test or initial evaluation - evaluation 1 (E1) and two post-tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation 2 (E2) in the short term, at the end of the intervention (approx 4 months after&#xD;
      evaluation 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation 3 (E3) in the medium term, three months after the intervention. Prior to the&#xD;
      community trial, the validation study of the instruments used in the research was carried&#xD;
      out. For this, the questionnaires were applied to adolescents twice (Evaluation A-EA and&#xD;
      Evaluation B-EB), with a temporal difference of one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CALCULATION OF SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation for the intervention group and the control group was based on the&#xD;
      data obtained in the Birnbaum et al. to the. (2002) regarding the variable &quot;changes in the&#xD;
      average number of servings consumed per day of fruits and vegetables&quot;. This was the only&#xD;
      study that was found to measure changes in dietary habits (food consumption) in a&#xD;
      quantitative way, as planned in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Was used the &quot;formula to calculate sample size when is expected to find an average difference&#xD;
      and is known the standard deviation, given reliability and power (considering different&#xD;
      variances).&quot; A control ratio was established: cases of 1: 1, a level of significance or&#xD;
      probability of error type 1 (α) of 0.05 (reliability of 95%) and a probability of error type&#xD;
      2 (β) of 0.20 (power of 80 %).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following results were obtained: Sample size for each group 29&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLING SYSTEM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling system for group formation is non-probabilistic, since the groups were already&#xD;
      formed prior to the experiment (2nd grade school groups). However, the form of participation&#xD;
      of the school groups in the research, yes was assigned of simple random way (by means of&#xD;
      tombola).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the six groups corresponding to the 2nd grade school, two groups were randomly selected to&#xD;
      perform the validation of the instruments (stage 1 of the research).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining four groups participated in the other stages of the research. After completion&#xD;
      of evaluation 1, they were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (two groups) or&#xD;
      the control group (two groups).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      MEASUREMENT TOOLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires. General data format: It was elaborated to collect the necessary data to&#xD;
      describe the population, it includes aspects related to data of identification, sex, age,&#xD;
      socioeconomic level, habits of physical activity and measures and anthropometric indices. To&#xD;
      evaluate the socioeconomic level, there are six multiple-choice or open-ended questions,&#xD;
      which were adapted from validated questionnaires (AMAI, 2017; Bauce, 2010; Vera-Romero,&#xD;
      2013); Only those that were adequate for adolescents to be answered were included. To&#xD;
      evaluate physical activity, a section of a validated questionnaire is used (Flores-Vázquez,&#xD;
      2014), with slight adaptations. To ensure the validity, the internal consistency and&#xD;
      reproducibility of said sections were evaluated. Only the anthropometric evaluation section&#xD;
      is filled by the evaluator and not by the adolescent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-completed food habits questionnaire: Contains 20 open-ended questions about the&#xD;
      frequency and amount of consumption of fruits and vegetables, dairy products, natural water,&#xD;
      sugary drinks and industrialized foods. Some of the questions were extracted from a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire (Flores-Vázquez, 2014), however, due to the adaptations and added questions,&#xD;
      the reproducibility of the questionnaire was evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive social measures related to eating habits in adolescents: Evaluates self-efficacy,&#xD;
      facilitating resources, self-regulation, social support, expectations and self-assessment of&#xD;
      expectations in relation to eating habits, using Likert type scales, including a total of 28&#xD;
      questions Four to five for each section). The instrument was translated and adapted from a&#xD;
      previously validated one (Dewar, 2012). The validation of the resulting instrument was&#xD;
      previously performed, for which reproducibility, internal consistency and factor load were&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algorithm to measure stage of change: It consists of a total of 4 linked questions about&#xD;
      actions and intentions in healthy eating habits, through which the adolescent change stage is&#xD;
      obtained, is based on an algorithm previously translated into Spanish (Villalobos, 2012).&#xD;
      Their reproducibility and clarity were evaluated for the adolescent, as well as their&#xD;
      correlation with the amount of adequate eating habits (criterion validity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAPTURE OF THE DATA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements. They were performed by nutrients previously trained and&#xD;
      standardized in the anthropometric measurements. One evaluator performed the measurement of&#xD;
      body weight and height and another the one of waist and abdominal perimeter; Another person&#xD;
      served as a scorer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires. All questionnaires were designed to be autocompleted. For their application,&#xD;
      the evaluators gave the questionnaires to the students and indicated the importance of&#xD;
      providing accurate information about the questions included in the formats. Each&#xD;
      questionnaire has explicit instructions on how to complete it. However, the evaluators&#xD;
      remained with the students during the filling of the instruments and solved the doubts. It&#xD;
      took 30 minutes to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATABASE AND COMPUTER PROGRAMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparation of the thesis document was carried out in the program Microsoft Office Word&#xD;
      2013. The database was elaborated in the program Microsoft Office Excel 2013 and later&#xD;
      exported to the statistical program SPSS version 22, for its analysis. The calculation of the&#xD;
      anthropometric indices was done through the WHO Anthro Plus program&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTIC ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables are expressed in quartiles (non-parametric) or some in mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation (parametric). The qualitative variables are expressed in frequency and&#xD;
      percentage. Non-parametric tests were used for the qualitative variables. It was verified&#xD;
      whether the quantitative data are normally distributed by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (n&gt;&#xD;
      50) or Shapiro-Wilk (n≤50) test, which allowed the use of parametric or non-parametric tests&#xD;
      (Table 13) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-group tests. Quantitative variables: Student's parametric T test for related samples,&#xD;
      Wilcoxon non-parametric test. - Evaluate changes in food consumption (portions / day) in the&#xD;
      short term (evaluation 1 to 2) and medium term (evaluation 1 to 3) in the intervention group&#xD;
      and in the control group. -Evaluate modifications in the score of each TCS construct, in the&#xD;
      short and medium term, in each group. -Evaluate changes in the anthropometric indicators, in&#xD;
      the short and medium term, in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ordinal qualitative variables: Wilcoxon non-parametric test -Evaluate differences in the&#xD;
      change stage, in the short and medium term, in each group. - Evaluate differences in the&#xD;
      distribution of nutritional status, in the short and medium term, in each group. -Evaluate&#xD;
      differences in the distribution of the food habit &quot;dairy consumption&quot;, in the short and&#xD;
      medium term, in each group. -Evaluate differences in the distribution of the answers of the&#xD;
      questions about cognitive-social measures, in the short and medium term, in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dichotomous qualitative variables: Non-parametric test Mc Nemar -Evaluate differences in the&#xD;
      distribution of each food habit classified as &quot;adequate or inadequate&quot;, in the short and&#xD;
      medium term, in each group. -Evaluate differences in the presence of abdominal obesity, short&#xD;
      stature and overweight / obesity, in the short and medium term, in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intergroup testing. Quantitative variables: Student's T parametric test for independent&#xD;
      samples, Non-parametric test U of Mann Whitney - To compare each eating habit, TCS construct&#xD;
      and anthropometric indicator, in each evaluation, between the intervention group and the&#xD;
      control group. -Compare the difference in the modification of each eating habit, in the short&#xD;
      and medium term, between the intervention group and the control group. -Compare the&#xD;
      difference in the modification of each TCS construct, in the short and medium term, between&#xD;
      the intervention group and the control group. -Compare the difference in the modification of&#xD;
      each anthropometric indicator, in the short and medium term, between the intervention group&#xD;
      and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative variables: Non-parametric test Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test - Compare&#xD;
      the distribution in the socioeconomic level and physical activity habits (baseline), of the&#xD;
      intervention group vs the control group. -Compare the distribution in the nutritional status&#xD;
      and the stage of change, in each evaluation, of the intervention group vs the control group.&#xD;
      -Compare the distribution of each food habit classified as &quot;adequate or inadequate&quot;, in each&#xD;
      evaluation, of the intervention group vs the control group. -Compare the changes in the stage&#xD;
      of change, in the short and medium term, of the intervention group vs the control group.&#xD;
