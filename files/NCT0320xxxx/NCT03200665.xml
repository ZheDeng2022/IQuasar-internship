  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sonographic fetal weight estimation at the last weeks of third trimester in low-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies is an effective method for diagnosis of fetal growth restriction (FGR) permitting&#xD;
      close surveillance and timely delivery. The need for a systematic ultrasound evaluation at&#xD;
      the last weeks of a low-risk pregnancy and the best time to perform it remains controversial.&#xD;
      The most commonly used clinical screening tool in this population is the serial measurement&#xD;
      of symphysis-fundus distance, which is a method of a variable and low sensitivity for&#xD;
      detection of FGR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Portugal, in accordance with guidelines of Direcção Geral de Saúde from 2015, fetal growth&#xD;
      restriction screening in low risk pregnancies is performed with an ultrasound for fetal&#xD;
      weight estimation at 30th-33rd weeks. Nonetheless, recent data from randomized trials showed&#xD;
      that FGR detection rate was superior at 36 vs 32 weeks' gestation. In cases of severe FGR,&#xD;
      detection rate was also superior at 36 vs 32 weeks' gestation. In a prior retrospective&#xD;
      study, our group analyzed 1429 term low risk pregnancies and the investigators concluded that&#xD;
      small for gestational age term babies (birthweight &lt; 10th centile) had a statistically&#xD;
      significant higher rate of operative deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress than&#xD;
      appropriate for gestational age as well as a higher rate of admission to neonatal intensive&#xD;
      care unit. Moreover the investigators compared the same outcomes within small for gestational&#xD;
      age neonates with antepartum detection at 30th-33rd weeks ultrasound vs undetected (normal&#xD;
      30th-33rd weeks ultrasound). Antepartum detection of small for gestational age neonates&#xD;
      showed a statistically significant lower rate of operative deliveries for intrapartum fetal&#xD;
      distress than undetected small for gestational age neonates. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      prospective randomized clinical trial with the aim to evaluate if a 35th-37th weeks after the&#xD;
      standard of care ultrasound in low risk pregnancies is effective in improving the detection&#xD;
      rate of FGR and in reducing cesarean deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress and admission&#xD;
      to neonatal intensive care unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population to include in this study corresponds to the low-risk pregnant women with&#xD;
      surveillance at the Prenatal Consultation or referenced by the Primary Care units to the&#xD;
      Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology of Hospital de Santa Maria. The screening method for&#xD;
      detection of fetuses at risk of fetal growth restriction currently used in low-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies is the measurement of the symphysis-uterine distal distance at all visits from 24&#xD;
      weeks and a third trimester ultrasound at 30-32 (6 / 7 days weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who agree to participate in the study, after signing an informed consent, will&#xD;
      be randomized into 2 groups (with and without an additional ultrasound evaluation at 35-35+6&#xD;
      (6 / 7 days weeks)). The randomization will be done through computer software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be recorded such as: maternal age, ethnicity, parity, height, weight,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status and smoking habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study group (ultrasound evaluation at 35-35+6 (6 / 7 days weeks)), the ultrasound&#xD;
      evaluation will include biometric parameters of the fetus: cephalic perimeter, biparietal&#xD;
      diameter, abdominal circumference and femur length. Based on these measurements, the computer&#xD;
      system (Astraia) provides the estimated fetal weight and respective percentile according to&#xD;
      the Hadlock formula. Amniotic fluid will also be measured (maximum column). Functional&#xD;
      evaluation will include: Doppler of the umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery and Uterine&#xD;
      arteries. The respective index of pulsatility and cerebroplacental ratio will be registered.&#xD;
      All Doppler evaluations will be performed in the absence of somatic and respiratory fetal&#xD;
      movements, under transitory maternal apnea, with the lowest insonation angle possible and at&#xD;
      least 3 successive complexes will be evaluated for each measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstetric and neonatal outcomes will be registered after delivery by revising medical records&#xD;
      such as: gestational age at delivery, prepartum hemoglobin, type of labor (spontaneous or&#xD;
      induced and respective indication), type of delivery (eutocic, instrumental, antepartum or&#xD;
      intrapartum cesarean section), indication of instrumental or cesarean delivery,&#xD;
      cardiotocographic register characteristics (repeated severe variable decelerations, late&#xD;
      decelerations, absence of variability), evidence of meconial fluid, neonatal morbidity&#xD;
      (hypoglycemia, hypothermia, transient tachypnea, hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy,&#xD;
      meconium aspiration syndrome, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, metabolic acidosis,&#xD;
      intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, seizures and asphyxia) and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a retrospective analysis performed in the target population of this study, the&#xD;
      rate of intrapartum fetal hypoxia requiring obstetric intervention in pregnant women with&#xD;
      fetal growth restriction is 28%. Aiming to reduce this adverse perinatal outcome by 10%, it&#xD;
      is estimated that the investigators will need to include a total sample of 2700 pregnant&#xD;
      women (1350 in each group), with 80% power and α level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing third-trimester ultrasound at 30-32 weeks, the rate of antenatal detection of&#xD;
      fetal growth restriction is 20.5% in low risk pregnancies. Aiming to increase the detection&#xD;
      rate by at least 7%, the investigators will require a total sample of 1,200 pregnant women&#xD;
      (600 in each group), with 80% power and α level of 0.05. Thus an interim analysis is expected&#xD;
      to be performed when 1200 cases are recruited to the study to compare the detection rate of&#xD;
      fetal growth restriction between the two groups.&#xD;
