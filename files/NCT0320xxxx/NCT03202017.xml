  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of two treatment techniques called&#xD;
      Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) and Lung Volume Recruitment (LVR) on breathing,&#xD;
      swallowing, speech, and cough function in persons with mild to moderate ALS. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will do EMST alone, and the other half of the participants will do EMST and LVR.&#xD;

    <description>EMST is a treatment method that has been used to improve cough function and swallowing in ALS. EMST uses a training device that has a valve set to 50% of a patient's maximum expiratory pressure (MEP). The patient exhales forcefully until the valve releases. Patients perform 5 sets of 5 repetitions a day, 5 days a week.</description>

LVR is a technique to increase cough function that is performed with a resuscitation bag fitted with a mouthpiece and a one-way valve. The bag is used to expand the lungs, after which the patient makes a voluntary cough.</description>
