  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect and analyze the physiologic data of the ICON™ during dexmedetomidine (DEX)&#xD;
      sedation for neonatal pulmonary function testing. The ICON™ is a noninvasive physiological&#xD;
      monitor which uses respiratory impedance to follow systemic vascular resistance (SVR), heart&#xD;
      rate, cardiac index and stroke index.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally the measurements of cardiac indices and hemodynamic variables require invasive&#xD;
      monitors such as pulmonary thermodilution catheters and transesophageal Doppler&#xD;
      echocardiography. In recent years, electrical cardiometry has been used for the non-invasive&#xD;
      determination of stroke volume, cardiac output, and other hemodynamic parameters in adults,&#xD;
      children, and neonates. Electrical cardiometry has been validated against &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
      methods such as thermodilution and is a proprietary method trademarked by Cardiotronic, Inc.&#xD;
      (La Jolla, CA). Cardiotronic markets the ICON™. It is FDA-approved for use in pediatric and&#xD;
      adult patients, is currently used for clinical purposes in the BCH MSICU at 11 South.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICON™ is a comprehensive, standalone hemodynamic monitor, which provides a complete&#xD;
      hemodynamic monitoring system that provides user-defined hemodynamic parameters. It provides&#xD;
      a continuous trend of cardiac output and stroke volume associated with rapid changes in vital&#xD;
      signs with minimal risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICON™ monitor has been used in Boston Children's Hospital to determine the hemodynamic&#xD;
      changes in children aged 1 month to 18 years of age who received dexmedetomidine sedation for&#xD;
      CT and Nuclear Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been found to be an effective drug in the pediatric population in&#xD;
      both the intensive care unit and for procedures in Radiology. In a recent study, DEX caused&#xD;
      bradycardia (3%), hypotension (9%) and hypertension (8%) in pediatric critical care patients.&#xD;
      Intravenously administrated sedation. DEX will be delivered as per the DEX order set used for&#xD;
      non-painful procedures in the radiology department. As an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, DEX&#xD;
      produces hemodynamic changes to blood pressure and heart rate. To precisely follow the trend&#xD;
      of complex changes in systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output and stroke volume during&#xD;
      DEX administration, would ideally be with invasive intravascular monitors which would not be&#xD;
      warranted in pediatric sedation procedures. However, a minimal risk non-invasive cardiac&#xD;
      output monitor such as the ICON can measure, detect, and trend these physiological changes in&#xD;
      the neonates and infants who are receiving DEX for pulmonary function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with certain lung conditions undergo pulmonary function tests (PFT) which are&#xD;
      currently being performed using chloral hydrate administered by the responsible and sedation&#xD;
      credentialed pulmonologist (Dr. Lawrence Rhein). Chloral hydrate is inconsistent and&#xD;
      unreliable in producing adequate sedation for a successful PFT study. Sedation physicians&#xD;
      from the BCH Department of Anesthesia have agreed to provide sedation for these patients with&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine (DEX), using the same approved protocols that are being used in the BCH&#xD;
      Department of Radiology for non-painful imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use the ICON™ to follow the physiological cardiac parameters (non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure, pulse oximeter, capnography, heart rate, and electrocardiogram) throughout&#xD;
      the pre-sedation, sedation and recovery period. Investigators propose collecting this data in&#xD;
      a prospective manner with parental informed consent for the data collection.&#xD;
