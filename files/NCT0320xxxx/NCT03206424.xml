      WHO and UNICEF recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months and addition of complementary&#xD;
      foods (CF) at six months of age with continued breastfeeding till two years But WHO estimates&#xD;
      that 2 out of 5 children are stunted in low-income countries, so CF should be timely,&#xD;
      adequate and prepared and given in a safe manner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for six months, i.e. 180 days and addition of complementary&#xD;
      foods at six months of age with continued breastfeeding till at least two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When breast milk is no longer enough to meet the nutritional needs of the infant,&#xD;
      complementary foods should be added to the diet of the child. The transition from exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding to family foods, referred to as complementary feeding, typically covers the&#xD;
      period from 6 to 18-24 months of age, and is a very vulnerable period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the time when malnutrition starts in many infants, contributing significantly to the&#xD;
      high prevalence of malnutrition in children less than five years of age world-wide. WHO&#xD;
      estimates that 2 out of 5 children are stunted in low-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary feeding should be timely, meaning that all infants should start receiving foods&#xD;
      in addition to breast milk from 6 months onwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be adequate, meaning that the complementary foods should be given in amounts,&#xD;
      frequency and consistency and using a variety of foods to cover the nutritional needs of the&#xD;
      growing child while maintaining breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foods should be prepared and given in a safe manner, meaning that measures are taken to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of contamination with pathogens. And they should be given in a way that is&#xD;
      appropriate, meaning that foods are of appropriate texture for the age of the child and&#xD;
      applying responsive feeding following the principles of psycho-social care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breastfeeding is common in developing countries, but exclusive breastfeeding is rare, and&#xD;
      complementary foods are introduced at an early age. Poorer nutritional status was&#xD;
      significantly associated with earlier complementary feeding. The results suggest that&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding, (together with promotion of weaning education and growth monitoring)&#xD;
      should be vigorously promoted in these developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child development experts advise parents not to introduce solid foods, such as baby cereal,&#xD;
      into an infant's diet until the infant is at least 4 to 6 months old. The researchers also&#xD;
      found that formula-fed infants were much more likely to be given solid foods too early than&#xD;
      were breast-fed infants. Health authorities do advise parents to wait until after 4 months&#xD;
      because infants aren't developmentally ready to eat solid foods before. There are a number of&#xD;
      other reasons why experts don't recommend early feeding. One is that the early introduction&#xD;
      of solid foods has been linked to a shorter duration of breast-feeding. Early solid food&#xD;
      consumption has also been linked to the development of chronic conditions, such as childhood&#xD;
      obesity, celiac disease, diabetes and eczema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So that we will do this study in our government region to evaluate Complementary feeding&#xD;
      practices and their impact on the health status of our infants, we will recruit a cross&#xD;
      sectional sample from those who visit our hospital clinics for various reasons such routine&#xD;
      check-ups, vaccinations or illness.&#xD;

    <time_frame>16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Specific values taken by good history from mother of the index infant including:&#xD;
When and why did the mother start complementary feeding?&#xD;
What is the type of food?&#xD;
How much food taken in one meal and How many meals are taken within the day?&#xD;
How does she prepare and give this food?&#xD;
What the effect of this food on breastfeeding demand or frequency?&#xD;
Ask about incidence and frequency of problems related to beginning of complementary food such as attacks of Acute gastroenteritis, Constipation or Acute chest infection.&#xD;
Information about the index infant: name, age, sex, his/her order in the family, height and weight of child at birth.&#xD;
General information about the parents such as name, age, place of residence, educational level, occupational status, socioeconomic level, self-hygiene and number of children of the family.&#xD;
