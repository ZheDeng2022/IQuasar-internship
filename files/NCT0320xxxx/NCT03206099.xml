      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic testing called &quot;sequencing&quot; helps researchers look at DNA. Genes are made of DNA and&#xD;
      are the instructions for our bodies to function. We all have thousands of genes. DNA variants&#xD;
      are differences in genes between two people. We all have lots of variants. Most are harmless&#xD;
      and some cause differences like blue or brown eyes. A few variants can cause health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the genetics of immune disorders various health conditions, as well as outcomes&#xD;
      of clinical genomics and genetic counseling services performed under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in other NIH human subjects research protocols - either at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center (CC) or at Children s National Health System (CNHS) - (aged 0-99 years), and, in&#xD;
      select cases, their biological relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will study participant s DNA extracted from blood, saliva, or another tissue&#xD;
      sample, including previously collected samples we may have stored at the NIH. Researchers&#xD;
      will look at participant s DNA in great detail. We are looking for differences in the DNA&#xD;
      sequence or structure between participants and other people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive results that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are important to their health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have been confirmed in a clinical lab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suggest that they could be at risk for serious disease that may affect your current or&#xD;
           future medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some genetic information we return to participants may be of uncertain importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If genetic test results are unrelated to the participant s NIH evaluations, then we will not&#xD;
      typically report:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal variants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about progressive, fatal conditions that have no effective treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carrier status (conditions you don t have but could pass on)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples and data will be saved for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data will be kept as private as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If future studies need new information, participants may be contacted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) use next&#xD;
      generation sequencing technologies to help determine genetic contributions to immune&#xD;
      diseases. These efforts have increased rates of molecular diagnosis for a subset of NIAID&#xD;
      participants as well as uncovered fundamental insights into the cellular and signaling&#xD;
      pathways in host defense and immune regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these successes, analysis and interpretation of genomic data remain a substantial&#xD;
      challenge. Simply, researchers do not understand the functional and clinical consequences of&#xD;
      most human genetic variation. This is true at NIAID and across the intramural research&#xD;
      program. Making progress in this area requires a coordinated, systematic, and transparent&#xD;
      approach to clinical genomics research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is specific to genetic testing and explicitly aims to both strengthen clinical&#xD;
      care and enhance research throughout participating programs at the NIH. Probands will provide&#xD;
      biological specimens for genetic testing and will be required to be enrolled on a primary&#xD;
      protocol, which will execute the primary clinical and research evaluations. This protocol&#xD;
      serves as a vehicle for a programmatic effort that includes standardized phenotyping, test&#xD;
      ordering through the Clinical Research Information System (CRIS), sample collection and&#xD;
      isolation, nucleic acid analysis, bioinformatics, clinical interpretation, reporting in CRIS,&#xD;
      genetic counseling, and supporting effective use of genomics as a research tool throughout&#xD;
      the intramural program. Overall, increased process standardization will support data&#xD;
      integrity and efficiency while still accommodating the need for investigator flexibility.&#xD;

        -  PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must fulfill one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Proband participants: must have a disease under investigation by another NIH&#xD;
                  protocol on which they are co-enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Biological relatives: biologically related to a proband participant, and does not&#xD;
                  have a disease under investigation in another NIH protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Healthy volunteers: unrelated to a proband participant, and does not have a&#xD;
                  disease under investigation in another NIH protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 0-99 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to undergo genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to allow samples to be stored for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to have their de-identified genomic data shared, for&#xD;
             example in a controlled access databases like the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes&#xD;
             (dbGaP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult healthy volunteers must be able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation in&#xD;
        this study is a reason for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-enrollment guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Probands must be enrolled on another NIH - either at the NIH CC or CNHS - protocol as their&#xD;
        primary protocol for carrying out clinical and research evaluations. Relatives of probands&#xD;
        may be enrolled in this protocol whether or not the relatives are enrolled on another NIH&#xD;
        protocol. However, we may prioritize enrolling relatives who are on other NIH protocols and&#xD;
        have undergone careful phenotyping on those protocols. Careful phenotyping is important,&#xD;
        even for participants who are apparently healthy. Because the primary research team is best&#xD;
        suited to characterize their participants phenotypes, phenotyping of co-enrolled relatives&#xD;
        will be performed on the primary protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        SUBSTUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 14-99 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English language proficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        SUBSTUDY EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received positive genetic results from this protocol in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation&#xD;
             in this substudy.&#xD;
