  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying two drugs at different time points as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for advanced renal cell cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab Ipilimumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab are antibodies (a type of human protein) that work to stimulate your&#xD;
      body's immune system to fight tumor cells. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration)&#xD;
      has approved nivolumab as a treatment option for this disease; however, the FDA has not&#xD;
      approved the way nivolumab and ipilimumab are being administered in this study. Ipilimumab is&#xD;
      FDA approved for the treatment of melanoma (skin cancer) and has been previously studied in&#xD;
      renal cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to evaluate nivolumab treatment strategies based on each patients&#xD;
      individual response to treatment. In participants who have a response to treatment, nivolumab&#xD;
      will be stopped and participants will be closely monitored. In participants who do not have a&#xD;
      response to treatment,the investigators will investigate whether the addition of ipilimumab&#xD;
      improves a participant response to treatment. Participant blood and tissue samples will be&#xD;
      collected to learn about how certain biomarkers and genes relate to participant outcomes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year after discontinuation with nivolumab</time_frame>
    <description>Persistent PR or CR is defined as radiologic disease assessment performed every 8 weeks since primary nivolumab therapy. These radiologic disease assessments are evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines. At 1 year after nivolumab discontinuation, the proportion of patients with persistent PR and CR will be evaluated by established methods (for Arm A only).</description>

    <description>PD or SD is defined as radiologic disease assessment performed every 8 weeks since primary nivolumab therapy. Confirmatory scans will be performed at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively for PD and SD evaluation. If persistent, ipilimumab will be added to nivolumab treatment and scans will continue every 12 weeks for assessment. These radiologic disease assessments are evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines. At 1 year after nivolumab discontinuation, the proportion of patients with PD or SD will be evaluated by established methods (for Arm B only).</description>
