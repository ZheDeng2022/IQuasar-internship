  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All of the tools currently available for preoperative preparation of children either use a&#xD;
      third person approach (i.e., use media whereby they watch a video or look at pictures of&#xD;
      another child receiving an anesthetic), provide tours at some time previous to the operation&#xD;
      date, or are shown the equipment that they will encounter during their anesthetic. No&#xD;
      preoperative programme currently allows the child to experience the entire chain of events&#xD;
      from leaving the preoperative preparation area (and their parents), walking to the operating&#xD;
      area, being initially prepared for and receiving anesthesia and recovering from anesthesia,&#xD;
      in real time and from a first person perspective. As such the investigators are carrying out&#xD;
      this study to assess whether virtual reality preoperative preparation is effective in&#xD;
      reducing anxiety at induction of anesthesia.&#xD;

      The investigators' goal in this study is to investigate the effects of virtual reality&#xD;
      preoperative preparation on anxiety in children at induction of anesthesia. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that utilisation of this novel 1st person immersive preparatory method will lead to an&#xD;
      enhanced understanding of what will happen to the child (in addition to what the environment&#xD;
      looks and sounds like) when they have their anesthetic. The investigators believe this&#xD;
      enhanced understanding and preparation will lead to the reduction in anxiety levels before&#xD;
      and during the induction of anesthesia, and will also lead to a reduction in postoperative&#xD;
      negative behaviour disorders.&#xD;
