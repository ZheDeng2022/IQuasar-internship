      Background. Immunotherapy in elderly patients is controversial, and there is still not much&#xD;
      evidences supporting this treatment's safety and efficacy in this population. This study was&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of specific injection immunotherapy for house&#xD;
      dust mite allergens in patients over 65 years of age with allergic rhinitis and a confirmed&#xD;
      allergy to house dust mites. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the mean&#xD;
      average adjusted symptom score (AAdSS) and the total combined rhinitis score (TCRS)&#xD;
      difference in the least square means in the label in comparison to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods. The study with double blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted in&#xD;
      one centre. Fifty eight elderly patients with house dust mites allergy and AR were&#xD;
      individually randomized in comparable numbers to one of two parallel groups: two years&#xD;
      perennial AIT with the use Purethal Mites or placebo. Symptoms and medication score were&#xD;
      presented as AAdSS and TCRS. Quality of life based on Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (RQLQ), serum allergen specific IgG4 to D.pteronyssinus and D. farinae and Der&#xD;
      p1 and Der p2 were monitoring.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of injection AIT for HDM&#xD;
      allergens in elderly patients with allergic rhinitis and a confirmed HDM allergy. The study&#xD;
      with double blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted in one centre. A total of 92&#xD;
      patients ranging from 65 to 73 years of age were recruited from the outpatient allergy clinic&#xD;
      to assess their eligibility for inclusion in the study. First, there was a need for pre&#xD;
      screening approximately 157 patients with inhalant allergies and the right age. Additionally,&#xD;
      the patients included in the study all had a positive skin prick test (SPT), were positive&#xD;
      for specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE), and had positive nasal provocation tests (NPTs) with&#xD;
      D.pteronyssinus and D. farinae allergens. Patients with a clinical allergy and/or a positive&#xD;
      skin prick test and specific IgE to other inhalant allergens (including other pollens) were&#xD;
      excluded from the study. A careful examination of the eyes, ears, nose, and throat was&#xD;
      performed on all patients. The severity of perennial allergic rhinitis (AR) was assessed&#xD;
      using the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines. The patients were&#xD;
      randomly selected to receive PURETHAL Mites (20,000 AUeq/ml, HAL Allergy BV, Leiden, The&#xD;
      Netherlands, containing major allergen equivalents of 14.0 μg/ml group 1, and 20.0 μg/ml&#xD;
      group 2, measured by ELISA in the extract prior to modification and adsorption on aluminium&#xD;
      hydroxide) or a placebo (Figure 1). The recruitment period was limited to three months&#xD;
      (April-June). Purethal Mites were administered as perennial therapy using the following&#xD;
      regimen: 1 dose- 0.1 ml, 2 doses - 0.2 ml, 3 doses - 0.5 ml every week, and 0.5 ml every four&#xD;
      weeks during 24 months.&#xD;
