  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigating how neuropathic limb pain, including phantom limb pain or complex regional pain&#xD;
      syndrome, is affected by virtual reality. While several studies have looked into virtual&#xD;
      reality for treating this type of pain, few have used the latest immersive virtual reality&#xD;
      hardware combined with motion control for an engaging virtual mirror therapy experience. The&#xD;
      investigators are interested in studying the use of virtual reality as an alternative&#xD;
      treatment option for these conditions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Immediately following final virtual reality session</time_frame>
    <description>Using a questionnaire, feedback over participant self-reported tolerance of the virtual reality environment, participant likelihood of recommending this therapy to others with similar conditions, reported sense of presence in presented scenario(s), comfort of virtual reality devices, impact on self-reported functional ability outside of clinic, and overall impression of virtual reality therapy will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Pain Relief with Virtual Reality Therapy: Wong-Baker Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from initial scores prior to virtual reality exposure to immediately prior to and following virtual reality sessions, and up to 8 weeks following last sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Wong-Baker Faces pain scale will be measured. This will be done by obtaining pain scale scores immediately prior to therapy session, immediately following therapy, and several weeks post last therapy session.</description>
