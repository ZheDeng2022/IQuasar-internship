    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare tumors. They usually form inside and near the&#xD;
      adrenal gland or in the neck region. Not all these tumors can be removed with surgery, and&#xD;
      there are no good treatments if the disease has spread. Researchers think a new drug may be&#xD;
      able to help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn the safety and tolerability of Lu-177-DOTATATE. Also, to see if it improves the&#xD;
      length of time it takes for the cancer to return.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults who have an inoperable tumor of the study cancer that can be detected with&#xD;
      Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drug in an intravenous infusion. They will get 4 doses, given&#xD;
      about 8 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 4 and 24 hours after each study drug dose, participants will have scans taken. They&#xD;
      will lie on their back on a scanner table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have vital signs taken. They will give blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will have other scans taken. Some scans will use a radioactive&#xD;
      tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by phone 1-3 days after they leave the Clinical Center. They&#xD;
      will then be followed every 3 to 6 months for 3 years or until their disease gets worse.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) are rare tumors arising from neural crest&#xD;
           tissue that can develop in sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia throughout the&#xD;
           body. Those arising in the adrenal gland are called PHEOs while those located&#xD;
           extraadrenally are called PGLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While benign and uni-focal, PHEO/PGL can be effectively treated with surgical resection,&#xD;
           participants with metastatic PHEO/PGL often times have few effective and efficient&#xD;
           treatment options with current treatments aimed more at palliation and symptom control.&#xD;
           Furthermore, some benign head and neck PGLs may be inoperable because of their size and&#xD;
           location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somatostatin receptors (SSTR), especially type 2, have been shown to be over-expressed&#xD;
           in a number of human tumors, including gastroenteropancreatic (GEP), carcinoids,&#xD;
           neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, and PHEO/PGL among many others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ionizing radiation such as the beta particles emitted by Lu-177 cause DNA damage to&#xD;
           target cells through both direct and indirect mechanisms. In addition, ionizing&#xD;
           radiation has also been shown to induce cell death through what is known as the&#xD;
           bystander effect, a phenomenon where cellular signaling from irradiated cells towards&#xD;
           non-irradiated cells induces cellular damage and eventually death in nearby surrounding&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lu-177-DOTATATE is a somatostatin analog that predominantly recognizes SSTR2. This&#xD;
           reagent has been used extensively and its well-tolerated safety profile and efficacy has&#xD;
           been shown in a variety of neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and to evaluate the ability of Lu-177-DOTATATE to improve upon&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months in participants with inoperable, SSTR positive&#xD;
      PHEO/PGL by comparing PFS of participants treated with Lu-177-DOTATATE to historical controls&#xD;
      from existing literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically-proven, surgically inoperable, PHEO/PGL participants (both newly&#xD;
           diagnosed or participants with existing diagnoses are eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have presence of SSTR+ disease as documented by positive Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Positivity of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan defined as having at least one lesion that is&#xD;
                greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter with uptake that is higher than or equal&#xD;
                to liver and is qualitatively higher and distinguishable from background activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: greater than or equal to 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky Performance Score greater than or equal to 60 or, ECOG Performance Status of 2&#xD;
           or better&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to understand and willing to sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open-label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 2 study evaluating efficacy and safety of&#xD;
           Lu- 177-DOTATATE in the selected participant population divided into two cohorts: 1)&#xD;
           SDHx cohort will include participants with the succinate dehydrogenase mutation, which&#xD;
           is the most common and most aggressive genetic sub-group of participants with PHEO/PGL,&#xD;
           and 2) apparent sporadic cohort which will include participants without a clear genetic&#xD;
           mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have met the primary endpoint of having achieved a PFS of at least 6 months&#xD;
           after the initial treatment course, may be eligible to receive further cycles of Lu-&#xD;
           177-DOTATATE at the time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simon 2-stage optimal design will be applied to each cohort independently. For each&#xD;
           cohort, if 11/18 participants are progression-free at 6 months, accrual will proceed to&#xD;
           the second stage, where an additional 23 participants will be accrued, for a total of 41&#xD;
           participants per cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assuming a loss-to-follow-up rate of 10%, a total of 45 participants will be accrued to&#xD;
           each cohort, with a total accrual ceiling of 90 participants.&#xD;
