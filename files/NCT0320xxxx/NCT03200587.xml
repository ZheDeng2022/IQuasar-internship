  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized, phase I dose-finding, of Cabometyx +&#xD;
      Avelumab, to establish safety, feasibility, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or&#xD;
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Cabometyx in combination with Avelumab, and to investigate&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy. The MTD or RP2D determined in this study will be used for a future&#xD;
      study to formally test efficacy. The MTD determined by dose escalation will be the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose.&#xD;

             prohibited.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including colitis, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disease, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent&#xD;
             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for&#xD;
             entry into this study.&#xD;

             ischemic event or symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) less than or equal to 6 months&#xD;
             before dose of Cabometyx.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or incidentally detected&#xD;
             asymptomatic PE on routine scans are allowed if stable and treated with therapeutic&#xD;

             hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first dose.&#xD;
