      The studies primary aim is to use the FACE-Q (a validated patient reported outcome (PRO)&#xD;
      scale) for patients undergoing parotidectomy to subjectively measure the functional and&#xD;
      aesthetic impact of the surgery1. It is hypothesized that patients undergoing parotidectomy&#xD;
      have long-standing under-reported functional and cosmetic issues. Currently most parotid&#xD;
      defects are not reconstructed. A secondary aim is to objectively analyse the volume of the&#xD;
      parotid gland pre- and post-operatively to guide reconstructive surgery in patient with&#xD;
      parotid tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and neck tumours are common. Most salivary gland tumours arise from the parotid gland&#xD;
      and 80% are benign. Tumour resection can be limited/partial, superficial, total or radical&#xD;
      depending upon the pathology2. This can lead to a cosmetic deformity in the pre-auricular&#xD;
      /cheek region, infra-auricular region causing a superior cervical depression (especially if&#xD;
      combined with a neck dissection) and retromandibular regions2,3. More than 50% of patients&#xD;
      report being affected by facial contour abnormalities after parotidectomy and their deformity&#xD;
      can be both visible on direct and lateral facial views4. The cosmetic defect following&#xD;
      parotidectomy has been rated from moderate to severe disgurement5. Facial disfigurement&#xD;
      experienced by head and neck cancer patients has a strong impact on their quality of life6,7&#xD;
      (both in function and cosmesis). This is accentuated by the central role of the face in&#xD;
      social communication and expression. Despite these facts there is little evidence on PRO&#xD;
      measures post parotidectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRO's are essential in current medical practice to view success of an intervention from a&#xD;
      patient's perspective. Two types of questionnaires are available- generic (e.g. SF-36) and&#xD;
      disease specific (e.g. FACE- Q). Generic assess the disease effect on the whole person&#xD;
      irrespective of the medical condition. Disease specific assess interventions in a particular&#xD;
      disease. They are more sensitive to detect changes due to focused questions. The FACE-Q&#xD;
      questionnaire is a recently designed gold standard PRO that is disease specific. The FACE-Q&#xD;
      measures 4 domains- satisfaction with facial appearance, adverse effects (both of these&#xD;
      highlight the effects on a specific facial area e.g. lips, eye etc), health-relate quality of&#xD;
      life and process of care (both of these are relevant to al facial patients). It achieves this&#xD;
      as it has over 40 scales each with a series of questions around one central concept. Patient&#xD;
      responses are graded on a 4 point scale and then converted to a score on a scale from 0-100.&#xD;
      A higher score means improved quality of life. There is no overall score, only scores for&#xD;
      each independent scale. As scales are independent only the scales most relevant to a specific&#xD;
      research objective or patient population need be administered. Patients can complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire pre and post operatively to view the impact of the intervention. An advantage&#xD;
      is that it only takes a few minutes to complete. The dis-advantage of the FACE-Q could be&#xD;
      perceived that it was initially developed for aesthetic facial procedures however the&#xD;
      questions are directly applicable for reconstructive facial procedures. Also research is&#xD;
      still undergoing regarding the clinical meaning/clinical significance of the FACE-Q but it&#xD;
      still allows PRO quantitative data pre and post procedure to aid evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little reconstruction post parotidectomy. However, the goals of reconstruction are&#xD;
      both functional (e.g. management of weakness of the lower lip or oral continence,&#xD;
      reconstruction of the facial nerve and prevention of Gustatory sweating) and aesthetic2. A&#xD;
      few possible methods have been described for reconstruction. Primary reconstruction of small&#xD;
      defects are usually with local fascial flaps2 e.g. SMAS flaps5 and large defects with muscle&#xD;
      flaps2 e.g. Sternocleidomastoid8. Secondary reconstruction involves fat grafting5 or&#xD;
      correction of lip asymmetry. The main method of reconstruction involves the defect being&#xD;
      analysed and subjectively &quot;compared&quot; to the contralateral side2. Recent papers have attempted&#xD;
      to improve accuracy. Some have reported abnormal volumes i.e. tumour size. However, they have&#xD;
      not reported normal volumes (i.e. size of defect)5.MRI has been used to measure volume of&#xD;
      defects left behind, however this is not totally accurate as it only measured the largest&#xD;
      transverse dimension and requires further expensive imaging5. Therefore to improve outcomes&#xD;
      improved accuracy on the dimensions of the defect is required before reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, although some reconstruction outcomes have been measured by subjective methods8,&#xD;
      there is none by a validated questionnaire e.g. the FACE-Q. End points such as morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and recurrence rates are only one measure of treatment success. In addition, there&#xD;
      are few objective outcomes reported e.g. using a visual analogue scale9 has been mentioned&#xD;
      but this is less accurate than using pre and post op 3D photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at prospective analysis of 50 consecutive patients undergoing&#xD;
      parotidectomy by consultant head and neck surgeons (ENT and maxillofacial surgeons) at 1&#xD;
      academic tertiary centre (Guy's Hospital). A range of adults from 18-80 years old with&#xD;
      capacity and of any gender or ethnicity will be assessed. Patients having both benign and&#xD;
      malignant parotid resection with either partial or superficial or total parotidectomy or neck&#xD;
      dissection will be included. Data to be collected includes pre-operative FACE-Q analysis and&#xD;
      non-invasive 3D camera measurements, demographic data, tumour pathology, tumour size, defect&#xD;
      size, postoperative radiation and duration of follow-up. Follow up will be from 3 months up&#xD;
      to 1 year post surgery using the FACE-Q and a non-invasive 3D camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no obvious risk to the patient as a validated questionnaire will be used and a&#xD;
      non-invasive investigation tool. The patient will not be subject to any extra treatment or&#xD;
      time in hospital for this particular group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous trials have been performed that are relevant to this study.&#xD;
