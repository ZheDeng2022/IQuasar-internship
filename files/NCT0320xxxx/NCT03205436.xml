    <textblock>
      This study is an extension of the randomized controlled trial NT-DFU-AFF-01. Subjects that&#xD;
      were randomized to the Standard of Care group will be able to crossover to the NT-DFU-AFF-02&#xD;
      trial and receive Affinity fHSAM if certain criteria are met.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an extension of the randomized controlled trial NT-DFU-AFF-01 in which subjects&#xD;
      were randomized to SOC for 12 weeks or SOC and fresh hypothermically stored human amniotic&#xD;
      membrane (Affinity; fHSAM) for 12 weeks to determine if addition of fHSAM to SOC results in&#xD;
      faster healing of Wagner grade 1 and 2 DFUs compared to SOC alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 weeks, patients from this RCT (NT-DFU-AFF-01) with study DFUs that have not been reduced&#xD;
      in area by at least 40% will be exited from the study and considered treatment failures. This&#xD;
      group (Group 2C) will constitute the active population in this single arm study&#xD;
      (NT-DFU-AFF-02). Study wounds will receive up to 12 weeks of continuing SOC and fHSAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU, appropriate sharp or&#xD;
      surgical debridement, and aggressive infection management with the use of appropriate&#xD;
      dressings (defined later in the protocol). A number of offloading systems are commercially&#xD;
      available. The choice of offloading will be at the discretion of the principal investigator&#xD;
      but should be total contact casting, fixed ankle walker boot, or equivalent device to the&#xD;
      fixed ankle walker boot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Phase (1 day) consists of a series of screening assessments designed to&#xD;
      determine eligibility followed by, for those who meet the eligibility criteria (described in&#xD;
      more detail below), treatment. At the Screening Visit (S1), written informed consent from the&#xD;
      subject will be obtained by the Investigator or suitably qualified designee before the&#xD;
      performance of any other protocol-specific procedure. The Screening Period is designed to&#xD;
      determine whether subjects are eligible to proceed to the Treatment Phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Phase (12 Weeks) begins on the same day as the screening visit. During the&#xD;
      Treatment Phase, subjects will be evaluated on a weekly basis. Efficacy evaluations each week&#xD;
      will include Investigator assessment of ulcer healing and measurements of ulcer size using&#xD;
      digital photographic planimetry. Safety evaluations during the Treatment Phase will consist&#xD;
      of adverse event assessments at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects whose ulcers do not achieve closure at 12 weeks or who experience an amputation will&#xD;
      be deemed treatment failures.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A percentage area reduction of less than 40% after having received 6 weeks of&#xD;
             treatment with SOC in the NT-DFU-01 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject understands and is willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply&#xD;
             with weekly visits and the follow-up regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has read and signed the IRB/IEC approved Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception (birth control pills, barriers, or abstinence).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Failure to complete 6 weeks of SOC in the original NT-DFU-01 study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any AE or SAE that occurred during the NT-DFU-01 study, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would preclude the subject successfully having Affinity applied for up to&#xD;
             12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is unlikely to complete a regimen of Affinity and SOC for up to 12 weeks due&#xD;
             to personal reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Osteomyelitis or bone infection of the affected foot as assessed by X-ray.&#xD;
