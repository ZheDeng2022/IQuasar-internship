  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis causes demyelinating lesions, which can induce multiple symptoms. If motor&#xD;
      disorders are the most visible disability, urinary disorders are frequent, with prevalence&#xD;
      from 32 to 86%. The first ones are due to pyramidal, cerebellar or proprioceptive lesions.&#xD;
      The seconds are due to specific lesion in inhibitor/activator encephalic centers, or&#xD;
      interruption on medullary conduction. It seems to be evident that walk and urinary disorders&#xD;
      are link, because of similar anatomic ways and control process. Effect of bladder filling is&#xD;
      well known on motoneuronal excitability. The effect of bladder filling on walk stay unknown,&#xD;
      while medullary integration of these two functions is very close, in medullary cone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim is to assess the effect of need to void on walk speed in multiple sclerosis with&#xD;
      lower urinary tract symptoms. Secondary aim is to identify clinical or urodynamic factor link&#xD;
      with major walk impairment when patients need to void.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with multiple sclerosis over 18 years old, consulting for lower urinary tract&#xD;
      symptoms in a tertiary center are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History and treatment, high, weigh, symptoms severity by USP score, cognitive impairment by&#xD;
      MMSE score and last urodynamic data are recorded. Patient are asked to drink water until they&#xD;
      feel a strong need to void, for which they would go to urinate at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walk tests are realized in a specific place, with calm and no passage. A chair is placed at&#xD;
      each end of the path. Toilets are just next to the hall where they realize the tests. A 10&#xD;
      Meters Walk Test is done during this condition, 3 times (only the intermediate 6 meters are&#xD;
      recorded). They can take 30 seconds of rest between each try if necessary. One Timed up and&#xD;
      go is done. Patient can use their habitual walking device. Speed walk asking is comfortable&#xD;
      for the two test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, patient can urinate. 3 post void residual volume with portable echography are done, and&#xD;
      the higher is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient achieve the same walk tests after urinate, in the same order. They must use the same&#xD;
      walking device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is mean gait recorded for 10 meters walk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome is time for timed up and go test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual variability between the 3 10MWT in the two conditions will be study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influence of age, EDSS, severity of symptoms, MMSE, detrusor overactivity on speed impairment&#xD;
      will be study in secondary analysis.&#xD;
