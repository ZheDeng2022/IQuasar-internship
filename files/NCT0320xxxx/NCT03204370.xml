  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) (or Morquio A disease) is a rare recessive autosomal&#xD;
      lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS)&#xD;
      resulting in accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) chondroitin-6-sulfate and keratin&#xD;
      sulfate (KS). Patients display progressive development of skeletal and joint abnormalities&#xD;
      and non-skeletal features including respiratory, cardiac, sensorial and neurological&#xD;
      complications. Recently, a specific treatment using enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with&#xD;
      recombinant human GALNS (elosulfase alfa) has become available. A multicenter double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (176 patients, age &gt; 5 yrs) showed significant improvement&#xD;
      in endurance of 22.5 m in 6 Minute Walking Test (6MWT) distance after 24 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with elosulfase alfa at 2.0 mg/kg/week as compared with placebo group. In addition to ERT, a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary management approach is necessary for coordinating assessment and follow-up&#xD;
      as well as for providing individualized supportive and symptomatic care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical presentation is highly variable from one patient to another regarding age at&#xD;
      onset, severity, progression rate and life expectancy. Most patients are affected with the&#xD;
      classical phenotype characterized by short trunk dwarfism with short neck and adult height &lt;&#xD;
      1 m. Atypical phenotypes with less severe extension of skeletal manifestations, adult height&#xD;
      &gt; 1m, and less frequent complications in other organs have been progressively recognized.&#xD;
      Clinical management differs depending on the clinical presentation of the patients but&#xD;
      natural history of the disease is largely unknown in atypical phenotypes. Precise and&#xD;
      exhaustive follow-up data are needed in such patients to increase our knowledge of this&#xD;
      natural history and to define the best criteria to evaluate ERT efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective clinical study focused on a unique large series of 9&#xD;
      adult patients (aged from 18 to 55 years) followed in a single expert center for metabolic&#xD;
      disorders located at the university hospital of Bordeaux, France. Eight of these patients are&#xD;
      affected with atypical MPS IVA characterized by less severe evolution of the disease and&#xD;
      heights ranging from 135 to 176 cm (the last patient height is 102 cm). Investigators aim to&#xD;
      increase knowledge on the natural history of the disease in adult patients with atypical MPS&#xD;
      IVA, treated or not with ERT, and to develop new objective and robust clinical criteria to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficiency of ERT over time, particularly in patients presenting an atypical&#xD;
      phenotype. The entire cohort treated or not treated with ERT, will be evaluated at baseline&#xD;
      and every year during a 5-years period. The complete evaluation at baseline will be our&#xD;
      absolute priority as well as obtaining long-term and exhaustive follow up of the patients&#xD;
      treated with ERT (two patients of the cohort already treated, and ERT expected in three&#xD;
      additional patients in the next months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a schedule of systematic and exhaustive assessments based on the&#xD;
      recommended follow up from experts panel consensus meeting (MorCAP protocol) extended to some&#xD;
      additional investigations including motor, cardiac and rheumatologic exams as our specific&#xD;
      focus.&#xD;
