      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study of Cu(II)ATSM administered orally to patients with&#xD;
      early idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The study will be conducted in two phases. In the first&#xD;
      phase, dose cohorts of six patients each will receive escalating daily doses of Cu(II)ATSM to&#xD;
      establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The starting dose will be 12 mg/day, which has&#xD;
      been shown to be well tolerated in an ongoing phase 1 pharmacokinetic and dose-finding study&#xD;
      of Cu(II)ATSM in patients with ALS (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02870634). In the second&#xD;
      phase of the study, an expansion cohort of 20 patients will be treated at the RP2D to confirm&#xD;
      tolerability and assess preliminary evidence of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the dose escalation and expansion cohorts, once the first 28 days of treatment are&#xD;
      completed, at the discretion of the investigator a patient may continue to receive Cu(II)ATSM&#xD;
      treatment for a maximum of six 28-day treatment cycles.&#xD;
