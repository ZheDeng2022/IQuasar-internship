  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present register has been designed to confirm the hypothesis that while using high&#xD;
      quality Intensity Modulated Radiation Techniques (IMRT) and a reduced external beam&#xD;
      stereotactic boost component it would be possible to maintain the late severe toxicity rates&#xD;
      under the 5 % level in situations where brachytherapy could not be proposed as a boost.&#xD;

      This register concerned patients with any kind of non-resected pelvic cancer for which a&#xD;
      brachytherapy Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) boost is non indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Placement of fiducials First of all, fiducials will be placed near or inside the Gross&#xD;
           Tumor Volume (GTV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radiation treatment The radiation treatment will be delivered by Varian Rapid ARC&#xD;
           accelerators. 50 Gy will be delivered in the Planning Tumor Volume (PTV) 1 and 60 Gy in&#xD;
           the PTV 2 simultaneously in 28 fractions (5 fractions a week) in no more than 40 days.&#xD;
           Anytime, 95% of the prescribed dose will have to cover at least 90% of the PTV 1 and PTV&#xD;
           2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CK Boost pelvis In the following 14 days after the external beam treatment, two high&#xD;
           CyberKnife dose sessions will deliver a pelvic boost of 6.5 Gy each to the initial GTV&#xD;
           or eventually to the residual GTV in case of too close vicinity of the organs at risk&#xD;
           (OAR). This boost will be planned according to a recent paper, using a new CT scan and&#xD;
           MRI scan for planimetric purposes. 95% of the prescribed dose will have to cover at&#xD;
           least 90% of the PTV. The maximal CyberKnife tolerated doses to the OAR for a 6.5 Gy&#xD;
           dose will be 5 Gy to 2cc of the bladder, rectum or sigmoid structures and 2.5 Gy to 5 cc&#xD;
           of the small bowel. The protocol will not require a dose summation of the different&#xD;
           steps of the treatment. The total duration of the whole treatment will have to be&#xD;
           inferior to 55 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Follow-up The clinical follow up will be planed weekly during the radiation treatments, and&#xD;
      at 2, 4 and 6 months thereafter. The patients will be then followed up every 4 months during&#xD;
      the first 2 years and twice yearly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical imaging using PET Scanner and MRI when possible will be performed at least at 6&#xD;
      months intervals during the first 2 years.&#xD;
