      In essence the researchers are hoping to test two separate hypotheses (described below in the&#xD;
      form of research questions). Therefore, the proposed analysis has been outlined according to&#xD;
      each hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Is low-dose quetiapine (50 mg/day) more effective for patients with depression&#xD;
      who have insomnia at treatment baseline? (Stated differently: is low-dose quetiapine 50&#xD;
      mg/day effective as monotherapy for patients with depression regardless of whether or not&#xD;
      they have insomnia at baseline?).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Is high-dose quetiapine (150 - 300 mg/day) more effective for patients&#xD;
      presenting with melancholic depression at treatment baseline?&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Response rates for even the most well-established antidepressants are poor, rarely exceeding&#xD;
      30%. This is likely due to fact that depression is a heterogeneous disorder. Using the DSM-5,&#xD;
      two patients diagnosed with depression may not share a single symptom. Antidepressants also&#xD;
      vary considerably in their mechanism of action, and research has shown that antidepressants&#xD;
      also differ in their ability to treat certain symptoms. Thus, there is a great need to&#xD;
      understand which patients respond to which antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quetiapine is commonly used to treat major depression and insomnia, although there is a&#xD;
      commonly held view that sedation underlies its antidepressant effect. Unlike most&#xD;
      antidepressants that bind to one or two receptor sites, quetiapine has a broad mechanism of&#xD;
      action and binds to over a dozen neurotransmitter receptors, with varying affinities, at&#xD;
      clinically relevant doses. Because of this, quetiapine has the ability to produce different&#xD;
      effects at different doses, in which the relative occupancy at neurotransmitter receptor&#xD;
      sites is changes accordingly. This is evidenced by the broad dosage range for quetiapine that&#xD;
      varies based on the disorder being treated (e.g., higher doses for schizophrenia than major&#xD;
      depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At low doses (e.g., 50 mg/day) quetiapine has more affinity for histamine and adrenergic&#xD;
      receptors, the blocking of which is presumed to result in sedation. These are the doses in&#xD;
      which quetiapine is commonly used as a sleep aid. At higher doses (150-300 mg/day) quetiapine&#xD;
      has greater affinity for serotonin receptors and produces a greater inhibition of&#xD;
      norepinephrine reuptake, which is believed to underlie its antidepressant effect, than it&#xD;
      does at lower doses at which it is more likely to bind to histamine and adrenergic receptors.&#xD;
      Not surprisingly, doses of 150-300 mg/day are recommended for the treatment of depression. It&#xD;
      is puzzling, however, that in one trial (NCT00320268; D1448C00001, Moonstone) 50 mg/day of&#xD;
      quetiapine was found to be just as effective as 150 and 300 mg/day as a monotherapy for&#xD;
      patients with major depression. Although there is evidence that the antidepressant effect of&#xD;
      high-dose quetiapine is independent of its sedating effect, to the researchers knowledge no&#xD;
      study has adequately assessed specifically if low-dose quetiapine is an effective&#xD;
      antidepressant in patients with depression not currently experiencing insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose quetiapine does not have a broad-spectrum antidepressant effect, but appears to be&#xD;
      most effective at treating certain depressive symptoms, including lack of pleasure/interest,&#xD;
      guilt/pessimistic thoughts, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, and anxiety/tension, which&#xD;
      commonly co-exist in a depressive subtype known as melancholic depression. This is not&#xD;
      surprising because melancholic depression is well-known to be responsive to medications that&#xD;
      increase serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission, compared to selective serotonergic&#xD;
      antidepressants. To the researchers knowledge, no study has examined if patients with&#xD;
      melancholic depression at baseline are more responsive to quetiapine, although the fact that&#xD;
      quetiapine seems to be most effective at treating symptoms common in melancholic depression,&#xD;
      as well as the fact that quetiapine has an active metabolite nor-quetiapine with strong&#xD;
      affinity for inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake, suggests this may be the case. Given that&#xD;
      insomnia is considered a symptom of melancholic depression, it would also be pertinent to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the effect of quetiapine on melancholic depression is not due to its&#xD;
      sedating effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the known lag-time between antidepressant initiation and response (roughly 4-6 weeks),&#xD;
      trial-and-error prescribing is an inevitably lengthy process. A better understanding of&#xD;
      predictors of response to medications such as quetiapine will lead to more timely and&#xD;
      effective treatment of patients with depression, as well as reduced financial burden of&#xD;
      diseases to society as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past research has demonstrated that the antidepressant effect of high-dose quetiapine&#xD;
      (150-300 mg/day) is independent of its sleep-inducing properties (Trivedi et al., 2013),&#xD;
      although to the researchers knowledge no study has adequately addressed this question using&#xD;
      only low-dose (50 mg/day) quetiapine. To test this hypothesis the researchers are using data&#xD;
      from 366 participants in D1448C00001 (50 mg/day arm [n = 182] and placebo arm [n = 184] only;&#xD;
      Weisler et al., 2009) because as far as the researchers know it is the only quetiapine XR&#xD;
      monotherapy trial for major depression that used doses of 50 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step in the analysis for Hypothesis 1 will involve classifying participants into&#xD;
      two groups: depression with insomnia and depression without insomnia. There should be a&#xD;
      balanced number of patients in each group who received quetiapine or placebo, as&#xD;
      randomization should have balanced interventions between any groups defined post-hoc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of insomnia will be determined based on responses to the baseline HAMD-17** and&#xD;
      MADRS** according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (a) Both of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduced sleep - MADRS Q 4 (A 2-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Insomnia - HAMD-17 Q 4 (A 2) or Q 5 (A 2) or Q6 (A 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers definition of insomnia is based on two gold-standard instruments designed to&#xD;
      assess the DSM criterion A4 &quot;insomnia&quot; required for the diagnosis of a major depressive&#xD;
      episode. The researchers definition was made deliberately broad to capture all participants&#xD;
      with reduced sleep in contrast to those with normal sleep or hypersomnia. It is unlikely that&#xD;
      this definition would miss any participants experiencing impaired sleep at baseline.&#xD;
      Furthermore, participants meeting either of these criteria would be judged to be experiencing&#xD;
      insomnia as a symptom of depression in most other research and clinical settings. The&#xD;
      researchers have requested for this definition that participants have impaired sleep on both&#xD;
      the MADRS and HAMD-17 so that there is agreement between participants' self-reported insomnia&#xD;
      (MADRS) and clinician-rated insomnia (HAMD-17). This also makes the results potentially more&#xD;
      relevant to a clinical setting in which clinicians assess the presence of depressive symptoms&#xD;
      including insomnia using simple questions with face validity such as those on the HAMD-17,&#xD;
      and do not typically rely solely on patient self-report questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on past research (YòÈargòn et al., 1997), it is expected that up to approximately 20%&#xD;
      of participants could have experienced hypersomnia at baseline, and others (up to 20%) will&#xD;
      have had normal sleep patterns. Therefore one could reasonably predict anywhere between 60&#xD;
      and 80% of participants would meet the researchers definition of &quot;insomnia.&quot; Should the&#xD;
      researchers insomnia grouping variable be overly inclusive to the point that more than 90% of&#xD;
      participants are in the &quot;insomnia&quot; group, or there are no responders in the &quot;no insomnia&quot;&#xD;
      group, then the researchers will utilize an alternate definition that requires the MADRS Q4&#xD;
      score to be 4 or higher. Should the categories still be unbalanced the researchers will&#xD;
      create a new grouping variable that defines the presence of a &quot;high sleep disturbance&quot; in&#xD;
      contrast to &quot;low sleep disturbance.&quot; The presence of a high sleep disturbance will be defined&#xD;
      as a score of 4 or greater on the summed HAMD-17 Questions 4, 5, and 6 (summed scores range&#xD;
      from 0-6) as well as a score of 4 or greater on MADRS Question 4 (range is 0 to 6). This&#xD;
      definition is identical to a &quot;high sleep disturbance&quot; definition used in past research&#xD;
      (Trivedi et al., 2013) although the researchers have added the stipulation that the baseline&#xD;
      MADRS Q4 score be 4 or higher so that there is consistency between the self-report and&#xD;
      clinical-rated assessments. It is unlikely that more than 90% of participants will be&#xD;
      classified as having a &quot;high sleep disturbance&quot; based on this definition (Trivedi et al.,&#xD;
      2013) and thus represents a potentially more balanced grouping variable. This new &quot;high sleep&#xD;
      disturbance&quot; variable would only need to be used in one portion of the analysis (Analysis A,&#xD;
      see below) as an alternate to the &quot;insomnia&quot; grouping variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the researchers not be able to determine an adequate &quot;insomnia&quot; or &quot;high sleep&#xD;
      disturbance&quot; grouping variable unfortunately they will not be able to proceed with the&#xD;
      corresponding analysis (Analysis A, as described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step in the analysis for Hypothesis 1 will involve calculating the study end&#xD;
      points. Two primary end points will be calculated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MADRS response rates, defined as a 50% score reduction from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Modified MADRS response rates, defined as a 50% score reduction from baseline calculated&#xD;
           without Item 4 (reduced sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test of Hypothesis 1 with modified MADRS response rates (Analysis B, see below) will only&#xD;
      be conducted if the Cronbach alpha value for the modified MADRS at baseline is at least .80&#xD;
      or within .10 of the unmodified MADRS alpha and still acceptable by standard convention (at&#xD;
      least .70). Given the hypothesis tests proposed (see below), response rates will be&#xD;
      calculated at each time point from baseline until and including the end of Week 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third step in the analysis for Hypothesis 1 will involve hypothesis testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First the researchers will compare MADRS response rates between participants with depression&#xD;
      and insomnia and participants with depression and no insomnia (alternate comparison, high&#xD;
      sleep disturbance vs low sleep disturbance) who were randomly assigned to received quetiapine&#xD;
      50 mg/day (Analysis A). The researchers are trying to establish that participants with&#xD;
      insomnia had a larger response than those without insomnia, and therefore no comparison&#xD;
      against placebo is needed. The outcome of interest will be the presence of a positive MADRS&#xD;
      response at any time point after baseline (i.e., Day 4, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, and Week 6).&#xD;
      Although this analysis strategy is not equivalent to a formal interaction test of a subgroup&#xD;
      treatment effect, which would inappropriately underpowered in this sample, the researchers&#xD;
      feel that it is appropriate to provide preliminary support for a subgroup effect that could&#xD;
      be evaluated with future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that 80% of the sample will be in the insomnia group and 20% in the no insomnia&#xD;
      group, and that 50% of participants in either group will have received quetiapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the researchers conducted a one-sided two-sample proportion z-test to evaluate the&#xD;
      prediction (insomnia response % &gt; no insomnia response %) with an alpha value of .05, it&#xD;
      would be able to detect a proportion difference of .22 with 80% statistical power (power&#xD;
      analysis conducted with G*Power, http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html). This corresponds to a&#xD;
      Cohen h effect size of .45, which is &quot;small&quot; bordering on &quot;medium&quot; in size by convention.&#xD;
      Considering the placebo response rate was 30%, while there is no consensus on what represents&#xD;
      a clinically meaningful subgroup effect, the researchers would consider a subgroup response&#xD;
      rate encompassing an additional 22% to be clinically meaningful and worthy of reporting&#xD;
      (especially in an area of medicine where response rates are typically &lt; 50%). Furthermore,&#xD;
      the researchers would have adequate statistical power to detect an effect size that is&#xD;
      neither overly large nor trivial in size (i.e., within the small-to-medium range) and thus&#xD;
      the test is appropriately powered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show that the antidepressant effect of quetiapine 50 mg/day was not due to its&#xD;
      sleep-inducing properties, the researchers will conduct a one-sided test of proportions&#xD;
      comparing modified MADRS response rates between the quetiapine 50 mg/day and placebo groups&#xD;
      (Analysis B). Again, the outcome of interest will be the presence of a positive MADRS&#xD;
      response at any time point after baseline (i.e., Day 4, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, and Week 6).&#xD;
      The insomnia grouping variable does not need to be used in this analysis because the modified&#xD;
      MADRS response rates do not include a &quot;reduced sleep&quot; item, and if there is significantly&#xD;
      higher modified MADRS response rates in the quetiapine group, one can reasonably conclude&#xD;
      that the antidepressant effect of low-dose quetiapine was not due to its ability to induce&#xD;
      sleep in participates who were experiencing insomnia (there are no other sleep items on the&#xD;
      MADRS). Analysis B also provides an alternate analysis strategy for understanding the role of&#xD;
      sleep improvement in the efficacy of low-dose quetiapine should the researchers be unable to&#xD;
      generate a meaningful insomnia grouping variable to be used in&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing the sample size in the original study was 366 (184 placebo), the researchers would be&#xD;
      able to detect a proportion difference of .12 (i.e., .30 for placebo vs .42 for treatment, as&#xD;
      per the original study results), which corresponds to a Cohen h of .26, with 80% power using&#xD;
      an alpha value of .05, and thus this analysis would be adequately powered (power analysis&#xD;
      conducted with G*Power, http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html). In essence, the researchers simply&#xD;
      want to attempt to replicate the original study findings using modified MADRS response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strictly speaking, tests of proportions provide full information only when the period at risk&#xD;
      for all subjects is the same. With clinical trials, censorship is common. One way of testing&#xD;
      for an interaction of treatment group and sleep status is by conducting a stratified log rank&#xD;
      test. The researchers will perform the stratified log rank test to examine whether the length&#xD;
      of time to MADRS response is the same between sleep groups. A significant chi-square&#xD;
      statistic, weighted by size of stratum, would indicate that low dose quetiapine is more&#xD;
      effective for those with insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Is high-dose quetiapine (150 - 300 mg/day) more effective for patients&#xD;
      presenting with melancholic depression at treatment baseline? To test this hypothesis the&#xD;
      researchers are using data from D1448C00001 (150mg, 300mg, and placebo arms only; Weisler et&#xD;
      al., 2009), D1448C00002 (150mg, 300mg, and placebo arms only, excluding duloxetine arm;&#xD;
      Cutler et al., 2009), D1448C00003 (quetiapine and placebo arms; Bortnick et al., 2011), and&#xD;
      D1448C00004 (quetiapine and placebo arms only, excluding escitalopram; Wang et al., 2012) in&#xD;
      order to conduct a pooled analysis. A pooled analysis is preferred as the researchers will&#xD;
      then have enough statistical power to detect a subgroup interaction (see analysis plan&#xD;
      below). This pooled analysis would include data from 1570 participants (n = 935 for&#xD;
      quetiapine 150 mg/day; n = 635 for placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step in the analysis for this hypothesis will involve classifying participants into&#xD;
      two groups: melancholic depression and nonmelancholic depression. This definition will be&#xD;
      applied to all participants in the four RCTs who received quetiapine (150-300 mg/day) or&#xD;
      placebo. There should be a balanced number of patients in each group, as randomization should&#xD;
      have balanced interventions between any groups defined post-hoc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of melancholic depression will be determined based on baseline responses to the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (MADRS) according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria by the presence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Anhedonia - MADRS Question (Q) 8 (Answers [A] 2-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Lack of reactive mood - MADRS Q 1 (A 6) or Q 2 (A 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At least three of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Mood worse in morning - HAMD-17 Q 18 (A 1-2 if specify in am)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Terminal insomnia - HAMD-17 Q 6 (A 1-2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Psychomotor changes - HAMD-17 Q 9 (A 2-4) or Q 8 (A 2-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Decreased appetite or weight - HAMD-17 Q 12 (A 2) or Q 16 (A 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Excessive guilt - HAMD-17 Q 2 (A 2-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers were not able to assess the criterion for DSM-IV melancholic depression that&#xD;
      mood be subjectively different from guilt in the assessment because this is not measured by&#xD;
      the HAMD-17 or MADRS. However, any participant meeting this subsample definitions would also&#xD;
      meet the full DSM-IV-TR criteria. One grouping variable for melancholic depression (coded as&#xD;
      1 &quot;present&quot; and 0 &quot;not present&quot;) will be created and all participants will be assigned a&#xD;
      value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on past research (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005;McGrath et al., 2008) the researchers&#xD;
      expect that the DSM-IV definition of melancholic depression be present in anywhere between 15&#xD;
      to 50% of the sample. This potential imbalance in group size is not problematic for the&#xD;
      planned analytic strategy using Cox regression models (unlike having unequal sample sizes in&#xD;
      ANOVA, for example - please see below for a more detailed description of the planned&#xD;
      analysis) unless there are empty cells in the model (e.g., no responders in the&#xD;
      &quot;nonmelancholic&quot; group). This would preclude the estimation of a model, although it would&#xD;
      still be clinically useful information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melancholia is typically associated with increased disease severity and therefore one might&#xD;
      expect a lower prevalence in an RCT that only involves outpatients and excludes participants&#xD;
      with significant suicidality and comorbidity. Therefore the researchers have made the&#xD;
      criteria for defining the presence of criterion A1 B1 B2 B3 and B5 as loose as possible.&#xD;
      Should these definition encompass more than 45% of the sample then the researchers would&#xD;
      consider this to be too broad as it is not consistent with previous research regarding the&#xD;
      prevalence of melancholic depression that would be expected in the sample. In this scenario&#xD;
      the definition will be changed such that a score of 3 is needed on HAMD-17 Q8, Q9, and Q17,&#xD;
      and a score of 4 or more is needed on the MADRS Q8. Should this new definition still be&#xD;
      inappropriately broad (&gt;45% of sample) the researchers will utilize a third definition that&#xD;
      also requires a score of 4 or more on HAMD-17 Q8, Q9, and Q17, a score of 6 or more on MADRS&#xD;
      Q8, and a score of 2 on HAMD-17 Q18 (if the specifier indicates mood is worse in the am).&#xD;
      Between these three definitions it is likely that there will be an appropriate prevalence&#xD;
      under 45% of the sample. If the researchers encounter the opposite problem, such that the&#xD;
      prevalence is less than 15%, the researchers will loosen the initial definition such that&#xD;
      only 2 of criteria B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 are needed. If the researchers are still unable to&#xD;
      obtain a prevalence between 15 and 45%, or a prevalence in this range but there are empty&#xD;
      cells in the Cox model, the researchers will unfortunately not be able to proceed with the&#xD;
      corresponding portion of the analysis (Analysis C, D, and E, as described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step in the analysis will involve calculating the study end points. Two primary&#xD;
      end points will be calculated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MADRS response rates, defined as a 50% score reduction from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Modified MADRS response rates, defined as a 50% score reduction from baseline calculated&#xD;
           without Item 4 (reduced sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portion of the analysis for Hypothesis 2 with MADRS response rates (Analysis D, see below)&#xD;
      will only be conducted if the Cronbach alpha value for the modified MADRS at baseline is at&#xD;
      least .80 or within .10 of the unmodified MADRS alpha and still acceptable by standard&#xD;
      convention (at least .70). Given the hypothesis tests proposed (see below), response rates&#xD;
      will be calculated at each time point from baseline until and including the end of Week 6.&#xD;
      Data from trials that extended longer than 6 weeks will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third step in the analysis will involve hypothesis testing. MADRS response rates between&#xD;
      quetiapine (150-300 mg/day) and placebo groups will be evaluated with a Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazard regression analysis. The outcome of interest will be MADRS response at any time point&#xD;
      after baseline up until Week 6, which represents the latest trial end-point common to all&#xD;
      four studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that high-dose quetiapine (150-300 mg/day) monotherapy will be more&#xD;
      effective for participants with melancholic depression the researchers will conduct a Cox&#xD;
      regression analyses (Analysis C) comparing MADRS response rates between the quetiapine&#xD;
      (150-300 mg/day) and placebo groups, while including the categorical melancholic depression&#xD;
      grouping variable as a covariate and testing for an interaction between treatment group&#xD;
      (quetiapine 150-300 mg/day vs placebo) and melancholic depression (present vs not present).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the researchers assume based on Weisler et al., (2012) a placebo response rate of 30% and&#xD;
      a quetiapine 150-300 mg/day response rate of 50% (and N = 1570), a simulated Cox regression&#xD;
      predicting overall treatment response, which the researchers ran in Stata 13, yielded a&#xD;
      hazard ratio of 1.6 (p &lt; .001). The Stpower command showed that a Cox regression and overall&#xD;
      response rate of 42% (50% treatment, 30% placebo) could detect a hazard ratio of 1.6 at a=.05&#xD;
      with 80% power with an N value of 339. It is usually recommended that to detect a subgroup&#xD;
      treatment effect with adequate power, the minimum required sample size to detect a treatment&#xD;
      response be multiplied by four (Brookes et al., 2004). Therefore the researchers would&#xD;
      consider a subgroup analysis with a sample of 1570 (&gt; 4x 339) to be adequate to detect a&#xD;
      potential interaction if it exists. The researchers also ran a second simulated Cox&#xD;
      regression with a sample of 1570 (30% melancholic; 70% nonmelancholic, and assuming the ratio&#xD;
      of 935 treatment:635 placebo would also be true of each subgroup) with an overall response&#xD;
      rate of 42%, a 30% response rate in placebo groups (regardless of melancholia status), and a&#xD;
      10% response rate difference between the melancholic treatment group and nonmelancholic&#xD;
      treatment group (which, given the predicted number of overall responses in treatment group,&#xD;
      leaves a rate of 47% in the nonmelancholic treatment group and 57% in the melancholic&#xD;
      treatment group) and found that the tested interaction was statistically significant such&#xD;
      that in the treatment group the odds of response was higher for those with melancholic&#xD;
      depression vs nonmelancholic depression (HR 1.7, p &lt; .001). Therefore, the researchers&#xD;
      consider the proposed analysis appropriately powered to detect a small subgroup treatment&#xD;
      effect assuming the predicted overall treatment effect (based on Weisler et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the interaction tested in Analysis C be nonsignificant, but there be a raw proportion&#xD;
      difference of &gt; .10 for response rates between the melancholic and nonmelancholic groups who&#xD;
      received quetiapine 150-300 mg/day, as a secondary analysis for Hypothesis 2, the researchers&#xD;
      will also compare MADRS response rates between participants with melancholic depression and&#xD;
      nonmelancholic depression who were randomly assigned to receive quetiapine with an&#xD;
      independent-samples proportion test (Analysis D). The outcome of interest will be the&#xD;
      presence of a positive MADRS response at any time point after baseline up until the end of&#xD;
      Week 6. With a presumed prevalence of 30% for melancholic depression, the researchers would&#xD;
      be able to detect a proportion difference as small as .10 (Cohen h = .20, which is &quot;small&quot;)&#xD;
      with 90% power (power analysis conducted with G*Power, http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most if not all participants with melancholic depression will have been experiencing insomnia&#xD;
      at baseline. To show that the improved efficacy of high dose quetiapine (150-300 mg/day) for&#xD;
      participants with melancholic depression was not simply due to the sleep-inducing properties&#xD;
      of quetiapine, the researchers will conduct a Cox regression (Analysis E) comparing modified&#xD;
      MADRS response rates between the quetiapine (150-300 mg/day) and placebo groups, while&#xD;
      including the categorical melancholic depression grouping variable as a covariate and testing&#xD;
      for an interaction between treatment group (quetiapine 150-300 mg/day vs placebo) and&#xD;
      melancholic depression (present vs not present). Because the modified MADRS response rates do&#xD;
      not include a &quot;reduced sleep&quot; item, if there is a significant interaction suggesting higher&#xD;
      modified MADRS response rates in persons with melancholic depression, the researchers can&#xD;
      reasonably conclude that the superiority of high-dose quetiapine for people with melancholic&#xD;
      depression was not simply due to its ability to induce sleep in these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival curves depicting response rates for each Cox model will also be plotted to help&#xD;
      visualize the data. As the Cox regression model assumes that the hazard ratio between any&#xD;
      treatment and the reference group is constant, the researchers will examine whether this&#xD;
      assumption is violated. This will be accomplished by comparing models with and without a&#xD;
      treatment x time interaction using a likelihood ratio test. If proportionality is violated,&#xD;
      the researchers will use restricted mean survival time analysis as suggested by Royston and&#xD;
      Parmar (Royston and Parmar 2013). Whether an interaction is present or not, the researchers&#xD;
      will compare the response rates at each week of treatment.&#xD;
