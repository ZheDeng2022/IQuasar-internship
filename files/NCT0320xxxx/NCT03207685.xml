      To demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the Embrace device in identifying convulsive&#xD;
      seizures (CS) and notifying a caregiver during patient hospitalization at an epilepsy&#xD;
      monitoring unit (EMU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be fit with an Embrace device upon admittance into the EMU. The Embrace system&#xD;
      will be used in conjunction with the EMU standard care practices to monitor the subject&#xD;
      during the subject's stay. EMU standard care practices will not be impacted by the Embrace&#xD;
      system, but rather the Embrace will be used to supplement the EMU monitoring. The events&#xD;
      detected by Embrace will later be compared to the gold standard results of the video EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convulsive seizure (CS) is defined for the purpose of this study as any seizure with&#xD;
      non-facial motor activity involving one or both upper and/or lower extremities that has&#xD;
      repetitive motor activity (rhythmic motor movements).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female patients with a history of convulsive seizure (as defined above) who&#xD;
             are admitted to a hospital for routine vEEG monitoring related to seizures. Patients&#xD;
             who are expected to have a convulsive seizure during their monitoring based on&#xD;
             interpretation of clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not expected to have their typical convulsive seizure during the&#xD;
             course of their hospital admission (i.e. expected reduction due to anti-epileptic&#xD;
             drugs during hospital admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are known or suspected to have a history of PNES only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known allergic reactions to nickel or stainless steel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants who were born pre-term and may not have fully developed skin&#xD;
