  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of the airway forms part of routine anesthetic practice. However, the predictions&#xD;
      referred to intubation or ventilation difficulties are usually inconclusive. In effect, the&#xD;
      failure rate in predicting such difficulties exceeds 60%. In this scenario it is not possible&#xD;
      to know whether a given patient will be difficult to intubate and ventilate. These are&#xD;
      referred to as non-intubate and non-ventilate cases with a high risk of severe neurological&#xD;
      complications and even death due to hypoxemia. According to all the clinical guides, the&#xD;
      solution in such cases usually involves the use of supraglottic devices that rescue&#xD;
      oxygenation through effective ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of ventilation failure with a supraglottic device, it is currently not possible&#xD;
      to know whether the device is correctly positioned, unless some other instrument such as a&#xD;
      flexible fiberscope is used to visualize the anatomy beyond the ventilation device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TotalTrack is a new device with all the characteristics of a supraglottic device that&#xD;
      moreover includes a camera at the tip, allowing us to confirm anatomical positioning with&#xD;
      respect to the glottic structures. This device also allows intubation under indirect&#xD;
      visualization of the glottis, thus adding the possibility of definitive patient lung&#xD;
      isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the capacity to visualize the glottic&#xD;
      structures through the camera of the TotalTrack device, compared with glottic visualization&#xD;
      afforded by indirect laryngoscopy in the same patient. The Cormack-Lehane scale and&#xD;
      percentage of glottic opening (POGO) are used for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives comprise assessment of the ventilation, intubation and TotalTrack&#xD;
      device withdrawal times. The hemodynamic changes associated to both techniques during&#xD;
      intubation and TotalTrack device withdrawal are also evaluated. Minimum patient oxygenation&#xD;
      throughout the procedure is assessed. The sealing and ventilation pressures during operation&#xD;
      of the TotalTrack device are recorded. Likewise, an analysis is made of the number of&#xD;
      placement attempts, visualization improvement maneuvers, and minor complications associated&#xD;
      to the use of the TotalTrack device (presence of blood upon withdrawal or pharyngeal pain),&#xD;
      with their degree of severity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the new TTK device improves laryngoscopic visualization compared&#xD;
      with direct laryngoscopy, thereby facilitating orotracheal intubation success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that the new TTK device does not improve visualization of the glottic&#xD;
      structures, the intubation conditions, or intubation success compared with direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Objectives 3.1 Primary objective To determine whether the new TTK device improves&#xD;
      laryngoscopic visualization as determined by the Cormack-Lehane scale and percentage of&#xD;
      glottic opening (POGO), versus conventional laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess intubation success, the laryngoscopy and intubation times, sealing pressure&#xD;
           and subjective difficulty with the TTK intubation device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the hemodynamic impact, oxygenation and complications associated to the use&#xD;
           of both intubation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Methodology 4.1 Type of study A prospective, multicenter, comparative observational study&#xD;
      has been designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 The study will begin following approval by the Clinical Research Ethics Committees of the&#xD;
      participating hospitals, and will have an estimated duration of 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Study population The study will involve patients scheduled for surgery and requiring&#xD;
      orotracheal intubation as routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the literature, the fibroscopic intubation success rate with other supraglottic&#xD;
      devices is close to 98%, versus 95-98% in the case of direct laryngoscopy. Considering a 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval and a study precision of 80%, the required sample size is 102 patients. A&#xD;
      total of 30 patients will be enrolled per center in order to compensate for possible losses&#xD;
      during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Inclusion criteria Patients with ASA score I-III Age &gt; 18 years Signing of the informed&#xD;
      consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5. Exclusion criteria Age &lt; 18 years Pregnant or breast-feeding women Patients with known&#xD;
      difficult airways Patients requiring rapid sequence intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6 Study withdrawal criteria Patients who after inclusion in the study fail to comply with&#xD;
      the protocol due to medical reasons, or who withdraw consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. 7 Study protocol A prospective, multicenter, observational study has been designed,&#xD;
      involving patients scheduled for surgery of any kind and requiring tracheal intubation,&#xD;
      following the obtainment of informed consent. The study will include ASA I-III patients over&#xD;
      18 years of age. Individuals requiring rapid sequence intubation or diagnosed with difficult&#xD;
      airways will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be collected before anesthesia (age, gender, body mass index and ASA&#xD;
      score), with evaluation of the airway (Mallampati score, thyroid-chin and sternum-chin&#xD;
      distances, interincisal distance, upper lip bite test, neck flexion, dental prostheses,&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, presence of a beard and neck perimeter) and history of&#xD;
      laryngoscopic procedures (if any). The patients also will be questioned about past neck&#xD;
      irradiation, neck or ENT surgery and lingual tonsil hypertrophy, in order to predict&#xD;
      supraglottic device management difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the patient in the pre-operating room, a peripheral venous line will be prepared and&#xD;
      premedication will be administered according to routine anesthetic practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once in the operating room, standard monitoring will be carried out, with peripheral O2&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) pulseoximeter, noninvasive arterial pressure (NIAP) and electrocardiography&#xD;
      (ECG). The depth of hypnosis should be evaluated based on the bispectral index (BIS)(or&#xD;
      through entropy monitoring), with the assessment of neuromuscular relaxation through train of&#xD;
      four (TOF) monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct patient oxygenation will be performed during 3-5 minutes, with an inspiratory oxygen&#xD;
      fraction of 100% using a correctly sealed face mask, with the aim of achieving an end-tidal&#xD;
      O2 level of over 90% (ETO2 &gt; 0.9). Following the above, anesthesia induction will be carried&#xD;
      out with fentanyl (1-2 µg kg-1), propofol (2-3 mg kg-1) and rocuronium (0.6 mg kg-1).&#xD;
      Endotracheal intubation will be performed when TOF = 0. Conventional laryngoscopy will be&#xD;
      carried out using a Macintosh blade in all patients, recording the exploration times and the&#xD;
      best laryngeal visualization achieved (using the Cormack-Lehane scale and percentage of&#xD;
      glottic opening [POGO]) with or without BURP (backward, upward and rightward pressure on the&#xD;
      thyroid cartilage) maneuvering. The best laryngeal vision achieved after these maneuvers will&#xD;
      be recorded. The TotalTrack (TTK) video laryngeal mask will then be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to intubation with this new device, the investigators will measure the TTK sealing&#xD;
      pressure, setting the respirator to manual mode, closing the expiratory valve to 40 cmH2O,&#xD;
      and adjusting the fresh gas flow to 3 litres. The pressure at which audible leakage occurs&#xD;
      will be measured. If the pressure exceeds 40 cmH2O, the test will be considered over, and&#xD;
      this latter value will be recorded as the TTK sealing pressure (&gt; 40 cmH2O).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, intubation will be carried out with an endotracheal tube half a grade less than the&#xD;
      maximum recommended by the manufacturer of the TTK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both direct laryngoscopy and after placement of the TTK, the best laryngoscopic vision&#xD;
      achieved will be recorded, based on the Cormack-Lehane scale and POGO, together with the&#xD;
      laryngoscopy and intubation times. The laryngoscopy time is defined as the time elapsed from&#xD;
      insertion of the laryngoscope or study device through the teeth to best vision of the&#xD;
      glottis. The intubation time in turn is defined as the time elapsed from collapse of the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube cuff to definitive positioning of the instrument beyond the vocal cords&#xD;
      (insertion mark on the tube), following capnographic confirmation of correct intubation. If&#xD;
      correct positioning is not achieved, the maneuver will be repeated, recording the time from&#xD;
      collapse of the cuff in the esophagus to correct positioning of the endotracheal tube. The&#xD;
      times will be recorded as accurately as possible. The use of a chronometer is advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected referred to heart rate, blood pressure (systolic / diastolic) and BIS&#xD;
      / entropy monitoring at the following times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before the induction of anesthesia (baseline value)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two minutes after the induction of anesthesia (post-induction baseline value)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immediately after direct laryngoscopy (post-direct laryngoscopy stress response)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Before insertion of the TTK (post-direct laryngoscopy baseline value)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Immediately after insertion of the TTK (post-TTK stress response)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After tracheal intubation (post-intubation stress response)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIS will be within anesthetic values at all times. If necessary, additional hypnotic drug&#xD;
      doses (propofol) will be administered (to be reflected in the total administered dosage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the subjective technical difficulty of the new device will be based on a&#xD;
      numerical scale from 1-10 (1 = very easy, 10 - insertion impossible).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data to be recorded for assessing the difficulties of the two techniques are the need&#xD;
      for repositioning of the TTK, external laryngeal manipulation maneuvers (BURP, lateralization&#xD;
      of the neck), the use of assists in intubation, and the number of attempts required to secure&#xD;
      orotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following complications will be documented: esophageal intubation; trauma of the mouth,&#xD;
      lips, tongue or teeth; presence of blood in the device; throat pain and dysphonia (in the&#xD;
      post-anesthesia recovery unit and 24 hours after surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Statistical analysis A descriptive analysis will be made of all the variables, including&#xD;
      the demographic data, predictors of difficult intubation, number of insertion and intubation&#xD;
      attempts, and the TTK intubation and withdrawal times. Continuous variables will be reported&#xD;
      as the mean and standard error, while categorical variables will be reported as frequency and&#xD;
      percentage. The chi-squared test will be used to compare categorical variables, while&#xD;
      quantitative variables will be contrasted using the Student t-test. The data will be analyzed&#xD;
      using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), version 20.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Strengths of the study If the study is successfully completed, the anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      have a new tool for orotracheal intubation that may minimize complications in the case of&#xD;
      difficult airways - thereby reducing healthcare resource utilization and the length of&#xD;
      hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of this device in the management of expected or unexpected difficult airways could&#xD;
      avoid important postoperative complications associated to such difficulties. In future,&#xD;
      increased experience and a larger number of patients could consolidate the TTK in an&#xD;
      important position in the difficult airway management algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Expected impact&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study hypothesis is correct, the benefits of improvement in the intubation technique&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A lesser risk of complications derived from hypoxemia, including irreversible brain&#xD;
           damage and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early discharge from the post-anesthesia recovery unit (PARU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant reduction of healthcare costs.&#xD;
