  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colo-rectal cancer is still one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. In France,&#xD;
      approximately 40 500 new cases are diagnosed each year. With more than 17 500 deaths in&#xD;
      France in 2011, colo-rectal cancer is responsible for more than 12% of all cancer deaths, the&#xD;
      overwhelming of deaths occurring in patients with metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies highlight the fact that colo-rectal cancer has immunogenic properties and that&#xD;
      host immune responses can influence survival. Recent data have provided a clearer&#xD;
      understanding of the factors limiting the antitumor immune response in colo-rectal cancer.&#xD;
      One of the most critical checkpoint pathways responsible for mediating tumor-induced immune&#xD;
      suppression is the programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-1 is expressed on activated immune cells and can link to PD-L1 express on&#xD;
      Antigen-Presenting-Cell. Usually, this pathway is involved in promoting T-cells tolerance and&#xD;
      preventing tissue damage in settings of chronic inflammation. In pathological context, the&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 pathway contributes to immune suppression and evasion. Many human solid tumors&#xD;
      including colo-rectal cancer express PD-L1, and this expression is associated with a worse&#xD;
      prognosis. The interaction of PD-1 with the ligand PD-L1 inhibits T-cell proliferation,&#xD;
      survival, and effectors functions; induces apoptosis of tumor-specific T cells; promotes the&#xD;
      differentiation of CD4+ T cells into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells; and increases the&#xD;
      resistance of tumor cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes attack. Thus, the blockage of the&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 interactions represents a logical target for cancer immunotherapy and in&#xD;
      particular colo rectal cancer immunotherapy strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have shown that PD-L1 blockade improves the immune response by restoring&#xD;
      T-cell effectors functions. Recent work in two in vivo tumor models shows a strong interest&#xD;
      in using an anti-PD-L1 in combination with standard treatment of colo-rectal cancer (FOLFOX).&#xD;
      In these models, the survival of mice that are treated with the combination therapy reached&#xD;
      40% when no mice were alive with FOLFOX treatment alone. This result may be explained, in one&#xD;
      hand by cytotoxicity of 5FU and in the other hand by the restoration of anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      activity of anti-PD-L1. These results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy with&#xD;
      immunotherapy would act synergistically in patients with colo-rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis: Combination of chemotherapy (FOLFOX) with immunotherapy association&#xD;
      (anti-PD-L1 + anti-CTLA-4) would act synergistically in patients with colo-rectal cancer.&#xD;
