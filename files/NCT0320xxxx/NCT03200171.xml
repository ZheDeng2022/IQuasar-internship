      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection can be complicated with liver cirrhosis and subsequently&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC develops at an annual rate of 1% to 4%, although higher&#xD;
      rates up to 7% have been reported in Japan. Recently; Reig et al; noticed that there was an&#xD;
      unexpected high rate of early tumor recurrence in patients with HCV-related HCC undergoing&#xD;
      interferon-free therapy (1). After this report; many publications have discussed the issue of&#xD;
      HCC development and recurrence in HCV patients treated with interferon free regimens. Results&#xD;
      of these trials are controversial with no definite conclusion till today. There is an unmet&#xD;
      need for further study the effect of interferon free regimens on development of de novo HCC,&#xD;
      recurrence of HCC and behavior of HCC in chronic HCV patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to study the effect of direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) on behavior of&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and overall survival in patients with chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      (CHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials &amp; methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective case control study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Setting: Multicenter study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients: 300 patients will be recruited in 2 groups assignment .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure of data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected at base line for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history: including current and previous treatment with stress on History of&#xD;
           treatment by DAAs (date started, used regimen, duration of treatment and treatment&#xD;
           response)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Full clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Complete blood picture (CBC):&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Liver profile: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),&#xD;
                albumin, total and direct bilirubin, prothrombin time and international normalized&#xD;
                ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Renal profile: serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium and potassium&#xD;
                levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Hepatitis markers: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) and hepatitis C virus&#xD;
                antibody (HCV Ab).&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Alpha feto protein (AFP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Tri-Phasic spiral abdominal CT: to diagnose HCC by typical vascular pattern and to&#xD;
                assess tumor extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Biopsy if needed After confirming HCC diagnosis, included patients will be&#xD;
                classified according to barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging system and&#xD;
                standard of care treatment will be provided to patients with different stages&#xD;
                according to BCLC guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed by CT scan or MRI examination and routine liver tests including AFP&#xD;
      every 3 months during the first 2 years then every 6 months during the subsequent 3 years if&#xD;
      no evidence of HCC recurrence during the first 2 years' period (for all patients regardless&#xD;
      HCC treatment receipt and its type). Local recurrence will be defined as reappearance of&#xD;
      tumor adjacent to the treated site of the initial HCC and distant recurrence as the emergence&#xD;
      of one or several tumor(s) not adjacent to the treated zone. Criteria for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      HCC recurrence will be the same as initial HCC, i.e. presence of typical hallmark of HCC&#xD;
      according to European Association for the Study of the Liver - European Organisation for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EASL-EORTC) guidelines and defined by presence on imaging&#xD;
      of hyper vascular in the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phases.&#xD;
      All imaging exams will be centralized and assessed by the same radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Statistical analysis will aim at identifying factors leading to change of behavior of HCC&#xD;
      after DAAs in CHC patients in addition to determination of the overall survival in those&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
