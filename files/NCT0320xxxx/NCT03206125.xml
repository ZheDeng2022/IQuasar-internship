      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal cancer is a common cause of cancer deaths. Most cases of this cancer are&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Many of these cases come from two parts of the&#xD;
      world with high-risk. One of these is in East Africa and include the country of Malawi.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn what factors explain the high risk there so we can understand&#xD;
      better what causes this cancer in people everywhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about causes and outcomes of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using Malawi&#xD;
      because of the large number of cases in that country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old who have ESCC and live in a certain region of Malawi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults in the same age group and location who do not have ESCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened at a hospital in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a 1-hour interview. They will answer questions about:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics (age, ethnicity, education)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place of residence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history and family medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug, alcohol, and tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hot beverage consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indoor air pollution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food habits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Farming&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal health&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their teeth and fingernails examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to give samples of blood, urine, saliva, toenails, and for the&#xD;
      cancer cases, a small piece of their tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 4 phone calls a year for 2 years to ask about their health....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Esophageal cancer causes an estimated 400,000 deaths per year and ranks as the&#xD;
      sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, just after breast cancer. Esophageal squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for 89% of all esophageal cancer cases worldwide and many of&#xD;
      the cases originate in two high risk regions, one in Asia and the other in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking tobacco and heavy alcohol consumption do not explain the incidence rates in the&#xD;
      high-risk regions. It is therefore important to consider a wide range of etiologic factors to&#xD;
      explain the high rates of cancer in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malawi has the highest incidence rates of ESCC in Africa. Our previous studies in Kenya and&#xD;
      preliminary studies in Malawi point to a number of potential ESCC risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Our study aims to enhance our understanding of the causes and outcomes for ESCC&#xD;
      in Malawi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: All suspected ESCC cases will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: We will conduct a case-control study of ESCC jointly at Kamuzu Central Hospital and&#xD;
      St. Gabriel s Hospital, recruiting 300 ESCC cases and 300 controls, to (1) evaluate exposures&#xD;
      (including consumption of very hot beverages, use of firewood as fuel, tooth loss and animal&#xD;
      exposure) which may influence risk of ESCC in Malawi and (2) collect biological samples to&#xD;
      quantify exposures of interest (included in the current proposal) and to study the genetics&#xD;
      and genomics of ESCC tumors (to be included in a future proposal).&#xD;

        300 ESCC cases and 300 controls recruited from Kamuzu Central Hospital and St Gabriel s&#xD;
        Hospital, Namitete (FWA: 00018517) which is 50 km from Kamuzu Central Hospital located in&#xD;
        Lilongwe, Malawi.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All suspected ESCC cases will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All KCH and St Gabriel s patients greater than or eqaul to 18 years of age who are&#xD;
             residents of the Central Region of Malawi and are diagnosed with histology-confirmed&#xD;
             ESCC will be invited to participate as cases in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &lt;18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those living outside the Central Region, those who are medically unable to complete&#xD;
             the study procedures (including questionnaire, biosample collection or endoscopy), and&#xD;
             those who are unable to understand the study procedures or give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        While we do expect to see younger people with ESCC in Malawi (as we have seen in Kenya),&#xD;
        cases under the age of 18 are rare: the field team would expect to see one or two a year.&#xD;
        This estimate is in line with the cancer registry data from Malawi. Therefore, we will not&#xD;
        enroll subjects younger than 18 years old.&#xD;
