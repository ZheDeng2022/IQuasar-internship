      This non-interventional study will test scoring systems used to identify high risk patients&#xD;
      when they are triaged upon presentation in the Emergency Department (ED) in a single hospital&#xD;
      in the Northwest of England between May and July 2017.E The study will involve collecting&#xD;
      data only from a cohort of 500 consecutive patients who arrive at the ED. Patients who have a&#xD;
      traumatic, purely obstetric or purely psychiatric condition will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be triaged as is routine by nursing and medical staff using various scoring&#xD;
      methods determine whether they are high risk and need urgent, life-saving treatment. In&#xD;
      addition the impression (yes/no) of the triaging nurse and the treating clinician as to&#xD;
      whether the patient will need a life-saving intervention will be collected. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up for 48 hours to see whether they needed any life-saving treatment, such as&#xD;
      admission to ICU, life-saving surgery, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient's Manchester Triage category, NEWS at presentation, nurse and treating clinician&#xD;
      impressions and a novel score calculated from NEWS data will be collected together with the&#xD;
      outcome data in order to compare the predictive power of the five scoring systems. In this&#xD;
      way the study will test which is the best scoring system for identifying high risk patients&#xD;
      in a timely manner. This is important as it can allow life saving treatment to be delivered&#xD;
      quickly to those patients who need it most and can prevent inappropriate interventions on&#xD;
      patients who do not immediately need them. The study will collect minimal patient information&#xD;
      and will not interfere with or alter their treatment in any way. Only patient data recorded&#xD;
      as part of routine practice is required, which will be collected by members of the direct&#xD;
      care team and will be anonymised prior to analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, non-interventional, prospective observational cohort study&#xD;
      collecting data from patients presenting to the ED of a large teaching hospital in the&#xD;
      Northwest of England. The study is designed to gather information about the number of&#xD;
      patients receiving life-saving intervention within 48 hours of presentation and the best of&#xD;
      five proposed ways of identifying these patients when they present to the ED. This study is&#xD;
      non-interventional and there will be no interference with treatment decisions or alteration&#xD;
      in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational approach is chosen as it will allow direct access to information&#xD;
      and better capture of the systems being assessed in the ED. Information about each patient's&#xD;
      perceived risk at presentation (in terms of the five proposed systems) will be collected at&#xD;
      the time of presentation. Information will include rating on the five proposed systems and a&#xD;
      number of outcome variables, all of which are recorded as part of routine clinical practice.&#xD;
      All information will be captured directly into a specially designed database including a&#xD;
      study number to preclude the need to record any personal identifiable information for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for each patient on an anonymised database. Demographic details (age,&#xD;
      gender, presenting condition) will be collected to identify if the sample is representative&#xD;
      of a general ED population. Each patient's Manchester Triage category, NEWS at presentation&#xD;
      and the novel score calculated from NEWS data will be included, as will the impression&#xD;
      (yes/no) of the triaging nurse and the treating clinician as to whether the patient will need&#xD;
      a lifesaving intervention. A number of outcome measures (death, admission to high dependency&#xD;
      or intensive care, admission directly to the cardiac catheter laboratory or coronary care,&#xD;
      emergency endoscopy, thrombolysis, life-saving surgery, intubation, emergency intravenous&#xD;
      medication, CPR, DC cardioversion/external or internal cardiac pacing, massive transfusion&#xD;
      for ongoing haemorrhage and non-invasive ventilatory support) will be extracted, having been&#xD;
      defined a priori as being potentially life-saving. The demographic details and variables&#xD;
      chosen are all recorded or calculated for each patient as part of routine practice on&#xD;
      critical care. No additional tests or measurements will be required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be anonymised by allocation of a study number and this figure will be&#xD;
      cross-referenced to an electronic masterlist which will contain the patient name and hospital&#xD;
      number. In this way the database can be linked back to the patient to continue data&#xD;
      collection and entry. The masterlist will be an electronic spreadsheet which will be stored&#xD;
      on a secure server at the hospital and accessed via password protected computers within the&#xD;
      ED. The masterlist will be destroyed on completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information will be collected in a spreadsheet designed to collate the information&#xD;
      and allow statistical analysis. No identifiable patient information will be inputted onto the&#xD;
      spreadsheet&#xD;
