  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard approach to managing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (SLL) is to wait until you have symptoms before treatment is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if providing earlier treatment for CLL&#xD;
      or SLL with ibrutinib in patients who do not have symptoms will be more effective than&#xD;
      waiting until symptoms develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with CLL or SLL. It is considered investigational to give ibrutinib&#xD;
      to CLL and SLL patients before symptoms develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can describe how the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take ibrutinib by mouth&#xD;
      1 time every day. Each dose should be taken with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you miss a dose of ibrutinib, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day. You&#xD;
      should take your next dose as scheduled. If you forget to take a dose, do not take extra&#xD;
      capsules on the next day to &quot;make up&quot; the missed dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given standard drugs, such as allopurinol or valacyclovir, to help decrease the&#xD;
      risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are&#xD;
      given and their risks. If you have side effects, your dose of ibrutinib may be lowered or&#xD;
      temporarily stopped until you recover from the side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may take ibrutinib for up to 2 years (24 cycles). If at the end of 2 years you are&#xD;
      benefitting from ibrutinib and the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest to&#xD;
      continue taking it, other treatment options will be discussed with you to allow you to&#xD;
      continue to take ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable&#xD;
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of Cycles 1-3 and then every 3 cycles after that until Cycle 24 (Cycles 6, 9, 12,&#xD;
      and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of Cycles 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn to test&#xD;
      for genetic mutations related to the disease. At Months 3, 6, and 12, additional blood (about&#xD;
      8 teaspoons) will be drawn for immune system testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of Cycles 6, 12, 18 and 24, you will have CT, MRI or PET/CT scan to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease. Depending on the results of the CT, MRI or PET/CT scans, you may not&#xD;
      need to have these scans repeated. The doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of Cycles 6, 12 and 24, you will have a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed or if the disease gets worse, some tests/procedures, such&#xD;
      as physical exams and blood draws for routine tests, may be repeated more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months, during a regularly scheduled clinic visit (if you are still receiving care at&#xD;
      MD Anderson) or by phone (if you are receiving care outside of MD Anderson), you will be&#xD;
      asked how you are doing, if you are still taking ibrutinib, and if you have any side effects.&#xD;
      If called, this call should last about 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
