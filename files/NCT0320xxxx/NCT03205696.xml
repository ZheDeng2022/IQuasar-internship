  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a strategic prospective cohort study which will measure the effects of early&#xD;
      intensive antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the establishment and persistence of HIV-1&#xD;
      reservoirs and HIV-1-specific immunity in acutely /recently HIV infected youth aged 12 to 24&#xD;
      years as compared to newly diagnosed youth with established infection &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants with newly diagnosed acute /recent HIV-1 infection will be offered enrollment&#xD;
      into the study with immediate initiation of ART which is the current standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents who are displaced and living in shelters or in the streets constitute an&#xD;
      extremely vulnerable population for acquisition of HIV infection worldwide. In the U.S.,&#xD;
      homeless youth, particularly African American Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered Youth (GBTY),&#xD;
      are very susceptible to substance abuse, juvenile justice contact, and acquisition of HIV and&#xD;
      other sexually transmitted infections (STI). The displaced adolescent population is not&#xD;
      generally amenable to routine clinic follow-up in hospital settings and potentially more&#xD;
      easily identified through mobile outreach efforts. HIV prevalence in this group can be as&#xD;
      high as 5.3%. While HIV incidence is unknown, high rates of concurrent exposures to other&#xD;
      STIs, substance abuse, and survival sex suggest acute infection is likely high. Pediatric&#xD;
      studies of HIV perinatally infected infants treated very early with potent antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy as well as studies of adult cohorts treated during acute infection, have shown that&#xD;
      very early treatment of HIV is associated with control and decrease in viral reservoir&#xD;
      burden, which is likely predictive of long term HIV control. Although early treatment has not&#xD;
      yet been demonstrated to induce a functional cure, it has been associated with an extended&#xD;
      period of complete viral quiescence, also known as HIV drug free remission. No studies of&#xD;
      this kind have enrolled significant numbers of adolescents. Some studies suggest HIV&#xD;
      reservoirs from adolescents who were recently HIV infected may be more pliable and responsive&#xD;
      to early combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) than that of adults. Prolonged control of&#xD;
      HIV through cART initiated following established HIV infection does not appear to impact&#xD;
      viral reservoir size. HIV remission is not attainable in this scenario following treatment&#xD;
      interruption, even after many years of undetectable plasma virus levels while on cART. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that very early antiretroviral treatment of adolescents with acute HIV infection&#xD;
      will be associated with decreased viral reservoir size, and viral reservoir size will be&#xD;
      significantly different between adolescents with acute, recent or established HIV infection.&#xD;
      To evaluate our hypothesis, we propose to capitalize on a current community-based strategy to&#xD;
      initiate very prompt antiretroviral treatment many times the very day of diagnosis of HIV&#xD;
      infection. Patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection will be offered antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment immediately or within a very short time by our collaborating clinical sites, and&#xD;
      through the present study will be monitored periodically for assessment of virus load and HIV&#xD;
      reservoir assays.&#xD;

      Study site staff will store blood specimens collected in this study at least through the end&#xD;
      of the study. In addition, as part of the informed consent process, subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      provide written informed consent for blood specimens to be stored after the end of the study&#xD;
      for possible future testing. The specimens of participants who do not consent to long-term&#xD;
      storage and additional testing will be destroyed at the end of the study&#xD;

        Our study will be recruiting youth between the ages of 12 and 24 years with newly diagnosed&#xD;
        HIV infection (Acute /Recent or Established HIV). The study is open to all patients within&#xD;

        will include adolescents who are displaced and living in shelters or in the streets. These&#xD;
        homeless youth will include African American Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered Youth (GBTY),&#xD;
        who are very susceptible to substance abuse, juvenile justice contact, and acquisition of&#xD;
        HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI).&#xD;
