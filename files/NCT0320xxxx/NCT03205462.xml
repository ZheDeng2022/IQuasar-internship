  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current Phase I clinical trial has been developed to assess the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of the Fluorothyazinone drug used as a single-dose administration and a treatment course in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. This dose-escalation trial will be conducted with sequential enrollment&#xD;
      of volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the screening results of volunteers who signed the Informed Consent Form, the&#xD;
      volunteers will be sequentially enrolled in three groups to receive different product doses;&#xD;
      the total number of volunteers receiving the product will be not less than 25 individuals. In&#xD;
      view of the fact that the product will be studied in humans for the first time, initially 5&#xD;
      volunteers will be admitted to the hospital to receive a single product dose. As soon as the&#xD;
      product safety is proven by the follow-up period outcomes on Day 7, the study will be&#xD;
      continued with the enrollment of additional 5 volunteers. They will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      600 mg to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of the studied product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interim safety assessment on Day 7 is completed, additional 15 volunteers will&#xD;
      enter the study to receive the product in a dosage regimen proposed for the use in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If necessary, backup individuals (not more than 4) will be additionally enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. The original volunteers could be replaced only if they had not received the product;&#xD;
      in case where a volunteer has received the product, no replacement will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers will be divided into three groups. Initially, Group I (5 volunteers) will be&#xD;
      included in the study. As soon as the interim results of safety tests (complete blood count,&#xD;
      clinical biochemical analysis, clinical urine test and clinical examination of the general&#xD;
      state of health) obtained on Day 7 are evaluated, the Investigator will make decision on&#xD;
      whether to enroll the second group (5 individuals) to assess the product used in a dose of&#xD;
      600 mg. After the interim safety evaluation on Day 7, additional 15 volunteers will enter the&#xD;
      study to receive the product in a dosage regimen proposed for use in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any of the volunteers who received a dose of the studied product will be considered as a&#xD;
      subject enrolled in the study, and his/her data will be used for assessing the product safety&#xD;
      and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consecutive enrollment of volunteers is implied for each of the groups with an interim&#xD;
      assessment of the safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be composed of four (4) visits for volunteers of Group I (a screening visit,&#xD;
      the hospitalization visit during which a volunteer will receive the studied product and stay&#xD;
      for three (3) days at the hospital, and two outpatient visits - 5 and 7 days after receiving&#xD;
      the product).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be composed of four (4) visits for volunteers of Group II (a screening visit,&#xD;
      the hospitalization visit during which a volunteer will receive the studied product and stay&#xD;
      for seven (7) days at the hospital, and two outpatient visits -14 and 28 days after receiving&#xD;
      the product).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be composed of five (5) visits for volunteers of Group III (a screening visit,&#xD;
      the hospitalization visit during which a volunteer will receive the studied product and stay&#xD;
      for seven (7) days at the hospital, and three outpatient visits - 14, 28 and 60 days after&#xD;
      receiving the product).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a volunteer signs the Informed Consent Form at the screening stage, a screening number&#xD;
      will be assigned to the volunteer (consecutive numbering system will be used, i.e. numbers&#xD;
      will be assigned to volunteers as they arrive: the first volunteer will be assigned a number&#xD;
      01, the second volunteer - 02, the third - 03, etc.), and appropriate notes will be made in&#xD;
      the Case Report Forms (CRF) and source documentation.&#xD;
