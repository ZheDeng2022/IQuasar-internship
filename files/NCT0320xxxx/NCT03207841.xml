  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are living to ages when metabolic disorders are&#xD;
      highly prevalent. The combination of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance can&#xD;
      disrupt lipid metabolism and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and&#xD;
      contribute to an accelerated aging process in the SCI population. Feasible interventions to&#xD;
      improve metabolic function in the chronic SCI are in great demand. Compared to pharmacologic&#xD;
      therapies, dietary modification is a more cost-effective treatment option for reducing the&#xD;
      risk of metabolic dysfunction that, surprisingly, has not been rigorously investigated in&#xD;
      people with SCI. Therefore, in the present study the investigators will investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of an 8-week, eucaloric (a meal plan designed specifically to provide the exact&#xD;
      amount of calories needed to maintain a given body weight) LC-HP dietary intervention for&#xD;
      improving metabolic function, body composition, gut bacteria composition and quality of life&#xD;
      in individuals with SCI and impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. The investigators&#xD;
      also aim to determine the association between changes in the composition of gut bacteria and&#xD;
      improvements in metabolic function and the association between improvements in metabolic&#xD;
      function and improvements in quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are living to ages when metabolic disorders are&#xD;
      highly prevalent. Due to the loss of mobility and severe skeletal muscle atrophy in&#xD;
      individuals with SCI, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and peripheral insulin resistance&#xD;
      develop after injury . The combination of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance&#xD;
      can disrupt lipid metabolism and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes,&#xD;
      and contribute to an accelerated aging process in the SCI population. Because of these&#xD;
      trends, the overall burden of health complications and their economic impact has increased&#xD;
      for individuals with SCI, often leading to a progressive decrease in their long-term quality&#xD;
      of life. Feasible interventions to improve metabolic function (i.e. the way the body&#xD;
      processes proteins, carbohydrates, and fats in foods) in those with chronic SCI are in great&#xD;
      demand. Given that metabolic disorders severely compromise health outcomes and important&#xD;
      domains of quality of life, including participation in daily life and community living and&#xD;
      employment outcomes, targeted strategies to combat these morbidities are of paramount&#xD;
      importance. Compared to pharmacologic therapies, dietary modification is a more&#xD;
      cost-effective treatment option for reducing the risk of metabolic dysfunction that,&#xD;
      surprisingly, has not been rigorously investigated in people with SCI. Much like the general&#xD;
      U.S. population, individuals with SCI consume far more fat and carbohydrate than recommended&#xD;
      levels. High fat, high carbohydrate diets (western diet) have been associated with a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity and metabolic disease as well as negative adaptations in the diversity&#xD;
      of gut bacteria (increased levels of harmful bacteria and reduced levels of beneficial&#xD;
      bacteria) that usually precedes the development of diabetes or insulin resistance. Therefore,&#xD;
      macronutrient (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) modification may be able to prevent or correct&#xD;
      the impaired metabolic state in persons with SCI. Diets composed of relatively high protein&#xD;
      and low carbohydrate have been shown to improve body composition (i.e., reduce body fat while&#xD;
      maintaining lean tissue) and metabolic profiles (i.e., increase in insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      glucose tolerance) in diabetic, able bodied individuals who are obese or overweight. This&#xD;
      improvement is thought to be due to protein's: (i) effect on the sensation of feeling full&#xD;
      after eating food despite similar or lower energy intake; (ii) contribution to storage of&#xD;
      fat-free mass; and (iii) insulin sensitizing effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' pilot work supports this hypothesis in that we showed that 8 weeks of a&#xD;
      low carbohydrate/high-protein (LC-HP) diet significantly improved whole body insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity (WBIS) and glucose tolerance and decreased the amount of intra-abdominal fat in&#xD;
      six men with SCI and with either untreated type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance&#xD;
      (pre-diabetes). In addition to significant improvements in metabolic health, our pilot work&#xD;
      also successfully demonstrated the safety and feasibility of our approach. The lack of&#xD;
      adverse effects and the improvement in glucose control and insulin sensitivity in our study&#xD;
      participants with SCI prompted us to propose the current study involving both men and women&#xD;
      in order to determine the effects of the dietary protocol to treat type 2 diabetes or&#xD;
      impaired glucose tolerance in persons with chronic SCI. Thus, the investigators propose an&#xD;
      investigation to determine if 8 weeks of an LC/HP dietary intervention induces the&#xD;
      physiological adaptations necessary to improve metabolic function and body composition and&#xD;
      alter the diversity of gut bacteria in a large cohort of individuals with SCI. The ultimate&#xD;
      outcome of this project will be an effective diet program which can be easily and&#xD;
      economically implemented at home as a non-pharmacological means of achieving blood glucose&#xD;
      control for people with SCI and impaired glucose tolerance or untreated type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention group will receive 8 weeks of LC/HP diet. The daily LC-HP dietary intervention will include ~30% total energy as protein (1.6 g/kg per day) with a carbohydrate-to-protein ratio &lt;1.5 and fat intake set at ~30% of the total energy intake. Dietary fat sources will focus on monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, e.g., plant oils and nuts; dietary carbohydrate sources will emphasize whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes; and dietary protein sources will include lean meats, fish, chicken, eggs, and nonfat dairy foods, e.g., fat-free milk and low-fat cheese, consistent with American Diabetes Association and Institute of Medicine guidelines. All LC-HP meals will be provided by UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCTS) Bionutrition Unit and delivered to participants' homes 3 times/week (a sample menu is included in Appendix J). Every delivery will include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks for 2 to 3 days.</description>

    <description>Control group will not receive the experimental diet and will continue with their usual diets. Participants will complete three 24-hour food recalls (on 2 week days and one day in the weekend) three times (at weeks 1, 4 and 8) during the course of the study to gather dietary information including dietary intake and/or particular aspects of the diet. Participants will be asked to recall foods and beverages they consumed in the 24 hours prior to the interview. Three 24-hour food recalls appear optimal for estimating energy intake.</description>
