  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of deferasirox film coated&#xD;
      tablet (FCT) versus phlebotomy for the management of iron overload in adults with HH at risk&#xD;
      of iron-related morbidity. This evaluation will provide information on the two treatment&#xD;
      options in terms of the rate of response of proportion of patients reaching the study target&#xD;
      SF ≤ 100 μg/L and their associated safety profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to exploring the safety and efficacy of deferasirox FCT in hereditary&#xD;
      hemochromatosis (HH), this study is being conducted to fulfill an FDA post-marketing&#xD;
      requirement [PMC 750-10 (Exjade) /PMR 2888-8 (Jadenu)] to provide additional randomized data&#xD;
      to confirm the ocular safety profile of deferasirox through detailed ocular assessments in&#xD;
      patients treated with deferasirox FCT for 2 years.&#xD;
