    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-arm study designed to evaluate the tolerability of direct&#xD;
      peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) in neonates with gastroschisis. The experimental arm (DPR&#xD;
      group) will receive adjuvant DPR with standard treatment for gastroschisis (staged silo&#xD;
      closure). The control arm (SoC group) will receive standard treatment for gastroschisis&#xD;
      without DPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Team will prospectively enroll all neonates with the diagnosis of gastroschisis&#xD;
      presenting to ACH within 12 hours after birth for whom consent is signed by the&#xD;
      parent(s)/legally authorized representative (LAR). The Research Team anticipates enrolling 40&#xD;
      subjects at Arkansas Children's Hospital. All subjects that have their abdominal wall defect&#xD;
      closed will be defined as having completed active participation in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroschisis is a clinical condition characterized by a defect in the normal development of&#xD;
      the abdominal wall. The defect is present to the right of the umbilicus leading to in utero&#xD;
      bowel evisceration and exposure to amniotic fluid. After birth and prior to operation, the&#xD;
      usual treatment consists of covering the bowel with an impermeable plastic bag to prevent&#xD;
      additional fluid losses and bowel desiccation. Subsequent operative intervention occurs&#xD;
      either in the operating room or in the neonatal intensive care unit. Two surgical options&#xD;
      include primary closure of the abdomen or placement of a silastic silo followed by subsequent&#xD;
      closure several days later as a staged procedure. The main reason the abdominal wall is not&#xD;
      closed initially is due to fear of abdominal compartment syndrome, a condition caused by high&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressures leading to respiratory and circulatory compromise. The key points&#xD;
      of the initial surgery involve examining the intestine for any signs of atresia, bowel&#xD;
      compromise, and either placement of the bowels back into the abdomen or a spring-loaded silo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) has one of the highest rates of gastroschisis patients in&#xD;
      the country and therefore has extensive experience managing these patients. It is not&#xD;
      currently known why ACH has one of the highest rates of gastroschisis, but it has been&#xD;
      postulated it may be due to some factor more common in low socioeconomic status population.&#xD;
      ACH is the only pediatric hospital in the state of Arkansas. Quarterly, reviews of the&#xD;
      Children's Hospital National Database (CHND) are performed to track the institutions progress&#xD;
      in comparison to national trends. ACH's current surgical practice is to place nearly all&#xD;
      patients in a silastic silo for staged reduction. Rarely are patients with gastroschisis&#xD;
      treated with primary surgical closure at ACH. Serial reductions are performed and once the&#xD;
      abdominal contents are at the level of the fascia the abdomen is closed in the operating&#xD;
      room. Previous data indicates an average of five days from birth for final reduction and&#xD;
      closure. After closure, there can be significant intestinal dysmotility with a prolonged&#xD;
      ileus and a delayed return of bowel function. Generally, those with uncomplicated&#xD;
      gastroschisis spend approximately 26 days in the neonatal intensive care unit before&#xD;
      discharge home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From historical CHND data, it is known that patients with simple gastroschisis have an&#xD;
      average length of stay of 29 days, average of 5 days until abdominal wall closure, average of&#xD;
      7 days until start of enteral feeding after abdominal wall closure and average of 10 days&#xD;
      until meeting 100 kcal per kg per day enteral feeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct Peritoneal Resuscitation The University of Louisville has been at the forefront of&#xD;
      research for Direct Peritoneal Resuscitation (DPR). This technique uses clinically available&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis solution instilled into the abdomen with an initial bolus of 500 mL&#xD;
      followed by a rate of 1.5 mL/kg/h in adults undergoing closure of the abdominal wall after&#xD;
      traumatic injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned lab has also studied DPR in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock. The model&#xD;
      has shown decreased mortality and increased intestinal and liver blood flow [2-5]. The group&#xD;
      further investigated the use of DPR in a rat model of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) and&#xD;
      discovered that 1.5% and 2.5% peritoneal dialysis solutions used as DPR improved intestinal&#xD;
      blood flow, and with the 1.5% solution, there was less hyperglycemia than in the group&#xD;
      treated with the 2.5% solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPR has also been studied in the treatment of severely injured trauma patients and has shown&#xD;
      a decrease in days until closure with improved outcomes. A randomized controlled study of 103&#xD;
      subjects requiring damage control surgery, i.e. open abdominal cavities, found that&#xD;
      peritoneal resuscitation reduced the time to definitive abdominal closure, reduced&#xD;
      intra-abdominal infections and reduced mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure of the abdominal viscera and its placement in a silo puts the neonate in a&#xD;
      metabolically stressed state. Using DPR has been shown to counteract the systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response, leading to dilation of arterioles in the intestine resulting in&#xD;
      reduced organ ischemia and cellular hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several case series have demonstrated safety of peritoneal dialysis in infants with recent&#xD;
      abdominal surgery and intestinal perforation. In pediatric patients, peritoneal resuscitation&#xD;
      has been used in two infants with perforated NEC who were too unstable to undergo laparotomy.&#xD;
      Both survived and went on to undergo laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient with gastroschisis is considered as an equivalent to the general surgery patient&#xD;
      with the open abdomen and that adjunctive DPR treatment may be able to accelerate abdominal&#xD;
      closure and improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the DPR group will have a more benign hospital course as measured by&#xD;
      time to full enteral feeds of 100 kcal/kg/day. Time to abdominal wall closure, time on TPN,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay and intestinal motility post-closure using bedside ultrasounds will&#xD;
      also be assessed. Secondly, it is hypothesized that there will be no deleterious effects&#xD;
      related to introducing the peritoneal dialysis solution into the silo.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to Hospital Discharge (average 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate that subjects treated with DPR will have a more benign hospital course as measured by time to full enteral feeds. The primary outcome measure will be time to full feeds of 100 kcal/kg/day.&#xD;
Tapering of the parenteral nutrition is congruent with the increase in enteral feeding, which is calculated based on the amount of nutrition and calories needed. The combination of parenteral nutrition and enteral feeding will be 100 kcal/kg/day. As the enteral feeding is increased, the TPN will be reduced proportionately. This is assessed once daily on morning rounds by the neonatology team.</description>

    <measure>Time to abdominal wall closure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Serial reductions are performed with silastic silo placement for staged reduction using umbilical tape ties. The silo is assessed daily on morning rounds by the surgical team. Once the abdominal contents are at the level of the fascia, the abdomen is closed in the operating room. The average day to closure historically from CHND data is 5 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time on Total Parental Nutrition (TPN)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until Day of Discharge, an average of 29 days</time_frame>
    <description>Enteral feeding is begun after orogastric (OG) tube output has stopped and a bowel movement has occurred. OG tube output is checked at least every 4 hours (± 30 minutes) and/or before each feeding per NICU standard practice. Initiation of feeds is a clinical decision based on decreased gastric tube output, abdominal x-rays, and passing of stool. The initiation of enteral feeds is assessed daily on morning rounds by the neonatology team. Feedings start at an average of 7 days following abdominal wall closure. The advancement of enteral feeds will be based on standard practice at ACH. Most feedings are started every six hours and advanced to every three hours as tolerated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to intestinal motility</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks post-closure</time_frame>
    <description>To assess motility, the investigators will identify all distinct bowel loops visualized in the video clips and count movements in each of the bowel loops identified in the clip to determine a motility count for each quadrant. Videos will be classified as poor, fair or good. Motility will be quantified as the total number of distinct peristaltic movements visualized in each abdominal quadrant over 30 seconds. Cumulative motility (CM) will be calculated as the sum of motility from all four abdominal quadrants. Mean motility (MM) will be calculated as the mean number of distinct peristaltic movements per patient on each day of life imaged. A global descriptive score of bowel activity will also be assigned for each quadrant with the following categories: no, low, normal, or hyperactive peristalsis.</description>

    <description>Strict intake and output will be monitored every 6 hours for 48 hours after the maximum dialysate infusion volume has been reached, then every 12 hours.&#xD;
The amount of IVFs is dependent on the subject's weight and calculated based on the volume of enteral feeds required to meet the subject's caloric needs. This is assessed daily on morning rounds by the neonatology team. IVF management changes will be made when clinically indicated by the neonatologists and guided by the subject's laboratory values. The current practice is not to replace the fluid lost during silo placement due to bowel edema often seen in these patients; thus, no additional changes are planned for the management of IVFs or nutrition during the intervention. The amount of dialysate fluid given will be documented in the medical record; it will dwell for 1 hour and then any remaining fluid will be removed.</description>

    <description>Serial reductions will be performed with silastic silo placement for staged reduction with adjuvant direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR). A JP drain will be securely placed through the top of the silo beneath the fascia at the base of the small bowel mesentery for instillation of dialysate fluid and aspiration of peritoneal fluid. The sterile syringe will then be connected to the JP drain. The dialysate fluid administered via JP drain as a bolus infusion every 6 hours until the abdominal wall is closed (generally 3-5 days), but not to exceed 7 days maximum. Fluid will be warmed at bedside using dry heat not to exceed 37°C/98°F. The initial bolus infusion will be 10 mL/kg of dialysate. If tolerated, each subsequent infusion will be increased by 10 mL/kg up to a goal infusion of 40 mL/kg (to a maximum volume of 100 mL) as tolerated. Dialysate will dwell for 1 hour after instillation of fluid. Any excess fluid will then be removed via JP drain.</description>
