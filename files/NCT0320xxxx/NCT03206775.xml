    <textblock>
      Phase 1: This is a remote observational study in which participants will complete cognitive&#xD;
      assessments developed by Posit Science. Participants will be healthy controls aged 18-65 with&#xD;
      reliable internet access and a device that they can use to access the assessments, such as a&#xD;
      laptop or iPad. Participants will complete up to 6 Posit Science assessments in different&#xD;
      domains of cognition, which should last approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: This is an in person observational study in which participants will complete&#xD;
      cognitive assessments developed by Posit Science. Participants will be healthy controls aged&#xD;
      18-80 who are fluent in English. Participants will complete batteries of cognitive&#xD;
      assessments developed by Posit Science, which include combinations of visual, auditory, and&#xD;
      social cognitive assessments, and self-report questionnaires. This study will be conducted at&#xD;
      the Driven to Discover building at the Minnesota State Fair. Participation will last&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Participants in Phase 3 will complete a Posit Science assessment battery and&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires. Each participant will be asked to provide brief demographic and&#xD;
      medical history data. Participants will be aged 18-35 and will be students at the University&#xD;
      of Minnesota who are enrolled in the Research Experience Points program. Participants will&#xD;
      complete the assessment battery remotely; the battery will take approximately 45-60 minutes&#xD;
      to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: This is a pilot program to test the use of remote cognitive assessment and training&#xD;
      in adolescents with an anxiety diagnosis and healthy controls. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      short assessment battery, then will receive 4 hours of cognitive training over 2 weeks at&#xD;
      home. Then they will repeat the battery. Total participation should last approximately 5&#xD;
      hours over 2-3 weeks and will be completed entirely remotely.&#xD;

      Phase 1: Remote Assessment with Old Battery (Enrollment period: June-August 2017. CLOSED TO&#xD;
      ENROLLMENT) Participants who have successfully completed the online consent process may begin&#xD;
      study procedures. A member of the research staff will connect the participant to the Posit&#xD;
      Science battery remotely using their laptop or iPad through the BrainHQ portal. All Posit&#xD;
      Science assessments have a brief training section before the assessment begins. Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to be in a quiet place free of distractions where they can turn up the&#xD;
      volume on their device or use headphones to complete the auditory portions of the assessment.&#xD;
      The battery will consist of 6 exercises and will last approximately 20 minutes, which will be&#xD;
      completed in a single sitting. Data to be captured will include response time, accuracy, and&#xD;
      time to complete the assessment. These data will be stored confidentially within the Posit&#xD;
      Science servers and will later be downloaded onto an external device for data analysis and&#xD;
      interpretation. Once participants have completed the batter, a member of the study staff will&#xD;
      send their compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Minnesota State Fair (Enrollment period: 2017-2022) Participants who have&#xD;
      successfully completed the consent process may begin study procedures. A member of the&#xD;
      research staff will connect the participant to the REDCap self-report surveys on an iPad. The&#xD;
      surveys will be contained within a directory listed under the participant's unique study&#xD;
      identifier and will not contain any personally identifying information. The first survey will&#xD;
      collect demographic information such as age, gender, ethnicity/race, zip code of residence,&#xD;
      education level, current medications, and personal and familial psychiatric and neurological&#xD;
      history. This information will be collected in a self-report survey form to avoid&#xD;
      embarrassment or stigma that could result if the participant was overheard answering these&#xD;
      questions. After completing the demographic survey and brief medical history, all&#xD;
      participants will complete self report questionnaires. The self-report assessments should&#xD;
      take approximately 2 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the self-report items, the participant will be automatically&#xD;
      redirected to the cognitive battery to which they have been randomized. They will be asked to&#xD;
      log in to the BrainHQ portal using the same email address they provided before. They will be&#xD;
      prompted for their name; study staff will instruct participants to enter &quot;State&quot; for their&#xD;
      first name and &quot;Fair&quot; for their last name. However, study staff will not directly oversee&#xD;
      participants while they create their account, and so some may not follow these instructions&#xD;
      and may disclose their full name to Posit Science. All Posit Science assessments have a brief&#xD;
      training section before the assessment begins. If the participant is still having trouble&#xD;
      understanding the assessment, study staff will be available to help explain the tasks.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with over-the-ear headphones with disposable sanitary pads for&#xD;
      auditory components. Each battery will consist of 4-6 Posit Science assessments, which last&#xD;
      approximately 2-3 minutes each. The cognitive battery should last approximately 12-15&#xD;
      minutes. Data to be captured will include response time, accuracy, and time to complete the&#xD;
      assessment. These data will be stored confidentially within the Posit Science servers and&#xD;
      will later be downloaded onto an AHC managed device for analysis and interpretation. When&#xD;
      downloaded to the AHC server, they will be de-identified and collated using a unique&#xD;
      participant ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the cognitive assessment battery, participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      short feasibility survey on REDCap which will ask them their opinion of the tasks they&#xD;
      completed and how likely they would be to use these kinds of programs. This survey should&#xD;
      take approximately 1-2 minutes. Then participants will receive their compensation and their&#xD;
      participation will be complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Research Experience Program (REP) Project (Enrollment period: Spring 2018; future&#xD;
      enrollment planned) Adult students at the University of Minnesota who are enrolled in the&#xD;
      Research Experience Points (REP) program may enroll in this study to be awarded points for&#xD;
      class credit. We will request that participants complete the study in a quiet environment&#xD;
      free of distractions with a reliable internet connection, and that they do not participate if&#xD;
      they have consumed alcohol or illicit substances in the last 8 hours/are under the influence&#xD;
      of illicit substances. We will also recommend the use of over-the-ear headphones for the&#xD;
      study. Participants will complete an online consent form independently, though they may&#xD;
      contact research staff at any time if they have questions. After completing the consent form,&#xD;
      participants will be redirected to the COMPAS self-report measures. After the assessment&#xD;
      suite is complete, the participants will be automatically re-directed to the Posit Science&#xD;
      website to complete the assessment battery. Total participation should take approximately&#xD;
      45-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Pilot Adolescent Cognitive Training (Enrollment period: Summer 2018. CLOSED TO&#xD;
      ENROLLMENT) We will recruit adolescents without a mental health diagnosis and with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of anxiety by using the UMP Psychiatry Clinic recruitment registry, contacting&#xD;
      previous research participants, by advertising in the community and online (Facebook and&#xD;
      Department website). Parents/guardians will be asked to provide a brief demographic and&#xD;
      medical history about their child. If the participant is over 18, they may complete this&#xD;
      independently, but are instructed that they can work with their parent or guardian if they&#xD;
      choose to do so. The adolescent will then complete the assessment battery, 4 hours of BrainHQ&#xD;
      training games over 2 weeks, and repeat the assessment battery. Total participation should&#xD;
      last approximate 5 hours and will be completed entirely remotely. Participants will receive&#xD;
      their compensation via email, using the same account that was used for sending the link to&#xD;
      the battery&#xD;
