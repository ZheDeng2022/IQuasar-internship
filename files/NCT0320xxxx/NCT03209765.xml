  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that there are about 1.4 million patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      worldwide, with a rising trend in CRC incidence in many Asian Pacific countries. In Hong&#xD;
      Kong, colorectal cancer ranks first in cancer incidence and second in cancer mortality based&#xD;
      on data from 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent guidelines from USA, Europe and Asia Pacific region recommend CRC screening for&#xD;
      average-risk asymptomatic individuals starting at age 50. Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT),&#xD;
      is one of the recommendation as first-line modality for CRC screening. Since yearly testing&#xD;
      is recommended to maintain programmatic effectiveness longitudinal adherence is a critical&#xD;
      component of FOBT-based screening programs. Our previous study conducted in Hong Kong showed&#xD;
      that the rate of compliance with CRC screening was declining since the first year of&#xD;
      enrolment8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, social media (SM) has become an increasingly popular source of health&#xD;
      information. By providing an easily accessible and interactive channel of communication&#xD;
      between reviewers and information providers, it has potential values for affecting public&#xD;
      health. However, the effects of SM on the compliance of CRC screening by FIT has not yet been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WhatsApp Messenger, is the most popular social media messaging app worldwide. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled study will investigate the effect of WhatsApp vs no reminder on the compliance of&#xD;
      CRC screening by FIT.&#xD;

      between reviewers and information providers, it has potential values for affecting public&#xD;
      health. However, the effects of SM on the compliance of CRC screening by FIT has not yet been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WhatsApp Messenger, is the most popular social media messaging app worldwide. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled study will investigate the effect of WhatsApp vs no reminder on the compliance of&#xD;
      CRC screening by FIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be recruited from the existing cohort of screening participants who joined&#xD;
      the bowel cancer screening programme in the CUHK JC Bowel Cancer Education Centre in 2016&#xD;
      with FOBT negative in the first round of screening, and who are expected to follow-up and&#xD;
      return to the centre in 2017 for their second round of FOBT screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study subjects will be offered either an interactive WhatsApp reminder to return to the&#xD;
      centre for taking faecal tubes for screening; or usual care, where no additional intervention&#xD;
      will be offered. A simple random sampling process will be administered using&#xD;
      computer-generated numbers so that each participant will have a 50% probability for&#xD;
      assignment into each group. All potential participants identified who are eligible for the&#xD;
      study will be randomized by a computer randomizer, which will give a number indicating the&#xD;
      group assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of interest included the proportion of subjects who return to the centre and&#xD;
      retrieve faecal tubes for screening 30 days within the scheduled time for the second year of&#xD;
      the screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the long-term effect of WhatsApp reminder on FIT compliance, all subjects in&#xD;
      this study (except those died or had positive FIT result) will be called in the first quarter&#xD;
      of 2019 and offered FIT again in a cross-over design in 2019, i.e. 1) patients initially&#xD;
      randomized to WhatsApp reminder group in 2017 will receive no reminder in 2019; and 2) those&#xD;
      randomized to no reminder group in 2017 will receive WhatsApp reminder in 2019.. The FIT&#xD;
      pickup and return rate and reason of default will be recorded again.&#xD;
