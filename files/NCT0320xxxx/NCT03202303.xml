      There is a clear unmet need for new therapeutics to treat irritability in children with ASD&#xD;
      that do not have the metabolic and weight adverse event profiles of the currently approved&#xD;
      treatments. Cannabidivarin (CBDV) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid and a safe variant of&#xD;
      Cannabidiol (CBD). It has no appreciable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [less than 0.01%], has&#xD;
      been shown to have no impact on weight or metabolism, and improves both social and cognitive&#xD;
      functioning in animal models of idiopathic and syndromal autism (Fragile X, Rett Syndrome,&#xD;
      Angelman Syndrome). The CDC currently estimates 1 in 59 children have ASD. ASD is&#xD;
      characterized by deficits in social communication, irritability, repetitive behaviors,&#xD;
      impulsivity, temper tantrums, and high caregiver burden. Currently, the only FDA-approved&#xD;
      medications for symptoms of ASD are aripiprazole and risperidone, both of which are indicated&#xD;
      for irritability in pediatric ASD. These medications are effective but are associated with&#xD;
      considerable side effects with long term treatment in this chronic developmental disorder,&#xD;
      including weight gain, metabolic syndrome and the risk of type 2 diabetes, prolactin&#xD;
      elevation and growth of breast tissue, extrapyramidal symptoms and the risk of tardive&#xD;
      dyskinesia. The anticonvulsant divalproex sodium (valproate/VPA) also significantly reduces&#xD;
      irritability and repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD. Although VPA is efficacious&#xD;
      for pediatric epilepsy and some symptoms of ASD, it also has significant side effects,&#xD;
      including weight gain, sedation and nausea. CBDV, like VPA, is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      pediatric epilepsy, and ASD mouse models demonstrate potential mechanisms for treatment with&#xD;
      CBDV, including potential therapeutic effects on repetitive behaviors, irritability,&#xD;
      sociability, and quality of life, and the capacity to reduce inflammation. This study aims to&#xD;
      examine the efficacy and safety of cannabidivarin (CBDV) with a primary aim of studying its&#xD;
      effect on irritability in children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind study of CBDV vs. placebo in 100&#xD;
      child and adolescent subjects aged 5 to 18 years with a diagnosis of ASD.&#xD;

             and/or give verbal assent.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Prior chronic treatment with CBD, CBDV or an endocannabinoid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Positive testing for THC or other drugs of abuse via urine testing at the screening&#xD;
             visit or baseline visits upon repeat confirmation testing.&#xD;

             schizophrenia, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Major Depressive Disorder&#xD;
             (MDD). These patients will be excluded due to potential confounding results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A medical condition that severely impacts the subject's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study, interferes with the conduct of the study, confounds interpretation of study&#xD;
             results or endangers the subject's well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A known diagnosis of Rett Syndrome or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, or marked&#xD;
             sensory impairment such as deafness or blindness.&#xD;

             systolic blood pressure at screening. If the initial screening ECG show a QTcB of&#xD;
             greater than 460 msec, then 2 additional ECGs will be conducted in the same sitting, 5&#xD;
             minutes apart. If not recognized at screening, then a full triplicate repeat showing&#xD;
             an average QTcB of 460 msec or less to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Female&#xD;
             subjects who are pregnant will be excluded from the study. If a female subject is able&#xD;
             to become pregnant, she will be given a serum pregnancy test before entry into the&#xD;
             study. Female subjects will be informed not to become pregnant while taking CBDV.&#xD;
             Female subjects must tell the investigator and consult an obstetrician or&#xD;
             maternal-fetal specialist if they become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
