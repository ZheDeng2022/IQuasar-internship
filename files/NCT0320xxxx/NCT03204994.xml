      This study aims to assess the lymphatic drainage of rectal tumours by using ICG as a&#xD;
      fluorescent non-specific marker. As a feasibility study, it will also assess its technique&#xD;
      and timing along with its ability to assist in removing lymph nodes when it is clinically&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;

      Current surgical treatment for rectal cancer includes total mesorectal excision (TME) which&#xD;
      involves excision of the rectum in its encompassing fat including the lymph nodes. Rectal&#xD;
      cancer can spread to lymph nodes locally inside the TME 'package' and the lateral pelvic&#xD;
      lymph nodes. The TME must be fully excised to ensure that the circumferential resection&#xD;
      margin (CRM) is disease free or negative. Despite advancing surgical techniques, a positive&#xD;
      margin can occur in around 9% of patients with accurate pre-operative magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI), increasing the risk of local recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of lateral pelvic lymph node involvement has been reported between 10-25%. It is&#xD;
      thought that lower rectal tumours are more likely to spread to the lateral pelvic nodes. In&#xD;
      the far East, LPLN dissection is often added to the TME procedure. Formal LPLND is not&#xD;
      utilised in Europe due to operative risks including damage to pelvic nerves, greater blood&#xD;
      loss and prolonged operating time. Instead, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is utilised&#xD;
      to 'sterilise' the lymph nodes. Although a retrospective analysis suggested that LPLN&#xD;
      dissection is equivalent to preoperative CRT for preventing local recurrence, there has been&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that positive LPLNs after CRT decrease cancer specific survival and&#xD;
      relapse free survival. This would suggest that there may be a cohort of patients that would&#xD;
      benefit from some form of LPLN dissection, although it is not certain what characteristics of&#xD;
      tumours are more likely to metastasise to the LPLNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prostatectomies, where pelvic lymph node dissection is a standard part of the procedure,&#xD;
      there has been investigation into fluorescence guided lymph node mapping. Yuen et al utilised&#xD;
      ICG guided node mapping in open prostatectomy. In their study, all lymph nodes identified by&#xD;
      fluorescence were found to have metastases on pathology whereas non-fluorescent nodes were&#xD;
      free from disease. A smaller, retrospective study comparing fluorescence guided lymph node&#xD;
      dissection with standard lymph node dissection showed higher sensitivity and specificity in&#xD;
      the fluorescence guided technique. Similar results were seen in an early, robotic&#xD;
      prostatectomy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG has been used to map pelvic lymph nodes in colorectal cancer, with the first reported&#xD;
      cases being published in 2010. ICG was injected to the tumour base in 25 open rectal&#xD;
      resections. A wide field camera is useful for fluorescence in open surgery, however, as most&#xD;
      rectal cancer cases are performed using a minimally invasive approach a laparoscopic method&#xD;
      is needed. Ishizuka et al used a similar method in low rectal cancers to identify drainage in&#xD;
      three different sets of lymph nodes. In 2015, a study of 5 patients using ICG node mapping&#xD;
      with the same laparoscopic equipment to be used in this study demonstrated fluorescence in&#xD;
      all 5 patients. Both studies 'berry picked' the fluorescing lymph nodes. In the 2010 study,&#xD;
      23 out of 25 patients had fluorescing lymph nodes. In the 2 non-fluorescing nodes LPLD was&#xD;
      performed and no diseased nodes were identified. In these studies, they did not observe what&#xD;
      types of tumours drain to the LPLDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG, when injected intravenously, rapidly binds to plasma proteins and is exclusively&#xD;
      excreted into bile by the liver. It is known to be well tolerated but there have been&#xD;
      reported cases of urticaria and anaphylaxis. Risk of anaphylaxis is 1 in 10,000 and if occurs&#xD;
      can be treated using a standard protocol. ICG contains sodium iodide and therefore should be&#xD;
      avoided in patients with known allergy to iodides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the lymphatic drainage of rectal tumours by using ICG as a&#xD;
      fluorescent non-specific marker. As a feasibility study, it will also assess its technique&#xD;
      and timing along with its ability to assist in removing lymph nodes when it is clinically&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
