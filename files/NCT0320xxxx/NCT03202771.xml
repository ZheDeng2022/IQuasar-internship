      Test the Efficacy of Home Biofeedback Training: Currently, biofeedback requires a skilled&#xD;
      therapist and sophisticated equipment and is not widely available. The investigators designed&#xD;
      and tested a novel home biofeedback device and predict that home training will be as&#xD;
      effective as office biofeedback therapy. Our specific aims are to perform a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of 100 subjects with dyssynergic defecation to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) Whether a self-administered, home-biofeedback training program with a new portable device&#xD;
      is as effective as office-based biofeedback therapy in improving i) physiology- dyssynergia&#xD;
      (defecation index), and ability to expel simulated stool, and ii) symptomatology-&#xD;
      satisfaction with bowel function, number of complete spontaneous bowel movements, stool&#xD;
      consistency, straining and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B) Whether home-training is more cost-effective than office-based biofeedback training.&#xD;

      Study Protocol: Patients will be randomized to receive either office-based biofeedback&#xD;
      therapy or home-based biofeedback training, in addition to the standard treatment described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedures: The permuted blocks method will randomize patients for all study&#xD;
      aims; this ensures approximate balance among the two treatment arms, while making it unlikely&#xD;
      that investigators will predict the next treatment assignment. The study statistician will&#xD;
      prepare sequentially numbered sealed envelopes containing the treatment assignment. Thus the&#xD;
      next treatment assignment cannot be read without opening the envelope. If a patient is deemed&#xD;
      eligible, and agrees to participate, after signing the informed consent, the investigator&#xD;
      will open the next envelope to determine the treatment assigned to that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Treatment: The patient will be seen by one of the gastroenterologists and receive&#xD;
      instructions regarding their problem and advice on exercises, timed toilet training,&#xD;
      laxatives, diet and fluid intake. Written materials will be given to each patient and the&#xD;
      study coordinator will reinforce the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timed-toilet training: This consists of educating the patient regarding the anatomy and&#xD;
      physiology of the pelvic floor and diaphragmatic breathing technique. They will be advised to&#xD;
      attempt a bowel movement twice a day, 30 minutes after meals and strain for five minutes and&#xD;
      push at a level of 5-7/10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laxatives: Patients will be asked to use 500 mg magnesium gluconate, 2-3 tablets/day or Milk&#xD;
      of Magnesia 1-3 tablespoons daily. If intolerant, they will be advised to use bisacodyl (1-2&#xD;
      daily) or sennokot (1-2 daily), but to titrate the dose. Patients will be asked to refrain&#xD;
      from using digital maneuvers and enemas. Rescue medications will include bisacodyl&#xD;
      suppositories (no BM for 48 hrs) or enema (no BM for 72 hours). If bowel movement is regular&#xD;
      i.e. soft stool &gt;3/week, they will be asked to reduce the laxative dose by 1/3rd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet: Based on a three-day prospective food diary, patients will get advice by the GCRC&#xD;
      dietician. The recommendations will include the advice to eat 5 servings of fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables per day, and 25 g dietary fiber from natural foods, and consume ~30% of calories&#xD;
      from fat. Three-day food records, obtained at baseline, and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks, will assess&#xD;
      dietary compliance. Subjects will get a diet report to reinforce adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office Biofeedback (Neuromuscular conditioning) Treatment- The aim of biofeedback will be to&#xD;
      establish a normal pattern of defecation and improve rectal sensation using visual/verbal&#xD;
      biofeedback technique. A monitor screen will provide visual feedback by showing changes in&#xD;
      pressure activity. First patients will be taught abdominal muscle coordination exercise to&#xD;
      improve the pushing effort during defecation. Here, patients are taught how to distend the&#xD;
      abdomen by inhaling slowly and then holding their breath for at least 15 seconds and to&#xD;
      practice this for 20 minutes, twice a day. Thereafter, patients will be asked to attend the&#xD;
      motility laboratory, biweekly for up to 6 training sessions. BT will be performed by a&#xD;
      3-sensor manometry probe. The clothed patient will be seated on a commode in front of a&#xD;
      monitor. The physician/nurse therapist will give verbal feedback by either complimenting the&#xD;
      patient for performing a correct maneuver or rectifying any errors. Each 60 minute treatment&#xD;
      session will comprise of the following maneuvers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recto-Anal Coordination This maneuver's goal is to produce a coordinated movement that&#xD;
      simultaneously increases the intra abdominal (intra rectal) pressure and relaxes the anal&#xD;
      sphincter. First, the patient is educated about their abnormal tracing: A normal pattern is&#xD;
      shown and they are encouraged to reproduce this. The patients' posture and breathing are&#xD;
      continuously monitored and corrected and verbal reinforcement provided. If a patient&#xD;
      consistently demonstrates normal rectoanal coordination, then they are asked to reproduce&#xD;
      this without feedback. Approximately 15 bearing down maneuvers are performed at 1 minute&#xD;
      intervals, some with and some without rectal balloon distention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulated defecation: This is performed by placing a fecom (artificial stool) into the&#xD;
      rectum. The patient is asked to sit on a commode and expel the fecom. Their movements,&#xD;
      posture, and breathing techniques are corrected and feedback is provided. The therapist may&#xD;
      assist the patient's effort by applying gentle traction to the fecom, while reinforcing their&#xD;
      straining technique. The maneuver is repeated twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Improvement: The number of training sessions will be customized for each&#xD;
      patient (maximum 6). Training will be discontinued if a patient demonstrates during two&#xD;
      consecutive training sessions, without feedback a) normal pattern of defecation in at least&#xD;
      50% of attempts, and b) at least 20% improvement in bowel satisfaction (VAS) (64). If these&#xD;
      goals are not achieved, patients will be considered treatment failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Biofeedback Treatment: After getting advice on standard treatment and breathing&#xD;
      exercises, patients will be taught how to use the home-trainer in a single lab session. Then&#xD;
      the investigators will place a reusable, dual sensor, probe into their rectum. The probe is&#xD;
      connected to a hand- held pressure monitor displaying the patient's response (Anatoner,&#xD;
      Protech, Hyderabad, India). Next, the clothed patient will be asked to sit on a commode, and&#xD;
      attempt 15 bearing down maneuvers. When the anal sphincter pressure decreases more lights go&#xD;
      on. If the patient cannot relax then fewer lights go on. Thus, the number of lighted lights&#xD;
      gives instant feedback about their performance. Patients will get a 20-minute tape recording&#xD;
      for home use. Patients will be asked to insert the probe at least twice daily and each time&#xD;
      practice at least 15 bearing down maneuvers; a daily log will be kept. At 4 and 8 weeks, they&#xD;
      will return for follow up. Based on their progress, new targets will be set by adjusting the&#xD;
      device's sensitivity. After 3-months, they will have a colonic transit, anorectal manometry&#xD;
      and fecom expulsion study. Progress will be monitored through bi-weekly phone calls.&#xD;
