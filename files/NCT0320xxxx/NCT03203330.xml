    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase 3 study to determine the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of TG-C in subjects with Kellgren and Lawrence Grade 2 or 3&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis of the Knee, Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) medial&#xD;
      joint space narrowing (JSN) Grade 1 or 2 of the knee joint. TG-C is to be administered by a&#xD;
      single intra-articular injection to the damaged joint area via ultrasound guidance. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 24 months for safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of TG-C in treating symptoms of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee and determining disease modifying effects of TG-C. This study is&#xD;
      intended for the treatment of patients with KL Grade 2 and 3 osteoarthritis and OARSI JSN&#xD;
      Grade 1 and 2. Assessments will be made on both the symptomatic effects of pain (VAS),&#xD;
      function (WOMAC), and Quality of Life (SF-12) as well as the physical effects (JSW, MRI&#xD;
      evaluations of whole knee joint organ tissues and structure) and biochemical biomarkers. This&#xD;
      is a placebo-controlled study, TG-C will be compared to normal saline as a control.&#xD;
      Additionally, this protocol is designed to evaluate the safety of TG-C. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated by observation of the injection site for irritation or other effects, the incidence&#xD;
      and severity of adverse events, and changes in physical examination findings, radiographic&#xD;
      criteria, and laboratory tests. Patients will be followed for 24 months for both safety and&#xD;
      efficacy with annual cancer surveillance questionnaires through 15 years post dosing for&#xD;
      subjects who do not enroll in the Long Term Safety study.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of change from baseline in target knee function using the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index. The WOMAC is a proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. The response to the questions is in the form of a checked box associated with the response; None, Mild, Moderate, Severe and Extreme.</description>

    <measure>Change in Knee Pain as Assessed by VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of change from baseline in target knee pain using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a method for the assessment of the intensity of pain. The VAS is a horizontal line, 100 mm in length and anchored by word descriptors at each end (no pain, very severe pain). The patient marks on the line at the point that represents their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end to the point of the mark. The score ranges from &quot;0&quot; or no pain to &quot;100&quot; very severe pain.</description>
