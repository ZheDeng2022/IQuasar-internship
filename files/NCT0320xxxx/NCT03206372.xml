  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young women have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during hormonale exposure&#xD;
      (estrogen-containing pill or pregnancy). In order to detect women at higher risk of VTE&#xD;
      during hormonal exposure, thrombophilia testing is often performed in order to adapt&#xD;
      contraception methods and/or to increases thromboprophylaxy during pregnancy. However, such&#xD;
      practice is probably not accurate nor discriminent. Indeed, there are evidence that the&#xD;
      impact of the familial history of VTE might be stronger than that of detectable inherited&#xD;
      thrombophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;FIT-H&quot; study is a cross-sectional study comparing the prevalence of previous venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism in first-degree relatives of women (propositi) who had a first episode of&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism in association with hormonal exposure with the prevalence of previous&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism in first-degree relatives of women who did not have venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism during a similar hormonal exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the association between the presence or the absence of&#xD;
      VTE in young women during hormonal exposure and the presence or the absence of a previous&#xD;
      episode of VTE in their first-degree relatives. Secondary objective is to determine the&#xD;
      impact of associated inherited thrombophilia on the risk of VTE in first-degree relatives.&#xD;

      Rational&#xD;
&#xD;
      The annual incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is about 1 to 2/1000 person-years and&#xD;
      mortality is 10% when VTE occurs as pulmonary embolism. VTE is a multifactorial disease&#xD;
      caused by hereditary and acquired risk factors. Among the latter, hormonal exposure in young&#xD;
      women (estrogen-containing pill, pregnancy) remains a major health issue given the frequency&#xD;
      of this condition and the 4 to 5-fold increased risk of VTE in the presence of such exposure.&#xD;
      In practice, inherited thrombophilia screening is often performed with the aim to identify&#xD;
      young women at higher risk for VTE and to avoid estrogen-containing pill or to reinforce&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy. The increased risk of thrombosis in relatives is&#xD;
      incompletely explained by the presence of known thrombophilias, as the risk of thrombosis in&#xD;
      first-degree relatives is increased even if patients do not have a detectable defect.8,9 In a&#xD;
      large cross-sectional study including 2830 first-degree relatives of patients with VTE, we&#xD;
      previously showed that the risk of VTE in the first-degree relatives of patients with a first&#xD;
      VTE is strongly influenced by whether the VTE was provoked or unprovoked, the patient's age&#xD;
      when the VTE occurred, and the number of relatives who have had thrombosis. The risk of VTE&#xD;
      in first-degree relatives is about twice as high if the index case had an unprovoked compared&#xD;
      to a provoked VTE, is about three times as high if the index case had VTE before about 50&#xD;
      years compared to later in life, and at least twice as high if two rather than one family&#xD;
      members have had VTE. The influence of these factors on the risk of VTE in first-degree&#xD;
      relatives was additive, and occurred independently of the presence of factor V Leiden or the&#xD;
      prothrombin 20210A gene in index cases. The underlying hypothesis is that patients who have&#xD;
      unprovoked VTE or at a young age often have undetected hereditary thrombophilias and that&#xD;
      these defects increase the risk of thrombosis in their relatives. However, the number of&#xD;
      included young women in the study was to low to confirm if such familial risk was also&#xD;
      elevated if young women were on hormonal exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, our hypothesis is that the risk of VTE in first-degree relatives of&#xD;
      young women with VTE on hormonal exposure will be higher than that in first-degree relatives&#xD;
      of young women on a similar hormonal exposure without VTE, independently of the presence or&#xD;
      not of a detectable inherited thrombophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: French multicentre prospective cross-sectional case-control study comparing the&#xD;
      prevalence of VTE in first-degree relatives (subjects) of young women with VTE during&#xD;
      hormonal exposure (propositus) with the prevalence of VTE in first-degree relatives&#xD;
      (subjects) of young women without VTE during a similar hormonal exposure (propositus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective: to demonstrate an association between the risk of VTE in young women&#xD;
           on hormonal exposure (estrogen-containing pill or pregnancy) and the presence of e&#xD;
           previous VTE in their first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if this there is an influence of a detectable inherited minor&#xD;
                thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, G20210A prothrombin variant) on the risk of VTE in&#xD;
                first-degree relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if this there is an influence of a detectable inherited major&#xD;
                thrombophilia (protein, S or antithrombin deficiency) on the risk of VTE in&#xD;
                first-degree relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the impact of the clinical characteristics of VTE in their&#xD;
                first-degree relatives (age, dead or alive at the time of inclusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the impact of clinical characteristic of VTE in the propositus (age,&#xD;
                PE vs DVT, severity of VTE, type of hormonal exposure) on the risk of VTE in the&#xD;
                first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main risk factor: the presence of VTE in young women on hormonal exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: the presence of a previous symptomatic VTE in first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cases are first-degree relatives (i.e., parents, siblings, children) of young women who&#xD;
           have VTE during hormonal exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  controls are first-degree relatives (i.e., parents, siblings, children) of young women&#xD;
           who did not have VTE during a similar hormonal exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study subjects are first-degree relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  propositi are young women on hormonal exposure, whether VTE was present of not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hormonal exposure is defined by estrogen-containg pill exposure (ongoing or stopped from&#xD;
           less than 3 months) or pregnancy or post-partum (in the three months following&#xD;
           delivery), in the absence of other provoking risk factors (such as surgery, prolonged&#xD;
           immobilization or trauma of lower limbs in the past three months, or cancer in the past&#xD;
           2 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Propositi with objectively confirmed proximal deep vein thrombosis (i.e. ultrasonography)&#xD;
      or pulmonary embolism (i.e. lung scanning) in women (18 to 50 years) while on hormonal&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cases are first-degree relatives (i.e., parents, siblings, children) of young women (18&#xD;
           to 50 years) who have VTE during hormonal exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  controls are first-degree relatives (i.e., parents, siblings, children) of young women&#xD;
           (18 to 50 years) who did not have VTE during a similar hormonal exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the propositus is willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the&#xD;
           study and to allow at least one of their first-degree relatives to be approached for the&#xD;
           study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First-degree relatives are eligible as study subjects if they are: a biological child,&#xD;
           full sibling or biological parent of an index case; at least 16 years of age; and if&#xD;
           they provided informed consent. * Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  first-degree relative where the propositus had thromboprophylaxis during hormonal&#xD;
           exposure or had VTE in association with other provoking risk factors (surgery, trauma,&#xD;
           prolonged immobilization, cancer, as defined above)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No information can be obtained on first degree family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family member under 16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vulnerable person other than minors aged 16 to 18 (person placed in guardianship,&#xD;
           curatorship)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not affiliated with and not beneficiary of a health insurance scheme. * First-degree&#xD;
           relatives who were dead could be included as study subjects provided the index case&#xD;
           agreed, and information about previous VTE was available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index cases will be enrolled prospectively at six university hospitals in France when they&#xD;
      will be diagnosed with a acute episode of acute symptomatic VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matching criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      First degree relatives &quot;cases&quot; will matched (1:1) with first-degree relatives &quot;controls&quot; via&#xD;
      their propositi characteristics based on the following keys:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age ±2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hormonal exposure (pregnancy or estrogen-containing pill)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tobacco smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous VTE in First-Degree Relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a previously described algorithm, first-degree relatives were classified as &quot;have&#xD;
           had VTE&quot; if they satisfied either of the following two criteria. First, results of&#xD;
           diagnostic testing were available that documented previous deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
           (including thrombosis confined to the distal deep veins) or pulmonary embolism. Second,&#xD;
           they had, in addition to a history of symptoms suggestive of VTE, at least one of the&#xD;
           following: i) a history of having been treated with anticoagulant therapy for at least&#xD;
           two months without another indication; or ii) a current ultrasound examination that&#xD;
           showed that the proximal deep veins were not fully compressible or that there was reflux&#xD;
           in a popliteal vein; or iii) current symptoms and signs suggestive of the&#xD;
           post-thrombotic syndrome (defined as a score ≥5 on the Villalta scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relatives were classified as &quot;have not had VTE&quot; if they satisfied all of the following&#xD;
           criteria: 1) no known or suspected previous diagnosis of VTE; and 2) no unexplained&#xD;
           anticoagulation in the past; and 3) did not currently have symptoms or signs suggestive&#xD;
           of the post thrombotic syndrome (i.e., had a score &lt;5 on the Villalta scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relatives were classified as &quot;uncertain for previous VTE&quot; if they did not satisfy the&#xD;
           criteria for either previous, or no previous, VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factor V Leiden and the Prothrombin 20210A Gene Variant After first-degree relatives had&#xD;
      completed assessments for previous VTE, their index cases will categorized as positive for&#xD;
      factor V Leiden or the prothrombin 20210A gene variant, or negative for both. Personnel who&#xD;
      will be unaware of the propositus family history of VTE, or the subject's past history of&#xD;
      VTE, will perfome these assays in a central laboratory in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethic committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRB was obtain in July, 7th 2017 (CPP méditerranée Sud V). The study is expected to start in&#xD;
      september 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sample size: in our previous work, the prevalence of previous VTE in first-degree&#xD;
           relative of young women with unprovoked (no surgery, no trauma, no immobilization and no&#xD;
           cancer) VTE that occurred before 50 years was 9.5% as compared the 5.5% observed in&#xD;
           first-degree relatives of young women who had VTE before 50 years with one of these&#xD;
           provoking risk factors. For an alpha risk of 5% and a beta risk of 80%, 1000 cases of&#xD;
           200 propositi with VTE and 1000 controls of 2000 propositi without VTE are required;&#xD;
           taking in account the proportion of 10% of first-degree relatives that should be&#xD;
           classified as &quot;uncertain for VTE&quot;, 2200 first degree relatives of 440 propositi are&#xD;
           required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VTE prevalence will compared between cases and controls using a conditional logistic&#xD;
           regression in univariate then in multivariate analysis. A random intercept will be also&#xD;
           introduced to account for the clustering effect within families (intra-family&#xD;
           correlation).&#xD;
