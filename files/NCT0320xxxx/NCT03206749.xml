    <measure>Time-weighted Sum of the Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Between VX-150 Versus Placebo as Recorded on a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) 0 to 24 Hours After the First Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>SPID was calculated as the sum of the product of time (in hours) elapsed since previous measurements and pain intensity difference. Pain intensity difference was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points from the baseline pain intensity scores (using pain rating score range: 0 =no pain to 10 =worst possible pain). SPID24 was calculated from 0 to 24 hours and the score range was -240 (worst score) to 240 (best score).</description>

    <description>SPID was calculated as the sum of the product of time (in hours) elapsed since previous measurements and pain intensity difference.

    <time_frame>0 to 48 hours after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>SPID was calculated as the sum of the product of time (in hours) elapsed since previous measurements and pain intensity difference.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Using Rescue Medication After the First Dose VX-150 Versus Placebo</measure>

    <measure>Total Rescue Medication Used After the First Dose of VX-150 Versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours after the first dose and 24 to 48 hours after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Total use of rescue medication was calculated as the sum of number of capsules multiplied by capsule strength at each dosing occasion of rescue medication. Rescue medication was ibuprofen (400 mg [oral] every 4 hours (q4h) as needed).</description>

        <title>Time-weighted Sum of the Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Between VX-150 Versus Placebo as Recorded on a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) 0 to 24 Hours After the First Dose</title>
        <description>SPID was calculated as the sum of the product of time (in hours) elapsed since previous measurements and pain intensity difference. Pain intensity difference was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points from the baseline pain intensity scores (using pain rating score range: 0 =no pain to 10 =worst possible pain). SPID24 was calculated from 0 to 24 hours and the score range was -240 (worst score) to 240 (best score).</description>

          <title>Time-weighted Sum of the Pain Intensity Difference Between VX-150 Versus Placebo as Recorded on a NPRS 0 to 48 Hours After the First Dose</title>
          <description>SPID was calculated as the sum of the product of time (in hours) elapsed since previous measurements and pain intensity difference. Pain intensity difference was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points from the baseline pain intensity scores (using pain rating score range: 0 =no pain to 10 =worst possible pain). SPID48 was calculated from 0 to 48 hours and the score range was -480 (worst score) to 480 (best score).</description>
