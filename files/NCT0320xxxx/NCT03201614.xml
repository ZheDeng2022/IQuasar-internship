      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major component of synovial fluid, to which it confers viscosity&#xD;
      and elasticity. It has been shown that the rheological properties of the synovial fluid&#xD;
      decrease in patients with osteoarthritis. Intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      represents a commonly used therapeutic option to relieve osteoarthritic symptoms, by exerting&#xD;
      a mechanical action on cartilaginous structures of the joints, thus leading to reduced pain&#xD;
      and improved joint function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet-rich Plasma is an autologous product prepared from the patient's own blood.&#xD;
      Potential benefits of platelet-rich plasma for the treatment of cartilage defects have been&#xD;
      suggested by many in vitro and animal studies. There are an increasing number of clinical&#xD;
      studies assessing the benefits of platelet rich plasma in the treatment of osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      showing that platelet rich plasma improves symptoms with no serious adverse events reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the above, HA and platelet-rich plasma have the potential to provide added&#xD;
      benefits in osteoarthritis symptoms when combined, in particular in patients who have had&#xD;
      previous intra-articular HA treatment but who are still experiencing pain. Preliminary&#xD;
      evidence to this effect was presented at the 2014 Annual Congress of the French Rheumatology&#xD;
      Society by a group of French investigators. Renevier and Marc enrolled patients who had not&#xD;
      experienced adequate symptom relief from previous intra-articular HA treatment and treated&#xD;
      them with HA plus platelet-rich plasma prepared using A-CP HA Kit. Of the 71 patients&#xD;
      treated, approximately 90% were classified as responders based on the OMERACT-OARSI criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The A-CP HA Kit allows for the preparation of a homogenous solution of platelet-rich plasma&#xD;
      and HA, intended to be injected intra-articularly for the treatment of pain in&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. In patients who had previous intra-articular HA treatment but who are still&#xD;
      experiencing pain, treatment with HA plus platelet rich plasma could provide a safe and&#xD;
      reproducible option before surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joint cartilage. The evolution of this&#xD;
      condition is characterized by the following symptoms: pain, joint cracking/popping,&#xD;
      stiffness, deformity, loss of mobility and especially in the case of knee osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      swelling (synovial effusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis can lead to functional impairment and deformities thereby causing degradation&#xD;
      of quality of life and may result in disabilities. Due to the fact that the knees and hips&#xD;
      are weight bearing, osteoarthritis of these joints is often more disabling for persons who&#xD;
      are affected by this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disorder in the United States. Among adults 60 years&#xD;
      of age or older, the prevalence of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis is approximately 10% in&#xD;
      men and 13% in women. The number of people affected with symptomatic OA is likely to increase&#xD;
      due to the aging of the population and the obesity epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A healthy joint is composed of two bone ends covered by cartilage (hyaline cartilage). This&#xD;
      allows for shock absorption and for the bones to slide over one another with ease, thus&#xD;
      ensuring the joint mobility. Synovial fluid (synovium) that surrounds the cartilage acts as&#xD;
      lubrication and nutrition for the articular cartilage. It is mainly composed of hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid, a glycosaminoglycan which binds to water molecules which in turn will result in a very&#xD;
      viscous solution thereby giving the synovial fluid its shock absorbing properties. It has&#xD;
      been shown that the rheological properties of synovial fluid decrease with age and in&#xD;
      patients suffering from osteoarthritis, which may cause symptoms of pain and physical loss of&#xD;
      function as seen in gonarthrosis, for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis has multiple causative agents, many of which are not yet fully understood.&#xD;
      However, a number of risk factors including age, gender, genetics, obesity, joint trauma,&#xD;
      certain sports or professional activities are currently known. Conventionally, there is a&#xD;
      distinction between so-called primary osteoarthritis, for which there is no obvious&#xD;
      predisposition (of unknown origin) and secondary osteoarthritis, related to previous trauma&#xD;
      or joint diseases. The secondary type represents the most common form of osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many and varied possibilities for treating gonarthrosis which include both&#xD;
      medicated and non-medicated routes. Among these, physical therapy and an improved life style&#xD;
      (weight loss, use of suitable shoe inserts, regular physical activity etc.) are an essential&#xD;
      component in the management of knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of medication, the administration of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs) is the standard treatment. However, although they promptly act against pain&#xD;
      and inflammation, they only have a limited effect over time in treating the symptoms without&#xD;
      acting upon the cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slow acting anti-rheumatic drugs, including glucosamine, chondroitin sulphate, diacerhein,&#xD;
      soybean and avocado unsaponifiables on the contrary have a delayed action on the pain and&#xD;
      joint function. Although still widely used in clinical practice for their chondroprotective&#xD;
      effect, they have moderate efficacy and primarily allow for the reduction of analgesic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticoid infiltrations occupy an important place in the therapeutic range of osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      especially when analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs fail to relieve an inflammatory flare.&#xD;
      The observed effect, however, has a limited effect over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid (viscosupplementation treatment) are currently&#xD;
      the treatment of choice in gonarthrosis as they can relieve symptoms for several months at a&#xD;
      time. These are designed to exert a mechanical action on cartilaginous structures of the&#xD;
      joints, leading to a reduction in pain and improvement in the joint function. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of hyaluronic acid is widely documented. Indeed, many clinical trials testing&#xD;
      different hyaluronic acid preparations have been carried out in humans, some of which report&#xD;
      results versus a saline placebo. Most of these studies conclude to the superiority of&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid regardless of its molecular weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the injections of platelet rich plasma were found to be an attractive&#xD;
      treatment option, due to the autologous nature of the product and its mechanism of action.&#xD;
      Indeed, the action of platelet rich plasma is not based on sustainable viscoelasticity of the&#xD;
      product, but on biological stimulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cartilaginous&#xD;
      cells. Many in vitro studies have already demonstrated the effects of isolated growth factors&#xD;
      on stimulation and chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical use of isolated growth factors is impossible today with regard to their mode of&#xD;
      production and the potential risk to human health. The autologous platelet rich plasma is the&#xD;
      simplest and safest solution to provide usable growth factors in a clinical setting. The&#xD;
      interest and potential efficacy of platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of cartilage lesions&#xD;
      have already been tested in vitro:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet-rich plasma increases the synthesis of proteoglycans and collagen in the&#xD;
           extracellular matrix of cultured intervertebral disc cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet-rich plasma stimulates the proliferation and biosynthesis of the matrix of&#xD;
           articular chondrocytes in pigs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet-rich plasma increases the expression of the &quot;cartilage oligomeric matrix&#xD;
           protein&quot; (COMP) Platelet-rich plasma was superior to a standard culture medium in the&#xD;
           proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into chondrocytes At the&#xD;
           clinical level, a number of studies showed improved symptoms with no serious adverse&#xD;
           effects. When compared to hyaluronic acid injections, platelet-rich plasma treatment&#xD;
           demonstrated superiority in terms of reduced pain, stiffness and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results suggest that platelet-rich plasma, by its specific mechanism of action, is an&#xD;
      effective and innovative tool in the therapeutic arsenal for the treatment of symptomatic&#xD;
      gonarthrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis o the above, it is reasonable to assume that platelet-rich plasma and hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid have the potential to provide added benefits in osteoarthritis when combined, in&#xD;
      particular in patients who have had previous intra-articular HA treatment but who are still&#xD;
      experiencing pain. Preliminary evidence to this effect was presented at the 2014 Annual&#xD;
      Congress of the French Rheumatology Society by a group of French investigators. Renevier and&#xD;
      Marc enrolled patients who had not experienced adequate symptom relief from previous&#xD;
      intra-articular HA treatment and treated them with the combination of platelet rich plasma&#xD;
      and HA prepared using A-CP HA Kit. Of the 71 patients treated approximately 90% were&#xD;
      classified as responders based on the OMERACT-OARSI criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The A-CP HA Kit, manufactured by Regen Lab SA, Le Mont-sur-Lausanne, VD, Switzerland, allows&#xD;
      for the preparation of a homogenous solution of platelet-rich plasma and HA. The product is&#xD;
      intended to be injected intra-articularly for the symptomatic treatment of pain. In patients&#xD;
      who had previous intra-articular HA treatment but who are still experiencing pain, treatment&#xD;
      with HA plus platelet-rich plasma could provide a safe and reproducible option before&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate if a biological treatment based on a&#xD;
      combination of platelet-rich plasma and hyaluronic acid obtained with A-CP HA Kit is&#xD;
      statistically superior to HA alone, on one hand, and to a saline placebo, on the other hand,&#xD;
      to reduce overall knee osteoarthritis symptoms, and particularly pain, and thus improve&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
