  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized study will investigate the use of niraparib in patients with&#xD;
      tumors known to have mutations in BAP1 and other select DNA damage response pathway genes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BAP1 is an ubiquitin ligase that is critical in helping to regulate the cell cycle, cellular&#xD;
      differentiation, and cell death. This protein is also intimately involved with DNA&#xD;
      double-strand break repair. Germline mutations in the BAP1 gene are associated with a&#xD;
      hereditary cancer syndrome that increases the risk of uveal melanoma, mesothelioma and renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. PARP is another protein that is crucial in DNA repair and enables continued&#xD;
      cell replication and survival. It is hypothesized that PARP inhibition with niraparib will&#xD;
      result in significant cytoreduction in patient tumors with mutations in BAP1 and other&#xD;
      components of the DNA damage response pathway through synthetic lethality. Synthetic&#xD;
      lethality is the inhibition of a gene that a cell relies on to compensate for the loss of&#xD;
      another gene, resulting in the cell's demise.&#xD;
