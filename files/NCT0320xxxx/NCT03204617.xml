      The AELIX-002 study aims to evaluate the safety and the immunogenicity of an heterologous&#xD;
      prime-boost regimen with DNA.HTI, MVA.HTI and ChAdOx1.HTI in early diagnosed and treated&#xD;
      HIV-1 positive individuals, males and females,18-60 years of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AELIX Therapeutics has developed a novel immunogen, which was designed to be used as a a&#xD;
      therapeutic HIV vaccine that could help HIV infected individuals to control viral replication&#xD;
      in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. HIVACAT T cell immunogen (HTI) is a novel T cell&#xD;
      immunogen covering the most vulnerable regions of HIV. The encoding DNA sequence that has&#xD;
      been inserted in various vaccine vectors, including viral and non-viral vectors.&#xD;
      Administration of the HTI immunogen is implemented through a heterologous prime-boost&#xD;
      approach. The aim of the sequential administration of the therapeutic vaccines is to achieve&#xD;
      a so-called &quot;functional cure,&quot; in which HIV-infected participants can control viral&#xD;
      replication in the absence of ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AELIX-002 Phase I study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an heterologous&#xD;
      regime with DNA.HTI, MVA.HTI and ChAdOx1.HTI in HIV-1 positive participants on suppressive&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment who started Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) within the&#xD;
      first 6 months of confirmed HIV-1 acquisition. In Phase A, participants were randomized to&#xD;
      receive active vaccine or placebo in a double blinded fashion. There was a sentinel group of&#xD;
      three participants; two received active vaccine and one received placebo (0.9% normal&#xD;
      saline). During the sentinel phase of the study only one participant was enrolled per day.&#xD;
      Two weeks later and in the absence of any related SAE or ≥ Grade 3 adverse event lasting &gt;72h&#xD;
      after vaccination in any of the 3 sentinel participants, six individuals in the remaining&#xD;
      cohort were enrolled (in blocks of 3 patients per day) and the final six participants one&#xD;
      week later, also in blocks of 3 participants per day. On each vaccination day, 2 participants&#xD;
      received active IMP and 1 received placebo (2:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 15 participants (3 sentinel and 12 non-sentinel) have reached week 22 visit&#xD;
      and a favourable report from the Safety Monitoring Committee has been released, transition to&#xD;
      Phase B was performed to include 30 participants (Group 3). Participants were recruited&#xD;
      sequentially and without following blocks of pre-defined number of vaccines and placebos per&#xD;
      immunization day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 32, all participants were invited to participate in an extension sub-study (Roll-over&#xD;
      Phase) to assess long-term safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of DNA.HTI and MVA.HTI&#xD;
      administrations until start of Phase C. There were no interventions during this extension&#xD;
      Roll over Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a favourable SMC report, transition to Phase C occurred. During Roll-over Phase&#xD;
      participants in Phase A/B were offered to participate in Phase C. Participants who received&#xD;
      active treatment (DDDMM) in Phase A/B will continue to receive active treatment (CCM) in&#xD;
      Phase C, while participants who received placebo in Phase A/B will continue to receive&#xD;
      placebo (PPP). Treatment allocation remained blind. Eight weeks after the third&#xD;
      MVA.HTI/placebo administration, all participants will undergo an Analytical Treatment&#xD;
      Interruption (ATI) of up to 24 weeks of duration. At visit Phase C week 56 (end-of-ATI&#xD;
      visit), or before according to pre-specified criteria, cART will be resumed, and participants&#xD;
      will be followed during a safety period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
