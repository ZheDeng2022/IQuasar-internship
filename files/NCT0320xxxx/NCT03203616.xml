  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with breast cancer often develop metastases in the brain. Currently, treatment of these&#xD;
      metastases is difficult and relies on radiotherapy or surgery which often fail. Therefore,&#xD;
      development of new methods of treatment for breast cancer with brain metastasis is very&#xD;
      important. T-DM1 is a drug that is already in everyday use for a specific type of breast&#xD;
      cancer called HER2-positive breast cancer. The objective of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      whether T-DM1 is also effective in brain metastasis and can help patients to live longer and&#xD;
      better&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, non-randomised, open label, single arm, phase II study of T-DM1 in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic breast cancer and with brain metastasis who have already failed at&#xD;
      least one line of anti-HER2 therapy for systemic disease. The study sample is composed of 2&#xD;
      distinct cohorts of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort number 1 is composed of patients with asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic brain&#xD;
      metastasis (single or multiple), measurable according to RECIST 1.1, who have not received&#xD;
      any local therapy (neither surgery, radiosurgery nor whole brain radiotherapy) for brain&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort number 2 is composed of patients with brain metastasis (single or multiple),&#xD;
      measurable according to RECIST 1.1, previously treated with local therapy (surgery,&#xD;
      radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy) and with radiologically confirmed brain&#xD;
      progression, with a minimum period of 3 months between the end of local therapy and brain&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 110 are planned for screening, in order to enrol 97 patients. A minimum of&#xD;
      87 evaluable patients is necessary. Inclusion of patients in both cohorts will follow a&#xD;
      two-stage Simon optimal design. During the study, both brain assessments via&#xD;
      magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) and systemic assessments with computerised tomography (CT)&#xD;
      will be performed every 3 cycles (9 weeks) of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment consists of T-DM1, 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients will receive study&#xD;
      medication until unacceptable toxicity, voluntary withdrawal from study treatment, disease&#xD;
      progression, death or pregnancy, whichever occurs first. Patients who experience only&#xD;
      progression in the brain and who receive local therapy may remain in the study until systemic&#xD;
      progression (or any of the other reasons stated previously), at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of study treatment, all patients will have a safety visit within 30 days (+/- 7&#xD;
      days) from the last T-DM1 administration date. After the safety visit, according the reason&#xD;
      of end of study treatment, the follow-up period will begin, as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If study treatment stopped due to progression of disease Patients will enter directly in&#xD;
           survival follow-up. No visits are mandatory per protocol after the safety visit. Chart&#xD;
           review and/or phone call to check if the patient is still alive are to be performed,&#xD;
           every 6 months, in order to acquire data for the overall survival endpoint. Patients in&#xD;
           survival follow-up who are of childbearing potential must be tested for pregnancy at 3&#xD;
           months and at 7 months after end of study treatment. These tests can be ordered by the&#xD;
           investigator during regular out of study follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If study treatment stopped for any other reason than progression (either toxicity or&#xD;
           voluntary withdrawal from study treatment) Patients will enter first in efficacy&#xD;
           follow-up after the safety visit and then in survival follow-up when progression disease&#xD;
           is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During efficacy follow-up, 9 weekly efficacy assessments continue according to the same&#xD;
      timetable they would have followed had treatment interruption not occurred. This consists of&#xD;
      imaging assessments (MRI and CT) and medical visits, as well as QoL evaluations. During this&#xD;
      period, treatment is at the discretion of the local physician/investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This follow-up is to continue until disease progression or until voluntary withdrawal of the&#xD;
      patient from the study. In case this follow-up is impossible (due to patient refusing to&#xD;
      perform assessments or other reasons), survival data can be collected every 6 months via&#xD;
      chart review or telephone. Patients in follow-up who are of childbearing potential must be&#xD;
      tested for pregnancy at 3 months and at 7 months after end of study treatment. Once a patient&#xD;
      has progressed while on efficacy follow-up, they will enter into survival follow-up as per&#xD;
      description above.&#xD;
