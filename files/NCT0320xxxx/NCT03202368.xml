    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, interventional, open-label, long-term extension study of Study WA28119&#xD;
      (NCT01791153) to evaluate the long-term safety of SC tocilizumab in participants with GCA who&#xD;
      subsequently have flare or persisting disease activity. A maximum of 11 participants from six&#xD;
      centers in France that participated in the WA28119 study will be enrolled. The entire study&#xD;
      duration is anticipated to be approximately 160 weeks.&#xD;
