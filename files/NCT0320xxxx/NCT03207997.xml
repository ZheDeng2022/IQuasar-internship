  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of pulmonary fibrosis is currently based on high-resolution CT (HRCT) and&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests (PFT) such as forced vital capacity, (FVC) and carbon monoxide&#xD;
      diffusion (DLCO). These techniques allow a semi-quantitative analysis of the pulmonary&#xD;
      disease but are imperfect. The mains weaknesses are the lack of reproducibility, the limited&#xD;
      sensitivity and for CT the resulting radiation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in MRI sequences allow exploring the lung parenchyma with millimeter slice&#xD;
      thickness. Development of computer-assisted post-processing such as elastic registration&#xD;
      opens new perspectives in the functional study of the lung parenchyma, especially the&#xD;
      analysis of its deformation during the respiratory cycle and therefore of its elasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary involvement in scleroderma is present in 70 to 100% of patients and is the leading&#xD;
      cause of death. Initial assessment of pulmonary involvement and follow-up are important for&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions and patient prognosis. Quantitative analysis should be developed to&#xD;
      reliably evaluate pulmonary fibrosis and increase the reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to evaluate the feasibility of quantifying pulmonary fibrosis by&#xD;
      successively performing full inspiration then full expiration volumetric MR acquisitions&#xD;
      using a VIBE - Volumetric Interpolated Breath-hold examination sequence. Post processing of&#xD;
      the 2 volumes using elastic registration is performed to evaluate pulmonary deformation in&#xD;
      the normal and fibrotic lung areas, hypothesizing that it would be different.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scleroderma is a chronic connective tissue disease of poorly understood origin. The&#xD;
      prevalence ranges between 100 and 260 cases per million inhabitants in Europe and the United&#xD;
      States, with a female predominance (3/1). Pulmonary involvement is frequent, observed in 70&#xD;
      to 100% of the patients. It is the leading cause of death in scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has mainly two forms: diffuse fibrotic interstitial pneumonitis, which occurs in the&#xD;
      majority of cases in the form of non-specific interstitial pneumonia (76%) and pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH in scleroderma may be secondary to pulmonary fibrosis or&#xD;
      develop on its own, in patients with no parenchymal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT and pulmonary function tests play a very important role in the detection and follow-up of&#xD;
      patients with lung disease associated with scleroderma. However, the analysis of HRCT,&#xD;
      looking for ground glass opacities, reticulations, traction bronchiectasis, predominantly&#xD;
      sub-pleural, basal and posterior remains semi-quantitative and shows great inter-observer&#xD;
      variability, when based on visual assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and staging of chronic lung diseases, such as scleroderma, is a major challenge for&#xD;
      both patient care and approval of new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lung disease may provide a non-invasive evaluation of&#xD;
      lung fibrosis, bypassing radiation dose concerns of CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to develop a quantitative imaging biomarker based on MRI for the&#xD;
      assessment of lung disease severity and monitoring disease progression. Fibrotic changes&#xD;
      increase lung stiffness and induce a restrictive lung disease with decreased lung volumes on&#xD;
      PFT. Thus, the investigators hypothesized that the assessment of lung elasticity would allow&#xD;
      differentiating between fibrotic and healthy lung parenchyma. For each subject, they will&#xD;
      examine an overall &quot;elasticity index&quot; (based on the total disease volume), as well as the&#xD;
      spatial distribution of elastic properties. These properties will be calculated using a&#xD;
      deformable registration between expiratory and inspiratory MR images. For the representation&#xD;
      of lung tissue expansion they will examine several surrogates based on the determinant of the&#xD;
      Jacobian of the deformation field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate a cohort of 30 patients, divided into 3 groups according to the&#xD;
      GAP criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 patients with mild pulmonary fibrosis (VFC&gt; 75% theoretical and DLCO / VA&gt; 55%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 patients with moderate pulmonary fibrosis (VFC 50-75% and DLCO 36-55%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 patients with severe pulmonary fibrosis (VFC &lt;50% theoretical or DLCO / VA &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be compared to a control group of 10 healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and non-inclusion criteria are developed in a next section. All patients will be&#xD;
      recruited in Cochin Hospital, during their annual follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed at the end of a cardiac MRI, performed as part of patient&#xD;
      standard follow-up. A 12-channel surface antenna will be installed for the acquisition of the&#xD;
      cardiac and pulmonary MRI images. VIBE (Volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination) T1&#xD;
      sequences, of 17 second duration (TR: 2.73 ms TE: 0.05 ms, Tilt angle: 5.5) will be acquired&#xD;
      following a deep inspiration then a deep expiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastic registration of the 2 sequences will be performed using an in-house software,&#xD;
      developed at CentraleSupelec (Center for Visual Computing). The registration will allow&#xD;
      determining a global lung elasticity index and separating healthy from fibrotic lung areas.&#xD;
      Marks will be manually placed on pre-defined anatomical targets on inspiratory and then&#xD;
      expiratory MR images in order to check the quality of automated registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done by two independent observers, and the distance between marks placed by the&#xD;
      2 observers will be compared to the results of automated registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data for all patients of the cohort will be collected, including clinical history,&#xD;
      sex, age, association to other systemic disease, positivity of biological markers, and&#xD;
      ongoing treatment. These data will be retrieved from the patient medical charts at Cochin&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI images will also be used to calculate the expiration and inspiration lung volumes in&#xD;
      order to compare them to the volumes acquired during PFT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be prospectively acquired, with only one evaluation for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data collection and image acquisition will start after the study approval by the&#xD;
      ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes, CPP) and the National Commission on&#xD;
      Informatics and Civil Liberties (CNIL)..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strength of the Jacobians (deformation forces) when performing elastic registration will&#xD;
      be compared to the FVC, by using Spearman correlation coefficient.&#xD;
