  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the efficacy of a&#xD;
      single intra-articular injection of OSTENIL PLUS compared to that of a single intra-articular&#xD;
      injection of the reference product SYNVISC-ONE in the treatment of symptomatic tibiofemoral&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. The primary endpoint was the change in mean score on the WOMAC pain scales&#xD;
      from D0 to D180.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a period of washout-out for NSAIDs, the patients received a single intra-articular&#xD;
      injection of OSTENIL PLUS or of SYNVISC-ONE in the most painful knee. The study involved a&#xD;
      preselection visit at D-7 and five further visits: at D0 (baseline, evaluation before&#xD;
      intra-articular injection), at D2 ± 2 days (injection), at D30 ± 15 days, at D90 ± 15 days&#xD;
      and C5 at D180 ± 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enrol the patients as quickly as possible, 129 sites, i.e. general medical or rheumatology&#xD;
      practices, were open. After verifying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the evaluating&#xD;
      investigators assigned a randomisation number based on the chronological order of inclusion&#xD;
      of patients at their site. The patient was then sent to the injecting investigator so that&#xD;
      he/she could give the injection of the product corresponding to the randomisation number.&#xD;

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>To prevent the patients from knowing the nature of their treatment, the investigational products OSTENIL PLUS and SYNVISC-ONE were packed in identical neutral packs. OSTENIL PLUS and SYNVISC-ONE differ in appearance (product volume and viscosity, prefilled syringe) and were therefore readily identifiable by the investigator administering the investigational product (i.e. injecting investigator). The double-blind masking could be ensured thanks to the intervention of an observer who did not know the nature of the treatment, namely the evaluating investigator. The treatment was therefore administered blind to the evaluating investigator and the patient but not to the injecting investigator.</masking_description>
