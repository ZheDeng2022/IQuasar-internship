  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional Phase I dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial for patients&#xD;
      with advanced, solid tumor malignancies who have pre-identified deleterious germline or&#xD;
      somatic mutations in the homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair pathway&#xD;
      (HR deficient). The trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of niraparib plus&#xD;
      carboplatin in patients with evidence of HRD. The primary endpoint will be identifying the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of niraparib plus carboplatin, as well as&#xD;
      establishing the anti-tumor efficacy of niraparib plus carboplatin as determined by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria.&#xD;

      This is a multi-institutional Phase I dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial for patients&#xD;
      with advanced, solid tumor malignancies who have pre-identified deleterious germline or&#xD;
      somatic mutations in the homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair pathway&#xD;
      (HR deficient). The trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of niraparib plus&#xD;
      carboplatin in patients with evidence of HRD. The primary endpoint will be identifying the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of niraparib plus carboplatin, as well as&#xD;
      establishing the anti-tumor efficacy of niraparib plus carboplatin as determined by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be pre-identified from participating centers as having either a germline&#xD;
      deleterious mutation or tumor expression of a deleterious mutation in one of the genes listed&#xD;
      below, as determined by Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) only, completed prior to&#xD;
      enrollment in this protocol. Patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies with the&#xD;
      presence of somatic or germline deleterious mutation in a gene(s) critical to DNA repair&#xD;
      through homologous recombination, including but not limited to: ARID1A, ATM, ATRX, MRE11A,&#xD;
      NBN, PTEN, RAD50/51/51B, BARD1, BLM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, FANCA/C/D2/E/F/G/L, PALB2, WRN,&#xD;
      CHEK2, CHEK1, BAP1, FAM175A, SLX4, MLL2 or XRCC, and who have an adequate performance status&#xD;
      (PS), bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function as well as biopsiable and measurable disease&#xD;
      will be screened for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate patients will be enrolled in a 3+3 alternating dose escalating fashion, to a&#xD;
      maximum dose of niraparib of 300mg daily and a maximum dose of carboplatin area under the&#xD;
      curve (AUC) of 4. The 3+3 schema will be employed to insure safety and tolerability. However,&#xD;
      within any given cohort, a full contingent of 6 patients (assuming adequate tolerability)&#xD;
      will be enrolled to capture a sufficient number of patients and samples for pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      assessment of DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the RP2D and schedule are identified, a Phase Ib expansion cohort of 20 additional&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled as a pilot subgroup to determine efficacy. Of the 20 patients in&#xD;
      this Phase Ib cohort, no more than 10 patients will have underlying breast cancer; and&#xD;
      additionally no more than 10 patients may harbor BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition and the extent of&#xD;
      DNA damage, patients will undergo serial tumor biopsies to measure DNA damage as quantified&#xD;
      by levels of ᵞH2AX and RAD51 foci formation, as well as an assessment of PARP inhibitory&#xD;
      activity. Tumor biopsies will also be used to assess the mechanisms of resistance to PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of safety including blood tests, clinic visits and exams will occur weekly at the&#xD;
      start of therapy, then will transition to every 3-week clinic visits and exams at the&#xD;
      beginning of cycle 4. For the Phase Ib portion, patients will undergo weekly lab work and&#xD;
      clinic visits for cycle 1 only. The researchers hypothesize that in this HR deficient patient&#xD;
      population, the addition of niraparib to carboplatin will lead to significant anti-tumor&#xD;
      responses with acceptable toxicities.&#xD;

             recombination mutation based on NGS done in a CLIA certified, CAP tested and&#xD;
             bioinformatics-validated testing lab PRIOR to enrollment in this current protocol. The&#xD;
             testing may have been done at any time prior to enrollment. HOWEVER, if any patient&#xD;
             has had NGS testing more than 3 months prior to enrollment, or if there has been&#xD;
             intervening therapy, then a repeat NGS test must be done and the deleterious somatic&#xD;

             study or interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study&#xD;
