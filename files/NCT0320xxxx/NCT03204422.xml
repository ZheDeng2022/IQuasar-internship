  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The accurate evaluation of daily salt or sodium intake is difficult to implement in clinical&#xD;
      practice and large epidemiological studies. 24-h urinary sodium excretion (USE) is considered&#xD;
      the gold standard, but is expensive and has a high participant burden. To further explore the&#xD;
      association between 24-h USE and spot urines in Chinese population, it was proposed that&#xD;
      using collected multiple spot urine samples could be estimated for 24-h USE in Chinese&#xD;
      children and adults.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To collect multiple spot urine samples and a 24-h urine sample in a population of&#xD;
           Chinese Children and adults. All participants will collect a spot urine in separate jugs&#xD;
           during the 24-h period, recording every urination time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validate previous finding that 24-h USE is estimated inaccurately by using only the&#xD;
           second morning void.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore a statistical formula to estimate 24-h USE by multi-time spot urine. The study&#xD;
           plan to enroll 200 children and 100 adults to collect a whole 24-h urine spot by spot&#xD;
           continuously. After a laboratory examination of sodium concentration from both spot&#xD;
           urine samples and 24-h urine sample, the exploratory estimation using multi-spot urine&#xD;
           to assess 24-h urinary sodium excretion will analyzed statistically. The validation for&#xD;
           the estimation method will be conducted in Chinese population as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sodium and potassium concentration in each urine specimen will be determined by ion&#xD;
      selective electrode methods and creatinine using enzymatic methods.The model established by&#xD;
      using linear model step by step. And the validation analysis conducted through correlation&#xD;
      analysis, bias distribution, residual analysis and Bland-Altman plot to assess accuracy. All&#xD;
      statistics analysis will be conducted using Statistical Analysis System software version 9.4.&#xD;
