  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Addiction to drugs and alcohol is increasingly becoming a worldwide trend that is&#xD;
           prevalent in both rich and poor countries . Substance abuse shows a significant warming&#xD;
           to the health, social and economic build of families, communities and nations. Extent of&#xD;
           worldwide psychoactive substance use is estimated at 2 billion alcohol users and 185&#xD;
           million drug users .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Substance abuse (including alcohol and drugs) is an important risk factor for poor&#xD;
           health globally due to their intoxicating effects or their toxic effects on organs and&#xD;
           tissues that lead to the development of diseases, injuries and other health conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug abuse is associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. A study on&#xD;
           the need for hospitalization in approximately 4800 drug users found that 223 of these&#xD;
           were admitted to hospital due to cardiovascular diseases .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The majority of abused substances or their metabolites are excreted through the kidneys&#xD;
           and renal complications of drug abuse are very common .The involvement of the kidney due&#xD;
           to drug abuse is either attributed to their elimination through the kidney, or a direct&#xD;
           nephrotoxic effect. The damage may be acute and reversible, or chronic and can leads to&#xD;
           end stage renal failure .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Addiction is responsible for different types of liver diseases including fatty liver,&#xD;
           hepatitis and liver failure. . Intravenous drug addiction by sharing of contaminated&#xD;
           needle is very important risk factor for the development of liver diseases, particularly&#xD;
           hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Globally, 90% of new hepatitis C infections are attributed&#xD;
           to drug injection . In the long run, substance abuse has negative effects on sexual&#xD;
           functions and leads to the onset of sexual disorders. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long term use of alcohol was reported to inhibit of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis&#xD;
           and reduces the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary . Morphine administration&#xD;
           suppresses LH release and reduces the levels of testosterone, which affects testicular&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
