      Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) has been a well-established treatment for chronic neuropathic&#xD;
      pain in Failed Back Surgery Syndrome with associated legs and/or low back pain. The waves&#xD;
      used in Spinal Cord Stimulation are mainly Tonic or Burst. Both Tonic and Burst stimulation&#xD;
      offer neuropathic pain suppression, with slightly superiority of the Burst wave for the FBSS.&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new stimulation paradigm with the&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) has been a well-established treatment for chronic neuropathic&#xD;
      pain for decades. One of the most general indication for SCS is Failed Back Surgery Syndrome&#xD;
      with associated legs and/or low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional low frequency neurostimulation is applied with a tonic wave shape (pulse width&#xD;
      is usually 300 to 500 Î¼sec, amplitude 2 to 5 mA, and frequency 40 to 50 Hz); this kind of&#xD;
      stimulation produces a perceptible paraesthesias in the area of stimulation &quot;covering&quot; the&#xD;
      region of pain. Further development in waves of stimulation during the recent years led to&#xD;
      new paradigms of sub-perception stimulation like &quot;Burst&quot; stimulation that has characteristics&#xD;
      of a cluster of waves with higher frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of these two wave forms has been demonstrated by different authors. Both Tonic&#xD;
      and Burst stimulation offer neuropathic pain suppression, with slightly superiority of the&#xD;
      Burst wave for the FBSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in technology of the implantable devices for spinal cord stimulation led to&#xD;
      the possibility to combine the two stimulation waves described allowing the design of a&#xD;
      possible new paradigm of stimulation. The Tonic and Burst wave can be combined to stimulate&#xD;
      the same pain area using the same configuration otherwise they can be programmed to stimulate&#xD;
      two different pain areas with two different configurations. Both burst and tonic waveforms&#xD;
      paradigms can be customized according to patients' need. The characteristics of this combined&#xD;
      stimulation wave in terms of efficacy, non inferiority, energy consumption, and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare pain suppressive effect of Low Frequency&#xD;
      &quot;Tonic Wave&quot; versus Low Frequency Combined &quot;Burst and Tonic Wave&quot; for Spinal Cord Stimulation&#xD;
      in subjects with refractory neuropathic leg and low back pain as result of FBSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and receive&#xD;
      electrocatheter implant. Then, they will be observed for a two-weeks trial period in which&#xD;
      the efficacy of the stimulation and the compliance of the patient is evaluated. During this&#xD;
      trial a Tonic wave stimulation is administered by the external generator. After this trial,&#xD;
      the definitive generator will be implanted. Two weeks of Tonic stimulation will follow the&#xD;
      surgery to avoid any interference of the pain measurement with the surgical pain. After this&#xD;
      two weeks period, the stimulation will be switched into the combined waveform for 15 days. At&#xD;
      the end of the study period, the final waveform setting of the SCS will be in accord with the&#xD;
      patient's stimulation preference.&#xD;
