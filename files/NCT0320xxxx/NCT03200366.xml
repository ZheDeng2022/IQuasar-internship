  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test different approaches to help people understand the&#xD;
      purpose of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, two screening test options available, and the&#xD;
      barriers to screening so they can make informed decisions about CRC screening. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) one group will receive a tailored&#xD;
      digital video disc (DVD) in the mail; (2) another group will receive the mailed DVD plus&#xD;
      telephone calls from a patient navigator; and (3) the third group will receive the care&#xD;
      normally provided by the healthcare system's endoscopy department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize the following: (1) participants who receive the tailored DVD&#xD;
      plus the patient navigation intervention will have higher rates of CRC screening with the&#xD;
      fecal immunochemical test (FIT), colonoscopy, or either screening test compared to those who&#xD;
      receive the tailored DVD alone; (2) participants who receive either intervention (DVD only or&#xD;
      DVD plus patient navigation) will have higher rates of CRC screening with FIT, colonoscopy,&#xD;
      or either screening test than those who receive usual care; and (3) participants who receive&#xD;
      either intervention who complete colonoscopy will have better quality of bowel preparation,&#xD;
      less anxiety about the procedure, and greater satisfaction with the colonoscopy experience&#xD;
      than those who receive usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) often can be prevented through regular screening and although&#xD;
      multiple screening tests are available, colonoscopy is often the only screening test offered&#xD;
      to patients. Unfortunately, up to half of people in some hospitals who receive a&#xD;
      recommendation and are scheduled for colonoscopy do not complete the test. Reasons for not&#xD;
      completing colonoscopy include lack of awareness of the need for, and benefits of, screening,&#xD;
      fear of pain, fear of finding cancer, unpleasantness of the bowel preparation, cost,&#xD;
      transportation issues, and the unwillingness to undergo an invasive test in the absence of&#xD;
      symptoms. The process of bowel cleansing is one of the most challenging aspects of having a&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Interventions that improve patients' knowledge about CRC screening, including&#xD;
      test options other than colonoscopy, enhance access, improve skills needed to complete CRC&#xD;
      screening, and reduce barriers will lead to greater numbers of people being screened. Patient&#xD;
      navigation and computer tailored interventions have been shown to be effective approaches to&#xD;
      increase CRC and other cancer screening but there is no evidence of their comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to compare two health system-based interventions,&#xD;
      with one another and with usual care, to increase completion rates among a diverse sample of&#xD;
      patients. The investigators will enroll an ethnically diverse group of 450 men and women aged&#xD;
      50-75,or aged 45-75 if African American, who are at average risk for CRC and were referred&#xD;
      and scheduled for colonoscopy at one endoscopy department but canceled or did not attend&#xD;
      their scheduled appointment. Participants will be randomized to receive: (1) a mailed&#xD;
      tailored digital video disc (DVD) alone; 2) the mailed tailored DVD plus a telephone-based&#xD;
      Patient Navigator; or 3) usual care. Data will be collected at baseline, at 6 months and at 9&#xD;
      months post-baseline. Interviews to assess receipt, viewing, and satisfaction with the&#xD;
      tailored DVD will be conducted 2 weeks after mailing. Satisfaction with the patient navigator&#xD;
      will be assessed at 6 months. Multivariable logistic regression analyses will be used to test&#xD;
      the interventions' effects on CRC screening test completion and, for those who complete&#xD;
      colonoscopy, quality of bowel preparation. The investigators will also examine whether these&#xD;
      interventions change knowledge about CRC and screening as well as health beliefs (perceived&#xD;
      risk, perceived benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy) about screening. From this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will learn how effective these two standardized, easy to disseminate health&#xD;
      system-based interventions are compared to each other and to usual care. If the interventions&#xD;
      are found to be equally effective, or differentially effective for different subgroups of&#xD;
      patients, healthcare systems may consider implementing one or both of these interventions in&#xD;
      their settings.&#xD;

    <measure>Participants With Adequate Quality of Bowel Preparation Per Modified Aronchick Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-baseline interview</time_frame>
    <description>Participants quality of bowel preparation is measured by the endoscopist during their colonoscopy using a modification of the Aronchick rating scale. The Aronchick scale rates quality as 1=excellent, 2=good, 3=fair, or 4=poor. Some endoscopists choose to grade quality more generally as adequate vs. inadequate. To accommodate this variation, bowel preparation ratings have been dichotomized into adequate (excellent, good, fair, or adequate ratings) vs. inadequate (poor or inadequate ratings). Adequate is scored as 1 and indicates better quality of bowel preparation than inadequate which is scored as 0.</description>

DVD: A 20 minute tailored DVD titled &quot;Approaches to Colon Testing&quot; is viewed by participants.

          <title>Tailored DVD + Patient Navigation</title>
          <description>Tailored digital video disc (DVD) plus Patient Navigation by a population health nurse in the healthcare system&#xD;
DVD: A 20 minute tailored DVD titled &quot;Approaches to Colon Testing&quot; is viewed by participants. It is designed to encourage CRC screening uptake by colonoscopy or FIT by increasing the participant's CRC knowledge and beliefs about the benefits of screening, reducing barriers to screening, and increasing self-efficacy for screening by demonstrating how these tests are performed.&#xD;
Patient Navigation: Participants talk by telephone with a Patient Navigator who is a trained nurse. The Patient Navigator determines if participants viewed the tailored DVD and answers any questions about the content. The Patient Navigator then provides telephone counseling on CRC and screening tests to: (1) increase knowledge, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy; (2) reduce barriers; (3) enhance access; and (4) provide social support.</description>

          <description>Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of body fat that is calculated using participants self report of height and weight. BMI values are correlated with weight categories. A BMI &lt;18.5 means underweight; BMI=18.5-24.9 means normal weight; BMI=25.0-29.9 means overweight; and BMI &gt; 30 means obese. A high BMI is associated with an increased risk for chronic diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes.</description>

DVD: A 20 minute tailored DVD titled &quot;Approaches to Colon Testing&quot; is viewed by participants. It is designed to encourage CRC screening uptake by colonoscopy or FIT by increasing the participant's CRC knowledge and beliefs about the benefits of screening, reducing barriers to screening, and increasing self-efficacy for screening by demonstrating how these tests are performed.&#xD;
Patient Navigation: Participants talk by telephone with a Patient Navigator who is a trained nurse. The Patient Navigator determines if participants viewed the tailored DVD and answers any questions about the content. The Patient Navigator then provides telephone counseling on CRC and screening tests to: (1) increase knowledge, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy; (2) reduce barriers; (3) enhance access; and (4) provide social support.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in perceived risk for CRC is measured by self-report at 6 months using a 3-item scale. We ask participants how likely it is that they will get colon cancer sometime during their lifetime, within the next 10 years, and within the next 5 years. Each item is scored from 1 to 4 (1=very unlikely; 4=very likely). Higher scores indicate a higher perceived risk for getting CRC. The mean of the 3 items is calculated at baseline and 6 months. Change in perceived risk equals the mean at 6 months minus the mean at baseline. Change can range from -3 to 3 with positive values indicating an increase in perceived risk for getting CRC.</description>

Patient Navigation: Participants talk by telephone with a Patient Navigator who is a trained nurse. The Patient Navigator determines if participants viewed the tailored DVD and answers any questions about the content. The Patient Navigator then provides telephone counseling on CRC and screening tests to: (1) increase knowledge, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy; (2) reduce barriers; (3) enhance access; and (4) provide social support.</description>

          <title>Change in Perceived Risk for CRC</title>
          <description>Change from baseline in perceived risk for CRC is measured by self-report at 6 months using a 3-item scale. We ask participants how likely it is that they will get colon cancer sometime during their lifetime, within the next 10 years, and within the next 5 years. Each item is scored from 1 to 4 (1=very unlikely; 4=very likely). Higher scores indicate a higher perceived risk for getting CRC. The mean of the 3 items is calculated at baseline and 6 months. Change in perceived risk equals the mean at 6 months minus the mean at baseline. Change can range from -3 to 3 with positive values indicating an increase in perceived risk for getting CRC.</description>

        <title>Change in Perceived Benefits of CRC Screening by FIT</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in perceived benefits of CRC screening by FIT is measured at 6 months by self-report using a 3-item scale. Each item is scored from 1 to 4 (1=strongly disagree; 4=strongly agree) and the mean of the 3 items calculated. Higher mean scores indicate greater perceived benefits of screening by FIT. Change in perceived benefits equals the mean at 6 months minus the mean at baseline. Change can range from -3 to 3 with positive values indicating an increase in perceived benefits for screening by FIT.</description>
