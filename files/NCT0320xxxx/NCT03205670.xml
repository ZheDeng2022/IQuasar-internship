  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates safety and efficacy of surgical treatment of patients with anterior&#xD;
      urethral stricture using a tissue-engineered construct based on autologous buccal mucosa&#xD;
      cells and matrix from reconstituted collagen and reinforcing polylactoglycolide fibers. This&#xD;
      is a single arm study with no control. Success will be assessed via objective and subjective&#xD;
      methods; complications will be tallied in a standardized fashion. Outcomes will be measured&#xD;
      at five years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of urethral strictures longer than 2 cm is an actual clinical challenge. In this&#xD;
      case, the common method is replacement surgery using a buccal mucosa graft. However, the main&#xD;
      disadvantage of this method is associated with limited donor resources and donor site&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of surgical treatment of patients with&#xD;
      anterior urethral stricture using a tissue-engineered construct. The construct consists of&#xD;
      autologous buccal mucosa cells and matrix from reconstituted collagen and reinforcing&#xD;
      polylactoglycolide fibers. Patients will be followed up for 5 years within this study. The&#xD;
      follow-up regimen includes retrograde and pericatheter urethrography, voiding&#xD;
      cystourethrography, uroflowmetry, biopsy, and quality of life monitoring. Telephone follow-up&#xD;
      will take place in between these assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained from this study will have practical implications for the urethral stricture&#xD;
      treatment and will be based on the principles of evidence-based medicine.&#xD;
