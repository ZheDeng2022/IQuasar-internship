  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) is to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid (HA) in combination with the coronally advanced flap (CAF) for the treatment&#xD;
      of single gingival recession site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that HA will result in improved the clinical outcomes and will reduce the&#xD;
      pos-operative morbidity&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession is a common clinical finding in patients with high standards of oral&#xD;
      hygiene and can be found in more than 90% of patients. Buccal exposure of roots with&#xD;
      aesthetic impairments and dentinal hypersensitivity The ultimate goal of root coverage&#xD;
      procedures is the complete coverage of the recession defect with an aesthetic appearance&#xD;
      comparable to adjacent healthy soft tissues in combination with physiological probing pocket&#xD;
      depths.Several surgical techniques have already provided good results and have been shown to&#xD;
      attain root coverage at individual recession sites these different methods.To date,&#xD;
      connective tissue grafts (CTG) and enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) in conjunction with a&#xD;
      coronally advanced flap (CAF) have been shown to provide the highest probability of obtaining&#xD;
      complete root coverage (CRC) in Miller class I and II single gingival recession as compared&#xD;
      to CAF alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major component of the extracellular matrix in almost all tissues.&#xD;
      The primary role of HA is to bind water and to permit the transportation of key metabolites&#xD;
      and therefore to maintain the structural and homeostatic integrity of these tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that hyaluronic acid have many properties that&#xD;
      are essential for tissue regeneration and wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been limited clinical application studies&#xD;
      in the field of root coverage procedures performed and still no consistent published data&#xD;
      with longer follow-ups on the usage of HA are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) was to evaluate the&#xD;
      potential benefit of the adjunctive use of HA in combination with a coronally advanced flap&#xD;
      (CAF) and to compare the outcomes with CAF alone, when treating single Miller Class I&#xD;
      gingival recessions.&#xD;
