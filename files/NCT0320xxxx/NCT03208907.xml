  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium vivax can be cause of severe malaria and mortality. There are serious public&#xD;
      health implications associated with cases of P. vivax resistant to Chloroquine in the&#xD;
      Americas as well there are efforts of many countries to eliminate this disease. In this way,&#xD;
      it is critically important to evaluate an alternative radical cure treatment efficient to&#xD;
      amazon scenario. The objectives of this trial are to demonstrate the superiority of adequate&#xD;
      parasitological response at D42 of Dihydroartemisinin plus Piperaquine (DHA-PQP or&#xD;
      Eurartesim®) versus Chloroquine and to evaluate the proportion of failure until D180&#xD;
      considering different starting days of Primaquine (0.50 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. It is an&#xD;
      open, 4 arms, randomised, comparative trial. Total of 460 patients must be included. To&#xD;
      demonstrate the superiority of DHA-PQP compared to Chloroquine, the 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      of the difference observed between both treatment success rates will be determined. Each&#xD;
      recurrence will be passively and actively detected for 180 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dihydroartemisinin/Piperaquine (DHA-PQP or Eurartesim®) is recommended by World Health&#xD;
      Organization Expert Board for the treatment of P.vivax malaria, in case of&#xD;
      chloroquine-resistance (CQR). However, no clinical study has been conducted to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of DHA-PQP in P.vivax malaria in the Americas. According a study performed in&#xD;
      Amazonas state, Brazil, Artesunate/Amodiaquine (ASAQ) exhibited high efficacy against CQ&#xD;
      resistant Plasmodium vivax and is an adequate alternative in the study area. They recommend&#xD;
      other studies with an efficacious comparator, longer follow-up and genotype-adjustment can&#xD;
      improve CQR characterization. Other publication, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials, found nine publications from January 1989 to May 2013 in which DHA-PQP was more&#xD;
      efficacious than CQ and Artemether/Lumefantrine in treating uncomplicated P. vivax malaria.&#xD;
      However, this drug combination is not active against the hypnozoite stage of P. vivax. So,&#xD;
      more efforts are required to establish how best combine this treatment with appropriate&#xD;
      nonrelapse therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, primaquine was assessed in high dose for 14 days as treatment for the hypnozoite&#xD;
      forms with DHA-PQP or artesunate-pyronaridine (AS-PYR). Both the treatment arms offer&#xD;
      evidence of good tolerability and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other previous study performed in an area with high chloroquine-resistance (Southern&#xD;
      Papua, Indonesia), DHA-PQP was compared to ASAQ, but never compared to chloroquine by itself&#xD;
      in areas where chloroquine still works. The objectives of this trial are to demonstrate the&#xD;
      superiority of adequate parasitological response at D42 of Dihydroartemisinin plus&#xD;
      Piperaquine versus Chloroquine and to evaluate the proportion of failure until D180&#xD;
      considering different starting days of Primaquine (0.50 mg/kg/day) for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be undertaken in the Amazonas State (Western Brazilian Amazon), in&#xD;
      Manaus, at Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado. The climate is tropical,&#xD;
      with mean temperatures between 26°C and 30°C. It is a prospective, open-label, 4-arm,&#xD;
      randomized and comparison trial. One hundred and fifteen (115) patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      each treatment arm. A total number of 460 patients should be enrolled. In this protocol, all&#xD;
      the subjects will be screened to evaluate Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD)&#xD;
      deficiency and the laboratorial tests (specially haemoglobin) in all the visits will be&#xD;
      evaluated, as well. The referred deficiency is estimated to be 3% among men from the Amazon&#xD;
      and essentially the A-type (african type) (27), which leads to moderate deficiency and minor&#xD;
      clinical complications. Each dose of the schizonticidal treatment will be administered by a&#xD;
      study pharmacist, and the patient will be monitored for 30 minutes after administration. The&#xD;
      assessment schedule will be done in days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 63, 90, 120, 150 and 180&#xD;
      (in addition, patient will be asked to come back to the health centre if fever occurs at any&#xD;
      time).&#xD;
