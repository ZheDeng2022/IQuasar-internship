  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic injury to the peripheral nerves is most common in the young population with high&#xD;
      associated costs to the patient, as well as to society. These range from acute healthcare&#xD;
      cost to loss of productivity and rehabilitation. Despite major efforts in improving surgical&#xD;
      technique, functional outcome has not significantly improved in the past thirty years.&#xD;
      Irreversible denervation, atrophy of target muscles, and deranged sensation secondary to slow&#xD;
      or aberrant axonal outgrowth remains a significant challenge. Although pre-operative&#xD;
      conditioning of the injured peripheral nerve with electrical stimulation has shown promise in&#xD;
      animal studies, it has not been tested in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal studies, pre-operative conditioning with electrical stimulation (ES) of the injured&#xD;
      peripheral nerves promoted peripheral nerve regeneration in both sensory and motor fibres. We&#xD;
      propose to conduct a clinical trial comparing 3 different treatments of complete digital&#xD;
      nerve laceration before and after surgical repair. Participants will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      three treatment arms: i) pre and post operative electrical stimulation, ii) pre-operative&#xD;
      electrical stimulation alone , or iii) control group that receives sham pre and&#xD;
      post-operative electrical stimulation. We will evaluate the effect of pre-operative&#xD;
      electrical stimulation on axonal regeneration, as well as determine whether there is an&#xD;
      additive effect of pre and post-operative electrical stimulation on sensory nerve axonal&#xD;
      regeneration.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effect of pre-operative electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (ES) on sensory nerve regeneration in the digital nerves that have been&#xD;
      traumatically transected and subsequently surgically repaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous animal and human research, we hypothesize that pre-operative ES will result&#xD;
      in significant improvement of sensory nerve regeneration in the hand compared to surgery&#xD;
      alone after a traumatic digital nerve laceration. Additionally, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      pre-operative along with post-operative ES will have an additive effect on sensory nerve&#xD;
      regeneration compared to pre-operative ES and surgery alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic injury to the peripheral nerves is most common in the young population; therefore&#xD;
      resulting disability incurs a significant cost to the patient, as well as to society, from&#xD;
      loss of productivity and healthcare dollars spent on rehabilitation. Despite major efforts in&#xD;
      improving surgical technique, functional outcome has not significantly changed in the past&#xD;
      thirty years. Irreversible denervation, atrophy of target muscles, and deranged sensation&#xD;
      secondary to slow or aberrant axonal outgrowth remains a significant challenge. Currently the&#xD;
      application of post-operative electrical stimulation is being used to promoted axonal&#xD;
      regeneration to good effect. However, pre-operative conditioning of the injured peripheral&#xD;
      nerve, with electrical stimulation, has not been investigated in the human population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative conditioning with electrical stimulation (ES) of the injured peripheral nerves&#xD;
      demonstrates particular promise. The mechanism of action of conditioning lesions consists of&#xD;
      up regulation of regenerative associated genes and the cAMP and JAK/STAT pathways. Data from&#xD;
      animal models, examining the effect of pre-operative electrical stimulation of peripheral&#xD;
      nerves, demonstrate that this technique promotes peripheral nerve axonal regeneration. Senger&#xD;
      et al have demonstrated that electrical stimulation produced axonal regeneration that is&#xD;
      equivalent to the traditional pre-conditioning crush lesion. Thus, electrical stimulation has&#xD;
      been proven as a viable method of pre-conditioning peripheral nerves, in order to promote&#xD;
      upregulate axonal regeneration prior to primary coaptation of the nerve. Senger et al have&#xD;
      also investigated the mechanism of action of this improved axonal regeneration in animals&#xD;
      pre-conditioned with electrical stimulation and have found upregulation of regenerative&#xD;
      associated genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of post-operative electrical stimulation on surgically repaired peripheral nerves&#xD;
      is well detailed in the literature. Thus it may be synergistic to combine pre and&#xD;
      post-operative electrical stimulation. Previously animal work has been translated into&#xD;
      patients with digital nerve transection and repair, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Wong et al&#xD;
      demonstrated those patients who underwent complete digital nerve transection, surgical&#xD;
      repair, and postoperative 1 hour of 20Hz continuous ES showed consistently greater&#xD;
      improvements in all sensory modalities by 5 to 6 months postoperatively compared to the&#xD;
      controls. Gordon et al demonstrated brief post-surgical ES resulted in robust motor&#xD;
      reinnervation to the thenar muscles by 3 months whereas it took more than a year in the&#xD;
      control patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nix and Hopf demonstrated that low frequency ES of the crushed motor nerve to the soleus in&#xD;
      rabbits accelerated improvement in muscle force production by 2 weeks compared to controls.&#xD;
      Pocket and Gavin using the rat model showed that the toe-spray reflex in crushed sciatic&#xD;
      nerves recovered significantly faster with low frequency and low intensity ES. Al-Majed et al&#xD;
      showed that one hour of low frequency 20Hz ES of transected and repaired rat femoral nerves&#xD;
      accelerated the slow-staggered regeneration growing across the repair site as well as&#xD;
      enhanced preferential motor reinnervation. Even when the ES was delayed by up to 2 weeks&#xD;
      post-rat femoral nerve repair, the enhancing effects were still persevered. In a companion&#xD;
      study of the same year, those investigators showed that ES upregulated brain-derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor and its receptor trkB within the first 2 days after surgery. Brushart et&#xD;
      al showed that brief low frequency ES improves the specificity of reinnervation. Geremia et&#xD;
      al performed a pivotal study showing an increase in axonal regeneration in sensory neurons if&#xD;
      the period of post-surgical ES was no more than 1 hr. The effect was blunted if the&#xD;
      stimulation period was any longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no studies have been done to look at the effect of pre-operative conditioning on&#xD;
      sensory reinnervation of human peripheral nerves with ES. Given the promising nature of the&#xD;
      animal data from Senger et al, and the well documented effectiveness of post-operative&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of surgically repaired peripheral nerves, we designed this study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of pre-operative conditioning with ES, as well as pre-operative and&#xD;
      post-operative ES on digital nerve sensory recovery post transection and repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are two-fold. To determine the effect of pre-operative ES alone,&#xD;
      as well as combined with post-operative ES on digital nerve regeneration of sensation,&#xD;
      post-transection and surgical repair, when compared to control patients with surgery alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method/Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blinded randomized placebo controlled trial that tests the effect of ES on&#xD;
      sensory (digital) nerve recovery in the human hand. Patients will be recruited in the hand&#xD;
      trauma (Plastic Surgery) clinics across Edmonton. Once consented for the research study, the&#xD;
      subject will undergo a battery of tests (Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Test, 2-point&#xD;
      discrimination, quantitative sensory testing for cold, warm and heat pain thresholds, as well&#xD;
      as the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] questionnaire) preoperatively to&#xD;
      determine their baseline deficit prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeons and intraoperative staff will be blinded from the experimental treatment. All&#xD;
      procedure is the same for every patient in the operating suite. Patients will receive the&#xD;
      standard-of-care surgical repair of their digital nerve with microscopic magnification and&#xD;
      using fine-gauge sutures. Every patient will have 2 fine-gauge Teflon insulated wires&#xD;
      (sterilized at the hospital where the surgery is done) inserted proximal to the nerve injury&#xD;
      site, away from the suture site, 3 days pre-operatively and immediately post operatively.&#xD;
      Those wires will be attached to the electrical stimulator that activates the nerve and send&#xD;
      action potentials towards the cell body. For that reason, the patient must not receive local&#xD;
      anesthetic because that would block the sodium channels, abolishing action potential&#xD;
      propagation and nullify the effects of electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Recovery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for baseline characteristics three days prior to the scheduled&#xD;
      surgical date,l fine-gauge wires will be implanted percutaneous proximal to the presumed&#xD;
      nerve injury site, these wires will be attached to an electrical stimulator (model SD9, Grass&#xD;
      Instruments, Providence, RI, USA). At that point, the personnel directly connected to the&#xD;
      study will leave the room. A research assistant who is not otherwise connected to the study&#xD;
      will take over. An opaque envelope that contains a computed generated randomization code will&#xD;
      be opened to determine the patient treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group A: Pre-operative stimulation with sham post-operative stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to this group will receive 1 hour of continuous electrical stimulation&#xD;
      three days prior to scheduled surgical date. The frequency will be fixed at 20Hz and the&#xD;
      voltage and duration of electrical pulses will be sequentially increased to the maximum&#xD;
      tolerable limit. As the nerve becomes accustomed to the sensation of the stimulation, the&#xD;
      voltage is increased to the next tolerable threshold and this is repeated throughout the&#xD;
      one-hour period. Once the stimulation is complete, the stimulator is detached and the patient&#xD;
      is informed of the surgical date. The wires are taken out at the conclusion of the&#xD;
      pre-operative appointment. These patients will have fine gauge wires for post-operative sham&#xD;
      stimulation implanted at the time of surgery. In the post-operative recovery room the&#xD;
      stimulator is attached to their wires. However, the voltage will only be increased to a level&#xD;
      they are able to sense. The stimulator was then be turned off without the patients'&#xD;
      knowledge. All connections are left in place. These patients will have their wires removed at&#xD;
      the first follow-up within 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group B: Pre-operative and post-operative stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to this group will receive 1 hour of continuous electrical stimulation&#xD;
      three days prior to scheduled surgical date and then again immediately post operatively. The&#xD;
      frequency will be fixed at 20Hz and the voltage and duration of electrical pulses will be&#xD;
      sequentially increased to the maximum tolerable limit. As the nerve becomes accustomed to the&#xD;
      sensation of the stimulation, the voltage is increased to the next tolerable threshold and&#xD;
      this is repeated throughout the one-hour period. Once the stimulation is complete, the&#xD;
      stimulator is detached and the patient is informed of the surgical date. The wires are taken&#xD;
      out at the conclusion of the pre-operative appointment. Patients randomized to this group&#xD;
      will also receive 1 hour of continuous electrical stimulation post-operatively. These&#xD;
      patients will have fine gauge wires for post-operative stimulation implanted at the time of&#xD;
      surgery. In the post-operative recovery room the stimulator is attached to their wires. The&#xD;
      frequency will be fixed at 20Hz and the voltage and duration of electrical pulses will be&#xD;
      sequentially increased to the maximum tolerable limit. As the nerve becomes accustomed to the&#xD;
      sensation of the stimulation, the voltage is increased to the next tolerable threshold and&#xD;
      this is repeated throughout the one hour period. Once the stimulation is complete, the&#xD;
      stimulator is detached and the patient is informed of the next follow-up. The wires are taken&#xD;
      out at the first follow-up within a week with the first dressing and splint change&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham-Placebo Control Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will have the stimulator attached to their wires 3 days prior to scheduled&#xD;
      surgical date and postoperatively as were in the previous groups. However, the voltage will&#xD;
      only be increased to a level they are able to sense. The stimulator was then be turned off&#xD;
      without the patients' knowledge. All connections are left in place for a hour duration. These&#xD;
      patients will similarly have their wires removed after the conclusion of their pre-operative&#xD;
      appointment and at the first post-operative follow-up within 1 week of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a one week post-operative visit, and then subsequently be followed&#xD;
      monthly where the previously mentioned sensory nerve assessment tests as well as sensory&#xD;
      nerve conduction studies and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure will be done.&#xD;
      There are a total of six monthly visits, each visit will take about 1.5h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a pivotal paper by Geremia et al; in the rat the difference in the number of&#xD;
      regenerated sensory axons following 1h ES was 397+/-321 (SD) compared to the controls. With&#xD;
      the type I error set at 0.05 and the type II error at 0.80, a sample size of 20 would be&#xD;
      needed in the treatment group and the same number in the control group. To account for 10% of&#xD;
      potential patients loss to follow-up we aim to recruit a total of 66 patients. An interim&#xD;
      analysis will be done by the data monitoring team once the first 10 patients have completed&#xD;
      their 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per protocol analysis will be completed. All results will be reported as mean + standard&#xD;
      deviation. Student t test and Fischer exact test will be preformed to determine demographic&#xD;
      differences between treatment groups. Differences in sensory testing results will be&#xD;
      evaluated via chi square testing. ANOVA will be used to determine reproducibility of testing&#xD;
      by comparing outcomes to the contralateral hand. ANOVA variance analysis will also be&#xD;
      preformed on all post treatment time points to determine whether the treatments differ over&#xD;
      time. A 5% (alpha) level will be considered a statistically significant difference.&#xD;
