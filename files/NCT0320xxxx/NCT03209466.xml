  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is controversy regarding the utility of antiseptics in wound management for diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcer syndrome. The aim of this study is to assess chlorhexidine gluconate at 0.125% vs.&#xD;
      saline solution to reduce the ulcerated area in patients with diabetic ulcer syndrome. A&#xD;
      clinical trial model to evaluate modifications in size and area is proposed. Patients to be&#xD;
      included will be those with diabetic foot ulcers Graded II accordingly to the University of&#xD;
      Texas wound classification system.&#xD;

      This study will be done in Hospital General de Leon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: People with diabetic foot syndrome grade IIb in Guanajuato Mexico&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universe: People with diabetes mellitus and diabetic foot syndrome in Guanajuato&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: Patients with diabetes mellitus over age of 18 years old, that present to the wound´s&#xD;
      clinic of Hospital General Leon with diabetic foot ulcers classified as Texas IIB. This&#xD;
      clinic provides services to patients in Guanajuato with diabetic foot syndrome, including&#xD;
      them in a multidisciplinary management program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: A minimal sample of 35 patients for each arm of the study was&#xD;
      calculated. Each study arm will be balanced considering the size. Potency was calculated at&#xD;
      0.8 and alpha value at 0-5, to detect a difference of 25% on the ulcer size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be invited to participate in the study consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      presented with diabetic foot ulcers Graded II accordingly to the University of Texas wound&#xD;
      classification system, in the area of Clinical wounds of Hospital General Leon between May&#xD;
      and December 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After explaining the study information and check it is understandable, the investigators&#xD;
      provide the sheet to signed the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently selected patients will be measure the ankle brachial index and determine the&#xD;
      absence of vascular compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history with emphasis on analyzing clinical data, including the characteristics of&#xD;
      the ulcer (type of exudate, measured surface area affected , type of tissue involved in the&#xD;
      ulcer to its depth ) and biochemical parameters will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be weighed and measured at the first visit and those who don't have biochemical&#xD;
      data will be requested to collect this information in subsequent follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be then treated with the principles of the standard treatment, under&#xD;
      the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove the ulcer exudate by spraying one of the two ingredients making mechanical drive&#xD;
           for 5 minutes, or until completely negative to the visual evidence of exudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completely remove hyperkeratosis and devitalized tissue from the periphery of the ulcer&#xD;
           with cutting material dissection with sterile dressing and drag, until visually&#xD;
           eliminate the exudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treated area is dried.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two photographs at a distance of 20 cm perpendicular to the ulcer will be taken,&#xD;
           covering a 1 square centimeter reference for measuring the area affected by diabetic&#xD;
           foot ulcer syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The solution will be applied in a blinded way to the ulcer and covered with sterile&#xD;
           gauze for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be instructed to continue treatment every 24 hours as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sterile gauze will be removed and continuously irrigate for 5 seconds with the&#xD;
           ingredient that was assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undiscovered for 24 hours, until the next day irrigation gauze area will be placed. Also&#xD;
           need to avoid contact with any surface over the affected area until the next assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform the same strategy for 24 hours, and on day 7 must go to the wound clinic to&#xD;
           clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 7 days until complete 6 views, clinical evaluation is performed, irrigation with&#xD;
           the selected ingredient and it will take 2 pictures at a distance of 20 cm perpendicular&#xD;
           to the ulcer again, covering a reference of 1 square centimeter to measure the area&#xD;
           affected by the diabetic foot ulcer syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week during the following 6 weeks, in the wound clinic consultation, it will be&#xD;
      measured and gather information of the following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ulcer area in square millimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Color of the ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of exudate; turbid, serous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of tissue involved in the ulcer to its depth. If any patients have increased&#xD;
           intensity of the signs and symptoms of diabetic foot syndrome, classified as a major&#xD;
           step on the scale of ulcers Classification System of the University of Texas, perform&#xD;
           analysis and comprehensive treatment will be redefined according to the suggestions of&#xD;
           ulcer classification system of the University of Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cleaning material for the ulcer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingredient 1: Preparation of spray application of chlorhexidine gluconate 0.125%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingredient 2: Preparation of spray application of physiological saline sterile solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of application of ingredients as described previously. Method of randomization: will&#xD;
      be effected since the fabrication of the ingredient by assigning a code number to each of the&#xD;
      bottles that contained. Those bottles will have identical presentations, and will balance for&#xD;
      the sample size. The code will not be known by the patient, observer and analyst. Only be&#xD;
      known by one of the advisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The description of the data, in the case of non-numerical variables will be performed by&#xD;
      reporting proportions and confidence interval of 95 % (95 %) in the case of numerical&#xD;
      variables, the description will be made based on averages and standard deviation or medians&#xD;
      and Q1- Q3 range, depending on the result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to evaluate the&#xD;
      Gaussian distribution of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of numerical variables were not performed by Chi square test. Comparison of the&#xD;
      rates of reduction in the size of ulcers of diabetic foot syndrome for both treatments will&#xD;
      be based on the t test for independent samples or by Kruskal- Wallis test, depending on data&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases be considered as the significance level alpha value &lt;0.05.&#xD;
