  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the safety, tolerability and how well durvalumab and tremelimumab&#xD;
      work in treating participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer who have not received&#xD;
      chemotherapy (chemotherapy naïve) and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic).&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab plus tremelimumab in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of durvalumab plus tremelimumab in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. II. To explore immunological changes in peripheral&#xD;
      blood and tissue (e.g. peripheral blood cluster of differentiation [CD] 4+ [Inducible&#xD;
      COStimulator (ICOS)]+ T cells, CD3 expression in tissue) in response to durvalumab plus&#xD;
      tremelimumab in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and durvalumab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles for tremelimumab and up&#xD;
      to 13 cycles for durvalumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, and&#xD;
      then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
