  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out in order to evaluate a new cancer vaccine called IMA970A&#xD;
      combined with CV8102, a new adjuvant for the treatment of liver cancer (hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma). It will be investigated whether IMA970A and CV8102 is safe and can trigger an&#xD;
      immune response against the tumor, which may prevent the tumor (cancer) from recurring or&#xD;
      spreading or may even lead to tumor shrinkage following the standard treatments the patients&#xD;
      have previously received.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, first-in-man phase I/II&#xD;
      study investigating an off-the-shelf, multi-peptide-based HCC vaccine (IMA970A) plus CV8102&#xD;
      adjuvant (RNAdjuvantÂ®) following a single pre-vaccination infusion of low-dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (CY) acting as an immunomodulator, in patients with very early, early and&#xD;
      intermediate stage HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment is applied without any concomitant anti-tumor therapy, with the intention&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence/progression in patients who have received all&#xD;
      indicated standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, it is planned to treat about 40 patients with IMA970A (off-the-shelf vaccine) plus&#xD;
      CV8102 (adjuvant) plus a single low-dose of pre-vaccination CY acting as an immunomodulator&#xD;
      in the HepaVac-101 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are requested to sign the 1st informed consent (IC 1) for screening 1 procedures&#xD;
      (blood drawings for Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing and for cellular immunomonitoring,&#xD;
      capture of demographics and staging of disease [routinely performed, older images may be used&#xD;
      if requirements are met]), which takes up to 4 weeks. Thereafter, patients receive indicated&#xD;
      standard treatment followed by recovery, which lasts for at least 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks.&#xD;
      The main-phase with full safety surveillance starts with the patient's signature of the 2nd&#xD;
      informed consent (IC 2) and lasts until the end of the EoV (End-of-Visit, Visit 10) Visit&#xD;
      (4-6 weeks after last vaccination). For each patient this main-phase lasts up to approx. 6.5&#xD;
      months consisting of up to 4 weeks screening 2, about 4.5 months vaccination period and about&#xD;
      4 weeks follow up (until EOV Visit [Visit 10]).&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessments will consist of continuous monitoring and reporting of adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs), regular monitoring of vital signs, ECOG performance status and regular conduct of physical examinations and laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical [bio]chemistry including C reactive protein (CRP) and Glomerular Filtration rate (GFR), coagulation test, assessment of viral infection, thyroid function test (TFT), urinalysis), electrocardiogram (ECG) and pregnancy tests (if applicable). Additionally, an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be implemented to evaluate safety data independently and at defined intervals.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity (T-cell response in peripheral blood)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of immunogenicity will be performed for all patients using standardized immunomonitoring assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients will be analyzed for the occurrence of T-cell responses to peptides contained in IMA970A vaccine before application of standard therapy, such as before and after vaccination. The induction of immune responses by IMA970A vaccine will be subsequently analyzed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infiltrating T-lymphocytes, immune cells and potential other (bio)markers in tumor tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of paraffin-embedded tumor tissues (also potentially in liquid-nitrogen frozen tissue, if available) will be performed to characterize both the tumor cells and the tumor-infiltrating components by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and potentially other analysis techniques. Classical hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining will be first performed to assess the cellular and stroma composition of the tumor tissue. Markers such as Cytokeratin 8, Cytokeratin 18 and HepPar-1, will be assessed to distinguish tumor cells from other cellular components. The tumor infiltrating cells will be characterized to assess leukocyte subpopulations such as myeloid (monocyte-macrophages, granulocytes) and lymphoid (T, B, NK) cells.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of the potential impact of the standard therapy on the natural imune response to peptides contained in IMA970A</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of the natural immune response to peptides contained in IMA970A will be performed before start of standard anti-tumor therapy and thereafter to assess whether the selected standard therapy has an influence on a potentially pre-existing (natural) immune response.</description>
