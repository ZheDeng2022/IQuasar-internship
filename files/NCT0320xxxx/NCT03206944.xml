    <textblock>
      The reducing the anti-aggregation properties of platelets significantly decreases the risk of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and the total number of cardiovascular events. In patients who have&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, anti-platelet therapy reduces the risk of serious vascular events.&#xD;
      Side effects, such as bleeding, are relatively small so the benefits of anti-platelet therapy&#xD;
      in secondary prevention exceed the risk of these side effects. According to guidelines for&#xD;
      the treatment of arterial hypertension, PTNT 2015, patients with arterial hypertension (HA)&#xD;
      that have a 20% or higher risk for cardiovascular events in the next 10 years, should have&#xD;
      ASA included in their treatment to reduce this risk. It has been proved that the use of&#xD;
      acetylsalicylic acid in secondary prevention reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      while the benefits of ASA in primary prevention have recently been debated. The benefits of&#xD;
      using ASA in primary prevention should always be confronted with the risk of hemorrhagic&#xD;
      complications of this therapy According to 2016 European Guidelines on cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) prevention in clinical practice, anti-platelet therapy is not recommended in&#xD;
      individuals who do not suffer from CVD, due to the increased risk of major bleeding. It is&#xD;
      important to look for alternative anti-platelet therapy for people with cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. Standardized tomato extract (STE) does not cause side effects and may have multiple&#xD;
      beneficial effects on total cardiovascular risk, primarily by inhibiting platelet&#xD;
      aggregation. Since its discovery in 1999, several studies and human trials with STE have been&#xD;
      carried out. During the last 50 years, tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) has become a highly&#xD;
      consumed food. The benefits of inhibiting platelet activity through diet are currently&#xD;
      difficult to determine due to the lack of clear and comprehensive scientific data. It is&#xD;
      difficult to specify the over activity of the plaques or their proper activity. However,&#xD;
      there are data available that indicate the benefits of a diet containing diminishing activity&#xD;
      of platelets (Mediterranean diet) and lowering cardiovascular risk.The investigators want to&#xD;
      conduct a comparison of the less common STE with clinically recognized ASA. The aim of the&#xD;
      study was to compare the anti-platelet effect of STE and ASA in hypertensive patients with&#xD;
      high cardiovascular risk.The study highlights that STE may be an alternative, food-based&#xD;
      strategy to control the platelets reactivity.&#xD;

      Study design The study involved 82 high-risk hypertensive patients (44 men and 38 women),&#xD;
      aged 28-74years, conducted between July 2015 and February 2017 in the Department of&#xD;
      Hypertension at the University of Medical Sciences in Poznan. Seventeen patients reported&#xD;
      resignation during the study. The permission no. 377/15 to conduct the study was published by&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee at the Poznan University of Medical Sciences. All the patients gave&#xD;
      informed consent for participation in the study. Patients with primary hypertension and high&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1(ASA) included 33&#xD;
      patients who received acetylsalicylic acid at a dose of 75 mg in the morning. Group 2 (STE)&#xD;
      included 32 patients receiving standardized tomato extract (STE) (ZAAX, Sequia, Poland) at a&#xD;
      dose of 213 mg orally in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients had two visits within 4 weeks according to the scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: During the first visit, patients were qualified for the study. The patients with&#xD;
      previously diagnosed hypertension were referred from an outpatient clinic, to the hospital&#xD;
      ward. After admission, the patients with high cardiovascular risk were isolated and written&#xD;
      consents were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of stage of hypertension, presence of risk factors and subclinical organ damage,&#xD;
      diabetes coexistence, cardiovascular complications and chronic kidney disease the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk was estimated. Each patient with one or two risk factors and a blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) &gt; 180/110 mmHg or three or more risk factors, and a BP &gt;160/100 mmHg or with&#xD;
      the presence of organ damage and BP &gt;140/90 mmHg were classified as a high risk Group.There&#xD;
      have been no changes in the concomitant treatment (lipid-lowering, anti-hypertensive and&#xD;
      antidiabetic) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous laboratory tests and imaging, such as aldosterone and ARO levels, both before and&#xD;
      after tilting, creatinine, urea, GFR, sodium, potassium, pro BNP, TSH, FT3, FT4, and a&#xD;
      24-hour collection for electrolytes were collected. Abdominal ultrasound examinations,&#xD;
      computed tomography of the abdomen, and Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries were&#xD;
      performed to exclude secondary causes of hypertension. Clinical BP measurements were&#xD;
      performed three times, as well as, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and&#xD;
      echocardiography was conducted. Whole blood samples were taken and baseline platelet&#xD;
      aggregation was determined using the VerifyNow analyzer from Accumetrics. In Group 1, two&#xD;
      whole blood samples for VerifyNow Aspirin test were assayed. In Group 2, four whole blood&#xD;
      samples for VerifyNow Aspirin and P2Y12 tests were assayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: After 4 weeks of taking STE or ASA the patients visited the hospital for the second&#xD;
      visit. All examinations from visit 1, including platelet aggregation inhibition assays, were&#xD;
      repeated. Whole blood samples were collected 1-4 h after the ingestion of a morning ASA or&#xD;
      STE dose from a peripheral vein using a 21 gauge or larger needle in a partial fill 3.2%&#xD;
      citrate vacuum collection tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standarized tomato extract characteristics STE is a water-soluble tomato concentrate, free of&#xD;
      lycopene and fats, which contains 37 biologically active compounds of well-known structure.&#xD;
      These bioactive compounds contain nucleosides (adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, inosine, AMP,&#xD;
      GMP), polyphenols including flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, kemferol, luteoline, naryngenin)&#xD;
      and phenolic acids (chlorogenic, coffee, p-coumar, ferulic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved the water soluble tomato&#xD;
      concentrate (WSTC) as a food supplement which helps to maintain normal platelet aggregation.&#xD;
      EFSA recommended the use of STE in healthy individuals between 35 and 70. The effective daily&#xD;
      dose was 3 g of bioactive compounds contained in syrup or 65-150 mg in powdered form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This extract affects the inhibition of ADP-mediated aggregation, thromboxane, collagen, von&#xD;
      Willebrand factor, thrombin and inflammatory mediators. What is more, it blocks the P2Y12&#xD;
      receptor for ADP and limits intracellular granular release of thromboxane, ADP, selectin P&#xD;
      and factor 4 (PF4, platelet factor 4). Additionally, it prevents activation of αIIbβIII&#xD;
      integrin and inhibits (GP) IIb / IIIa receptor activation. By inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor&#xD;
      for ADP, it increases cAMP activity and this results in decreasing intracellular calcium ions&#xD;
      concentration. Inhibition of collagen binding process with GP VI as well as von Willebrand&#xD;
      factor with GP Ib receptor and decrease in Cβ and Cy2 phospholipase activity are also&#xD;
      included in anti-aggregation effects of STE. These phenomena affect the shape of thrombocytha&#xD;
      and are reversible while maintaining a level of platelet activity that allows aggregation in&#xD;
      case of vascular injury. ZAAX can be used by people with hypersensitivity to salicylates and&#xD;
      other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with bronchial asthma, with active peptic&#xD;
      ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that STE inhibits the activation of endothelial inflammatory processes,&#xD;
      which prevents the development of atherosclerosis. STE reduces the production of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-12) and to increases the synthesis of interleukin 10, which&#xD;
      has anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VerifyNow® Tests Procedure The study protocol included measurements of platelet reactivity&#xD;
      using a VerifyNow Tests Procedure (Accumetrics Inc., USA). This method detects platelet&#xD;
      activity by measurement of platelet aggregation, in a blood sample, exposed to a specific&#xD;
      agonist. This leads to an inhibition of platelet function in response to anti-platelet&#xD;
      therapy. The VerifyNow System is a whole blood device that performs qualitative measurement&#xD;
      of induced platelet aggregation based on the increase in light transmittance. Two types of&#xD;
      VerifyNow test kits were used in the study: VerifyNow Aspirin Test and VerifyNow P2Y12. The&#xD;
      Aspirin test results are reported as Aspirin Reaction Units (ARU), which are calculated as a&#xD;
      function of the rate of aggregation. ARU values less than 550 indicate effective result of&#xD;
      ASA, while values &gt; 550 ARU indicate no effect of the drug. The VerifyNow P2Y12 test measures&#xD;
      platelet function based on the ability of activated platelets to bind fibrinogen and provides&#xD;
      information on the aggravation of platelet aggregation in reactivity units of P2Y12 receptor&#xD;
      (PRU). It is considered that the range of 95 - 208 PRU is responsible for optimal&#xD;
      antiplatelet activity. High PRU values after drug administration, point to the lack of&#xD;
      expected anti-platelet effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measurements In all the patients, during each visit, BP measurements were&#xD;
      performed three times at rest, in the supine position, in standard conditions, and using an&#xD;
      upper arm blood pressure monitor (Omron 705IT). Ambulatory, 24-hour blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements (ABPM) were carried out using an A&amp;D, 24-hour ambulatory peripheral blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor. The frequency of measurements was every 15 minutes between 7:00 and 22:00&#xD;
      and every 30 minutes between 22:00 and 7:00.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed with Statistica, version 12.5.&#xD;
      (StatSoft, USA). Since the tested data did not meet the assumption of Gaussian distribution&#xD;
      (evaluated with Shapiro-Wilk method), the non-parametric methods were applied. The Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank test was used for evaluation of the differences between the initial values and&#xD;
      the values obtained after the treatment, for factors of; body weight composition, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and platelet aggregation. To evaluate differences and correlations between the two&#xD;
      independent groups the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman׳s rank correlation coefficient (Rs)&#xD;
      were used, respectively. The data presented on graphs and tables included median and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges. A p&lt;0.05 was considered as significant.&#xD;
