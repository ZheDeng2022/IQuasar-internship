  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Although exclusively breastfeeding is recommended up to six months, current&#xD;
      breastfeeding rates are still far from recommended targets. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of the information on breast milk substitutes at discharge on&#xD;
      breastfeeding rates at six months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled trial has been designed. All mother-infant pairs will be&#xD;
      randomized to either receive the written information of the name of a breast milk substitute&#xD;
      on the infant's discharge documents (group A) or not to receive it (group B). Mothers will&#xD;
      receive a phone interview on mode of infants' feeding at 7 days,1, 2 , 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      delivery. Reasons for early discontinuation of breastfeeding according to mothers' opinion&#xD;
      will be also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: In order to detect a 10% difference in the discontinuation rate of exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding at six months of age between groups, at 5% significance and 80% power, a total&#xD;
      of 388 mother-infant pairs per group will need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data will be expressed as mean±SD or number of observations (percentage). With&#xD;
      regard to the items that were scored on a 5-point Likert scale, for the analysis, the answers&#xD;
      will categorize into two groups (not important and important).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between groups in breastfeeding rates at each time point of the study will be&#xD;
      assessed by the T-test analysis. The X2 test will be used for comparisons between discrete&#xD;
      variables. Statistical significance is set at a = .05 level. All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed by using SPSS (version 12, SPSS, Chicago, IL).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: To investigators' knowledge there is paucity of data regarding the effect of the&#xD;
      information of breast milk substitutes written on newborn's discharge medical documents on&#xD;
      subsequent breastfeeding behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of the information of breast milk&#xD;
      substitutes written on newborn's discharge documents on breastfeeding rates at six months of&#xD;
      age in a cohort of mothers exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge. The hypothesis to&#xD;
      be tested is that the breastfeeding rates of the mothers receiving the written information of&#xD;
      the name of a breast milk substitute at discharge would be similar to that of the&#xD;
      breastfeeding mothers not receiving it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Statement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura&#xD;
      a Carattere Scientifico Cà Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, and informed written consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will conduct a prospective, controlled, single-blinded randomized trial.&#xD;
      Breastfeeding will be promoted and supported in all mother-infant pairs throughout hospital&#xD;
      stay. Enrollment and randomization will occur concurrently at discharge. Mother-infant pairs&#xD;
      will be randomized either to receive the written information of the name of a breast milk&#xD;
      substitute on the infant's discharge documents (group A) or not to receive it (group B).&#xD;
      Randomization to group A or B will be performed by an independent investigator with a random&#xD;
      permuted block size of 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment the following maternal variables will be collected through a face to face&#xD;
      interview: mode of delivery (vaginal delivery/caesarean section), being primiparous or&#xD;
      multiparous, previous breastfeeding experience (yes/no; if yes how many days/months), labour&#xD;
      duration, drugs consumption during pregnancy and/or labour, including analgesia or&#xD;
      anesthesia, diseases arisen during pregnancy, maternal education classified as low (≤13&#xD;
      years) or high (&gt;13 years), pre and post pregnancy body mass index (kg/m2), marital status,&#xD;
      age and attitude towards smoking. Mothers will be also interviewed on pre pregnancy course&#xD;
      attendance, intention to breastfeed and satisfaction with the breastfeeding support received&#xD;
      during hospital stay. Timing of the first latching will be also registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following neonatal variables will be also collected: gestational age, gender, Apgar score&#xD;
      values at 1 and 5 minutes, birth weight, length and head circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will be contacted at 7 (±3) days,1 (±7 days), 2 (±7 days), 3 (±7 days), 6 (±7 days)&#xD;
      months after delivery by phone calls by four investigators blinded to randomization.&#xD;
      Following a structured interview mothers will be asked whether the infant had been breastfed&#xD;
      during the last 24 hours. Mothers will be then asked whether the infant had been fed any&#xD;
      water and/or fruit juice and/or formula and/or semi solid and/or solid foods during the last&#xD;
      24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mode of feeding (exclusive breastfeeding, predominant breastfeeding, mixed breastfeeding&#xD;
      exclusive formula feeding) will be then categorized according to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the infant will be no more breastfed, mothers will be administered a questionnaire&#xD;
      modified after Odom et al. in order to investigate the main reasons associated with&#xD;
      breastfeeding discontinuation. Specifically, the questionnaire focuses on the following 7&#xD;
      macro areas: lactation problems, milk-pumping factors, psychosocial factors, nutritional&#xD;
      factors, life style factors, medical problems, factors related to the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will be asked to rate the importance of each item of the questionnaire according to a&#xD;
      5-point Likert scale: score 1=not at all important, score=2=not very important, score=3&#xD;
      moderately important, score=4 important, score=5 extremely important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be assessed based on inquiries to the mothers. All adverse events will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the investigator for severity. An adverse event will be defined as any event&#xD;
      that will not be consistent with the information provided in the consent form or that could&#xD;
      not reasonably be expected to accompany the natural history and progression of the subject's&#xD;
      condition throughout the study. Adverse events will be considered serious if fatal or&#xD;
      life-threatening, require hospitalization or surgical intervention, result in persistent or&#xD;
      significant disability/incapacity or are considered to be medically relevant by the&#xD;
      investigator. All other adverse events will be categorized as non-serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to detect a 10% difference in the discontinuation rate of exclusive breastfeeding at&#xD;
      six months of age between groups, at 5% significance and 80% power, a total of 388&#xD;
      mother-infant pairs per group were needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data will be expressed as mean±SD or number of observations (percentage). With&#xD;
      regard to the items that are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, for the analysis, the answers&#xD;
      will be categorized into two groups (not important and important).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between groups in breastfeeding rates at each time point of the study will be&#xD;
      assessed by the T-test analysis. The X2 test will be used for comparisons between discrete&#xD;
      variables. Statistical significance will be set at a = .05 level. All statistical analyses&#xD;
      will be performed by using SPSS (version 12, SPSS, Chicago, IL).&#xD;
