  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study evaluates the use of Laser-Assisted Immunotherapy (LIT) plus placebo and LIT plus&#xD;
      low-dose cyclophosphamide versus that of Standard of Care in patients presenting with Stage&#xD;
      IIIA, IIIB or IV breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-third of enrolled patients will receive LIT plus placebo, one-third will receive LIT plus&#xD;
      low-dose cyclophosphamide, and one-third will be assigned to a control group that receives&#xD;
      Standard of Care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser-Assisted Immunotherapy (LIT) is intended to a systemic anti-tumor immune response by&#xD;
      priming a tumor with laser energy to liberate an array of tumor antigens from whole cells,&#xD;
      immediately followed by administration of the immune stimulant Glycated Chitosan (GC), which&#xD;
      is designed to activate antigen presenting cells and facilitate the uptake of tumor antigens.&#xD;
      In turn, the antigen presenting cells activate the patient's immune system, resulting in an&#xD;
      immune response towards the remaining tumor(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study it is investigated if the addition of low-dose cyclophosphamide increases the&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune response of LIT, as well as comparing the effect of LIT plus Placebo or LIT&#xD;
      plus low-dose cyclophosphamide to a control arm of patients receiving Standard of Care&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive laser-assisted immunotherapy along with Placebo cyclophosphamide tablets. Patients' laser-assisted immunotherapy treatment will be based on the number and size of laser-accessible solid tumors available at the time of treatment. In and around each photothermal laser-treated site will be injected 1 mL of 1% Glycated Chitosan (GC) Injection, with a total of up to 4 sites being treated per patient. The maximum dose of GC Injection that a patient can receive in 1 visit is 4 mL.</description>

             thrombosis, abnormal hyper-coagulation profile, or symptomatic pulmonary embolism) or&#xD;
             would complicate the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patient has any other condition that may cause an increased risk associated with the&#xD;
             study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
