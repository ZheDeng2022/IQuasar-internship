  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter single-arm phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of olaparib in patients diagnosed of advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with&#xD;
      methylation of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 promoters assessed in DNA from metastatic lesions and&#xD;
      absence of BRCA1 and 2 germline mutations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must have received at least one previous regimen in the advance disease setting and&#xD;
      must have at least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed according to RECIST&#xD;
      v.1.1. Potential eligible patients will be screened to assess somatic (s) BRCA promoter&#xD;
      methylation at an reference central laboratory. Germinal (g) BRCA mutational status will be&#xD;
      analyzed also centrally at 'Myriad Genetics GmBh' laboratory unless the BRCA mutational&#xD;
      status is already known based on a Myriad previous report. Patients with a positive&#xD;
      methylation status on at least one of the two genes and lacking of known deleterious or&#xD;
      suspected deleterious mutations in both genes could be enrolled in the study and receive&#xD;
      olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and tumor samples collected from all screened patients could be used for the biomarker&#xD;
      analysis, including the assessment of germline methylation status and gene expression levels&#xD;
      of BRCA1/2. An early efficacy review will be performed after 12 evaluable patients are&#xD;
      enrolled; if at least 4 of them show tumour response, additional patients will be included to&#xD;
      complete a total of 34 patients.&#xD;

         14. *Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. *Breast feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. *Immunocompromised patients, e.g. patients who are known to be serologically positive&#xD;
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. *Patients with known active hepatitis (i.e., Hepatitis B or C) due to risk of&#xD;
             transmitting the infection through blood or other body fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. *Patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. *Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical&#xD;
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation&#xD;
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. Examples&#xD;
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal&#xD;
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, moderate or severe hepatic impairment&#xD;
             (according to Child-Pugh classification), an extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
             disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) or any psychiatric disorder that&#xD;
             prohibits obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. *Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood&#xD;
             transplantation (dUCBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. *Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to entry to the study (packed red&#xD;
             blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable, for timing refer to inclusion&#xD;
             criteria no 10).&#xD;
