  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of alpelisib when given together&#xD;
      with enzalutamide in treating patients with androgen receptor and PTEN positive breast cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to other places in the body. Alpelisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Androgen receptor can cause the growth&#xD;
      of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using enzalutamide may fight breast cancer by&#xD;
      lowering the amount of androgen the body makes. Giving alpelisib and enzalutamide may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      the combination of alpelisib (BYL719) and enzalutamide in patients with androgen receptor&#xD;
      (AR)-positive and PTEN-positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combination of BYL179 and&#xD;
      enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety profile of BYL179 and enzalutamide used in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Progression-free survival (PFS) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response or&#xD;
      partial response + prolonged stable disease) after a 16-week treatment of BYL719 and&#xD;
      enzalutamide per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the association between aberrant circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating&#xD;
      tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA), and CBR at 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the association between PIK3CA and PTEN mutations and treatment response to&#xD;
      the combination of BYL179 and enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the association between PIK3CA mutation status change in ctDNA and&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the molecular (CTC, ctDNA) profile of tumors that become resistant to&#xD;
      treatment in comparison with those prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the association between the AR expression level measured by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor and CBR at 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alpelisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive alpelisib orally (PO) and enzalutamide PO on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
