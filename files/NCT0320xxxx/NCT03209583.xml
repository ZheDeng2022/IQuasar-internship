  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects approximately 1% of newborns in the US, with 25% of&#xD;
      those affected having critical conditions requiring open heart surgery within one year of&#xD;
      birth. Surgical and medical advances have allowed many patients to live beyond their fourth&#xD;
      and fifth decades of life. Unfortunately, cardiac arrhythmias are a relatively common sequela&#xD;
      due to cardiac anomalies and surgical scars in addition to residual volume and pressure load&#xD;
      on the heart. Atrial arrhythmias, including sinus node dysfunction and intra-atrial&#xD;
      re-entrant tachycardia (IART) are among the more common abnormalities found in adults with&#xD;
      repaired CHD. The presence of IART significantly increases morbidity and mortality, and&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic medications have been shown to be a sub-optimal treatment strategy with the&#xD;
      majority of patients requiring multi-drug therapy. Catheter ablation procedures remain a&#xD;
      treatment option, but are less successful for some patient demographics. In the mid-1990's,&#xD;
      pacemakers with atrial anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) capabilities were developed, primarily&#xD;
      for the management of atrial flutter and fibrillation in adults with structurally normal&#xD;
      hearts. Given the need for pacemakers in the CHD population to manage sinus node dysfunction&#xD;
      and atrioventricular node conduction block, the adoption of atrial anti-tachycardia&#xD;
      pacemakers began to gain favor. However, there is limited data available comparing the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of ATP therapy between various demographics of CHD patients. In the current&#xD;
      study, the investigators aim to determine if ATP is an effective treatment strategy for IART,&#xD;
      specifically within particular sub-populations of CHD patients. Additionally, investigators&#xD;
      hope to delineate any significant differences in efficacy of ATP treatment between adult and&#xD;
      pediatric congenital heart patients. The research team will accomplish our goals with a&#xD;
      retrospective, multi-center study in which data is collected from existing electronic medical&#xD;
      records and pacemaker interrogations. Following data collection, the investigators will&#xD;
      employ statistical analyses to determine if certain CHD demographics are statistically&#xD;
      significant predictors of ATP therapy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective/retrospective study is to determine how effective atrial&#xD;
      anti-tachycardia therapies are with the congenital heart patients who are known to have&#xD;
      atrial arrhythmias. As this population ages, we know that arrhythmic burden increases and&#xD;
      medications are increased or changed for symptomatic improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled at the time of anti tachycardia device (ATD) placement or when&#xD;
      device therapies are turned on. Patients will need a minimum of 5 years of clinical history&#xD;
      prior to implantation and after implantation (unless patient is very young). Data will be&#xD;
      collected both retrospectively and prospectively. The research team will consent patients at&#xD;
      the time of clinical evaluations and scheduled follow-ups (usually 3 - 6 months). If therapy&#xD;
      is effective, investigators will determine the specific programming which was successful. If&#xD;
      therapy was ineffective, investigators will also determine if a change in programing was made&#xD;
      and if this improved ATP efficacy. Investigators will also determine the arrhythmia burden.&#xD;
      Cardioversion and medications before and after ATD implantation will be the key determinants&#xD;
      of arrhythmia burden in this study.&#xD;

      University of Iowa is moving to begin the multi-institutional portion of this study by asking&#xD;
      for centers to assist with enrollment so that the investigators can meet our enrollment goal.&#xD;
      The investigators wish to recruit a minimum of 250 subjects and will collect data for up to&#xD;
      300 subjects. The research team will move to a retrospective and prospective enrollment&#xD;
      looking at how well ATP works in ATD therapy devices for patients who have CHD. No&#xD;
      interventions will take place as this is a chart review and observational study.&#xD;
