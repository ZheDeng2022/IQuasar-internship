  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a prevalent and impairing illness. To better understand the basic science&#xD;
      and treatment of depression, the investigators study the behavioral and brain processes&#xD;
      associated with learning in depression and how potential disruptions in learning may be&#xD;
      repaired. Understanding different methods that change learning may lead to novel treatments&#xD;
      that contribute to recovery in people with depression.&#xD;

      Major depressive disorder ranks among the most significant causes of mortality and disability&#xD;
      in the world. Recent data from the investigators and others highlight that impairments in&#xD;
      reward and loss learning are central to depression, have distinct neural substrates, and&#xD;
      improve with successful treatment. Together, these findings suggest an urgent need to&#xD;
      delineate the relationships among neural and behavioral learning impairments and depression.&#xD;
      Equally important, these insights suggest new targets for treatment such that manipulating&#xD;
      the neural and behavioral substrates of learning may facilitate symptom change in depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these issues, the investigators use functional neuroimaging and a computational&#xD;
      psychiatry framework to i) systematically characterize the neural and behavioral substrates&#xD;
      that attend reward- and loss- learning in depression and ii) assess the degree to which&#xD;
      learning in depression responds to two behavioral methods that target learning in different&#xD;
      ways. The investigators test the broad hypotheses that i) that depression may be&#xD;
      characterized by distinct neural and behavioral disruptions of learning, and ii) these&#xD;
      disruptions and associated symptoms may be ameliorated through different methods of guiding&#xD;
      learning. Recent advances in computational psychiatry provide a mechanism-based framework&#xD;
      within which to understand the nature and trajectory of potential learning impairments in&#xD;
      depression and suggest new ways that disrupted learning and associated symptoms may be&#xD;
      improved in depression&#xD;
