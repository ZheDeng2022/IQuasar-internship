  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death worldwide. However&#xD;
      smoking is a very difficult addiction to break whereby main reasons for not quitting or&#xD;
      relapsing after cessation are the nicotine withdrawal syndrome and post-cessational weight&#xD;
      gain. GLP-1 analogues are well known to stimulate insulin secretion and to reduce energy&#xD;
      intake and therefore body weight. Recent findings from animal and human studies suggest a&#xD;
      role of GLP-1 in the pathophysiology of addiction. The putative role of GLP-1 analogues in&#xD;
      nicotine reward regulation combined with its weight reducing effects might be of major&#xD;
      interest in view of novel pharmacotherapeutic options for smoking cessation.&#xD;

      Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death worldwide. However&#xD;
      smoking is a very difficult addiction to break and despite established smoking cessation&#xD;
      programs quit rates are low, especially in the real-life setting. The main reasons for not&#xD;
      quitting or relapsing after cessation are the nicotine withdrawal syndrome and&#xD;
      post-cessational weight gain. GLP-1 analogues are well known to stimulate insulin secretion&#xD;
      and to reduce energy intake and therefore body weight. Recent findings from animal and human&#xD;
      studies suggest a role of GLP-1 in the pathophysiology of addiction. The putative role of&#xD;
