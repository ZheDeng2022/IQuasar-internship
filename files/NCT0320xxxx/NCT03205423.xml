  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present proposal will evaluate the ability of gabapentin maintenance to reduce the abuse&#xD;
      liability of alcohol, oxycodone, and alcohol in combination with oxycodone in participants&#xD;
      with both Opioid Use Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the abuse of prescription opioid medications is a pervasive problem in the U.S. In&#xD;
      addition, co-abuse of opioids and alcohol represents a significant problem from the&#xD;
      perspective of increased toxicity and decreased success in treatment. Surprisingly few&#xD;
      studies have examined the effects of combined administration of opioids and alcohol in&#xD;
      humans, and no clinical studies have examined the reinforcing effects of this combination.&#xD;
      The current 8-9-week inpatient study will systematically evaluate gabapentin because it shows&#xD;
      promise for treating both opioid and alcohol use disorders (OUD and AUD). The guiding&#xD;
      principle is that a medication's effects on positive subjective responses and reinforcing&#xD;
      effects are the best laboratory procedures to date in predicting its clinical efficacy. We&#xD;
      will examine the ability of gabapentin to alter opioid-, alcohol-,and combined&#xD;
      opioid/alcohol-mediated responses. Participants will meet DSM-5 criteria for moderate-severe&#xD;
      OUD and be physically dependent on opioids. In addition, participants will meet DSM-5&#xD;
      criteria for moderate-severe AUD, but they will not be physically dependent on alcohol. All&#xD;
      of the participants will be maintained on oral morphine throughout the study and different&#xD;
      doses of gabapentin will be evaluated.&#xD;
