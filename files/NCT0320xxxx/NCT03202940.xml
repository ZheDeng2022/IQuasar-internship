  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug combination as a possible treatment for anaplastic&#xD;
      lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alectinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cobimetinib&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of&#xD;
      investigational drugs or new combinations of approved drugs. In addition, a Phase I study&#xD;
      tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for further studies.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied. Following the phase I study,&#xD;
      additional participants will be enrolled to the Phase II component. The phase II component&#xD;
      will test the safest doses of alectinib and cobimetinib (as identified in the Phase I&#xD;
      component) in a larger group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved alectinib as a treatment option&#xD;
      for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved cobimetinib as a treatment for this specific disease. However,&#xD;
      cobimetinib is approved for treatment of melanoma, another type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alectinib is an oral ALK inhibitor made by the pharmaceutical company Genentech. The term ALK&#xD;
      inhibitor means that alectinib targets the abnormal ALK protein that is causing your lung&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow. Alectinib has been tested in other clinical research studies and&#xD;
      results show that the drug may help stop the growth and spread of ALK+ lung cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cobimetinib is an oral inhibitor of MEK, a signaling protein that can cause some types of&#xD;
      lung cancer to grow. Cobimetinib is also made by Genentech. Laboratory studies suggest that&#xD;
      ALK and MEK may work together to help ALK+ lung cancer cells grow. In the laboratory,&#xD;
      combination treatment with drugs targeting ALK and MEK prevented lung cancer cells from&#xD;
      growing. It is possible that combination treatment with alectinib and cobimetinib will work&#xD;
      better than alectinib alone to control the spread of the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are trying to determine whether the combination of&#xD;
      alectinib and cobimetinib is safe and well tolerated. This study will help determine the&#xD;
      doses of the drugs that should be used in the Phase II portion of this study. Another purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine whether adding cobimetinib to alectinib is effective for&#xD;
      treating lung cancer that has already stopped responding to alectinib alone. In order to help&#xD;
      understand why the cancer may have stopped responding to alectinib and whether treatment with&#xD;
      the two drugs effectively blocks growth signals, all participants in this study will have&#xD;
      periodic blood collections and undergo multiple biopsies.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For the expansion cohort: Patients must have had disease progression on alectinib&#xD;
             (including patients who received alectinib as first-line treatment). Subsequent&#xD;
             anti-neoplastic therapy (including other ALK inhibitors or chemotherapy) after&#xD;
             progression on alectinib is not permitted. Note: patients in the dose-finding portion&#xD;
             of the study may have received other anti-neoplastic therapy after progression on&#xD;
             alectinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Previously irradiated&#xD;

             half-lives between the last dose of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and the&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment is required. For patients on crizotinib, a 7 day washout&#xD;
             is sufficient. A shorter washout period may be considered in the event of disease&#xD;
             flare, after discussion with the Sponsor. No washout is required if the most recent&#xD;
             anti-neoplastic therapy is alectinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from treatment toxicities to ≤ Grade 1 or to their&#xD;
             pretreatment levels except for adverse events (AEs) that in the investigator's&#xD;

             for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Acute effects of therapy must have&#xD;
             resolved to baseline severity or to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for AEs that in the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient. Patients who&#xD;
             have received prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitors are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovery from effects of any major surgery or significant traumatic injury at least 28&#xD;
             days before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;

             the baseline visit before starting study treatment. For women who are not&#xD;
             postmenopausal (≥ 12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile&#xD;
             (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to remain abstinent or use two adequate&#xD;
             methods of contraception, including at least one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%&#xD;
             per year, during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                  methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
                  tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of&#xD;
                  combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine&#xD;
                  devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom&#xD;
                  and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt;1% per year.&#xD;
                  Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent or use a barrier method of contraception (e.g.,&#xD;
             condom) during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug and agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this same period&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men with a pregnant partner must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for&#xD;
                  the duration of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                  methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated, controlled asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) lesions&#xD;
             are allowed in this trial as long as the CNS is not a site of progressive disease on&#xD;
             alectinib monotherapy. If the CNS is a site of progressive disease on alectinib&#xD;
             monotherapy, treatment of CNS lesions is required for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of seizure prophylaxis is allowed as long as patients are taking non-enzyme&#xD;
             inducing anti-epileptic drugs (non-EIAED). If patients were previously on EIAEDs and&#xD;
             these have been discontinued, they must have been discontinued for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to treatment start. If patients require an anti-epileptic medication, then a&#xD;
             CYP3A4 non-EIAED can be used such as levetiracetam, valproic acid, gabapentin,&#xD;
             topiramate or lacosamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring steroids must be at a stable or decreasing dose for at least 1 week&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with asymptomatic leptomeningeal disease are eligible for participation in&#xD;
             this trial. However, patients who had progression of leptomeningeal disease on&#xD;
             alectinib will be required to undergo CNS radiation to meet eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study or&#xD;
             those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than&#xD;
             3 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who experienced progression of CNS lesions on alectinib who have not&#xD;
             received local CNS therapies (radiation, surgery) to address the lesions. CNS imaging&#xD;
             obtained at least 21 days after completion of radiation is required for confirmation&#xD;
             of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy (except palliative to relieve bone pain) within 7 days of study&#xD;
             entry. Palliative radiation (≤ 10 fractions) must have been completed at least 48&#xD;
             hours prior to study entry. Stereotactic or small field brain irradiation must have&#xD;
             been completed at least 7 days prior to study entry. Whole brain radiation and&#xD;
             radiation for leptomeningeal metastasis must have been completed at least 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study entry. Acute effects of radiation must have resolved to baseline&#xD;
             severity or to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for AEs that in the investigator's judgment do&#xD;
             not constitute a safety risk for the patient.&#xD;
