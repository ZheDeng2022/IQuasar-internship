  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Check the effects of musical auditory stimulation on the autonomic modulation and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory parameters during and after aerobic exercise. Hypothesized that classical&#xD;
      music can increase recovery velocity after exercise and rock style music can generate a delay&#xD;
      in the recovery velocity of the cardiorespiratory parameters and in the cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

      To implement the experimental protocol, all volunteers were informed to not ingest alcoholic&#xD;
      or caffeine-based drinks for 12 hours before the experimental procedure; consuming light meal&#xD;
      only two hours before and avoid any vigorous physical exertion 24 hours before the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental procedures were divided into three segments, all performed on a treadmill,&#xD;
      with a minimum interval of 48 hours between them in order to allow the volunteers to recover.&#xD;
      The protocols running time was always set between 5:30 PM and 9:30 PM, to avoid circadian&#xD;
      influences. In addition to these, temperature was fixed between 23 ° C and 24 ° C and&#xD;
      humidity between 60% and 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first phase of the experimental protocol the volunteers were approved and the&#xD;
      investigators obtained body mass by means of a digital scale (Plenna, TIN 00139 Maxima,&#xD;
      Brazil) then height, by means of a stadiometer (ES 2020 - Sanny, Brazil). The comparable&#xD;
      stages of the experimental protocol were undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Maximal exercise test: the investigators undertook this to record the maximum velocity&#xD;
      (Vmax) reached by the volunteer. This was then applied to indirectly determine the anaerobic&#xD;
      threshold via the Conconi threshold. Intensity of 60% of the Vmax obtained in the test was&#xD;
      lesser than that found in the anaerobic threshold, and this intensity was enforced to perform&#xD;
      subsequent steps;&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) Control Protocol (CP): In this period the volunteers were at rest, in the supine position&#xD;
      for 15 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on a treadmill (five minutes at a&#xD;
      speed of 6.0 km / h followed by 25 minutes with 60% of Vmax + 1% grade) and then a recovery&#xD;
      period lasting 60 minutes (three minutes standing on the treadmill followed by 57 minutes in&#xD;
      the supine position). The volunteers were instructed to remain awake during all the protocol&#xD;
      and this was verified and monitored by one of the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III) Music Protocol (MP): Volunteers accomplished the same activities of the CP, but with&#xD;
      exposure to musical auditory stimulation during exercise and recovery.&#xD;
