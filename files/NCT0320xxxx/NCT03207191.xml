      Phase I, open label, single arm, non-randomized, multicenter, prospective dose escalation&#xD;
      study in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (alloHSCT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine a recommended dose for F16IL2 in combination with BI&#xD;
      836858 in AML relapse after alloHSCT and investigating safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) with overdose&#xD;
      control that will be fitted to binary toxicity outcomes. The estimate of parameters will be&#xD;
      updated as data are accumulated using the BLRM. At the end of the dose escalation phase, the&#xD;
      probability of toxicity at each dose combination level will be calculated to determine an&#xD;
      estimate of the MTD. Once the MTD or a biological active dose has been defined, additional&#xD;
      patients (up to 10) will be treated with F16IL2 and BI 836858 dosed at this dose combination&#xD;
      in order to confirm the safety profile of the combination.&#xD;
