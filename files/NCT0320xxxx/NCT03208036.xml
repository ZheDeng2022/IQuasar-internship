  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of interventions that can effectively target and remediate the cognitive and&#xD;
      functional impairment associated with serious mental illness is a treatment priority.&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive neuromodulation&#xD;
      technique that is capable of stimulating brain activity to facilitate learning. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the pairing of two therapeutic techniques, cognitive&#xD;
      remediation and tDCS, as a cognitively enhancing intervention. This study is designed to&#xD;
      address four questions. Is cognitive remediation paired with tDCS more efficacious than&#xD;
      cognitive remediation delivered with sham stimulation? Is it possible to predict&#xD;
      responsiveness to the intervention? Is intervention-induced cognitive change sustainable? Are&#xD;
      there barriers to implementing this intervention in clinical practice?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the incremental benefit of pairing tDCS with cognitive remediation, a 110&#xD;
      clinically stable outpatients between the ages of 18-65 who have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder will be enrolled in a&#xD;
      double-blind, double-baseline, sham-controlled clinical trial. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tDCS or sham stimulation concurrent with working&#xD;
      memory focused cognitive remediation. Training will be offered to participants in a small&#xD;
      group format. Training will consist of 48 sessions, with 2-3 sessions scheduled in a week.&#xD;
      Each training session will last 2 hours. One hour will be spent completing cognitive&#xD;
      exercises that require working memory skills on a computer. TDCS or sham stimulation will be&#xD;
      offered concurrent with the first 20 minutes of training with a StarStim neuromodulator. One&#xD;
      mA of anodal stimulation will be applied to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the&#xD;
      cathodal electrode will be placed in the contralateral supraorbital position. Upon completion&#xD;
      of working memory training, participants will transition to a 30-minute discussion group. The&#xD;
      discussion will focus on application of cognitive skills in everyday life. Effective&#xD;
      strategies for approaching cognitive tasks will be described and practiced. Participant&#xD;
      experience with aspects of the training will be monitored with self-report measures of&#xD;
      motivation, mood, and physical reactions. To assess intervention-induced change, working&#xD;
      memory, other aspects of cognition, functional capacity, and community functioning will be&#xD;
      assessed pre- and post-intervention. Cognitive outcomes will be assessed with training tasks&#xD;
      as well as tasks that are unfamiliar to participants. A performance-based measure will be&#xD;
      used to assess functional capacity for everyday living skills and a self-report instrument&#xD;
      will be used to assess community functioning. Potential confounds such as symptom severity,&#xD;
      medication changes, outside treatment hours, and significant life stressors will be assessed&#xD;
      individually every 2 weeks during the intervention phase of the study. Sustainability of&#xD;
      intervention-induced change will be assessed with assessment sessions 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention. Change in performance during the first 12 training sessions on two working&#xD;
      memory training tasks, a n-back task and a complex span task, will be used to determine if&#xD;
      early response to treatment is predictive of post-intervention outcomes. An intent-to-treat&#xD;
      analysis will be used to analyze intervention-induced change. Regression analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted to identify predictors of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving the proposed objectives will yield important information about the efficacy,&#xD;
      durability, and efficiency of a novel pairing of cognitively enhancing interventions.&#xD;
      Findings will inform treatment development for patients with serious mental illness as well&#xD;
      for patients with other cognitively compromising illnesses.&#xD;
