    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis in the setting of HIV infection is distinct and includes increased vascular&#xD;
      inflammation, worsened endothelial function, and a predominance of non-calcified plaque.&#xD;
      These outcomes can be assessed using specialized noninvasive imaging which strongly predict&#xD;
      future CV events in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCSK9 has emerged as an important pharmacologic target for cholesterol lowering in the&#xD;
      general population and recent studies among individuals without HIV have shown that PCSK9&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy is safely tolerated and significantly reduces major CV events in the&#xD;
      general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a clinical trial of PCSK9 inhibition in the setting of HIV&#xD;
      infection. This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      PCSK9 inhibition on vascular inflammation, endothelial function, and non-calcified plaque&#xD;
      using a PCSK9 inhibitor called alirocumab. This study will recruit 140 treated individuals&#xD;
      with HIV who are aged 40 and older, with known CVD or risk factors for CVD and who have&#xD;
      evidence of vascular inflammation at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary objective of this study is to determine whether PCSK9 inhibition&#xD;
      can improve arterial inflammation as assessed by FDG-PET/CT and endothelial function as&#xD;
      assessed by flow mediated vasodilation. The investigators will correlate changes in arterial&#xD;
      inflammation and endothelial function with lipids and markers of inflammation and immune&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary objective is to perform a pilot evaluation of the impact of PCSK9 inhibition on&#xD;
      non-calcified plaque as measured by coronary CT angiography. Non-calcified plaque&#xD;
      measurements will be correlated with changes in lipid parameters and markers of inflammation&#xD;
      and immune activation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis continues to be the leading single cause&#xD;
      of death in industrialized countries. High serum lipid levels, and especially high&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, have been demonstrated to strongly and&#xD;
      directly correlate with CVD risks by numerous epidemiological studies. Moreover, large&#xD;
      prospective clinical outcome trials have demonstrated that lowering LDL-C decreases&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A meta-analysis of 26 randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      comprising 170,000 participants showed that more intensive statin therapy compared to less&#xD;
      intensive regimens will reduce coronary deaths or myocardial infarction by an additional 13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals represent a unique and increasing subset of atherosclerosis. With&#xD;
      the advent of antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected individuals now have much improved&#xD;
      survival and are faced with health issues related to aging, including cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Individuals with HIV have higher rates of coronary events compared to controls even in the&#xD;
      setting of treated and suppressed disease and a growing body of literature suggests that they&#xD;
      are at increased risk for myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, and sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
      Many facets of atherosclerosis differ in HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected&#xD;
      individuals with atherosclerosis. HIV-infected patients with acute coronary syndromes are&#xD;
      younger and more likely to be males and smokers, with low high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), compared to other acute coronary syndrome patients. With&#xD;
      respect to pathophysiology, viral replication, antiretroviral drugs all contribute to&#xD;
      atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-associated inflammation induces pro-atherogenic lipid abnormalities and anti-retroviral&#xD;
      therapy leads to the development of metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      lipodystrophy and insulin resistance. In a large cross-sectional study, 27% of subjects&#xD;
      receiving combination therapy including a protease inhibitor had a total cholesterol level&#xD;
      exceeding 240 mg/dl, compared to 8% of untreated HIV subjects, and 40% had triglyceride&#xD;
      levels above 200 mg/dl, compared to 15% in untreated subjects. The prevalence and severity of&#xD;
      dyslipidemia varies among different antiretroviral drugs; however, hypertriglyceridemia and&#xD;
      low HDL-cholesterol were associated with HIV infection even before the advent of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy. Total, HDL-C, and LDL-C decrease at the time of HIV infection, and&#xD;
      with antiretroviral treatment total and LDL-C levels increase to pre-infection levels while&#xD;
      HDL-C remains low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormalities in body composition have been reported in 40-50% of HIV-infected patients, with&#xD;
      higher rates in those receiving combination antiretroviral therapies. Subcutaneous&#xD;
      lipoatrophy commonly affects the face, limbs, and buttocks, and is accompanied by central fat&#xD;
      accumulation. Hyperinsulinemia is often also present. In a representative study, diabetes was&#xD;
      present in 7% of HIV-infected adults with fat accumulation or lipoatrophy, as compared to&#xD;
      0.5% of control subjects matched for age and BMI. The corresponding rates of glucose&#xD;
      intolerance were 35% and 5% respectively. Compared to healthy control subjects, HIV-infected&#xD;
      men treated with combination antiretroviral therapy were 4 times as likely to develop&#xD;
      diabetes over a 3-year observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased cardiovascular risk and dyslipidemia in HIV-infected individuals is difficult&#xD;
      to treat for several reasons. Statins reduce LDL-C levels less in HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      compared to uninfected controls. Fibrates reduce triglyceride levels less in HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals compared to uninfected controls as well. Drug-drug interactions between statins&#xD;
      and protease inhibitors increase the risk of adverse events. Due to these interactions,&#xD;
      simvastatin and lovastatin are contraindicated among individuals receiving protease&#xD;
      inhibitors and the dose of atorvastatin should not exceed 40 mg. Even interactions with&#xD;
      rosuvastatin, which is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, physicians may avoid treating HIV-infected individuals who would benefit&#xD;
      from statins, or use lower doses or less potent statins, reducing the potential for&#xD;
      cardiovascular event reduction. High triglyceride levels in HIV-infected subjects are common,&#xD;
      and the combination of a fibrate plus antiretroviral therapy increases the risk of drug-drug&#xD;
      adverse events, even before consideration of a statin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statin treatment reduces lipid levels modestly in HIV subjects. Among 72 HIV-infected&#xD;
      subjects in the SATURN-HIV trial randomized to rosuvastatin 10 mg/day, LDL-C was reduced by&#xD;
      25.3% by week 24. In another study, of 83 HIV-infected subjects, rosuvastatin 10 mg and&#xD;
      pravastatin 40 mg/day reduced LDL-C by 37% and 19% respectively at 45 days. Among 151&#xD;
      HIV-infected subjects randomized to rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, or pravastatin 40&#xD;
      mg/day, LDL-C reductions were greater with rosuvastatin at this dose, but all 3 statins&#xD;
      significantly and similarly reduced serum levels of hs-CRP and TNF-a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1/3 of individuals with HIV-infection are co-infected with hepatitis C.&#xD;
      Elevated hepatic enzymes due to hepatitis C represent a relative contraindication to statin&#xD;
      therapy, and some evidence suggests that a statin might increase hepatitis C activity.&#xD;
      Finally, HIV-infected patients often need many medications and have a large daily pill&#xD;
      burden. Compliance suffers, but has been shown to improve when single tablet regimens reduce&#xD;
      daily pill load. Long-acting injectable antiretroviral drugs are under development as a&#xD;
      strategy to reduce pill burden and improve compliance. PCSK9 inhibitor injections would&#xD;
      dovetail well with this approach. For these reasons, PCSK9 inhibitor therapy offers&#xD;
      advantages over statin therapy in this unique population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That statins might favorably influence the evolution of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected&#xD;
      subjects is suggested by a recent trial where 40 HIV subjects with mild coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis by CT angiography and aortic inflammation by FDG-PET imaging were randomized&#xD;
      to atorvastatin 20-40 mg/day or placebo and were followed for 12 months. Atorvastatin&#xD;
      significantly reduced non-calcified coronary plaque volume relative to placebo, as well as&#xD;
      the number of high-risk plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the HIV-uninfected population, statin therapy produced significant and rapid&#xD;
      dose-dependent reductions in FDG update that were reflective of changes in atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque inflammation. In addition, lipoprotein apheresis resulted in significant reduction of&#xD;
      arterial inflammation. Recently, addition of evolocumab was found to result in a greater&#xD;
      decrease in percent atheroma volume using intravascular ultrasound. All of these studies&#xD;
      which were performed in the non-HIV population provide a strong scientific rationale for&#xD;
      studying the role of PCSK9 inhibition in HIV. Namely, given the strong association between&#xD;
      HIV, noncalcified plaque, and arterial inflammation, PCSK9 therapy may play a unique role in&#xD;
      reducing HIV-associated atherosclerosis, Alirocumab (Sar236553/REG 727) is a fully humanized&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody against the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enzyme&#xD;
      responsible for the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and is&#xD;
      developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals/Sanofi. In a randomized trial of 2341 patients with&#xD;
      heterozygous familiar hypercholesterolemia or with established coronary heart disease or a&#xD;
      CHD risk equivalent with LDL levels≥70mg/dL and were receiving treatment with statins at the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose with or without other lipid-lowering therapy. Patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to a 2:1 ratio to receive alirocumab 150mg or placebo every 2 weeks for 78 weeks. At&#xD;
      week 24 the difference between the alirocumab and placebo groups from baseline to calculated&#xD;
      LDL was -62 percentage points. The alirocumab group had higher rates of injection site&#xD;
      reactions, myalgia, neurocognitive events and ophthalmologic events. The rate of major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events was lower in the alirocumab group as compared to placebo in a&#xD;
      post hoc analysis (p=0.02).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data on 6 HIV-infected individuals inadvertently enrolled in a PCSK9 inhibitor&#xD;
      study using evolocumab demonstrated that LDL was lowered 60%, along with significant&#xD;
      reductions in triglycerides and Lp(a) and was well tolerated (unpublished data)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these findings a dose of 75 mg every 2 weeks for 6 weeks followed by an upward&#xD;
      titration to 150 mg every 2 weeks for those with LDL-C &gt;50 mg/dl for the remainder of the&#xD;
      study for this trial will be used. Based on population PK/PD modeling, a dose of 150 mg every&#xD;
      2 weeks in patients on a background of statins is estimated to be equivalent to approximately&#xD;
      80% of the maximal response for LDL-C lowering (-67%). Assuming an average LDL C at baseline&#xD;
      of 100 mg/dL for HIV-infected individuals, the mean absolute LDL-C reduction is predicted to&#xD;
      be approximately -60 mg/dL.&#xD;
