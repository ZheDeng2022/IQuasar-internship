      Impulsivity describes the tendency to make risky and unplanned decisions, to pick immediate&#xD;
      reward over a bigger reward after a period of time or to not be able to resist the urge to do&#xD;
      something. Empathy refers to the ability to be sensitive to and vicariously experience other&#xD;
      people's feelings and to create working models of emotional states. Recent neuroscientific&#xD;
      research have found that the right frontal part of the brain (left dorsal lateral frontal&#xD;
      cortex, LDLPFC) is important in the control of impulsive behaviour and empathy. Self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires have been proven valid measures at assessing impulsivity and empathy.&#xD;
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a widely used non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation procedure; stimulation can be applied at different brain regions depending on the&#xD;
      administration method. It temporally changes the way that this part of the brain functions,&#xD;
      providing us a further understanding of how this part works. Recent research has found that&#xD;
      rTMS on the LDLPFC changes performance-based tasks measuring different types of impulsivity&#xD;
      and empathy. This study aims to investigate this further to look at the RDLPFC stimulation&#xD;
      and its effects on empathy and two different types of impulsivity. Of interest is also how&#xD;
      innate impulsive personality type and empathy trait relate to performance on these tasks.&#xD;

      Background Impulsivity describes the tendency to make risky and unplanned decisions, to pick&#xD;
      immediate reward over a bigger reward after a period or to not be able to resist the urge to&#xD;
      do something. Empathy refers to the ability to be sensitive to and vicariously experience&#xD;
      other people's feelings and to create working models of emotional states. Recent&#xD;
      neuroscientific research have found that the left frontal part of the brain (left dorsal&#xD;
      lateral frontal cortex, RDLPFC) is important in the control of impulsive behaviour and&#xD;
      empathy. Self-report questionnaires have been proven valid measures at assessing impulsivity&#xD;
      and empathy. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a widely used&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation procedure; stimulation can be applied at different brain&#xD;
      regions depending on the administration method. It temporally changes the way that this part&#xD;
      of the brain functions, providing us a further understanding of how this part works. Recent&#xD;
      research has found that rTMS on the LDLPFC changes performance based tasks measuring&#xD;
      different types of impulsivity and empathy. This study aims to investigate this further to&#xD;
      look at the LDLPFC stimulation using the newer form of high-frequency rTMS, intermittent&#xD;
      theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and its effects on empathy and two different types of&#xD;
      impulsivity. Of interest is also how innate impulsive personality type and empathy trait&#xD;
      relate to performance on these tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The specific purposes of this study are to (i) examine whether iTBS is an effective&#xD;
      technique for modulating impulsivity and empathy, and to (ii) examine the relationship&#xD;
      between the modulatory effects of the iTBS and baseline self-reported impulsivity and&#xD;
      empathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key objectives of this study are to examine whether the specific iTBS protocol at RDLPFC&#xD;
      can effectively modulate two subtypes of impulsivity (delayed discounting and reflection&#xD;
      impulsivity) and empathy, and to examine whether the participant's baseline self-reported&#xD;
      impulsivity and empathy scores mediate the modulatory effects of the iTBS on impulsivity and&#xD;
      empathy respectively in normal healthy young adults. The secondary objectives of this study&#xD;
      are to examine whether the self-reported measures of impulsivity and empathy correlate with&#xD;
      their performance-based counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol and methods The proposed study will be a single-centre, crossover&#xD;
      design study, taking place at Queens Medical Centre, Nottinghamshire NHS Trust. Participants&#xD;
      (male students or staff) will be recruited from the University of Nottingham. A potential&#xD;
      participant will be asked to complete the TMS screening questionnaire to ensure that there&#xD;
      are no contraindications to using TMS. After the written informed consent is obtained, he&#xD;
      will then be asked to complete an online questionnaire (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale -version&#xD;
      11, BIS-11) measuring self-report impulsivity. The scores obtained from BIS-11 will be one of&#xD;
      the screening criteria. If the potential participant is eligible for taking part in the&#xD;
      study, he will be invited to the two laboratory sessions. He will then be asked to perform&#xD;
      three computerised tasks assessing impulsivity and empathy before and after the iTBS&#xD;
      administration. Each session of iTBS will apply 600 pulses to the LDLPFC, with 20 2-second&#xD;
      trains and an 8-second inter-train interval for a total stimulation time of 190 seconds. Sham&#xD;
      iTBS condition will be administered with the same methodology used for active iTBS condition&#xD;
      with a sham coil mimicking noises and vibrations without delivery of magnetic pulses.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to guess which rTMS condition is real after completing the whole&#xD;
      study to ascertain that whether the sham manipulation is successful or not. Participants will&#xD;
      be monitored if they experience any adverse events during the rTMS session and instructed to&#xD;
      report any experience of adverse events after each rTMS session. Tolerability will be&#xD;
      presented as the number of reported adverse events and the number of dropouts due to adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable end points/statistical power of the study To detect the change in impulsivity and&#xD;
      empathy resulted from the iTBS intervention, G*Power 3.1.9.2 was used to estimate sample size&#xD;
      required in consideration of interaction effect (impulsivity group × iTBS conditions) of&#xD;
      repeated measure ANOVA. The following parameters were selected: effect size f = 0.20&#xD;
      (equivalent to d = 0.40, estimated from the results of previous meta-analyses), alpha error&#xD;
      probability = .05, power = (1- β error probability) = .80, number of groups = 2, number of&#xD;
      measurements = 2 and correlation among repeated measurements = 0.6. A minimum of total sample&#xD;
      size of 42 subjects will be required. Considering the dropout rate of 0.20 (according to&#xD;
      previous rTMS studies), 54 subjects will be required for the study, including 27 high&#xD;
      impulsivity participants and 27 low impulsivity participants.&#xD;
