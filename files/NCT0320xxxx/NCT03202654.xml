  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial are to assess the effects of corn oil and coconut oil on&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, and other aspects of the fasting&#xD;
      lipoprotein lipid profile, as well as insulin sensitivity and an inflammatory marker, in men&#xD;
      and women.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, crossover, pilot study that includes two screening visits and two&#xD;
      4-week test periods, separated by a 3-week washout. Subjects will consume study products&#xD;
      providing 4 tablespoons oil/day of either corn oil or coconut oil replacing the same amount&#xD;
      of oil in the background diet. Subjects will otherwise be encouraged to follow their habitual&#xD;
      diet during both treatment periods. They will receive diet instructions on the incorporation&#xD;
      of food substitutions during the test periods to maintain habitual energy intake. Subjects&#xD;
      will record daily study product intake and compliance in a Daily Log. An intravenous glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (IVGTT) will be completed at baseline and the end of each treatment period for&#xD;
      evaluation of insulin sensitivity. Fasting blood samples will be collected for lipid profile&#xD;
      and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measurements at all visits. Assessments of&#xD;
      vital signs and body weight, review of concomitant medication/supplement use and inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria for relevant changes, and evaluation of adverse effects will be&#xD;
      performed throughout the study. Compliance will be assessed using the Daily Log intake&#xD;
      percentages as the primary source.&#xD;
