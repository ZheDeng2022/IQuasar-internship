      Phase1 study of TTC 352 for treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is open-label, accelerated dose escalation study of TTC 352, a selective human ER&#xD;
      partial agonist for treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer in patients who received and&#xD;
      progressed on at least two lines of endocrine therapy with one that included a CDK4/CDK6&#xD;
      inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      TTC-352 for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer progressing after endocrine&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TTC-352 will be determined using initial single-patient&#xD;
      cohort escalations until grade 2 toxicity, then expansion to a modified-Fibonacci&#xD;
      dose-escalation 3+3 design. Patients enrolled at each dose escalation step must complete the&#xD;
      first 28-day cycle of treatment without a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), or be withdrawn&#xD;
      because of a DLT, before additional patients may be enrolled for the next dose escalation&#xD;
      step. The MTD dose level cohort will be expanded to a total of 9 patients, to further&#xD;
      evaluate safety. In each cohort pharmacokinetics of TTC-352 will be evaluated.&#xD;

             increase the risk associated with study participation, that may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results or that otherwise would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, make study participation inappropriate;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. have any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to the planned&#xD;
             start of study treatment;&#xD;
