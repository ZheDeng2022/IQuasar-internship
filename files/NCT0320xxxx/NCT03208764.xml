      A Prospective, Open labeled, multi-Center, Evaluation of the Efficacy Safety and Tolerability&#xD;
      of Nitric Oxide Given Intermittently via Inhalation to Subjects with NTM (specifically MABSC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitric Oxide (NO) has been shown to play a critical role in various biological functions. In&#xD;
      the airways, NO is considered to play a key role in the innate immune system in which the&#xD;
      first-line of host defense against microbes is built.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro studies suggested that NO, in part per million (ppm) concentrations, possesses&#xD;
      anti-microbial activity against a wide variety of phyla including fungi, and&#xD;
      antibiotic-resistance bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators wish to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 160&#xD;
      ppm Nitric Oxide intermittently delivered via inhalation to subjects infected with&#xD;
      Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM), specifically with MABSC.&#xD;
