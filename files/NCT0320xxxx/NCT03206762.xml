    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, randomized study evaluating the use of Jetstream Atherectomy (JS)&#xD;
      followed by DCB in comparison to the use of plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) followed by&#xD;
      DCB alone in the treatment of complex lesions in femoropopliteal arteries in subjects with&#xD;
      claudication (Rutherford Clinical Category (RCC) of 2-4) (complex lesions are defined as long&#xD;
      (≥ 10 cm) lesions, or moderately or highly calcified lesions, or chronic total occlusions&#xD;
      irrespective of length).&#xD;

             percutaneous intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has had a previous peripheral bypass affecting the target vessel (allowable for&#xD;
             physician to pass through bypass graft in aorta-iliac region to get to the target&#xD;

&#xD;
        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject must not meet any of the following angiographic exclusion criteria. The&#xD;

             investigator judgment may interfere with the outcome of this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has two or more lesions that require treatment in the target vessel. Lesions have to&#xD;
             be separated by &gt; 5 cm in order to be considered different lesions. Only one lesion&#xD;
             per target vessel can be enrolled during the index procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has disease that precludes safe advancement of the JS device to the target lesion.&#xD;
