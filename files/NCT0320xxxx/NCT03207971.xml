  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) is considered the gold standard treatment for&#xD;
      root coverage in Miller Class I and II single gingival recession. Therefore, scientific&#xD;
      evidence is limited for multiple gingival recessions, only with extrapolation from&#xD;
      single-tooth data. Depending on area and depth during the removal of the graft from palate,&#xD;
      connective tissue presents different anatomic characteristics, geometric shapes and&#xD;
      histological composition. Possibly different types of SCTGs present distinct volumetric&#xD;
      stability and physiological process of revascularization. This randomized, split-mouth,&#xD;
      double blind clinical trial aim to evaluate periodontal parameters (complete root coverage,&#xD;
      gingival recession depth and width, gingival thickness, width of keratinized tissue, probing&#xD;
      depth, clinical attachment, plaque and bleeding index) and gingival blood flow in recipient&#xD;
      sites, comparing sites that received SCTG from palatal area with predominance of lamina&#xD;
      propria and predominance of submucosa. Clinical measurements will be evaluated at baseline&#xD;
      and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgical procedure. Blood flow flowmetry with laser doppler&#xD;
      (LDF) will be analyzed at baseline and 3, 7,14 and 28 days after surgery. Participants will&#xD;
      be invited to answer a questionnaire of aesthetic satisfaction and symptoms of pain and&#xD;
      discomfort. Two experienced periodontists blind to experimental groups will be invited to&#xD;
      observe the clinical outcomes and answer an aesthetic questionnaire. Data analysis will be&#xD;
      performed by paired t-test if follow normal distribution or Wilcoxon if follow nonnormal&#xD;
      distribution with significance level of 5% (p &lt;0.05).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, split-mouth clinical trial lasting 12 months.&#xD;
      Participants will be selected from the Department of Periodontology of the Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry of Bauru (FOB-USP). The sample will consist of systemically healthy individuals&#xD;
      aged between 18 and 70 years. Patients will be included in the study if they meet the&#xD;
      following inclusion criteria: (1) clinical diagnosis of multiple gingival recessions with at&#xD;
      least one gingival recession ≥ 2 mm, including canines and premolars; (2) Miller class I and&#xD;
      II gingival recession areas; (3) non-abrasive, erosive or carious root surfaces (4)&#xD;
      unrotated, non-extruded and non-movable teeth (5) systemically healthy patients without&#xD;
      contraindication to periodontal surgical procedures. The exclusion criteria will be: smokers,&#xD;
      pregnant women, patients with a history of periodontal disease or recurrent abscess&#xD;
      formation, patients previously submitted to surgical procedures for root coverage, patients&#xD;
      taking anti-convulsant drugs, antihypertensives, contraceptives or immunosuppressors,&#xD;
      patientes with low oral hygiene (plaque and bleeding index over 20%). The experimental&#xD;
      protocol will be sent to the FOB-USP Human Research Ethics Committee for evaluation.&#xD;
      Participants will receive detailed information about the study and will sign the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form after understanding all the steps of the research. All selected patients will be&#xD;
      submitted to basic periodontal procedures (scaling, root planning, coronary polishing and&#xD;
      oral hygiene instructions) before performing the surgical procedures. Patients should present&#xD;
      plaque index and bleeding ≤ 20% throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental groups (A and B) will be treated through the association of subepithelial&#xD;
      connective tissue graft (SCTG) and coronally advanced flap. Each individual will receive the&#xD;
      types of treatment, randomly assigned to the right or left side. Group A will receive the&#xD;
      submucosal predominant area for SCTG (removed from the anterior region of the lateral palate,&#xD;
      more deeply) by the double-blade technique (Harris, 1997). This collection method allows a&#xD;
      uniformity of the SCTG with standard thickness (1.5mm). Thus, the scalpel cable with double&#xD;
      blades (1.5mm distance) will be used. The initial horizontal incision will be made on the&#xD;
      palate, preserving 1-1.5 mm from the gingival margin of the teeth, until the complete&#xD;
      deepening of the number 15C blades in the necessary extension previously defined for the&#xD;
      receiving area. Internal vertical incisions will be performed for both sides of the&#xD;
      horizontal incision and at the base of the graft to enable the SCTG removal. After the graft&#xD;
      removal, the epithelial portion is extracted for subsequent stabilization of the graft to the&#xD;
      recipient site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will be the one who will receive a graft whit a predominance of lamina propria&#xD;
      (removed from the posterior region of the lateral palate, more superficially) by the&#xD;
      technique of the deepithelialized graft. Two horizontal and two vertical incisions will be&#xD;
      performed on the palate according to the extension needed for the recipient area, preserving&#xD;
      1-1.5 mm from the gingival margin of the teeth. These incisions will be made perpendicular to&#xD;
      the palatine dome. Subsequently, for complete removal of the epithelial graft, an incision&#xD;
      will be made with the 15 C blade, parallel to the palatal surface. The graft should be&#xD;
      approximately 2 mm thick and after removal of the entire epithelium, the thickness should be&#xD;
      1.5 mm, measured with the anesthetic needle with endodontic stop and a digital pachymeter.&#xD;
      The removal of the epithelium will be performed with the aid of reflector light (epithelium&#xD;
      is firmer and more rugged and connective tissue, more flexible and soft) parallel to the&#xD;
      surface of the graft. The difference in light reflection (epithelium reflects more than&#xD;
      connective tissue) allows one to distinguish whether it has been removed (Zuchelli et al.,&#xD;
      2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The width of the graft will be calculated according to the amount of tissue needed to cover&#xD;
      the exposed roots plus mesial and distal 3mm and the amount of tissue required for the&#xD;
      biopsy. The graft height will be the distance from the enamel cement junction (ECJ) to the&#xD;
      buccal bone crest (Zuchelli et al., 2010). A small biopsy of the grafts (approximately 2mm x&#xD;
      6mm) will be removed for histomorphometric analysis. The donor area will be sutured with silk&#xD;
      thread 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recipient areas, oblique incisions (from the ECJ to the gingival margin of the&#xD;
      adjacent tooth) and intrasulcal incisions in the gingival recess defects will be performed&#xD;
      with the objective of designing surgical papillae and anatomical papillae for the subsequent&#xD;
      displacement of the flap to coronal (Zucchelli &amp; DeSanctis, 2000). The incisions will be&#xD;
      performed with a 15C scalpel blade and will extend to the adjacent teeth with gingival&#xD;
      recessions. In the region of the interdental papilla, the deepithelialization will be&#xD;
      performed with a scalpel blade. The flap will be of total thickness up to the height of the&#xD;
      mucogingival junction to preserve greater thickness of flap that will be displaced on the&#xD;
      bare root surface. In the most apical portion, the flap will be of partial thickness,&#xD;
      eliminating muscular tensions and allowing greater mobility for subsequent accommodation of&#xD;
      the flap by the same 2.5mm coronally to ECJ (Richardson et al, 2015). The root surfaces&#xD;
      exposed to the buccal medium will be scraped with the aid of periodontal curettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After washing the recipient area with saline, SCTG with a standardized thickness of 1.5mm&#xD;
      will be positioned over the exposed roots and sutured with 5-0 monofilament gluconate suture&#xD;
      strands in adjacent connective tissue at the ECJ level. The flap will be advanced coronally&#xD;
      so that each surgical papilla can be positioned over its respective anatomical papilla. In&#xD;
      all cases, the ECJ and SCTG will be completely covered by the flap. With the same suture,&#xD;
      sutures will be made to adapt the flap. The sutures will be removed 14 days after the&#xD;
      surgical procedure. As a post-operative medication, all patients will receive analgesic,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and instructed to gently wash the mouth with 0.12% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      digluconate twice daily for 4 weeks. After the surgical procedure, patients will receive&#xD;
      instructions on postoperative care verbally and also in writing. During this period they will&#xD;
      be advised not to brush their teeth in the treated area. All patients will be followed weekly&#xD;
      for 4 weeks, fortnightly for 6 months, and monthly for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the surgical procedure, all clinical measurements will be recorded by a calibrated&#xD;
      examiner using computerized periodontal probe (Florida Probe®). Customized acrylic guides&#xD;
      will be manufactured for each surgical area in order to allow successive measurements in the&#xD;
      same position. The measurements will be rounded to the nearest 0.5 mm and repeated in the&#xD;
      periods of 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Depth of gingival recession (PR) - Distance in millimeters from ECJ to gingival margin&#xD;
           at three points (mesial, center and distal);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Width of gingival recession (WGR) - Distance between interproximal gingival margins of&#xD;
           the GR at the height of the most apical central portion of the JCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Probing Depth (CPD) - Distance in millimeters from the gingival margin to the&#xD;
           bottom of the gingival sulcus at three points (mesial, center and distal);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical attachment (CA) - Measured in mm from the bottom of the periodontal pocket to&#xD;
           the cementoenamel junction at three sites per tooth (mesial, center and distal);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) - Distance in millimeters from the gingival margin to&#xD;
           the mucogingival junction at three points (mesial, center and distal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Thickness of the keratinized mucosa (TKM): determined at 2mm apical the gingival margin&#xD;
           at the central buccal site with anesthetic needle and endodontic stop and digital&#xD;
           pachymeter (Paoloantonio et al., 2002, da Silva et al., 2004, Joly et al. 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Plaque index (Ainamo and Bay, 1975): presence or absence of bacterial plaque on the 4&#xD;
           faces of the teeth (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Bleeding index (Ainamo and Bay, 1975): presence or absence of bleeding after probing on&#xD;
           the 4 faces of the teeth (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histomorphometric analysis of SCTG removed from the palate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although we can distinguish clinically the SCTG predominantly richer in lamina propria or&#xD;
      submucosa, incisional biopsies of the grafts will be performed to confirm the nature of the&#xD;
      tissue removed. The specimens will be approximately 2mm x 6mm being removed from the grafts&#xD;
      of groups A and B. The specimens will be fixed in 10% formalin in phosphate buffer pH 7.3 for&#xD;
      one week. They will then be rinsed in running water for 24 hours and kept in 70% ethanol&#xD;
      until the next day. Histological processing will consist of dehydration in ethanol,&#xD;
      diaphanization in xylol and inclusion in Histosec # (paraffin + synthetic resin) in an oven&#xD;
      at 60oC. From the selected paraffin embedded cases, serial cuts with approximately 5 μm&#xD;
      thickness will be performed, in a microtome; Then drawn in water and mounted on silanized&#xD;
      slides. The cuts on the silanized slides will be submitted to routine histochemical technique&#xD;
      staining with Hematoxylin and eosin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slides submitted to histochemical techniques will be evaluated with the aid of a microscope&#xD;
      (CARL ZEISS, Germany). The first evaluation will determine if the epithelium has been&#xD;
      completely removed. The second evaluation will be from the edge of the epithelial incision to&#xD;
      the division that separates the lamina propria of the submucosa, measured in 5 different&#xD;
      points. The total extent of the graft will be the sum of the last two measurements (Harris et&#xD;
      al, 2003). All counts will be performed by a single calibrated examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser-doppler flowmetry of the grafted area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the evaluation of the blood flow will be used the Laser Doppler Fluxometer (LDF) equipped&#xD;
      with an infrared emitting diode laser (VMS-LDF2 DUAL CHANNEL- Laser Doppler Blood Flow and&#xD;
      Temperature Monitor, trademark Moor instruments- FAPESP process number is 2012 / 13331-2).&#xD;
      The maximum power of the diode laser is 2.5mW, emitting wavelengths in the order of 785nm ±&#xD;
      10nm. The time constant will be set to 0.1s and the bandwidth to 15kHz. It will be used 2&#xD;
      probes composed of 2 optical fibers of 0.25mm each, conditioned in an all steel of 1.5mm. The&#xD;
      probes will be calibrated monthly in a solution that comes with the equipment kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements with the LDF last 2 minutes. Three flow records of two points will be performed&#xD;
      concomitantly with the interval of 1 minute between them. From these values, the average of&#xD;
      the frequencies obtained will be considered to evaluate microvascularization at the&#xD;
      determined points. There will be a total of 4 points evaluated by surgical field: two points&#xD;
      at the base of the flap (alveolar mucosa immediately below the mucogingival junction) and two&#xD;
      points at the border of the flap (two points at the margins of the gingiva).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements with LDF in group A and B will be performed on the day of surgery before&#xD;
      anesthesia and in the postoperative days of 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. To standardize the position&#xD;
      (location and angulation) of the LDF probe relative to the gingival tissue at different&#xD;
      evaluation times, the measurements will be performed with the aid of an individual acrylic&#xD;
      guide supported on the tooth with perforations for fitting the point of the fiber optic probe&#xD;
      (Donos et al., 2005; Retzepi M, 2007). In this way, the LDF probe will be inserted&#xD;
      perpendicular to the tissues with a distance of 0.5 mm from the gingiva, remaining immobile&#xD;
      during repeated measurements. In order to perform these measurements, patients will be&#xD;
      comfortably accommodated in a standard semi-cline position, in the same dental chair, in a&#xD;
      calm environment with a constant temperature (23 ± 20oC). Measurements will be performed by&#xD;
      the same operator who has been properly calibrated and blinded to the experimental groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective analyzes by questionnaires for patients and professionals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to answer a questionnaire with information about aesthetics,&#xD;
      pain, discomfort, hygiene capacity of the area, sensitivity differences in donor areas. For&#xD;
      this, analogue visual scales (AVS) will be used after 7, 14 and 28 days and at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      postoperative months. Likewise, the occurrence of adverse effects and /or postoperative&#xD;
      complications will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two experienced periodontists without the knowledge of the experimental groups will be asked&#xD;
      to observe the clinical results after 7, 14 and 28 days and at the 3, 6 and 12 postoperative&#xD;
      months and to answer a questionnaire including information about the healing pattern of the&#xD;
      recipient and donor areas and aesthetics of the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample estimate will be approximately 20 patients, and after a pilot study will be&#xD;
      performed the sample calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All examiners will be calibrated and the intraclass correlation coefficient will be&#xD;
      calculated considering the parameters evaluated including clinical, microvascularization and&#xD;
      histomorphometric analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals will receive the two treatments being randomly distributed to the right and&#xD;
      left side. An independent statistician will generate a random sequence through software.&#xD;
      During the surgical procedure, immediately after the preparation of the recipient surgical&#xD;
      site, the investigator responsible for inclusion will open the opaque and sealed envelopes&#xD;
      containing the information about the type of treatment that will receive on the right and&#xD;
      left side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical outcome will be the depth of the gingival recession. The secondary&#xD;
      clinical outcomes related to the tooth will be: (1) the complete root coverage (CRC) of the&#xD;
      gingival recessions, (2) the width of the recession; (3) clinical attachment (CA); (4)&#xD;
      clinical probing depth (CPD); (5) width and thickness of the keratinized mucosa (WKM, TKM);&#xD;
      (6) analysis of microvascularization by LDF. The secondary clinical outcomes related to the&#xD;
      patient will be: (1) aesthetic satisfaction; (2) pain and discomfort. Related to the&#xD;
      specialist: (1) aesthetic satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to synthesize the data recorded in the initial and final&#xD;
      evaluations. The statistical analysis of the clinical parameters will be performed to compare&#xD;
      the initial values with the values after the experimental periods (6 and 12 months). The&#xD;
      analysis of the data will be done by paired t test, if obeyed the distribution normal or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon if it obeys the non-normal distribution. The level of significance adopted will be&#xD;
      5% (p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
