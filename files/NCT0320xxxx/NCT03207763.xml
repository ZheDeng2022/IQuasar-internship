  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microneedles can be prepared as a low-cost patch that is simple for patients to apply for&#xD;
      vaccine delivery targeting the many antigen-presenting cells present in the skin. Data&#xD;
      regarding the safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and acceptability of a microneedle patch&#xD;
      in children are lacking. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity,&#xD;
      and acceptability of placement of a placebo microneedle patch to the skin of children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available vaccine delivery methods include intramuscular or subcutaneous injection are&#xD;
      limited by patient needle phobia and the need for trained medical personnel. Alternative&#xD;
      routes of vaccination that avoid hypodermic needles have previously been poorly immunogenic,&#xD;
      require live vaccines, utilize bulky devices and/or are unsuitable for self-administration.&#xD;
      Novel vaccine delivery methods such as microneedles can render vaccination easier and more&#xD;
      acceptable to the public by simplifying vaccine access. Microneedles are micron-scale needles&#xD;
      that administer vaccine directly into the skin using a simple minimally invasive approach&#xD;
      without generating sharps waste. This study is designed to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and acceptability of a placebo microneedle patch in children.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Placebo Microneedle Patch-related Serious Adverse Events (SAE).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through the Final Study Visit (Day 27 - 38)</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate safety following application of the patch topically, microneedle patch-related serious adverse events were recorded. Information collected included event description, date of onset, severity and date of resolution/stabilization of the event. Severity and relationship to study product was assessed by the Investigator or sub-investigator.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Grade 3 Placebo Microneedle Patch-related Solicited Adverse Events (AE).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 8 for Patch 1, Day 8 to Day 15 if received Patches 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of Grade 3 solicited adverse events related to the placebo microneedle patch was recorded. Solicited adverse events were irritability (fussiness), lethargy (drowsiness), decreased appetite, vomiting, and fever. The severity of these adverse events was graded on a scale from 0 to 3 where 0 = not present and 3 = significant, preventing daily activity or a fever of &gt;102.1 degrees Fahrenheit (F).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Application Site Reactogenicity Events.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 8 for Patch 1, Day 8 to Day 15 if received Patches 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of solicited reactogenicity events at the application site was recorded. The solicited reactogenicity events are reactions that are common or expected to occur with application of a microneedle patch and include induration/swelling, erythema, ecchymosis, itching, pain, and tenderness. The Legally Authorized Representatives (LARs) of participants were provided with a memory aid, thermometer and ruler to record the presence of solicited symptoms and oral temperature. Reactogenicity event details were collected via review of the subject's memory aid and by interview with the subject LAR. Reactogenicity events were graded on a scale from 0 (not present) to 3 (significant or severe).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Grade 3 Placebo Microneedle Patch-related Unsolicited Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through the Final Study Visit (Day 27 - 38)</time_frame>
    <description>Grade 3, patch-related unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded. An adverse event is graded as Grade 3 if the event is significant or prevents daily activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of New-onset Medical Conditions (NOMC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through the Final Study Visit (Day 27 - 38).</time_frame>
    <description>The number of new-onset medical conditions (NOMC) were recorded. NOMC were tabulated by overall and treatment related events.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of Vaccination Methods</measure>
    <time_frame>Final Visit (Day 27 - 38)</time_frame>
    <description>LARs were asked to state their preference for different methods of vaccine delivery, assuming that a vaccine patch were to be available in the next two years. LARs reported their preference for their child receiving 1) a vaccine by shot or nasal spray given by a healthcare worker, 2) a vaccine patch given by a healthcare worker, 3) a vaccine patch given by the LAR but monitored by a healthcare worker, or 4) a vaccine patch given by the LAR at home. LARs rated their preference on a scale from 0 (definitely not) to 10 (definitely so).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Experience</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 2, Day 8, Final Visit (Day 27-38)</time_frame>
    <description>LARs were asked to report their overall experience with the study so far at each study visit related to Patch 1. Experiences were rated on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 = very negative and 5 = very positive.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Solicited Application Site Reactogenicity Events.</title>
        <description>The occurrence of solicited reactogenicity events at the application site was recorded. The solicited reactogenicity events are reactions that are common or expected to occur with application of a microneedle patch and include induration/swelling, erythema, ecchymosis, itching, pain, and tenderness. The Legally Authorized Representatives (LARs) of participants were provided with a memory aid, thermometer and ruler to record the presence of solicited symptoms and oral temperature. Reactogenicity event details were collected via review of the subject's memory aid and by interview with the subject LAR. Reactogenicity events were graded on a scale from 0 (not present) to 3 (significant or severe).</description>

        <description>LARs were asked to state their preference for different methods of vaccine delivery, assuming that a vaccine patch were to be available in the next two years. LARs reported their preference for their child receiving 1) a vaccine by shot or nasal spray given by a healthcare worker, 2) a vaccine patch given by a healthcare worker, 3) a vaccine patch given by the LAR but monitored by a healthcare worker, or 4) a vaccine patch given by the LAR at home.

          <title>Acceptability of Vaccination Methods</title>
          <description>LARs were asked to state their preference for different methods of vaccine delivery, assuming that a vaccine patch were to be available in the next two years. LARs reported their preference for their child receiving 1) a vaccine by shot or nasal spray given by a healthcare worker, 2) a vaccine patch given by a healthcare worker, 3) a vaccine patch given by the LAR but monitored by a healthcare worker, or 4) a vaccine patch given by the LAR at home. LARs rated their preference on a scale from 0 (definitely not) to 10 (definitely so).</description>
