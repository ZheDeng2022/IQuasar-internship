  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a sedated procedure traditionally performed using air insufflation during the&#xD;
      insertion phase of the procedure. Recently, the use of water method (eg, water infusion or&#xD;
      water exchange techniques) during the insertion phase of colonoscopy has been reported to&#xD;
      increase the proportion of patients in whom complete unsedated colonoscopy could be achieved,&#xD;
      reduce patient recovery time burdens, decrease abdominal discomfort during and after&#xD;
      colonoscopy, enhance cecal intubation, and increase willingness to repeat an unsedated&#xD;
      colonoscopy. However, there has been no study on the use of water method during the training&#xD;
      of primary care doctors or nurse endoscopists in flexible sigmoidoscopy for colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In unsedated endoscopic procedure such as FS, endoscope insertion techniques that can&#xD;
      potentially reduce patient discomfort and increase the rate of achieving an adequate depth of&#xD;
      scope insertion are desirable. Our current study aims to evaluate the impact of water method&#xD;
      during insertion phase of FS in the training of primary care doctors or nurse endoscopists&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that there are about 1.2 million patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      worldwide, with a rising trend in CRC incidence and mortality globally. In Hong Kong,&#xD;
      colorectal cancer ranks first in cancer incidence and second in cancer mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRC is one of the most preventable cancers because its development in general follows an&#xD;
      adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Adenomas are considered precursor lesions for CRC. Recent&#xD;
      guidelines from USA, Europe and Asia Pacific region recommend CRC screening for average-risk&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals starting at age 50. Modalities such as guaiac-based fecal occult&#xD;
      blood tests (gFOBT), fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, and&#xD;
      colonoscopy are among the acceptable options for CRC screening. Studies have shown that early&#xD;
      detection and removal of colorectal adenoma by screening flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) and&#xD;
      screening colonoscopy with polypectomy reduce CRC incidence and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately two-thirds of CRC are located in the sigmoid colon and rectum, which can be&#xD;
      diagnosed by FS. In countries where colonoscopy may not be widely available or a prolonged&#xD;
      waiting time exists, FS becomes an attractive option for CRC screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When compared to colonoscopy, FS has the advantages of being an unsedated procedure,&#xD;
      requiring less stringent bowel prep, and being less technically demanding. While flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy have traditionally been performed by gastroenterologists or surgeons, studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that adequately trained primary care doctors and nurse endoscopists can&#xD;
      perform screening flexible sigmoidoscopy as safely and effectively as gastroenterologists or&#xD;
      surgeons. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), the Society of American&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), and the The Society of Gastrointestinal Nurses&#xD;
      and Associates (SGNA) recommend 25 supervised procedures for training in FS. Hawes R et al&#xD;
      reported that at least 30 supervised procedures were needed before 85% - 90% of the&#xD;
      procedures were graded as competent in doctors without prior experience on rigid&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy. In another report, at least 50 supervised procedures have been suggested for&#xD;
      FS training of clinicians without prior endoscopic skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a technical standpoint, colonoscopy is a sedated procedure traditionally performed using&#xD;
      air insufflation during the insertion phase of the procedure. Recently, the use of water&#xD;
      method (eg, water infusion or water exchange techniques) during the insertion phase of&#xD;
      colonoscopy has been reported to increase the proportion of patients in whom complete&#xD;
      unsedated colonoscopy could be achieved, reduce patient recovery time burdens, decrease&#xD;
      abdominal discomfort during and after colonoscopy, enhance cecal intubation, and increase&#xD;
      willingness to repeat an unsedated colonoscopy. However, there has been no study on the use&#xD;
      of water method during the training of primary care doctors or nurse endoscopists in flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy for colorectal cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In unsedated endoscopic procedure such as FS, endoscope insertion techniques that can&#xD;
      potentially reduce patient discomfort and increase the rate of achieving an adequate depth of&#xD;
      scope insertion are desirable. Our current study aims to evaluate the impact of water method&#xD;
      during insertion phase of FS in the training of primary care doctors or nurse endoscopists&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer screening.&#xD;
