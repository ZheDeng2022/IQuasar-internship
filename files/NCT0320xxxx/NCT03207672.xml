    <textblock>
      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7389 liposomal formulation (E7389-LF) will be determined&#xD;
      in the dose escalation part. Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy will be assessed&#xD;
      using treatment regimen evaluated in dose escalation part in participants with breast cancer&#xD;
      (up to 3 prior regimens of chemotherapy) in the expansion part 1 and in participants with&#xD;
      adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), gastric cancer (GC), esophageal cancer (EGC), small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC) and breast cancer (with no prior regimens of chemotherapy) in the expansion&#xD;
      part 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively.&#xD;

For target lesions, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. For non-target lesions, CR is defined as the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (less than [&lt;] 10 millimeter [mm] short axis). Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in the short axis to &lt;10 mm.

    <time_frame>From the date of first dose of study drug until progressive disease (PD), death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 6 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first. For target lesions PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. For non-target lesions, progressive disease is defined as the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>
