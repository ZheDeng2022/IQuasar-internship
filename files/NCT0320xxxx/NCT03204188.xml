  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (hereby referred as CLL) are&#xD;
      tumors of B cells. A subset of patients categorized as high-risk CLL has a poor clinical&#xD;
      outcome when treated with conventional chemotherapy. This single-arm, phase II study&#xD;
      investigates the combination of ibrutinib, fludarabine and pembrolizumab for treatment of&#xD;
      CLL. Ibrutinib is an orally administered therapy for CLL. Fludarabine is a well-tolerated&#xD;
      drug that has been widely used to treat CLL. Also, fludarabine can modulate CLL cells as well&#xD;
      as immune cells that support the growth of CLL cells. Pembrolizumab recruits immune cells to&#xD;
      attack CLL cells. With this approach we hope to achieve a greater reduction in CLL cells than&#xD;
      with single agent ibrutinib andto restore healthier immune system that could contribute to&#xD;
      durable responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the rate of complete response to ibrutinib, short course fludarabine and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with active CLL meeting treatment indications defined by 2008 International Workshop&#xD;
      on CLL (IWCLL) consensus guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-risk CLL defined by one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapsed/refractory disease status (except patients with deletion 13q AND mutated IgHV),&#xD;
           or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of high-risk mutations regardless of prior treatment status: deletion 17p, TP53&#xD;
           mutation, NOTCH1 mutation, or complex cytogenetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline: Treatment on this study is given in cycles from cycle -3 to 17, then in months&#xD;
      beyond cycle 17. Cycles -3 to -1 are 28-day cycles. Cycles 1 to 17 are 21-day cycles. After&#xD;
      completion of 1 year of pembrolizumab, the time on study is by chronological months on study&#xD;
      from starting pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ibrutinib is given starting from cycle -3 and continuously until disease progression or&#xD;
           intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fludarabine is given on cycle -2 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab is given every 3 weeks starting from cycle 1 for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal residual disease will be measured at 2 years from cycle 1 to determine the need&#xD;
           for long- term treatment with ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Previously-untreated patients who achieve minimal residual disease negativity will&#xD;
                stop ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who do not achieve minimal residual disease negativity or who has&#xD;
                Relapsed/refractory CLL will continue ibrutinib.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the combination of ibrutinib, fludarabine and pembrolizumab for&#xD;
      treatment of CLL. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (hereby&#xD;
      referred as CLL) are tumors of B cells. A subset of patients categorized as high-risk CLL has&#xD;
      a poor clinical outcome when treated with conventional chemotherapy. High-risk CLL is defined&#xD;
      by relapsed/refractory disease status, or the presence of high-risk mutations, such as&#xD;
      deletion 17p, TP53, and NOTCH1. While the cause of CLL is still unclear, studies have&#xD;
      indicated critical factors required for the tumor cells. First, CLL cells grow and survive&#xD;
      because they receive signals through the B-cell receptor (BCR); and second, CLL cells benefit&#xD;
      from interactions with other cells, especially T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation through the BCR can be blocked by ibrutinib, which is an oral drug that&#xD;
      selectively inhibits Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK). In clinical trials, ibrutinib&#xD;
      demonstrated safety and high response rates in patients with high-risk disease. Ibrutinib has&#xD;
      gained FDA approval as a treatment for CLL regardless of prior treatment or cytogenetic&#xD;
      status. However, single-agent ibrutinib has limitations; the drug does not eliminate all&#xD;
      tumor cells and, with time, the tumor cells may become resistant. Therefore, combination of&#xD;
      ibrutinib with other drugs could be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To investigate the rate of complete response to ibrutinib, short course fludarabine and&#xD;
&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
