  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of GERD is estimated to be as high as 20% in the US, and up to 50% remain&#xD;
      symptomatic on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The clinical approach to understand the&#xD;
      mechanism of nonresponse is not standardized, and patients will often undergo various tests:&#xD;
      1) pH-impedance, 2) wireless pH monitoring over 96 hours, 3) high-resolution impedance&#xD;
      manometry (HRIM), and 4) mucosal impedance (MI). Controversy exists regarding the best&#xD;
      technique, optimal study protocol and treatment approach for the PPI non-responder (PPINR)&#xD;
      group, resulting in inappropriate resource utilization and a failure to provide effective&#xD;
      personalized care. The first aim is to identify the relevant physiologic parameters of&#xD;
      diagnostic tools in their ability to predict PPI requirement. In Aim Two, these results will&#xD;
      be applied to guide the formal development of a clinical algorithm for the management of&#xD;
      PPINRs with personalized clinical pathways based on mechanism of treatment failure. We will&#xD;
      first perform a prospective comparison trial of 240 PPINR subjects at 2 sites over 4 years.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete symptom questionnaires and undergo diagnostic testing (pH-impedance on&#xD;
      PPI therapy, HRIM, 96-hr wireless pH monitoring off PPI therapy and MI). Those who have a&#xD;
      positive pH study and/or resume PPI therapy will receive escalation of therapy with&#xD;
      dexlansoprazole. We will compare the ability of 96-hr wireless pH monitoring vs pH impedance&#xD;
      to predict PPI requirement and response to dexlansoprazole, respectively. We will explore&#xD;
      whether MI is equivalent to 96-hr wireless pH monitoring in predicting PPI requirement.&#xD;
      Lastly, we will determine whether HRIM metrics can be utilized to determine reflux burden,&#xD;
      mechanism and response to treatment. Next, the investigators will develop quality measures&#xD;
      for reflux testing in order to develop a simplified management strategy for the PPINR group.&#xD;
      The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology will be utilized with an expert working group to&#xD;
      develop formal validated quality measures for reflux testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease is estimated to be as high as 20% in the&#xD;
      United States, and up to 50% of these patients remain symptomatic on proton pump inhibitor&#xD;
      (PPI) therapy. Unfortunately, the clinical approach to understand the mechanism of&#xD;
      nonresponse is not standardized, and patients will often undergo various esophageal function&#xD;
      tests: 1) pH-impedance, 2) wireless pH monitoring over 96 hours, 3) high-resolution impedance&#xD;
      manometry (HRIM), and 4) mucosal impedance. Currently significant controversy exists&#xD;
      regarding the best technique, optimal study protocol and treatment approach for the PPI&#xD;
      non-responder (PPINR) group, resulting in inappropriate resource utilization and a failure to&#xD;
      provide effective personalized care. As such, PPINRs contribute to a large healthcare burden&#xD;
      in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the study is to identify the relevant physiologic parameters of the&#xD;
      aforementioned diagnostic tools in their ability to predict PPI requirement. Subsequently, in&#xD;
      Aim Two, these results will be applied to guide the formal development of a clinical&#xD;
      algorithm for the management of PPINRs with personalized clinical pathways based on mechanism&#xD;
      of treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will first perform a prospective comparison trial of 240 PPINR subjects at&#xD;
      two centers over a 4 year period. Subjects will complete symptom questionnaires and undergo&#xD;
      diagnostic testing (pH-impedance on PPI therapy, HRIM, 96-hthe wireless pH monitoring off of&#xD;
      PPI therapy and mucosal impedance). Those who have a positive pH study and/or resume PPI&#xD;
      therapy will receive escalation of acid suppression therapy with dexlansoprazole. Experiments&#xD;
      1a &amp; 1b will compare the ability of 96-hthe wireless pH monitoring vs pH impedance to predict&#xD;
      PPI requirement and response to dexlansoprazole, respectively. Experiment 1c will explore&#xD;
      whether mucosal impedance is equivalent to 96-hthe wireless pH monitoring in predicting PPI&#xD;
      requirement. Lastly, Experiment 1d will determine whether HRIM metrics can be utilized to&#xD;
      determine reflux burden, mechanism and response to treatment. Next, the investigators will&#xD;
      develop quality measures for reflux testing in order to develop a simplified management&#xD;
      strategy for the PPINR group. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology will be utilized with&#xD;
      an expert working group to develop formal validated quality measures for reflux testing based&#xD;
      on results from aim 1 in addition to the available literature &amp; evidence. This will be&#xD;
      conducted over twelve months (years 4 to 5).&#xD;
