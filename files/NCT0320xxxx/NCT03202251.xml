  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure using a device that improves motor&#xD;
      symptoms of specific neurological and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease or&#xD;
      Essential Tremor. As part of the patient's care, the DBS is implanted when symptoms cannot be&#xD;
      satisfactorily controlled with medications or conventional therapies. Lower urinary tract&#xD;
      symptoms are common in patients who have underlying neurological or movement disorders and&#xD;
      control over lower urinary tract function is poorly understood. In this study investigators&#xD;
      are evaluating the effects of DBS on lower urinary tract function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that improves motor symptoms of&#xD;
      specific neurological and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease or Essential Tremor.&#xD;
      DBS is implanted when symptoms cannot be satisfactorily controlled with medications or&#xD;
      conventional therapies. After insertion of deep electrodes, electrical stimulation will be&#xD;
      delivered to modulate specific neurons in certain areas of the brain. Despite, the known&#xD;
      motor effects for DBS, its nonmotor effects on other organs such as the urinary tract and&#xD;
      bladder function remains unclear. Lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, urgency,&#xD;
      urinary incontinence, or incomplete bladder emptying are common in patients who have&#xD;
      underlying neurological or movement disorders. In addition, central neural control over lower&#xD;
      urinary tract function is still poorly understand. In this trial investigators plan to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of Deep Brain Stimulators (DBS) on lower urinary tract function. This&#xD;
      trial is designed to test the hypothesis that DBS improves objective and subjective symptoms&#xD;
      of lower urinary tract function in specific patient populations. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      test this hypothesis by using validated patient reported outcome questionnaires and&#xD;
      urodynamic testing (both are part of routine care for neurogenic bladder) before and after&#xD;
      DBS implantation. In addition, this trial will shed some light in understanding higher neural&#xD;
      control of bladder and potentially identify target areas for future intervention.&#xD;
