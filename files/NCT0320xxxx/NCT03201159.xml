  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug (VLX103) is being developed for the treatment of Alcoholic Steatohepatitis and&#xD;
      other liver diseases. Alcoholic Steatohepatitis is an inflammatory (associated with&#xD;
      irritation, swelling and cell damage) disease that affects the liver. It is associated with&#xD;
      heavy and chronic intake of alcohol and presence of fat in the liver. Signs and symptoms&#xD;
      often include fever, yellowing of the skin, nausea and impairment of liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics (what the drug&#xD;
      does to the body) and pharmacokinetics (how the drug is handled by the human body, like&#xD;
      absorption and elimination) of increasing doses of VLX103 in subjects with moderate Alcoholic&#xD;
      Steatohepatitis. In other words, we will evaluate how your body tolerates VLX103 at a&#xD;
      specific dose and the effects that this VLX103 dose has on your liver and your body in&#xD;
      general. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate if VLX103 has the potential&#xD;
      to treat Alcoholic Steatohepatitis patients, to determine the maximum dose that can be&#xD;
      tolerated, and to measure the levels of VLX103 in your blood at different time points during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VLX103 is an experimental drug. Experimental means that the drug has not been approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Alcoholic Steatohepatitis. The active&#xD;
      ingredient in VLX103, pentamidine, is approved for treating parasitic (microorganisms)&#xD;
      infections. Pentamidine is currently approved and marketed in about 20 countries, including&#xD;
      the United States, for use by injection (administered by a syringe) and by inhalation&#xD;
      (administered by a nebulizer) for other health conditions. However, VLX103 is the first oral&#xD;
      form of pentamidine being developed, and is administered by mouth as an oral tablet.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multiple cohorts, dose escalation Phase Ib study, in which up to 3&#xD;
      doses of VLX103 will be assessed for safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in well&#xD;
      defined moderate ASH patients cohorts receiving increasing doses of VLX103. The overall study&#xD;
      design is characteristic for early phase, first in patient clinical evaluation of safety and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, especially when prudent dose escalation is recommended. A maximum of 18&#xD;
      moderate ASH patients will be enrolled and treated in at least 4 clinical sites throughout&#xD;
      the US. The open label nature of the study design will allow to efficiently monitor the&#xD;
      safety of VLX103 throughout the trial, and taking rapid decisions about dosing adjustments&#xD;
      (dose reduction or discontinuation within each dosing cohort, for each patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an adequate screening period (Day -7 to -1), all eligible patients of the first dosing&#xD;
      cohort will receive the initial, low dose of VLX103 150 mg per day (QD) for 14 consecutive&#xD;
      days. Subjects will be evaluated only for safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      during this period. Pre-established safety criteria will be used to decide upon dose&#xD;
      escalation, for each subject. If patients tolerate well VLX103 at 150 mg QD , a second cohort&#xD;
      will then receive a 300 mg QD regimen for 14 days. At the end of this period, safety,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics will be assessed as well. The next dose will be 450 mg&#xD;
      QD for 14 days, with the same monitoring process. Long term safety will also be assessed, at&#xD;
      all 3 doses, at Day 30 and 90 post treatment initiation.&#xD;
