    <description>A seizure was a brief episode of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. POS was a seizure that starts in one area of the brain that may or may not associated with loss of awareness and consciousness.

    <description>The Treatment Phase consists of the 4 milligrams (mg) Treatment Phase (the Titration Period [6 weeks] and the Maintenance Period [26 weeks]) and the 8 mg Treatment Phase (the Titration Period [4 weeks] and the Maintenance Period [26 weeks]) if participants require a higher dose. In the 4 mg Titration Period (6 weeks), participants will initiate 2 mg perampanel once daily (QD) for 2 weeks and then will be up-titrated to 4 mg QD and will continue this dose for 4 weeks. If participants have no safety issues at the end of the Titration Period, they will start the 4 mg Maintenance Period for 26 weeks. Participants will only need the higher dose if they are having seizures. In the 8 mg Titration Period (4 weeks), participants will be administered 6 mg perampanel QD for 2 weeks and then will be up-titrated to 8 mg QD and will continue this dose for 2 weeks. If participants have no safety issues at the end of the Titration Period, they will start the 8 mg Maintenance Period for 26 weeks.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 38 investigative sites in Japan and Korea from 28 Jun 2017 to 27 Jul 2020. A total of 98 participants were screened, of which 07 were screen failures and 91 entered Treatment Phase. Of these, 89 participants received the study treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study consisted of 2 main phases: Treatment Phase (consisted of a 4 milligram [mg] Treatment Phase [Titration Period {6 weeks} and Maintenance Period {26 weeks}], and for those participants who need a higher dose, the 8 mg Treatment Phase [Titration Period {4 weeks} and Maintenance Period {26 weeks}]) and Extension Phase.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Perampanel</title>
          <description>Participants received 2 mg of perampanel tablets orally QD for up to 2 weeks, then dose was up-titrated to 4 mg QD for 4 weeks in 4-mg Titration Period (6 Weeks) followed by 4 mg of perampanel tablets orally QD in Maintenance Period (26 weeks). If a participant experienced seizures during 4-mg Maintenance Period, the participant was transitioned to 8-mg Titration Period based on the participant's safety and tolerability. In 8-mg Titration Period (4 weeks), participants received 6 mg of perampanel tablets orally QD for 2 weeks and up-titrated to 8 mg QD for 2 weeks followed by 8 mg of perampanel tablets orally QD in Maintenance Period (26 weeks). Participants who completed Treatment Phase or who ended Maintenance Period of Treatment Phase due to insufficient efficacy or intolerability, and who agreed to continue perampanel monotherapy entered Extension Phase and received perampanel tablets in 2 mg to 8 mg dose range at the discretion of the investigator based on the participants clinical response and/or tolerability until insufficient seizure control or lack of tolerability, or initiation of additional antiepileptic drug (AEDs).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Partial-onset Seizures (POS) Who Achieved Seizure-free Status During the 26-week Maintenance Period of 4 mg Perampanel</title>
        <description>A seizure was a brief episode of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. POS was a seizure that starts in one area of the brain that may or may not associated with loss of awareness and consciousness. Seizure-free status was defined as no incidence of seizure during 26-week Maintenance Period of 4 mg perampanel.</description>

If a participant experienced seizures during 4-mg Maintenance Period, the participant was transitioned to 8-mg Titration Period based on the participant's safety and tolerability.
