      The study is a Randomized Intervention, Multi-Center Study to Determine the Role of Fatty&#xD;
      Acids in Serum and Breast Milk in preventing Retinopathy of Prematurity Subjects who meet all&#xD;
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. Upon entry into&#xD;
      the study, subjects will be randomized and given a unique subject number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized intervention study of 105+105 (number based on power analysis regarding up to&#xD;
      date ROP frequency, see 5.1 and 11.1) infants without major malformations born with a&#xD;
      gestational age less than 28 weeks + 0 days will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year around 10-12 % of all infants in Europe and the USA are born prematurely which&#xD;
      results in 950000 preterm infants per year (500000 in Europe and 450000 in USA). Direct&#xD;
      complications of preterm birth account for one million deaths each year worldwide, and&#xD;
      preterm birth is a risk factor in over 50% of all neonatal deaths. In addition, preterm birth&#xD;
      can result in a range of long-term complications in survivors, with the frequency and&#xD;
      severity of adverse outcomes rising with decreasing gestational age and decreasing quality of&#xD;
      care. The annual costs, beside patient suffering and parental emotional stress, of preterm&#xD;
      care in USA amounts to 26,2 billion United States dollar in terms of immediate neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care, subsequent long-term complex health care needs, as well as lost economic&#xD;
      productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible problems that may occur after a preterm birth are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organ disorders (intestine, heart, lung - BPD and asthma), ears (hearing problems), eyes (ROP&#xD;
      and visual problems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding problems and failure to thrive, Poor general growth,Physical disabilities such as&#xD;
      cerebral palsy,Cognitive impairment,Learning disability or behavioral problems such as&#xD;
      attention deficit (ADD) or autism spectrum disorders. Of infants born extremely prematurely,&#xD;
      i.e. at less than 28 weeks gestation or with extremely low birth weight (&lt;1000 g), 20 - 30%&#xD;
      may show developmental disorders requiring treatment (3, 4). Impaired cognitive development&#xD;
      and abnormal behavior may cause problems at school; in some countries the percentage of&#xD;
      learning difficulties in the preterm population is as high as 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much has been done to improve neonatal care e.g. target levels for oxygen saturation has been&#xD;
      an issue for extensive discussions and clinical trials. In fact, the optimal oxygen&#xD;
      saturation level for preterm infants has been called &quot;a moving target&quot;, fluctuating almost as&#xD;
      much as our patients oxygen saturation levels. Reaching a consensus on what these levels&#xD;
      should be is still a work in progress. Nutrient delivery is another important and central&#xD;
      area of neonatal care which is closely associated with morbidity outcome, and is in need of&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines. The project therefore aims to improve nutrient delivery to prevent&#xD;
      or reduce the development of preterm disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a long tradition in neonatology to develop national and in some cases local&#xD;
      guidelines for care in each individual Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). This has resulted&#xD;
      in a wide range of treatment approaches and experience-based strategies. These approaches may&#xD;
      differ between countries and hospitals and even between neonatologists at the same hospital.&#xD;
      There is, for example, a fragmented approach and incomplete compliance to guidelines for&#xD;
      nutrient delivery, one important medical parameter tightly associated with neonatal&#xD;
      morbidities. Although over 3000 randomized controlled trials have been reported in the field&#xD;
      of neonatology, few interventions have yet been subjected to unbiased evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available nutritional fatty acid guidelines are not evidence-based and neither optimal&#xD;
      composition nor amounts needed to meet the demands of these immature infants are known. What&#xD;
      is known is that most infants born extremely preterm develop a large energy deficit resulting&#xD;
      in poor neonatal growth. Many experience moderate hyperglycemia associated with lipid&#xD;
      infusion. Hyperglycemia is a strong risk factor for preterm mortality as well as for ROP and&#xD;
      other disorders of prematurity. With commonly used lipid solutions, preterm new-borns&#xD;
      experience a rapid decline in blood fatty acid proportions of the long chain polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids (LCPUFA), Arachidonic acid (AA) and DHA, as compared to the intra-uterine&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Sweden, approximately 300 infants are born extremely preterm i.e. before 28 gestational&#xD;
      weeks yearly. With modern neonatal care, infants born as early as at 23-24 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation, in the second trimester of gestation, have more than 50% chance of survival. The&#xD;
      third trimester is a period of intense growth and differentiation of the central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) of which the retina is a part, with rapid formation of synapses and dendritic&#xD;
      spines and development of retinal photoreceptor cells. During this fetal time period AA and&#xD;
      DHA are selectively transferred from the mother to her fetus and blood fractions of DHA&#xD;
      increase above maternal values. AA fractions are high, twice those of the mother, from at&#xD;
      least 24 weeks of gestation. After very preterm birth, the fractions of AA and DHA fall. In&#xD;
      utero glucose, not lipid is the main source of energy and the LCPUFAs transferred during the&#xD;
      third trimester play important structural and functional roles in membranes of the central&#xD;
      nervous system and most other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHA, which is an omega-3 LCPUFA is derived from algae and oily fish is the pre-dominant fatty&#xD;
      acid of membrane phospholipids in the brain grey matter and the retina, especially its rod&#xD;
      outer segments. DHA is not merely a structural component of cell membranes but essential for&#xD;
      proper function of membranes. Since the capacity to synthesize DHA is limited in humans and&#xD;
      especially in infants, it needs to be provided in the diet. Dietary DHA is needed for optimal&#xD;
      functional maturation of the retina and visual cortex, it is a major component at the&#xD;
      synaptic site, modulating the uptake and release of neurotransmitters. Absolute accretion of&#xD;
      DHA in the brain is greater before than after term and DHA is also accumulated in adipose&#xD;
      tissue. In addition, omega-3 LCPUFA has the potential to reduce oxidative stress, deranged&#xD;
      glucose metabolism and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many studies have focused on DHA and its role in fetal and neonatal development, few&#xD;
      studies have addressed the role of the omega-6 LCPUFA AA during fetal life and after preterm&#xD;
      birth. Like DHA, AA is an important component of cell membranes. Altered cell membrane&#xD;
      composition results in altered cell function. AA is abundant in the vascular endothelium and&#xD;
      in glia where it plays different roles than DHA which is especially abundant in retinal rod&#xD;
      outer segments and in synapses and brain grey matter. In the retina AA metabolites contribute&#xD;
      to neurovascular coupling i.e. modulation of blood flow with neuronal activity. Metabolites&#xD;
      of AA both stimulate and inhibit inflammation and angiogenesis. In addition, AA is involved&#xD;
      in blood vessel tonus control with AA derivatives mediating both vessel relaxation and&#xD;
      contraction. Low AA concentrations are associated with late onset sepsis in preterm infants.&#xD;
      Improved development of very preterm infants fed twice as much AA as DHA than of infants fed&#xD;
      equal amounts of AA and DHA was recently reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After extremely preterm birth energy expenditures increase, oral intake often takes some&#xD;
      weeks to establish and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is invariably required during the&#xD;
      initial postnatal weeks. After birth lipids are the main source of energy, initially as&#xD;
      integral part of administered TPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants treated with soy and olive oil based parenteral lipid solutions (Intralipid&#xD;
      and Clinoleic) have low levels of LCPUFAs and increased supply of DHA has been recommended.&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that low DHA levels are associated with compromised fetal insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and insulin resistance in preterm infants is common and strongly associated with&#xD;
      neonatal morbidity. Few studies have examined associations between low AA and preterm&#xD;
      neonatal morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most severe morbidities affecting preterm infants is sight threatening ROP, a&#xD;
      disorder characterized by reduced retinal vascularization followed by pathologic&#xD;
      neovascularization which can lead to retinal detachment and blindness similar to diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy. ROP develops during the neonatal period and outcome is available around term age&#xD;
      (40 postmenstrual weeks), which makes it a useful marker for short term outcome of&#xD;
      neurovascular development in interventional studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal studies, a diet rich in omega-3 LCPUFAs reduced pathologic retinal&#xD;
      neovascularization in oxygen induced retinopathy, through reduction of inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      and attenuation of endothelial cell activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In two recent studies, the frequencies of ROP needing treatment as well as cholestasis were&#xD;
      significantly reduced when a solution containing fish oil (SMOFlipid) was provided compared&#xD;
      to Clinoleic in preterm infants with birth weight 1250 grams. In addition, ROP frequency was&#xD;
      reduced in infants receiving SMOFlipid as compared to those receiving Intralipid. No&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing convention-al fatty acid administration without and&#xD;
      with supplementation of AA and DHA from birth with regard to ROP has been published.&#xD;
