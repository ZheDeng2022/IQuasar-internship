  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An international, multicenter, single arm Phase II trial to determine the efficacy, safety&#xD;
      and quality of life of pazopanib treatment after previous therapy with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      treatment. Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled, with approximately 40 of those&#xD;
      patients receiving pazopanib as 2nd-line therapy. Patients will receive treatment with&#xD;
      standard dose pazopanib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, pregnancy, death,&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason or until study end. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed for survival. Patients who discontinue treatment without documented&#xD;
      disease progression will be followed for efficacy.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life measured through the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Kidney Symptom Index (FSKI-DRS).&#xD;
FKSI-DRS is a validated tool developed specifically to assess symptoms experienced by patients with advanced kidney cancer. The symptoms covered by the 9-item FKSI-DRS include fatigue, pain, weight loss, dyspnea, cough, fever and hematuria. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale (0=not at all to 4=very much). FKSI-DRS total score ranged from 0 (most severe symptoms) to 36 (no symptoms) with a higher score indicating a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in EuroQoL 5-level instrument (EQ-5D-5L) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until the end of treatment, approximately up to 44 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patient has not recovered from toxicity from prior immune checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
             therapy. Recovery is defined as ≤ NCI-CTCAE Grade 1, except for liver function test&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Disease recurrence less than 6 months from the last dose of prior neoadjuvant or&#xD;
             adjuvant therapy (including VEGF-R TKI)&#xD;
