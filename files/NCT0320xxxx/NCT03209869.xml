  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma will receive ex-vivo&#xD;
      expanded and activated natural killer (NK) cells from a haploidentical donor in conjunction&#xD;
      with the immunocytokine, hu14.18-IL2.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Natural Killer cells, a type of white blood cell, circulate around the body and kill abnormal&#xD;
      cells (cells that are malignant, damaged or infected with virus). Sometimes cancer cells&#xD;
      adapt to the body's own NK cells and are able to avoid being killed by them. This clinical&#xD;
      trial uses two strategies to overcome the cancer cells' ability to avoid NK cell-mediated&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first strategy involves giving NK cells from another individual to the patient (in other&#xD;
      words, donor- or haploidentical-NK cells). This is done because NK cells from an individual&#xD;
      who is haploidentical (half-matched genetic make-up) are still able to effectively kill the&#xD;
      cancer cells. Unfortunately, only a limited number of NK cells can be obtained from a donor.&#xD;
      So, to increase the number of cancer-killing NK cells that will be given to the patient, the&#xD;
      donor NK cells will first be grown in a sterile laboratory environment and allowed to&#xD;
      multiply many-fold before they are infused into the patient. This growing process also&#xD;
      activates the donor NK cells, which increases their ability to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second strategy to overcome the cancer cells' ability to avoid NK cell-mediated death is&#xD;
      to administer the immunocytokine, hu14.18-IL2, every day for seven days after infusion of the&#xD;
      donor NK cells. The antibody portion (hu14.18) of the immunocytokine molecule &quot;flags&quot; the&#xD;
      neuroblastoma cells for destruction by NK cells and the cytokine portion (IL2) further&#xD;
      activates the NK cells (as well as other anti-tumor immune effector cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the donor NK cells are from a haploidentical individual, they are different enough to&#xD;
      be recognized as foreign cells and will be killed immediately (&quot;rejected&quot;) by the patients&#xD;
      own immune system unless the immune system is restrained. So, to allow the donor NK cells&#xD;
      time to kill neuroblastoma cells before they are &quot;rejected&quot;, a chemotherapy regimen is first&#xD;
      given to the patient to temporarily restrain the patient's own immune system. This also&#xD;
      allows &quot;room&quot; for the donor NK cells to live, multiply and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four courses of treatment are planned for each subject. Each course of treatment will be&#xD;
      approximately one month long and involves a week of chemotherapy followed by infusion of&#xD;
      donor NK cells. Beginning the day after the donor NK cell infusion, hu14.18-IL2 is infused&#xD;
      over four hours for seven consecutive days.&#xD;
