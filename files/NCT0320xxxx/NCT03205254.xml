    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to generate preliminary data on the effects of a&#xD;
      short-term diet of either fast food or Mediterranean type diet on HDL and microbiota&#xD;
      composition and function in healthy subjects, which includes both normal weight and&#xD;
      overweight/obese subjects.&#xD;

      Subjects will be recruited through word-of-mouth, flyers, newspaper advertisements, and&#xD;
      postings on the UC Davis Nutrition Department website. Interested individuals who respond to&#xD;
      notices will undergo a telephone screen to assess eligibility. A copy of the flyer, the&#xD;
      Nutrition Department website notice, newspaper advertisement, and phone screen are attached&#xD;
      with this submission. The subject population may reflect the ethnic and cultural diversity of&#xD;
      the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Consent Prospective subjects who pass the initial phone screening interview&#xD;
      (i.e. meet inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be admitted into the study and scheduled for a&#xD;
      consent visit. At the consent visit, after singing the consent form and agreeing to&#xD;
      participate, participants' weight, height, and blood pressure will be measured to ensure that&#xD;
      they meet inclusion criteria, and if their measurements agree with their reported values they&#xD;
      will be admitted into the study and scheduled for their baseline visit. At the consent visit,&#xD;
      subjects will also be instructed on how to complete a 3-day food record and will be asked to&#xD;
      complete and return it before the baseline visit. Participants will also be given a stool&#xD;
      collection kit during the consent visit to collect stool samples within 24 hours before their&#xD;
      first scheduled visit. Women who consent to participate will be scheduled to complete the&#xD;
      study within the luteal phase and menses of the menstrual cycle to avoid confounding&#xD;
      alterations in lipoproteins. If women participants are not able to remember the first day of&#xD;
      their last menstrual cycle, they will be instructed to note the start of their next menstrual&#xD;
      cycle and will then be scheduled accordingly thereafter. Subjects will be randomized to begin&#xD;
      either on the fast food arm or the Med arm. Each cohort of 4 participants will have 2&#xD;
      individuals who begin on the Med diet arm, and 2 individuals who begin on the fast food diet&#xD;
      arm, and each participant will be randomized into one of these two blocks and be assigned a&#xD;
      study ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit A At the scheduled baseline visit subjects will report to the Ragle Human&#xD;
      Nutrition Research Center located on the UC Davis campus (1283 Academic Surge, University of&#xD;
      California, Davis, in Davis CA 95616) for a 12-hour fasting blood draw and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements. They will be asked to bring their stool sample to this visit. Each participant&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete a health history questionnaire, a physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire, and a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The duration of the baseline study&#xD;
      visit will be approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm 1: (4 days) Following the baseline blood draw, subjects randomized to begin on the&#xD;
      fast food arm will consume a fast food diet for 4 days, Subjects randomized to begin on the&#xD;
      Med diet arm will consume foods provided to them and follow basic food preparation&#xD;
      instructions. At the end of each 4-day-long diet phase, subjects will report to the Ragle&#xD;
      Human Nutrition Research Center again for their first follow-up study visit (Study Visit 2).&#xD;
      Participants will be required to collect another stool sample to bring with them to their&#xD;
      visit and will complete a hunger and satiety questionnaire at either the lunch or dinner meal&#xD;
      each day on each diet arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Med diet arm, participants will pick up their meals and instructions from the&#xD;
      study team. During the fast food diet arm, participants will be given gift cards and meal&#xD;
      plans to follow for the on-campus fast food restaurants and will purchase meals at the fast&#xD;
      food restaurants on their own. For both dietary interventions, participants will follow the&#xD;
      appropriate meal plan, attached with this submission. They will also be instructed to&#xD;
      maintain their physical activity level during the study period. Subjects will be contacted&#xD;
      once during each dietary period by e-mail or phone and will be asked about their general&#xD;
      wellbeing, and to remind them to collect a stool sample for the next visit. To monitor&#xD;
      compliance, participants will fill out a compliance survey as well as bring in any leftover&#xD;
      food they do not consume. The leftover foods plus packaging will be weighed, and the weight&#xD;
      of packaging alone subtracted in order to obtain an accurate measurement of how much&#xD;
      participants actually consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit B This study visit will also be approximately 1 hour in duration, and will also&#xD;
      include a fasting blood draw, anthropometric measurements, and the same questionnaires as the&#xD;
      baseline study visit except they will not complete an FFQ. Participants will receive the&#xD;
      first installment of their study compensation at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Washout Period: (4 days) Following Study Visit B, subjects will enter a 4-day washout&#xD;
      period, in which they will return to their normal diets. Subjects will be required to&#xD;
      complete a 3-day food record during this time. At the end of the 4-day washout period,&#xD;
      subjects will return to the Ragle facility for the second follow-up Visit (Study Visit C).&#xD;
      Participants will be required to collect another stool sample to bring with them to their&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit C This study visit will also be approximately 1 hour in duration, and will also&#xD;
      include a fasting blood draw, anthropometric measurements, and the same questionnaires as&#xD;
      study visit B. Participants will receive the second installment of their study compensation&#xD;
      at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm 2: (4 days) At this time, participants who completed the mMed diet arm will now&#xD;
      begin the fast food diet arm, and those who completed the fast food diet arm will now enter&#xD;
      the mMed diet arm. All participants will be asked to complete a hunger and satiety&#xD;
      questionnaire during this time (4 days). At the end of the 4-day period subjects will return&#xD;
      for the third follow-up study visit (Study Visit D). Participants will be required to collect&#xD;
      a final stool sample to bring with them to their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit D This study visit will also be approximately 1 hour in duration, and will also&#xD;
      include a fasting blood draw, anthropometric measurements, and the same questionnaires as&#xD;
      study visits B and C. Subjects will receive the rest of their compensation at this time.&#xD;
