  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and eribulin work in treating&#xD;
      patients with inflammatory breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Cobimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and&#xD;
      eribulin may work better in treating patients with inflammatory breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine ORR (overall response rate) of metastatic inflammatory breast cancer (BC)&#xD;
      (mIBC) patients treated with this proposed combinatorial atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and&#xD;
      eribulin (ACE) therapy via phase II. (ACE, Cohort I) II. To determine ORR (overall response&#xD;
      rate) for double combination of atezolizumab and eribulin (AE). (AE, cohort II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further characterize the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab + cobimetinib +&#xD;
      eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To further characterize the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab + eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine CBR (clinical benefit rate): (stable disease [SD] + complete response [CR]&#xD;
      + partial response [PR] &gt;= 24 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the duration of response (DOR). IV. To determine progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS). V. To determine 2 years overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progressive disease (PD) biomarker changes induced by combinatorial&#xD;
      therapy using liquid and tissue based assays to investigate microenvironment via multiplex&#xD;
      imaging, proportional study of T cells: CD3, CD8 composition and change, macrophage (M1 and&#xD;
      M2), PD-L1 expression on circulating tumor cell (CTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the immune pathway related biomarker changes induced by combinatorial&#xD;
      therapy via multiplex serum cytokine assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. This translational biomarker assays will be done based on collaboration with plasma&#xD;
      based ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNA-seq) in collaboration with Lambowitz laboratory&#xD;
      (lab) (University of Texas at Austin [UT Austin]), Oncomine next-generation sequencing (NGS)&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over about 30-60 minutes every 2&#xD;
      weeks, cobimetinib orally (PO) daily for 3 weeks on, 1 week off for 4 weeks of the safety&#xD;
      lead-in course. Patients then receive atezolizumab IV over about 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks,&#xD;
      cobimetinib PO daily for 3 weeks on, 1 week off, and eribulin IV over 2-5 minutes on days 1&#xD;
      and 8 of cycles 1-4. Cycles 1-4 repeat every 21 days and subsequent cycles with atezolizumab&#xD;
      and cobimetinib repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over about 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks for cycles&#xD;
      1-6 and every 4 weeks for subsequent cycles, and eribulin IV over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8&#xD;
      of cycles 1-6. Cycles 1-6 repeat every 21 days and subsequent cycles with atezolizumab repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed for 3 months and then every 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;
