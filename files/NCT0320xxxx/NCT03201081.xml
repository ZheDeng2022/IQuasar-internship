  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of physical activity is one of the major causes for obesity and functional disability in&#xD;
      the elderly. Including regular exercise in elderly´s lifestyle is not an easy task. The main&#xD;
      objective was to analyse the effect of a motivational resistance-training programme on&#xD;
      satisfying the individual´s psychological needs, level of self-determination and body&#xD;
      composition. A quasi-experimental study was performed with 47 volunteers (29 females, 18&#xD;
      males) of 67-75 years of age, divided into two groups: experimental (n = 27) and control (n =&#xD;
      20). A 12-week intervention programme was performed, with a total of 36 sessions.&#xD;

      Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The study included a total of 47 subjects, (29 females, 18 males) ages 65 to 75&#xD;
      years, recruited from an elderly social club. The participants were divided into two groups:&#xD;
      experimental group (n=27; 10 men and 17 female) and control group (n=20; 8 men and 12&#xD;
      female). The sampling was natural and intentional. All subjects originated from Murcia&#xD;
      (Spain) and met the following inclusion criteria: had never previously attended classes in&#xD;
      fitness academies or were not currently performing regular physical activity, and had no&#xD;
      previous experience with resistance-training programmes. Exclusion criteria included any&#xD;
      history of neuromuscular, metabolic, hormonal or cardiovascular diseases; not taking any&#xD;
      medication that could influence hormonal and neuromuscular metabolism. In addition, the&#xD;
      participants were advised to not alter their diet during the study. Participants were&#xD;
      informed about the possible risks and discomforts that could arise and were asked to complete&#xD;
      a health history questionnaire and sign a consent form. The current study was approved of the&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of the Catholic University San Antonio of Murcia (Spain) following the&#xD;
      guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A quasi-experimental design (2x2) was developed, dividing the participants into two&#xD;
      groups; one experimental and one control. In this design, an initial measurement prior to the&#xD;
      intervention (pre-test) and a measurement after the intervention (post-test) were conducted.&#xD;
      This same research design has been used in previous studies, which has sought to assess the&#xD;
      effect of an intervention programme on body composition, motivational variables and&#xD;
      resistance-training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Procedure Motivational variables Behavioural regulation during exercise.&#xD;
      The Spanish version of Behavioural Regulation during Exercise Questionnaire was used. This&#xD;
      questionnaire allows to evaluate the type of motivational regulation related to physical&#xD;
      exercise, and consists in 23 items distributed in three dimensions, based on the established&#xD;
      distinction in the SDT between autonomous motivation, controlled motivation and demotivation.&#xD;
      Autonomous motivation was calculated using the mean score of intrinsic regulation (e.g.&#xD;
      &quot;Because I think that exercise is fun&quot;), integrated regulation (e.g. &quot;Because I believe that&#xD;
      physical exercise is consistent with my values&quot;) and identified regulation (e.g. &quot;I value the&#xD;
      benefits of exercise&quot;). Each of these regulations was composed of 4 items, except for the&#xD;
      identified regulations which was composed of 3 items. Controlled motivation was calculated&#xD;
      using the mean score of introjected regulation (e.g. &quot;I feel guilty when I don't exercise&quot;)&#xD;
      and external regulation (e.g. &quot;I feel under pressure from my friends/family to exercise&quot;)&#xD;
      with 4 items each. Demotivation (e.g. &quot;I don't see why I should have to exercise&quot;) was also&#xD;
      calculated using 4 items. Previous research in the physical activity and health context&#xD;
      demonstrated the internal reliability of the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic psychological needs during exercise. To assess the perceived need satisfaction of the&#xD;
      participants, the Spanish adaptation of the Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale was&#xD;
      used (BPNES), which is specific for the context of physical activity and health.67 The&#xD;
      questionnaire includes 12 items distributed in three dimensions. Four items measure autonomy&#xD;
      (e.g. &quot;I exercise according to what I intend to do&quot;), four items measure competence (e.g. &quot;I&#xD;
      feel that physical exercise is an activity that I do very well&quot;) and the other four items&#xD;
      measure relatedness (e.g. &quot;I have a close relationship with the people with whom I&#xD;
      exercise&quot;). Previous research in the physical activity and health context demonstrated the&#xD;
      internal reliability of the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The answers to the questionnaires were assessed on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7, where&#xD;
      one corresponded with the anchor statement &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and seven with the anchor&#xD;
      statement &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Before carrying out the intervention, the main researcher&#xD;
      contacted with the director of the social club to inform of the purpose of the study.&#xD;
      Likewise, all the participants involved were informed about the process that they were going&#xD;
      to follow, emphasizing that participation was voluntary. The researcher overviewed how to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaire and answered any questions that arose during the process. The&#xD;
      different questionnaires were completed in an adequate climate of concentration, with each&#xD;
      participant taking approximately 15-20 minutes to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition variables Total body weight was measured, after removal of shoes and heavy&#xD;
      outer clothing, using a Tanita BC-418 MA scale, (Tanita Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL)&#xD;
      to the nearest 0.1 kg.69 Standing height without shoes was measured using a Seca 202&#xD;
      stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.1 cm. To minimize the potential source&#xD;
      of Bioimpedance systems (BIA) related to total body weight and height, body composition&#xD;
      assessment was performed by a level two anthropometrist following International Society for&#xD;
      the Advancement of Kinanthropometry recommendations.70 Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated&#xD;
      as the ratio of weight to squared height. BMI was categorized into underweight (&lt;18.50&#xD;
      kg/m2), normal weight (18.50-24.99 kg/m2), overweight (25.00-29.99 kg/m2), and obese (30.00&#xD;
      kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioelectrical impedance was measured using the Tanita BC-418 MA scale, with participants&#xD;
      standing barefooted on the analyser's footpads, and holding its handles. Fat mass (FM) and&#xD;
      muscle mass (MM) were then calculated, using the prediction equation described by Jebb et al.&#xD;
      Bioelectrical impedance was chosen due to its ease of use and less invasive nature, making it&#xD;
      suitable for assessment of body composition in vulnerable populations such as obese&#xD;
      individuals and elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-dimensional intervention programme Prior to the commencement of the study, the subjects&#xD;
      were submitted to two weeks of training, two sessions per week, in order to be familiarized&#xD;
      with the resistance-training exercises performed in the current study. During this&#xD;
      familiarization period, a higher emphasis was placed on learning the proper exercise&#xD;
      techniques, and brief pauses between repetitions were allowed in order to reset their&#xD;
      starting positions when necessary. During the second week of the familiarization period, a&#xD;
      pre-test of the motivational variables was performed, as well as measuring weight, height,&#xD;
      BMI, FM and MM. Both pre-test and post-test were carried out in one day between 8:00 and 9:00&#xD;
      a.m. After the pre-test, the experimental group underwent a resistance-training programme for&#xD;
      12 weeks, where different motivational strategies were used. The resistance-training&#xD;
      programme incorporated resistance exercises of six major regions and consisted in 3 training&#xD;
      sessions per week on non-consecutive days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). The six regions&#xD;
      were chest, back, triceps, biceps, shoulders and legs. The different regions were grouped&#xD;
      into a circuit. The control group, on the other hand, did not participate in the&#xD;
      resistance-training programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group exercised at a moderate intensity (8 to 12 repetitions). The load was&#xD;
      increased during the 12 weeks from 65% 1-RM to 80% 1-RM. This training load was increased&#xD;
      when the individual could perform more than the prescribed number of repetitions (12&#xD;
      repetitions), following the OMNI-RES scale and a hard effort perception level. A 1-2 minutes&#xD;
      resting period was allowed between sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All training sessions were monitored by an experienced physical education professional and&#xD;
      the subjects were not allowed to perform any additional exercises during the training period.&#xD;
      During the training weeks, participants were instructed not to change dietary habits or&#xD;
      perform additional non-resistance-training related physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, with the objective of increasing the adherence to the resistance-training&#xD;
      programme, a series of motivational strategies were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategies to motivation assessment used were based on the principles of the&#xD;
      Self-Determination Theory (SDT). SDT includes a meta-theory for framing motivational studies,&#xD;
      a formal theory that defines intrinsic and varied extrinsic sources of motivation, their role&#xD;
      in cognitive and social development, as well as in individual differences. SDT is a theory of&#xD;
      motivation and personality that addresses three universal, innate and basic psychological&#xD;
      needs: autonomy, competence and relatedness. During the resistance-training programme, the&#xD;
      subjects received verbal motivational strategies, based on previous studies which have proven&#xD;
      the beneficial effect they exert on BPN satisfaction and autonomous motivation.&#xD;
