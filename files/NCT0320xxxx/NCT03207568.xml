      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of Relay Pro and Relay&#xD;
      NBS Pro devices in humans having thoracic aortic pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical results will be used to apply for the CE certification.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single arm clinical study in patients&#xD;
      presenting thoracic aortic pathologies. Patients with thoracic aortic pathologies who are&#xD;
      planned to undergo thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with a stent-graft based on&#xD;
      routine clinical assessments performed as part of the patients' standard care will be&#xD;
      screened after obtaining the informed consent from the patients, and if eligible, enrolled&#xD;
      and scheduled for the implantation procedure with the study device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a baseline assessment, the implantation procedure will be performed according to&#xD;
      the Instructions for Use and local routine practice. A follow-up visit will be performed 30&#xD;
      days after the implantation procedure. The investigator will perform assessments of the&#xD;
      implantation procedure and device system and document adverse events and device deficiencies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient diagnosed with thoracic aorta pathology (aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, dissection,&#xD;
             penetrating ulcer or intramural hematoma) suitable for TEVAR with a Relay Pro or Relay&#xD;
             NBS Pro stent-graft; diagnosis must be confirmed by contrast computed tomography&#xD;
             angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months of the planned&#xD;
             implant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proximal and distal aortic necks suitable for stent-graft placement (i.e., diameter&#xD;
             ranging between 18 and 42 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proximal and distal landing zones suitable for the stent-graft&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate vascular access for insertion of the delivery system, i.e., femoral or iliac&#xD;
             arteries a minimum 6 mm in diameter to accommodate the 19 to 22-Fr outer-diameter&#xD;
             delivery system and no excessive disease precluding delivery system entry/passage or&#xD;

             (IUDs), and sexual abstinence.&#xD;
