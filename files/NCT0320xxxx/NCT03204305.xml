      All participants will be healthy volunteers and all procedures will be completed for research&#xD;
      purposes only. Two groups will be recruited, females who use cannabis (marijuana, MJ), and&#xD;
      female who do not use cannabis (controls). Female MJ users will be enrolled in a protocol&#xD;
      that includes an outpatient drug administration session and a 4-day/3-night inpatient stay on&#xD;
      the Johns Hopkins Bayview Clinical Research Unit (CRU). During outpatient visits, MJ users&#xD;
      will have an MRI, and complete MJ self-administration and cognitive performance sessions. MJ&#xD;
      users will then reside on the CRU,and complete MJ abstinence, and self-report instruments for&#xD;
      withdrawal discomfort. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan of brain cannabinoid type 1&#xD;
      receptors will also be completed. Non-users will complete MRI, PET imaging and cognitive&#xD;
      testing under an outpatient protocol (no MJ administration).&#xD;

      The primary goals of this project are to examine whether use of cannabis alters brain&#xD;
      cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) availability in females, and if severity of cannabis&#xD;
      withdrawal is correlated with CB1 receptor availability. CB1R are widely distributed in the&#xD;
      human brain and can be quantified using PET imaging with the radiotracer 11C-OMAR&#xD;
      (Carbon-11-OMAR). The effects MJ use on brain CB1R have not been studied in females. The&#xD;
      current study will enroll 10 female MJ users in an inpatient protocol that includes&#xD;
      administration of smoked MJ, followed by monitored abstinence with daily behavioral&#xD;
      assessments, and PET imaging with 11C-OMAR. PET data will collected in 10 matched controls&#xD;
      for comparison. The proposed study is an important first step to determine whether localized&#xD;
      CB1R changes in female MJ users help explain, and provide a neurobiological target for&#xD;
      intervention. Results will increase knowledge of cannabinoid mechanisms of cannabis use and&#xD;
      severity of dependence in females, an understudied population.&#xD;

    <description>Marijuana withdrawal discomfort will be self-reported using the marijuana withdrawal checklist, available via PhenXToolkit.org. Items are: depressed mood, irritability, nervousness/anxiety, restlessness, increased aggression, increased anger, violent outbursts, nausea, decreased appetite, stomach pain, shakiness, sweating, sleep difficulty, strange/wild dreams, craving to smoke cannabis, diarrhea/loose stools, dizziness, muscle spasms/aches, hiccups, stuffy nose, feverish feeling, hot flashes, chills, increased appetite, headaches, fatigue/tiredness, yawning, difficulty concentrating, and general physical discomfort. Participants can describe symptoms not listed on the questionnaire (Other). Each item is rated as 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, or 3=severe. A sum score is calculated from items that are valid, reliable cannabis withdrawal symptoms (Budney et al, 2003, Journal of Abnormal Psychology,112(3): 393-402).</description>
