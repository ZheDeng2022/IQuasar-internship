    <textblock>
      Acceptability study to evaluate the gastrointestinal tolerance, palatability and participant&#xD;
      compliance, over a 7-day period, of Krio for the dietary management of participants with&#xD;
      intractable epilepsy or Glut-1 deficiency syndrome patients on a ketogenic diet.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, acceptability study in fifteen (15) participants aged three (3) years&#xD;
      and over, who are established on a ketogenic diet (KD), of Krio to aid in the management of&#xD;
      their diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a 7-day supply of Krio and will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      daily diary and short questionnaire to record information allowing assessment the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal tolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palatability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Krio is a Food for Special Medical Purposes (FSMP) and is intended for use in the KD. It has&#xD;
      a fat to protein and carbohydrate ratio of 3 to 1. This makes it appropriate for inclusion in&#xD;
      all versions of the KD: classical, medium chain triglyceride (MCT), modified Atkins diet&#xD;
      (MAD) and low glycaemic index (LGI). It is suitable from 3 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Krio is presented as a ready to eat solid bar (28g), with no additional preparation required.&#xD;
      It contains fat (20g per bar), protein and carbohydrate with added sweetener and flavourings.&#xD;
      It does not contain any added micronutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended intake of the product for each participant will be determined by a dietitian.&#xD;
      The quantity to be consumed daily will be recommended on an individual patient basis, but&#xD;
      will be a minimum of 1 bar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product acceptability data from 15 participants are required in order to submit an&#xD;
      application to the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS) for product&#xD;
      registration.&#xD;
