    <textblock>
      Continued uncertainty exists over benefits of early intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering in&#xD;
      acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), related to the non-significant primary outcomes,&#xD;
      patient selection, and discordant results of INTERACT2 and ATACH-II. We designed INTERACT3 to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of a goal-directed care bundle of active management (intensive BP&#xD;
      lowering, glycemic control, treatment of pyrexia and reversal of anticoagulation) vs. usual&#xD;
      care in ICH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERACT3 is a large-scale pragmatic clinical trial to provide reliable evidence over the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a widely applicable goal-directed care bundle in acute ICH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of a goal-directed care bundle of active&#xD;
      management involving early physiological control (intensive blood pressure [BP] lowering,&#xD;
      glycemic control, early treatment of pyrexia, and rapid reversal of anticoagulation), versus&#xD;
      usual standard of care, on functional outcome (defined by a shift in scores on the modified&#xD;
      Rankin scale [mRS] in patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: An international, multicentre, stepped wedge, cluster randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      design involves implementation of a guideline-recommended intervention package applied to&#xD;
      patients with ICH as part of routine care. Patients are only excluded if they refuse to have&#xD;
      details of their management included and/or participate in the follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site inclusion criteria: Organized systems of acute stroke care; no established&#xD;
      comprehensive protocols for the management of patients with ICH; suitable location,&#xD;
      infrastructure and willingness to participate in clinical research; large volume of ICH&#xD;
      patients (approx. 100 per year). The hospitals will have training, prior to their activation&#xD;
      and commencement of the intervention. Data collection at baseline,Day 1, discharge/ Day 7,&#xD;
      and 6-month (end of follow-up), will be captured through a web database. Randomized&#xD;
      allocation of intervention will be assigned by a statistician not otherwise involved in the&#xD;
      study according to a statistical program stratified by the country of the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation: Mixed methods were used to explore how the care bundle, a complex&#xD;
      intervention, is implemented, as well as to understand clinicians' perspectives, a&#xD;
      prospective process evaluation will be conducted alongside the trial implementation.&#xD;
      Intervention fidelity, reach, dose, adaption, feasibility and appropriateness of the&#xD;
      goal-directed care bundle will be evaluated within the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic Evaluation: A multi-country within-trial economic evaluation will be conducted, from&#xD;
      each healthcare system's perspective. Healthcare utilisation costs incurred within the&#xD;
      initial hospital visit will be estimated using administratively collected hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations: We anticipate recruiting a minimum of 110 sites in a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge design consisting of 3 groups and 4 phases. Each group would therefore include&#xD;
      approximately 36-37 sites. We assume an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.044&#xD;
      between sites which is similar to that found in the INTERACT2 and recently completed Head&#xD;
      Position in Acute Stroke Trial (HeadPoST) trials across Chinese sites. To demonstrate a&#xD;
      treatment effect with 90% power and a 2-sided type-I error rate of 5%, each site would need&#xD;
      to recruit an average of 18 patients per phase for a total sample size of 7,920 patients.&#xD;
      Assuming that 5% of patients will have a missing outcome, each site would need to target an&#xD;
      average of 19 patients per phase per site for a total sample size of 8,360 patients. To allow&#xD;
      for variability in the number of patients recruited at each site, with very large hospitals&#xD;
      expected to recruit up to 50 patients per phase and smaller hospitals recruiting as little as&#xD;
      1 patient per phase in order to allow a broad range of hospitals with variable experience and&#xD;
      systems of care for the management of ICH. The sample size would need to be inflated by a&#xD;
      factor of approximately 1.3; thus leading to a sample size of up to 25 patients per site per&#xD;
      phase (11,000 patients in total). Assuming the worst case scenario for the effect of cluster&#xD;
      size variability on power, this sample size would still provide at least 80% power. This&#xD;
      sample size provides 90% power to determine a treatment effect of a 5.6% absolute improvement&#xD;
      in the proportion of patients experiencing a bad outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] scores&#xD;
      of 3-6), from 55.6% down to 50%. This also translates to a 10% relative risk reduction&#xD;
      (relative risk of 0.90). All analyses will be undertaken at the patient level on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis at each center using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) or&#xD;
      random-effects regression to account for clustering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics consideration: A mixed consent process is proposed, according to local/national rules&#xD;
      and regulations, for the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster Guardian consent or appropriate approval (e.g. signed by General Manager or Chief&#xD;
      Executive of hospital, or Head of Neurology/Stroke Department) for the goal-directed care&#xD;
      bundle to be the new usual management for patients with ICH;&#xD;
&#xD;
      With one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i). Individual standard consent for the collection of data through in-person assessment and&#xD;
      data extraction from medical records during the hospital stay and follow-up, and for release&#xD;
      of personalized information for research purposes to allow centralized follow-up at 6-month&#xD;
      after admission, or (ii). Opt-out/withdraw consent for collection of data through in-person&#xD;
      assessment and data extraction from medical records during the hospital stay and follow-up,&#xD;
      and for release of personalized information for research purposes to allow centralized&#xD;
      follow-up at 90 days after admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: The internet based data management system is managed at the George Institute&#xD;
      for Global Health, which has extensive experience in clinical trial data capture and&#xD;
      security. The George Institute has in place system security SOP with VeriSign SSL digital&#xD;
      certification and encrypted HTTPS connection. Only staff listed in the delegation log will be&#xD;
      given unique individual password to access the internet-based data management system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Paper CRFs will be provided for sites preferring to use these for the&#xD;
      initial collection of data. These forms will be used as source document and will need to be&#xD;
      signed and dated by the investigator completing the form. All computerized forms will be&#xD;
      electronically signed (by use of the unique password) by the authorized study staff and all&#xD;
      changes made following the initial entry will have an electronic dated audit trail. It is the&#xD;
      requirement that the collection of data and transfer of information for the 90 day follow-up&#xD;
      assessment has to be approved by the local IRB for each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collarboration: Central international coordination is from GI, China and together with&#xD;
      regional coordinating centers established and located in Sydney, and Santiago, Chile, the&#xD;
      study will be overseen by an International Steering Committee comprised of world experts in&#xD;
      the fields of stroke, neurocritical care, neurology, geriatrics, cardiovascular epidemiology&#xD;
      and clinical trials. The investigators of the 110 participating hospitals will be&#xD;
      administratively tied through a structure designed to enhance effective communication,&#xD;
      collaboration and study monitoring by maintaining operations through adherence to a common&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety &amp; Monitoring Board (DSMB): The DSMB will review the safety, ethics and outcomes&#xD;
      of the study.The DSMB will be governed by a charter that will outline their responsibilities,&#xD;
      procedures and confidentiality.&#xD;
