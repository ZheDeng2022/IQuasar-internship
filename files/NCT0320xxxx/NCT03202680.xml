  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to compare the effects of a healthy, lean beef diet and an&#xD;
      average American, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) style diet, that is low in&#xD;
      saturated fatty acids (SFA), on insulin sensitivity in men and women with risk factors for&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, crossover study that includes two screening visits, one&#xD;
      baseline visit, two 28-d test periods and an end-of-washout visit. A 2-week washout period&#xD;
      will separate the two treatments. Subjects will be screened to identify metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and/or prediabetes at the screening visits. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      test sequence (USDA/lean beef or lean beef/USDA diets) and the appropriate calorie menu&#xD;
      within each test diet, which will be determined based on each subject's calculated energy&#xD;
      needs for weight maintenance. Study foods will be dispensed, and subjects will be instructed&#xD;
      to consume all of the foods in their entirety for the duration of each 28-d test period, and&#xD;
      avoid consuming any additional food or drink items that has not been provided to them.&#xD;
      Compliance will be assessed through a Food Deviation Log where subjects will record any&#xD;
      non-study food/beverages consumed, and any portions of the study foods not consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) will be completed at baseline and the end of&#xD;
      each treatment period, and fasting glucose and insulin will also be measured at screening and&#xD;
      at the first test visit in each treatment period. Fasting blood samples will be collected for&#xD;
      lipid profile and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measurements at all treatment&#xD;
      visits. Additionally, fasting blood will be drawn for measurement of apolipoprotein B and A1&#xD;
      and lipoprotein particles and subfractions at baseline and the end of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of vital signs, body weight, evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      medication/supplement use, and adverse effects will be performed throughout the study.&#xD;
