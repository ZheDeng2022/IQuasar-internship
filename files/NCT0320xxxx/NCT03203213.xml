  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poisoning by psychoactive substances is increasingly common in Europe and can be responsible&#xD;
      for deaths. These substances, also called &quot;festive drugs&quot;, circulate among other places in&#xD;
      festive gatherings (night clubs, concerts, free music, feria, etc.). The main objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the molecules that circulate in festive events in Aquitaine, in&#xD;
      order to implement prevention actions by looking at whether the circulating substances vary&#xD;
      with the style of event.&#xD;

      Poisoning by psychoactive substances is increasingly common in Europe and can be responsible&#xD;
      for deaths. These substances, also called &quot;festive drugs&quot;, circulate among other places in&#xD;
      festive gatherings (night clubs, concerts, free music, feria, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also a significant increase in the number of new psychoactive substances (NSPs)&#xD;
      whose toxicity is unknown: by 2014, 101 new substances were detected for the first time in&#xD;
      Europe. These molecules, because of this regular and rapid emergence, are not included in the&#xD;
      narcotics list, in the great majority of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poison control centers, as well as addictovigilance centers, are regularly called upon for&#xD;
      serious poisoning resulting in hospitalization, for which analytical evidence is most often&#xD;
      missing or difficult to obtain. The lack of documentation, both analytical and clinical, of&#xD;
      these files limits its expertise. As a result, medical knowledge, in particular clinical&#xD;
      knowledge, progresses little which limits the efficiency of the management of these&#xD;
      poisonings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2015 pilot study on the Dax and Mont-de-Marsan (FERIATOX) fertilization sites on 27&#xD;
      patients showed that although several psychoactive substances have been identified in these&#xD;
      patients (cocaine, ketamine, MDMA, cannabis, etc.) No DK was identified in this study. It is&#xD;
      possible, however, that the profile of people who frequent ferias is different from that of&#xD;
      music festivals, which explains the lack of identification of these substances in the&#xD;
      FERIATOX study. To support this hypothesis, it seems important to renew this study on festive&#xD;
      events of the type of music festival. The Garorock Festival (Marmande), held at the beginning&#xD;
      of July, seems to be relevant for the study.&#xD;

Oriented hair removal is also carried out if possible (small wick cut and not torn the size of a pencil mine of paper taken at the level of the occipital region). This technique has been used many times, and evaluates the previous consumption (memory consumption)&#xD;
A urine sample is taken if possible.</description>
