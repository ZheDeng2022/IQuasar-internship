  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve detection of esophageal (pre)malignant lesions during surveillance endoscopy of&#xD;
      patients at risk of developing malignancies, for example in Barrett's Esophagus (BE), there&#xD;
      is a need for better endoscopic visualization and the ability for targeted biopsies. Optical&#xD;
      molecular imaging of neoplasia associated biomarkers could form a promising technique to&#xD;
      accommodate this need. It is known that the biomarker c-Met is overexpressed in dysplastic&#xD;
      and neoplastic areas in BE segments versus normal tissue and has proven to be a valid target&#xD;
      for molecular imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Edinburgh Molecular Imaging Ltd (EMI) has developed a fluorescent tracer specifically&#xD;
      targeting c-Met by labeling a small peptide to a fluorescent fluorophore: 'EMI-137'. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that when EMI-137 is administered intravenously, it accumulates in&#xD;
      c-Met expressing high grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), enabling&#xD;
      (early) cancer visualization using a newly developed fluorescent fiber-bundle. This&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested in the current pilot intervention study.&#xD;
