      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the&#xD;
      candidate malaria vaccines ChAdOx1 LS2 and MVA LS2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated in Oxford.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose-escalation, first in human, partially blinded, phase I/IIa&#xD;
      controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study. The study will assess the safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the novel malaria vaccine candidates ChAdOx1 LS2&#xD;
      and MVA LS2 in healthy UK adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, malaria naive adults, aged between 18 and 45 years, will be recruited and vaccinated&#xD;
      in Oxford.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of between 23 and 31 volunteers will be recruited across four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 volunteers will receive a low dose ChAdOx1 LS2 vaccination on day 0. Group 2&#xD;
      volunteers will receive a high dose ChAdOx1 LS2 vaccination on day 0 and a dose of MVA LS2 on&#xD;
      day 56, followed by a CHMI on day 77. Volunteers exhibiting sterile protection will undergo a&#xD;
      repeat CHMI 5-7 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group A will not receive any vaccinations and will undergo CHMI on day 77.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group B will not receive any vaccinations and will undergo CHMI during the repeat&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
