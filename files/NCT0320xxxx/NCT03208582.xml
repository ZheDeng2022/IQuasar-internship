  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteogenesis Imperfecta(OI) is an inherited disorder characterised by extreme fragility of&#xD;
      the bones. Bones often break from little or no apparent cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current available medicine can increase bone strength by making bones wider and &quot;filling in&quot;&#xD;
      the holes in the bone walls that weaken it. These medicines are bisphosphonates, given either&#xD;
      by a drip intravenously (eg pamidronate), or taken by mouth (eg risedronate). Their major&#xD;
      action is to prevent bone breakdown by stopping the normal process of removing and then&#xD;
      replacing old bone tissue, so in some parts of the bone, new bone formation is actually&#xD;
      reduced. Most studies of bisphosphonates in children with OI have shown increased bone&#xD;
      mineral density and improved exercise tolerance that could positively affect new bone&#xD;
      formation; some have shown reduced fracture rate. Bone is highly responsive to mechanical&#xD;
      stimulation. Whole body vibration (WBV) is a form of mechanical stimulation that has been&#xD;
      shown to improve bone mineral density in some individuals with narrow bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known whether bisphosphonates affect the response of the skeleton to mechanical&#xD;
      stimulation. We will determine the response to mechanical stimulation in children with OI by&#xD;
      looking at bone turnover markers following WBV in those who are and are not treated with&#xD;
      bisphosphonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this study will help us to understand whether skeleton in children with OI&#xD;
      is normally responsive to mechanical stimulation, and whether bisphosphonates alter that&#xD;
      responsiveness in a way that is either beneficial or not for increasing bone strength.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Essentially, subjects will have a baseline assessment (WBV1) of their bone turnover marker&#xD;
      response to a week-long period of whole body vibration (10 minutes/day), followed by a&#xD;
      &quot;washout period&quot; of 5 weeks during which bone turnover is expected to return to normal.&#xD;
      Following this, there will be a period of 6 weeks of treatment with risedronate (1&#xD;
      mg/kg/week). Immediately following this will come a second assessment (WBV2) of the bone&#xD;
      turnover marker response to a week-long period of whole body vibration (10 minutes/day) as&#xD;
      previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects stand on the vibration platform for 10 minutes for 7 days on 2 occasions. The&#xD;
      vibration is delivered as 4 &quot;blocks&quot; of 2.5 minutes each, with 30 seconds rest in between&#xD;
      each block. The initial Whole Body Vibration (WBV) on day 1 will be undertaken in the&#xD;
      Sheffield Children's Hospital Clinical Research Facility (SCHCRF) under supervision.&#xD;
      Subsequent WBVs D2-D7 and D85-91 will be done in the participants' homes. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to record the administration and timing of WBV in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken after an overnight fast according to the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-WBV1 D1; D8 (postWBV); D15; D43 (immediate pre-risedronate); D85 (post-risedronate and&#xD;
      pre-WBV2); D92 (post-WBV2) and D99 (final). 7 samples are taken altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood tests are bone turnover markers (Alkaline phosphatase[ALP], Procollagen Type 1&#xD;
      N-Terminal Propeptide[P1NP] and C-Terminal Telopeptide of Type 1 Collagen[CTX]). The first&#xD;
      blood test will be done by the researcher (Dr Sithambaram) in the SCHCRF and the subsequent 6&#xD;
      blood tests can be done by the research nurse/researcher at the participant's home. Blood&#xD;
      samples taken will be allowed to clot for ½ an hour. Samples will be spun at 2500 rpm for 10&#xD;
      minutes at 4°C. The centrifuged sample will be stored in SCHCRF at -80°C. Blood tests will be&#xD;
      analysed in the Mellanby Centre for Bone Research, University of Sheffield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be taking risedronate (oral bisphosphonate, once weekly), rounded to the&#xD;
      nearest 5 mg) together with Vitamin D and calcium for 6 weeks. Vitamin D and Calcium will be&#xD;
      given as Calcichew 500mg/200 IU tablets, 1 tablet for participants weighing less than 30 kg&#xD;
      and 2 tablets for participants weighing 30 kg or more. Risedronate Sodium belongs to&#xD;
      Bisphosphonates group of medicine. As per BNF, it is not licensed for use in children. The&#xD;
      trade name is Actonel® Warner Chilcott). This study will use 5mg and 35mg film-coated&#xD;
      tablets.&#xD;
