  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the INITIATE trial is to compare the clinical outcome of individualized&#xD;
      lot selection to random lot selection utilizing one plasma-derived von Willebrand factor&#xD;
      (VWF)/coagulation factor (FVIII) complex concentrate for immune tolerance induction (ITI) in&#xD;
      subjects with congenital Hemophilia A, FVIII activity ≤2%, and a historical high-titer&#xD;
      inhibitor [≥5 Bethesda Unit (BU)].&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized on a one-to-one basis between one of two study arms,&#xD;
      individualized lot selection (alternative treatment arm) and random lot selection (standard&#xD;
      treatment arm, current US clinical practice in ITI). Study sites, participants, and&#xD;
      investigators will be blinded to the treatment status assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative treatment arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the participants will be randomized to blinded individualized lot selection for ITI.&#xD;
      The target initial dose of FVIII for ITI is ~200 IU/kg/day intravenously. The suggested&#xD;
      maximum dose is 20,000 IU/day. Investigators may adjust the dose to a minimum dose of 150&#xD;
      units/kg if infusion volume is not feasible in patients without central venous access or in&#xD;
      patients with von Willebrand factor levels &gt;250%. Splitting dose into two infusions per day&#xD;
      must be approved by the Steering Committee, and if approved, will be considered a protocol&#xD;
      deviation. Wilate® will be the VWF/FVIII complex concentrate (Octapharma USA, Inc., U.S.&#xD;
      License No. 1646) prescribed for ITI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individualized lot selection will be performed according to a modified Oxford method in a&#xD;
      central laboratory, by testing subject's plasma against 4-6 lots of Wilate® and selecting the&#xD;
      one with the highest residual FVIII (lowest Oxford titer) activity remaining after&#xD;
      incubation. The same lot will be used throughout the entire ITI course for each subject. If&#xD;
      the selected lot is depleted prior to the completion of ITI, a second individualized lot&#xD;
      selection will be performed using the original plasma sample provided at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Wilate® batch includes 1.6-1.8 million IU and is expected to last for about 3-57 months&#xD;
      depending on the weight of the subject and prescribed dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other half of the participants will receive random lot selection for ITI. The dose and&#xD;
      concentrate used will be the same. Concentrate will be randomly selected from available&#xD;
      Wilate® lots. The same lot will be used throughout the entire ITI course for each subject. If&#xD;
      the random lot is depleted prior to the completion of ITI, a second lot will be randomly&#xD;
      selected. In both cases the random lot will be tested against subject's plasma to measure the&#xD;
      residual FVIII activity left after incubation but this result will not affect lot selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that the time to negative inhibitor (&lt;0.6 BU) will be shorter with&#xD;
      individualized lot selection compared to random lot selection and that this will impact&#xD;
      monthly break-through bleeding and reduce costs.&#xD;

Incremental in vivo FVIII recovery in the normal range [≥66% of normal (1.5% per IU/kg), equal to 0.99%per IU/kg] with samples taken prior to and 15 or 30 minutes after concentrate treatment. The recovery assessment should be done without any wash-out period.&#xD;
Half-life of FVIII &gt;6 hours. The half-life assessment should be done in a non-bleeding status without any wash-out period.&#xD;

All three criteria above met.&#xD;
Partial Success (PS) of ITI:&#xD;
The first two of the three criteria above met.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR) of ITI:&#xD;

Complete Failure (CF) of ITI:&#xD;

Incremental in vivo FVIII recovery in the normal range [≥66% of normal (1.5% per IU/kg), equal to 0.99%per IU/kg] with samples taken prior to and 15 or 30 minutes after concentrate treatment. The recovery assessment should be done without any wash-out period.&#xD;
Half-life of FVIII &gt;6 hours. The half-life assessment should be done in a non-bleeding status without any wash-out period.&#xD;
Complete Success (CS) of ITI:&#xD;
All three criteria above met.&#xD;
Partial Success (PS) of ITI:&#xD;
The first two of the three criteria above met.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR) of ITI:&#xD;
One of the three criteria above met.&#xD;
Partial Failure (PF) of ITI:&#xD;
Inhibitor still present, but titer is decreased to &lt;5 BU in contrast to ≥5 BU before start.&#xD;
Complete Failure (CF) of ITI:&#xD;
