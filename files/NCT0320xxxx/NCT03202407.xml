    <textblock>
      &quot;Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder &quot; is a systemic disorder of mineral and&#xD;
      bone metabolism, due to chronic kidney disease that is manifested by either one or a&#xD;
      combination of the following :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Abnormalities of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone or vitamin D metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vascular and/or soft tissue calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abnormalities in bone turnover, metabolism, volume, linear growth or strength. According&#xD;
           to glomerular filtration rate , Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomesclassify chronic&#xD;
           kidney disease into 5 stages,stage 5 also known as End Stage Renal disease is defined as&#xD;
           glomerular filtration rate less than 15 ml/Min/1.73 m2, or the need for renal&#xD;
           replacement therapy for survival The kidney plays a major role in phosphate&#xD;
           homoeostasis. The kidneys excrete the total net amount of absorbed phosphate.Under&#xD;
           normal physiological condition phosphate is freely filtered through the glomerulus. The&#xD;
           majority (85-90%) of filtered phosphate undergoes tubular reabsorption primarily in&#xD;
           proximal tubules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive renal insufficiency leads to hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperphosphatemia known as hidden killer in chronic kidney disease defined as an abnormally&#xD;
      high serum phosphate concentration of &gt;1.46 mmol/L (4.5 mg/dL). Its long term complications&#xD;
      are renal osteodystrophy, hyperparathyroidism, and increased cardiovascular calcification&#xD;
      leading to increased mortality and morbidity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      High serum phosphate can interact with calcium to precipitate calcium phosphate salts in&#xD;
      non-skeletal tissues Calcification generally occurs in the blood vessels, heart valves,&#xD;
      myocardium, and other soft tissues .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular calcification is probably the main reason for the high prevalence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases in chronic kidney disease patients Studies have shown that&#xD;
      hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased vascular stiffening and arterial and valvular&#xD;
      calcification This is postulated to be caused by elevated serum phosphorus promoting the&#xD;
      transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into an osteoblast phenotype that can&#xD;
      mineralize These vascular calcification also lead to left ventricular hypertrophy by&#xD;
      decreasing vascular compliance . Poor control of mineral metabolism also has been associated&#xD;
      with functional and structural cardiac abnormalities Efforts to reduce morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality associated with Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder are therefore&#xD;
      primarily directed at controlling hyperphosphatemia via diet, phosphorus binders, and&#xD;
      dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dialysis alone is inadequate in assisting hemodialysis patients to obtain and maintain normal&#xD;
      serum phosphate levels . So, other methods of achieving prescribed levels of serum phosphate&#xD;
      in hemodialysis patients include the use of phosphate binders and phosphorus dietary&#xD;
      restrictions.:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphate binders have been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for patients&#xD;
      treated with maintenance dialysis, and calcium-containing salts are used worldwide not only&#xD;
      for the control of hyperphosphatemia but also as a source of supplemental calcium. Several&#xD;
      calcium salts are commercially available, including calcium carbonate, calcium acetate, and&#xD;
      calcium citrate Sevelamer hydrochloride is a recently developed phosphate binder, which is a&#xD;
      quaternary amine anion exchanger without calcium or aluminum. Sevelamer is effective in&#xD;
      controlling hyperphosphatemia without increasing the calcium load in chronic hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients In addition to its effects on serum phosphorous levels, sevelamer has been shown to&#xD;
      decrease total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and to increase&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein levels . These effects may offer additional benefits in reducing&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications in patients with end-stage renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlling abnormal laboratory parameters such as calcium ,phosphate and parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      as well as preventing the progression of extraskeletal calcification is considered a major&#xD;
      component for prevention of the bone disease and other related morbidities and hopefully&#xD;
      mortality in chronic kidney disease patients&#xD;
