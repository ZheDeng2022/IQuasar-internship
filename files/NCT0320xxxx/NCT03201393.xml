          1. The patient is a male or female 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A clinical diagnosis of nonmalignant, chronic low back pain (CLBP). LBP, as defined by&#xD;
             Quebec Task Force in class 1 - pain without radiation and class 2 - pain with proximal&#xD;
             radiation above the knee. CLBP is defined as being present for at least several hours&#xD;
             a day, at least half the days in the previous 6 months, and being the principal pain&#xD;
             condition. (In accordance with the NIH 2013 Task Force on Research Standards for&#xD;
             Chronic Low Back Pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The 24-hour average pain intensity (API) mean score for the baseline period is ≥ 4 and&#xD;
             ≤ 8, [measured on the 11-point (0-10) numeric rating scale (NRS)] with each individual&#xD;
             score ≥ 3. In addition, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score during the&#xD;
             Randomization Visit is ≥ 30% and ≤ 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patient agrees to refrain from taking opiate medications from Visit 1 to 7 days&#xD;
        after the last dose of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The patient agrees to limit their rescue pain medications to acetaminophen 2000 mg per&#xD;
        day for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The patient is willing and able to discontinue use of non-pharmacological pain&#xD;
        management modalities (e.g. TENS, physical therapy, chiropractic manipulations,&#xD;
        biofeedback, and acupuncture) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The patient has been taking a stable dose of a medication with pain prevention potential&#xD;
        for at least 6 weeks prior to the screening visit and agrees to not start, stop, or change&#xD;
        the dose of any medication with pain prevention potential during the study period. (E.g.,&#xD;
        tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
        (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), herbal preparations (e.g.&#xD;

        6. The patient has a history or diagnosis of moderate-to-severe hepatic or renal impairment&#xD;
        (&gt;2 × the upper limit of normal [ULN] for alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase.&#xD;
        ≥1.5 × ULN for Alkaline Phosphatase, bilirubin, BUN, or Creatinine). (Patients with&#xD;
        elevated bilirubin level due to Gilbert's syndrome are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The patient has a history of the previous 5 years of abuse of any drug, prescription,&#xD;
