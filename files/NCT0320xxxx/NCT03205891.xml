  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of TAK228 that&#xD;
      can be given in combination with brentuximab vedotin in patients with lymphoma. The safety of&#xD;
      this combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. TAK228 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is&#xD;
      currently being used for research purposes only. Brentuximab vedotin is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of different types of lymphoma. The study doctor can&#xD;
      explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of TAK228 based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of TAK228 will be&#xD;
      tested. About 3-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of TAK228 is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your dose of brentuximab vedotin will stay the same. However, if the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
      needed for your safety, it may be lowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive brentuximab vedotin by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take TAK228 by mouth either every day or on a 5 days on/2 days off schedule (a &quot;5/2&#xD;
      schedule,&quot; where you take the study drug every day for 5 days in a row and then do not take&#xD;
      any TAK228 for 2 days in a row). The study doctor will tell you how often to take the study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose of TAK228 should be taken at about the same time each day on an empty stomach with&#xD;
      8 ounces (about 1 cup) of water. You should fast for 2 hours before and 1 hour after each&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 16 cycles of study drugs. You will no longer be able to take the study&#xD;
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after about 2 years of follow-up (described&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time every week while receiving the study drugs, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will&#xD;
      be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 days before the start of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood&#xD;
           sugar levels. If you can become pregnant, part of this blood sample will be used for a&#xD;
           pregnancy test. You should fast for about 8-10 hours before this draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â°Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 3 and every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on), you will&#xD;
      have a CT or PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At-Home Glucose Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are required to monitor your glucose (sugar) levels at home during the first 2 months you&#xD;
      are taking the study drug. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may be asked to continue&#xD;
      monitoring your glucose (sugar) levels at home. The study staff will give you a glucose&#xD;
      monitor (called a glucometer) and teach you how and when to use it. You will bring the&#xD;
      glucometer with you to each study visit so the study staff can collect the results of the&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will tell you what an &quot;abnormal&quot; level is and when to contact the study&#xD;
      doctor/study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need to return the glucometer to the study staff at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 21 days after your last dose of study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood&#xD;
           sugar levels. If you can become pregnant, part of this sample will be used for a&#xD;
           pregnancy test. You should fast for about 8-10 hours before this draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a PET/CT or CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 months for up to 2 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your blood&#xD;
           sugar levels. You should fast for about 8-10 hours before this blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to receive a transplant as part of your standard care, you&#xD;
      may receive a transplant. You will sign a separate consent explaining that procedure and its&#xD;
      risks in more detail. If you have a stem cell transplant, you will stop having follow-up&#xD;
      visits as part of this study.&#xD;
