  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well carboplatin with or without atezolizumab&#xD;
      works in treating patients with stage IV triple negative breast cancer. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving carboplatin with atezolizumab may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage IV triple negative breast cancer&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) of carboplatin +&#xD;
      atezolizumab (using irRECIST) versus carboplatin alone (using RECIST) in patients with triple&#xD;
      negative metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine overall response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by clinical benefit rate, of carboplatin +&#xD;
           atezolizumab (using irRECIST) versus carboplatin (using RECIST) alone in patients with&#xD;
           triple negative metastatic breast cancer. Clinical benefit rate is defined as complete&#xD;
           response plus partial response plus stable disease for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the duration of response for patients achieving a partial or complete&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of carboplatin + atezolizumab versus carboplatin&#xD;
           alone in patients with triple negative metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform the following correlative studies from biopsies taken at baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte frequency and phenotype (TILs) at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. PD-L1 expression from the baseline pre-treatment tissue and at progression lesion,&#xD;
                performed by IHC (SP142 clone)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. HER2 (IHC, FISH) and ER/PR levels (IHC) from a metastatic site&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Perform RNA-seq to determine non-synonymous mutation burden in expressed genes and&#xD;
                gene expression to assign a triple negative subtype at baseline for correlations&#xD;
                with clinic outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Immune phenotyping (IHC) for markers of T cell subsets and activation (CD4, CD8,&#xD;
                FoxP3, CD25, Glut1) and exhaustion (PD1, CTLA4) and test feasibility of flow&#xD;
                cytometric analyses to include additional markers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of BRCA mutations on response to the study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of steroids on the efficacy of atezolizumab To assess the&#xD;
           prognostic effects of TILs on PFS and CBR in patients receiving atezolizumab&#xD;

          -  Receipt of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study drug&#xD;
