  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/IIb trial studies side effects and best dose of atezolizumab when&#xD;
      given together with guadecitabine and CDX-1401 vaccine and to see how well they work in&#xD;
      treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come&#xD;
      back. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. CDX-1401 vaccine may enhance the expression of the genes encoding tumor antigens&#xD;
      on the surface of tumor cells and enhance the activity of tumor-killing T cells against those&#xD;
      tumor cells. Vaccines made from monoclonal antibodies combined with tumor cells may help the&#xD;
      body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving atezolizumab,&#xD;
      guadecitabine, and CDX-1401 vaccine may work better than CDX-1401 alone in treating patients&#xD;
      with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of fixed doses of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) in combination with&#xD;
      guadecitabine (SGI-110). (Phase I) II. To evaluate toxicity of the combination as defined by&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      version 5.0. (Phase I) III. To study if SGI-110 improves the benefit of atezolizumab and then&#xD;
      if the further addition of the DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 (CDX-1401)/poly ICLC&#xD;
      adds further clinical benefit by analyzing progression free survival (PFS), using Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. (Phase IIb)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) II. To determine overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), objective response rate (complete and partial responses), clinical benefit rate&#xD;
      (response + stable disease), CA-125 reduction (percentage of patients with CA-125 reduction&#xD;
      by &gt;= 50%), and duration of response. (Phase IIb) III. To assess the impact of the&#xD;
      combination of atezolizumab, SGI-110, and CDX-1401 on anti-tumor immune responses. (Phase&#xD;
      IIb) IV. To assess the impact of SGI-110 on NY-ESO-1 expression in tumor tissue. (Phase IIb)&#xD;
      V. To assess toxicities associated with the combination cohorts (2 and 3), as there is little&#xD;
      human experience with these combinations. (Phase IIb)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY/TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effectiveness of SGI-110 on enhancing vaccine efficacy by assessing NY&#xD;
      ESO 1 specific cellular and humoral immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Peripheral blood NY ESO 1 specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Ib. Peripheral blood NY ESO 1&#xD;
      specific antibodies. Ic. Peripheral blood unrelated CTA specific antibodies (antigen&#xD;
      spreading). Id. Peripheral blood frequency of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. Ie. Examine&#xD;
      potential differential effect of NY-ESO-1 expression on PFS. II. To assess the impact on PDL1&#xD;
      expression in tumor tissue. III. Evaluation of therapeutic efficacy on immune cell phenotype.&#xD;
      IV. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and DNA methylome: in pre- and on-treatment&#xD;
      peripheral blood, serum (circulating DNA), and tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Pre-and on-treatment density and location of tumor infiltrating CD3+ and CD8+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate the pre- and post-treatment mutational and neo-antigen load and therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Pre- and post-treatment T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire to study the effect of TCR V&#xD;
      beta diversity due to combination of PDL1 blockade, epigenetic modification, and vaccination&#xD;
      on therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Gut microbiota at baseline and one on-treatment sample at C4D1 (cycle 4, day 1) or at&#xD;
      progression, whichever is earlier to evaluate the role of microbiota on the therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy of the proposed combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of guadecitabine followed by a phase IIb&#xD;
      study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and&#xD;
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive guadecitabine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients also receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 8 and 22.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT III: Patients receive guadecitabine and atezolizumab as in Cohort II. Patients also&#xD;
      receive CDX-1401 vaccine IV on day 15 and poly ICLC SC on days 15-16. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 2&#xD;
      months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
