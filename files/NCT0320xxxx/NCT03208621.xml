      Objective: To evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of FDG-PET/CT (PET) and diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopy (DLS) in addition to initial staging by CT and gastroscopy in patients with&#xD;
      advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The study hypothesizes that performing DLS and PET for advanced gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas results in a reduction in the number of futile gastrectomies performed and a&#xD;
      favorable cost-effectiveness. According to the literature, in 27% of patients a futile&#xD;
      gastrectomy can be prevented, and the annual cost-reduction is an estimated €916.438.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study design is a prospective observational study. Study population: The&#xD;
      study population consists of patients with a surgically resectable, advanced gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (cT3-4a,N0-3,M0), that are scheduled for treatment with curative intent after&#xD;
      initial staging with gastroscopy and CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care / comparison: Both PET and DLS were recently included in the new Dutch guidelines&#xD;
      for the treatment of gastric cancer, as staging modalities for advanced (T3-4) tumors after&#xD;
      initial staging. The costs of the study population will be compared to retrospective data of&#xD;
      patients who underwent curative surgery (gastrectomy) after initial staging with CT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome of this study will be the proportion of patients in&#xD;
      whom the PET or DLS lead to a change in treatment strategy. The accuracy of each modality&#xD;
      will be analyzed separately. Secondary outcome parameters will be diagnostic performance,&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, quality of life, cost-reduction and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Based on the expectation that 22% of patients will have a change in treatment&#xD;
      strategy, at least 239 patients will be needed for this study to demonstrate that the&#xD;
      diagnostic modalities in the new guideline are break-even. Approximately 543 patients will be&#xD;
      eligible for the study in 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis: A state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact&#xD;
      analysis will be performed on the additive value of PET and DLS by both prospective and&#xD;
      retrospective data collection&#xD;
