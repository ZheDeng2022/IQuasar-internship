      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the MTD and RP2D of the combination of pembrolizumab and ATRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the safety and toxicity of combined treatment with pembrolizumab and all-trans&#xD;
           retinoic acid (ATRA) [brand name VESANOID] in melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the anti-tumor activity in terms of a). The reduction in MDSC&#xD;
           (immunosuppressive myeloid -derived suppressor cells) frequency and suppressive function&#xD;
           (measured as a continuous variable)in peripheral blood of advanced melanoma patients&#xD;
           undergoing pembrolizumab and VESANOID combination therapy. b). progression free&#xD;
           survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective&#xD;

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has known sensitivity to retinoic acid derivatives.&#xD;
