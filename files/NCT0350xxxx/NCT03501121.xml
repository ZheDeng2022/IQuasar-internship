  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All UK patients who participated in the TARGIT-A Trial were initially treated for early&#xD;
      breast cancer between 2000-2012. A total of 3451 patients from 33 hospitals in 11 countries&#xD;
      participated in the trial and a comparison was made between traditional radiotherapy given&#xD;
      over several weeks (external beam radiotherapy, EBRT) with TARGeted Intraoperative&#xD;
      radioTherapy (TARGIT-IORT) as a single dose given during the operation to remove the breast&#xD;
      cancer. The trial was funded by the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme of the&#xD;
      Department of Health, UK and sponsored by University College London. The results from this&#xD;
      trial have been published in major medical journals and have already started changing the way&#xD;
      breast cancer in treated around the world; please see www.targit.org.uk for more details. We&#xD;
      would like to continue to collect data about the health status of all patients to enable us&#xD;
      to learn about longer term differences in the effects of these treatments on health. An&#xD;
      analysis of this information could improve treatment for patients with breast cancer. For&#xD;
      this, HTA have granted us further funding.&#xD;
