      During colonoscopy, the endoscopist will document prospectively all polyps detected and note&#xD;
      the size, location and morphology. Polyps of 4-20 mm will be removed only in accordance with&#xD;
      the method the cold snare. Afterwards, the remaining tissues could be observed with an&#xD;
      imaging technology called Optivista with an injection of 10-50 ml of saline solution (if&#xD;
      required) to improve visibility of the tissues. The endoscopist will continue to remove the&#xD;
      remaining polyp tissue (with a snare or forceps) until there are no more visible polyp&#xD;
      tissues. Biopsies from the polyp resection site will be sent to the laboratory for analysis&#xD;
      to confirm the complete resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global disease affecting more than 1 million people&#xD;
      worldwide and the majority of colon cancers develop from adenomas. The purpose of endoscopic&#xD;
      cancer prevention is the detection and removal of these precancerous adenomatous polyps.&#xD;
      However, polyps between 4-20 mm are incompletely eliminated in about 10% of cases, which is&#xD;
      one of the main risk factors for patients to develop post-colonoscopy cancers. The&#xD;
      polypectomy with cold snare showed promising results for complete adenoma resection rates for&#xD;
      polyps up to 9 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses is that polypectomy with cold snare could be a standard approach for polyps up&#xD;
      to 20 mm and could improve the rates of complete resection of the adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients to undergo colonoscopy will be considered for the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified from the colonoscopy appointment lists at the CHUM. During&#xD;
      colonoscopy, the endoscopist will document prospectively all polyps detected and note the&#xD;
      size, location and morphology. All polyps will be removed during the procedure and will be&#xD;
      sent to the laboratory as recommended in current clinical practice. Polyps of 4-20 mm will be&#xD;
      removed only in accordance with the method the cold snare. Afterwards, the remaining tissues&#xD;
      could be observed with an imaging technology called Optivista with an injection of 10-50 ml&#xD;
      of saline solution (ir required) to improve visibility of the tissues. Optivista is an&#xD;
      imaging technique based that uses a light filter for endoscopic optical diagnosis where light&#xD;
      of specific blue and green wavelengths is used to enhance the surface and vascular patterns&#xD;
      of the polyp surface mucosa. The intestinal mucosa will be carefully examined and the&#xD;
      endoscopist will continue to remove the remaining polyp tissue (with a snare or forceps)&#xD;
      until there are no more visible polyp tissues. Biopsies from the polyp resection site will be&#xD;
      sent to the laboratory for analysis to confirm the complete resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone follow-up will be done 14 days after the procedure to report possible side effects&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of incomplete resection of all adenomatous polyps resected in the cold snare will be&#xD;
      determinate after completion of this project. The confidence interval will first be&#xD;
      calculated using the exact confidence limits of Clopper-Pearson, considering all adenomatous&#xD;
      polyps. An additional analysis will also be performed with a model of estimation equations&#xD;
      (GEE) based on the binomial distribution to obtain standard errors taking into account the&#xD;
      correlation with the patient.&#xD;
