      1. Baseline Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will be assessed in accordance with the hospital standard of care for&#xD;
           patients treated with carotid artery stenting procedure, which in general includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Informed consent for data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical History&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medication record&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Carotid Duplex Ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neurological Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diffusion weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Procedural angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline assessments will be performed prior to the index procedure and documented in&#xD;
           the patient medical record. Baseline assessments considered standard of care completed&#xD;
           prior to obtaining informed consent do not need to be repeated unless the investigator&#xD;
           feels it is medically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neurological Assessment Baseline neurological assessment is recommended in this study&#xD;
           and will be conducted by a physician, nurse, or other allied health professional,&#xD;
           independent of the treating physician prior to the procedure. This assessment will&#xD;
           include the neurological signs, symptoms, and the NIH Stroke Scale. For some&#xD;
           pre-specified subgroups, imaging studies (Carotid Duplex Ultrasound and/or Diffusion&#xD;
           Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging: DW-MRI) will be performed prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Enrollment Point A patient is considered enrolled in the study if there is full&#xD;
           compliance with the study and RoadSaver IFU eligibility criteria, and only after&#xD;
           successful guidewire passage through the study target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Medications Patients enrolled in this study will be pre-medicated according to the&#xD;
           hospital routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Procedure The procedure will be performed according to the physician's standard of care.&#xD;
           During the procedure, patients should receive appropriate anticoagulation and other&#xD;
           therapy according to standard hospital practice. The use of any medication for the&#xD;
           treatment of vessel spasm, patient agitation or discomfort, hypotension, arrhythmias,&#xD;
           and hemodynamic changes during the procedure is at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard procedures should be followed based on the Instructions for Use for the&#xD;
           Roadsaver™ device of Terumo. If pre- and/or post-dilatation is performed, or any other&#xD;
           device (e.g. embolic protection devices, etc.) is used at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. Treatment Failures If a Roadsaver™ Carotid Stent is not implanted due to technical&#xD;
           reasons, another CE-marked Carotid Stent may be used to complete the procedure. Patients&#xD;
           who do not have a successful Roadsaver™ Carotid Stent implanted during the index&#xD;
           procedure will be considered as technical failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with technical failure will be followed only until discharge at which time they&#xD;
           will have completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients who receive a Roadsaver™ Carotid Stent upon enrollment in the ROADSAVER&#xD;
           study will be included in the analysis of clinical outcomes by the end of the study.&#xD;
           Patients with technical failures will be analyzed separately only for procedural success&#xD;
           and for in-hospital adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2. Device Deficiency and Device Malfunction A device deficiency is defined as an&#xD;
           inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, durability,&#xD;
           reliability, safety, or performance. This may include malfunctions, use error, or&#xD;
           inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A device malfunction is defined as failure of the medical device to perform in&#xD;
           accordance with its intended purpose when used in accordance with the instructions for&#xD;
           use or the Clinical Investigation Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In case of device deficiency or malfunction, the device deficiency form in the eCRF&#xD;
           should be completed and the investigator is asked to make every possible effort to&#xD;
           return the device to Terumo Europe accompanied if possible with the packaging containing&#xD;
           the device identification (lot number). Another Roadsaver™ Carotid Stent or another&#xD;
           stent as per operators' discretion will be used in order to complete the treatment of&#xD;
           the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post-procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-procedural evaluation should be done according to the routine hospital practice&#xD;
           prior to discharge, which in general includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post Angiography immediately after the index procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination before discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MAE defined as the cumulative incidence of any periprocedural death or stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse events including: any revascularization, major vascular and bleeding&#xD;
                complications, other&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neurological assessment when performed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) when performed&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information on the post-procedural evaluation and any interventional treatment that&#xD;
           occurred since the procedure should be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Follow-Up Evaluations Patients will be followed according to routine hospital practice&#xD;
           usually performed at 30-day and at 12-month assessment through hospital visit or through&#xD;
           telephone contact. Investigators and research coordinators will keep notes of all&#xD;
           telephone contacts with the patients in the patient hospital file as source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital Visit at 1 month (30 ± 7 days) and 12 months (365 ± 30 days) Patients' clinical&#xD;
      status should be reported if hospital visits are done at 30 days and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These follow-up assessments should be done according to the routine hospital practice, which&#xD;
      in general includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events including: any stroke, any Revascularization, major vascular and bleeding&#xD;
           complications, other&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carotid duplex ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All relevant information obtained during follow-up including imaging should be reported. Data&#xD;
      to be collected at follow-ups would include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Contact at 12 months (365 ±30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events including: any death (stroke related/other), any stroke, any&#xD;
           revascularization, major vascular and bleeding complications, other&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication In case of death, stroke, TLR, and TVR all efforts should be made to provide&#xD;
           sufficient baseline and event documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment at unscheduled visits should be performed according to safety reporting&#xD;
      requirements, which in general includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events including: any stroke, any revascularization, major vascular and bleeding&#xD;
           complications, other&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carotid duplex ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient who returns to the investigational site between pre-determined visits with an event&#xD;
      related to the index procedure should be treated according to the physician's standard of&#xD;
      care. Reportable events occurring during this period should be collected.&#xD;
