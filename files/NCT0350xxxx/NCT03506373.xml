    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of ibrutinib citrate when given with ixazomib,&#xD;
      and determines how well they work in treating patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia&#xD;
      that is newly diagnosed, has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Enzyme inhibitors, such as ibrutinib and ixazomib citrate, may stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy (as assessed by complete response [CR] rate) of the combination&#xD;
      of ixazomib citrate (ixazomib) and ibrutinib in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR=partial response [PR] or better) in WM patients&#xD;
      treated with ixazomib and ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the time to progression (TTP) in WM patients treated with ixazomib and&#xD;
      ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To further characterize the safety and toxicity of the combination of ibrutinib and&#xD;
      ixazomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the overall survival (OS) in WM patients treated with ixazomib and ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the role of members of the BTK signalosome in achievement or lack thereof of&#xD;
      response to ibrutinib and ixazomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore biologic effects of ibrutinib and ixazomib on microenvironment in WM and&#xD;
      correlate with response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15 and ibrutinib PO daily on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <description>Complete response rate to be defined as an objective status of CR at any time, where confirmation of the complete response status is required on two consecutive evaluations with a second immunofixation before calling the patient a CR. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. 95% confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate will be estimated by the total number of patients who achieve a CR, very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) divided by the total number of evaluable patients. All evaluable patients will be used for this analysis. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true overall response rate will be calculated.</description>

    <description>15 protein/genes associated with BTK-signaling will be assessed and their levels from baseline samples will be compared with levels from samples during treatment. Changes over time will be evaluated using paired sample approaches (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Baseline levels will be correlated with response (responder versus [vs.] non-responder) using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.</description>

    <measure>Biologic effects of ibrutinib and ixazomib citrate on microenvironment in WM</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples &amp; bone marrow aspirate to be taken from participants. The study will explore biologic effects of ibrutinib and ixazomib on microenvironment in WM and correlate with response to treatment. Immunophenotyping of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) using the Multi-Omyx TILs platform. This will identify 17 different types of TILs from BM samples collected at baseline and then after one cycle of treatment. This data is represented as % and actual cell counts. Next, identification of 4 types of T-cells from the blood. This will be done from peripheral blood samples collected at Baseline and then after one cycle of treatment with ixazomib + ibrutinib (Ixa+Ibr). Next, BTK receptor occupancy: This is a competitive-binding assay essentially and will be performed in CD19+/CD138+ WM cells collected at baseline and then after one cycle of treatment with Ixa+Ibr. Readout is % occupancy. Values to be correlated with response (responder vs. non-responder) using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.</description>
