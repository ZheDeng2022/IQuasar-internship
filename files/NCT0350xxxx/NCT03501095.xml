  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The delicate structures of the larynx can be compromised by innumerable causes, one of these&#xD;
      is represented by endotracheal intubation. More frequently, these damages are represented by&#xD;
      hematomas, edema and granulomas of the vocal cords. The pathophysiology of laryngeal damage&#xD;
      can be explained by an ischemic attack of the chordal mucosa. Numerous risk factors can cause&#xD;
      the onset of damage, some depending on the practice itself, such as size and type of&#xD;
      endotracheal tube, cuff pressure, use of mandrels and / or inserting devices, use of oral or&#xD;
      nasogastric tubes, use of neuromuscular inhibitors or sleep-inducing drugs and the duration&#xD;
      of the intervention; others from patient-related factors, such as gender, weight, history of&#xD;
      exposure of smoking habit, or a history of gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). The incidence of&#xD;
      such symptoms varies from 0% to 18% among the general population, with an average of 6% with&#xD;
      resolution of most of the symptoms within 72 hours unless substantial damage has occurred to&#xD;
      the vocal cords or to the arytenoids. In general, the incidence of such laryngeal&#xD;
      complications has been described by several studies, but there is no standardized protocol&#xD;
      for measuring and evaluating their entity. The purpose of this study is to determine how the&#xD;
      voice and the chordal clinical aspect vary after oro-tracheal intubation, evaluated through&#xD;
      voice analysis and laryngostroboscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acoustic analysis aims at studying the acoustic emission of the pneumo-phono-articulatory&#xD;
      system, i.e. the vocal signal. Currently, digital technology instruments enable the&#xD;
      processing and analysis of the verbal signal quickly and reliably, also offering graphical&#xD;
      products and numerical data. Among the various existing software products for the study of&#xD;
      the vocal signal, PRAAT is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, the vocal parameters are acquired in a non-invasive way with a microphone. At&#xD;
      the same time, these analysis systems can be integrated by other methods, such as&#xD;
      laryngostroboscopy. This method is one of the most widely used techniques for laryngeal&#xD;
      clinical evaluation. This is a non-invasive endoscopic practice performed by means of a&#xD;
      flexible fibroscope, which, through a pulsed light source, allows visualization of the&#xD;
      chordal movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, a study will be carried out on healthy volunteers, comparable for their demographic&#xD;
      characteristics to the second population to be included. In this way the investigators will&#xD;
      test the instrument used for the voice analysis, in order to set the reference values for the&#xD;
      general population. In a second step, the investigators will evaluate the incidence of&#xD;
      post-intubation laryngeal complications, considering as a pathological all values above 95%&#xD;
      percentile compared to healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first phase, healthy volunteers will undergo voice analysis in two different days.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the patients included in the study population will be undergo during the&#xD;
      preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative to a combined evaluation between&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists and ENTs for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data to be recorded, both for the healthy volunteers as well as for patients, will&#xD;
      include personal data, anamnestic, working exposure and specific risk factors such as&#xD;
      smoking, alcohol, irritants, a previous diagnosis of GERD, frequent inflammation of upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract (VADS); moreover, only for patients, the pre-, intra and post-surgery&#xD;
      anesthesia evaluation parameters will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pre-surgery visit, patients will receive an otorhinolaryngeal evaluation by&#xD;
      laryngostroboscopy and the vocal analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any lesions due to endotracheal intubation will be standardized according to Mendels et al.'s&#xD;
      modified classification, in grade I (lesion of the vocal cords in terms of vibratory changes,&#xD;
      which can be observed in the epithelium, lamina propria or arytenoid cartilages ) and grade&#xD;
      II (vocal cords movement disorders in terms of paralysis, arytenoid dislocation or incomplete&#xD;
      glottal closure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vocal analysis will consist, instead, in asking the patient to voice through a microphone&#xD;
      (Sennheiser E 835 S) placed at about 15 cm from the mouth, a certain vowel (ie &quot;a&quot;) and&#xD;
      recording it using PRAAT software (version 6.0. 29 64bit). The PRAAT is a multi-platform&#xD;
      application developed since 1992, constantly updated and made available free of charge by&#xD;
      Paul Boersma and David Wenink of the Phonetics Laboratory of the University of Amsterdam. It&#xD;
      provides numerical data with the possibility of objective evaluations of the vocal&#xD;
      characteristics. The system provides information on the fundamental frequency (F0), glottal&#xD;
      impulses, microperturbations or causal variations of the fundamental period (Jitter) and of&#xD;
      the amplitude (Shimmer) and also the relationship between the periodic and aperiodic signal&#xD;
      (NHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      F0 is the frequency of vocal cord vibrations during phonation, it is calculated in Hz and it&#xD;
      differs from man to woman with a difference of about 1.5 times higher in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jitter is a parameter related to the microperturbation of the fundamental period and in&#xD;
      particular the Jitter % represents the percentage ratio between the absolute average of the&#xD;
      differences between the consecutive fundamental periods and the average fundamental period.&#xD;
      The parameters relating to changes in the fundamental period increase in the presence of an&#xD;
      irregular glottal vibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shimmer identifies the microperturbations of the signal amplitude, therefore the Shimmer&#xD;
      % expresses the average relative perturbation of the amplitude period; the values increase in&#xD;
      case of organic or functional vocal pathology, as a consequence of the inability of the&#xD;
      chordal oscillator to maintain a regular vibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHR (noise-to-harmonics ratio) expresses the relationship between the disharmonic component&#xD;
      (noise) and the harmonic component, it constitutes a global evaluation of the presence of&#xD;
      noise in the analyzed signal due to the simultaneous variation of frequency and amplitude, of&#xD;
      turbulent noise, of sub-harmonic components and sound interruptions; its increase is related&#xD;
      to the subjective perception of dysphonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, after a forced inhalation, the sound emitted until exhaustion will represent the&#xD;
      maximum phonatory time (MPT), ie the longest time during which a patient can sustain the&#xD;
      phonation of a vowel sound and it is calculated in seconds (s). These measurements will be&#xD;
      performed three consecutive times; for the F0 variation, Jitter %, Shimmer % and NHR will be&#xD;
      kept the avarage value while for the MPT the best recording will be kept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will submit to the subject a self-assessment questionnaire on the&#xD;
      quality of the voice (Voice Handicap Index or VHI 10). This assessment is necessary to&#xD;
      estimate the psychological and social impact of the severity of dysphonia according to the&#xD;
      subject with regard to his normal daily activity. In this case, it will help the&#xD;
      investigators to exclude patients with pre-existing dysphonic problems. It will not be used&#xD;
      after surgery, since it is not indicative of short term variations. The anaesthesiological&#xD;
      evaluation will consist of a normal pre-surgery visit with particular regard to demographic&#xD;
      and anamnestic parameters and difficulties associated with respiratory tract, which will be&#xD;
      indicated in the appropriate form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery patients will be monitored and the respiratory tract will be handled as the&#xD;
      usual standard of care, collecting all necessary data for subsequent evaluations. 24-48 hours&#xD;
      after surgery, the patient, still hospitalized, will undergo an otorhinolaryngeal&#xD;
      re-evaluation by means of vocal analysis and laryngostroboscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of laryngeal morbidity (i.e edema, granulomas, mucosal damage, cordial paralysis&#xD;
      and/or alterations in the voice characteristics) the patient will be advised to undergo an&#xD;
      otorhinolaryngology visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will enroll patients who must undergo general and/or urology surgery of an&#xD;
      elective type.&#xD;
