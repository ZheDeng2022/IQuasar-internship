      and co-administered with HIV DNA CON-S env vaccine in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive 4&#xD;
      mg of DNA CON-S env at Months 0 and 1. They will receive 4 mg of DNA CON-S env and 150 mcg of&#xD;
      IHV01 at Months 3 and 6. Participants in Group 2 will receive placebo at Months 0, 1, 3, and&#xD;
      6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at Day 0 (study entry), Week 2, and Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6 + 1&#xD;
      week, 6.5, and 12. Visits may include physical examinations, medical history, injection of&#xD;
