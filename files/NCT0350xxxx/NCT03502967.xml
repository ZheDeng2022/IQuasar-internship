    <textblock>
      This project is to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate as&#xD;
      imaging agents of altered cerebral glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction and assess&#xD;
      pyruvate utilization in mitochondria in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients.&#xD;

      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will quantify changes in [1-13C]lactate and H13CO3- labeling following a bolus&#xD;
      injection of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate during the time window of secondary injury to&#xD;
      assess upregulated glycolysis. Due to heterogeneous presence and severity of damage by TBI,&#xD;
      defining the injured brain region can be difficult. Therefore, the metabolite ratio maps&#xD;
      ([product]/[pyruvate]) of TBI patients (n = 5) will be compared with those of&#xD;
      healthy-controls (n = 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperpolarized [2-13C]pyruvate will be examined in a separate group of TBI cohorts (n = 5)&#xD;
      and healthy controls (n = 3), and [5-13C]glutamate, [1-13C]acetyl-carnitine,&#xD;
      [1-13C]acetoacetate, and [1-13C]citrate from [2-13C]pyruvate will be quantified for assessing&#xD;
      the altered mitochondrial metabolism. Imaging procedure with [2-13C]pyruvate is the same as&#xD;
      the imaging with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both [1-13C]pyruvate and [2-13C]pyruvate studies, each subject will be imaged twice with&#xD;
      a 45min interval for confirming the reproducibility of the methods and/or averaging to&#xD;
      enhance the signal-to-noise ratios of 13C-metabolite maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the feasibility study (aim1) is completed, an intra-subject comparison study of&#xD;
      [1-13C]pyruvate and [2-13C]pyruvate will be performed. Similar to the aim1, patients with&#xD;
      post-TBI neurological disorders having normal or near-normal CT results (n = 6 patients) as&#xD;
      well as normal brains of age/gender-matching healthy volunteers (n = 3) will be recruited.&#xD;
      Each patient will be imaged twice (one with [1-13C]pyruvate and one with [2-13C]pyruvate with&#xD;
      a 45min interval). PDH activity and the TCA cycling will be assessed from measured H13CO3-&#xD;
      from hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate and [5-13C]glutamate from [2-13C]pyruvate, respectively.&#xD;
      The comparison of [1-13C]pyruvate and [2-13C]pyruvate will identify the detailed information&#xD;
      of how pyruvate (and converted acetyl-CoA) is utilized in the mitochondria, and assess the&#xD;
      utility and necessity of imaging hyperpolarized [2-13C]pyruvate in TBI, providing critical&#xD;
      data for future grant applications and larger clinical trials.&#xD;
