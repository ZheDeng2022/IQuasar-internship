  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients are supposed to take Fortimel® Protein, an Oral Nutritional&#xD;
      Supplement (ONS) recommended in case of malnutrition once daily during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three visits will be planned for each patient enrolled in the study (baseline visit, visits&#xD;
      of follow-up at 4 weeks and 12 weeks). Phone calls will be regularly organized during one&#xD;
      month or three months according to the duration of supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the OFraDDom study is to assess the compliance with ONS (respect by&#xD;
      the patient of the physician's prescription) at the end of the first month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the beneficial effects of ONS, or compliance with ONS in frail elderly&#xD;
      population, are very limited. The study could complete knowledge about oral nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation in the undernourished frail elderly people and help to demonstrate that oral&#xD;
      nutritional supplements have benefits on nutritional status and physical performances in&#xD;
      frail elderly people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For elderly with Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) or at nutritional risk, evidences support&#xD;
      that Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS) and dietary counselling can increase dietary intake&#xD;
      and improve quality of life. However, data regarding the beneficial effects of ONS, or&#xD;
      compliance with ONS in frail elderly population, are very limited. In their RCT, testing the&#xD;
      effect of protein supplementation, Tieland and colleagues (7) showed an improvement of SPPB&#xD;
      in frail older adults randomized to receive 15 g of supplemental protein daily for 24 weeks&#xD;
      compared with the placebo group (p=0.02). Another recent RCT on the effect of a daily&#xD;
      supplementation with protein and micronutrients for 12 weeks in 87 frail older adults (usual&#xD;
      gait speed &lt;0.6 m/s; MNA &lt; 24) showed that Physical Functioning increased by 5.9% (1 point)&#xD;
      in the intervention group, although no change was observed in the control group. SPPB&#xD;
      remained stable in the intervention group, although it decreased by 12.5% (1 point) in&#xD;
      controls (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients are supposed to take Fortimel® Protein, an ONS recommended in case of&#xD;
      malnutrition once daily during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling eligibility criteria will be asked whether they are interested to&#xD;
      participate in the study and receive Fortimel® protein. After informed consent, three visits&#xD;
      will be planned for each patient enrolled in the study (baseline visit, visits of follow-up&#xD;
      at 4 weeks and 12 weeks). Phone calls will be regularly organized during one month or three&#xD;
      month according to the duration of supplementation to collect the compliance with ONS and&#xD;
      coach patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First prescription of the study product will be done for one month. Prescription will be&#xD;
      repeated for 2 additional months only after the patient's nutritional status and its global&#xD;
      health status, as well as tolerability and compliance to the ONS, were re-assessed during the&#xD;
      first follow-up visit at one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the beneficial effects of ONS, or compliance with ONS in frail elderly&#xD;
      population, are very limited. To complete knowledge about oral nutritional supplementation in&#xD;
      the undernourished frail elderly people, study purpose is to assess Fortimel® Protein&#xD;
      compliance to know if this supplementation is well accepted and what are factors which limit&#xD;
      compliance. More, it could help to demonstrate that oral nutritional supplements have&#xD;
      benefits on nutritional status and physical performances in frail elderly people.&#xD;
