  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common chronic autoimmune disease associated with cell-mediated&#xD;
      immunological dysfunction. Symptomatic OLP is painful and complete healing is rare. Current&#xD;
      treatments for lichen planus and lichenoid mucositis are usually directed towards reducing&#xD;
      the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double-blinded cross-over placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to measure the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a topical NSAID (Ibuprofen suspension - 100mg/5ml) compared with a placebo&#xD;
      in reducing pain associated with Oral Lichen Planus and Oral Lichenoid Lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of dysplasia in the histopathological specimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known or suspected sensitivity to NSAID medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of gastrointestinal ulceration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of bleeding disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures are self-reported pain scores at day 0, day 4 and day 7 of use of the&#xD;
      placebo or active suspension, using a horizontal 100 mm, visual analog scale (VAS). If&#xD;
      subjects were already on active treatment at the time of enrollment, they will be asked to&#xD;
      discontinue for 7 days for a washout period before starting the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cord their spontaneous pain level on a 0-10 VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted initially after the first day of the intervention to discuss&#xD;
      any concerns or questions. Every week, reminder phone calls will be made to the subjects to&#xD;
      fill out the forms from the investigator and to check for any side effects from the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the patient and the investigator will be blinded for the content of each bottle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A four-week randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial was planned.&#xD;
      Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of&#xD;
      Washington before the start of the study, participants agreed to participate in this study&#xD;
      had to sign a written informed consent. The present trial was also registered (#NCT03509675).&#xD;
      The research was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the World&#xD;
      Medical Association's Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A coin was flipped to decide which medication would be used first to start the randomization.&#xD;
      Based on the coin toss, drug A was chosen for the first block of two participants. Then,&#xD;
      block randomization was further assigned by blocks of two, alternating the drugs. The&#xD;
      medicines were distributed in identical plastic containers, packed by an external pharmacist&#xD;
      who was unaware of the protocol and successfully labeled as A and B containers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention, neither investigators nor the participants knew which of the&#xD;
      treatments they were using.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Study Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants were screened through the Oral Medicine patient registry at the&#xD;
      University of Washington. Prospective patients aged 18-80 were examined by the attending at&#xD;
      the Oral Medicine Clinical Services (OMCS) faculty. All potential study participants with a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of symptomatic oral lichenoid mucositis with or without a biopsy were&#xD;
      identified. Individuals were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a symptomatic form of the disease, pain level of 3 out 10 on VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of dysplasia in the histopathological specimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known or suspected sensitivity to NSAID medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of gastrointestinal ulceration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of bleeding disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were asked to participate in the research at their first or follow-up visits at&#xD;
      the OMCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Sample Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most similar study to the present one was done by Saxen et al., in which a 45% change in&#xD;
      VAS scores between the treatment groups was found. With the assumption of a 45% difference in&#xD;
      VAS scores, a standard deviation of 0.69, a two-sided significance level of 0.05, and a&#xD;
      statistical power of 80%, a sample size of 36 was calculated. When accounting for the effect&#xD;
      of a cross-over trial and analyses, a sample size of 36 should be able to show significance&#xD;
      with a change in VAS scores between 25% and 30%, significantly less than that found in the&#xD;
      work of Saxen et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected included the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS at baseline, end of day 4 and following the end-of-the-week application of the&#xD;
           active intervention and the placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Race and ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of the primary chief complaint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication trials for the condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current prescription drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current OTC drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known allergies to drugs or food substances&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical diagnosis of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Classification of the OLP (if noted): reticular, erythematous, erosive, bullous Topical&#xD;
           Formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The topical suspension of the topical NSAID was 100 mg per 5 ml concentration of ibuprofen,&#xD;
      with similar ingredients as OTC children's ibuprofen and was compounded by an external drug&#xD;
      service. Another placebo suspension was also compounded with the same taste but without the&#xD;
      active ingredient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      We used tracking forms for the participants to record both their daily usage and VAS scores&#xD;
      at baseline, day 4, and day 7. (see Appendix A). Participants were asked to mark their pain&#xD;
      level before starting the first bottle in the morning of day one. 100mm VAS scales were used&#xD;
      with the anchors of (non-intense) on the right side and (extremely intense) on the left. The&#xD;
      patients were seen for a free assessment to evaluate their condition during the intervention&#xD;
      and report any adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      After we obtained written consent from the patients regarding their participation in the&#xD;
      research, they received a research packet with the relevant data forms, the consent form, and&#xD;
      two bottles; each bottle had an individual label marked wither &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;. The coding which&#xD;
      identified the contents of A and B was sealed by the pharmacy and was kept with one of the&#xD;
      committee members as well as with the pharmacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were asked to record their baseline score of spontaneous pain on a&#xD;
      horizontal 10 cm VAS before commencing the use of the provided rinses. If the participants&#xD;
      were already on active treatment at the time of enrollment, they were asked to discontinue&#xD;
      for 7 days prior for a wash-out period before starting the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were instructed to use the first suspension four times a day for 7 days.&#xD;
      They were instructed to rinse before the meals; breakfast, lunch, dinner and also before&#xD;
      bedtime. After every application of the rinse, they were asked to check a box in order to&#xD;
      record their use of the rinse. The instructions included rinsing with 5 ml of the suspension&#xD;
      for 1 minute without swallowing it, and then expectorating. The patients were instructed not&#xD;
      to eat or drink for the following 20 min after the application of the drug. At the end of&#xD;
      days 4 and 7, the participants were asked to record their spontaneous pain level on the VAS.&#xD;
      After the first week, they discontinued any treatment for 7 days (wash-out) before starting&#xD;
      the second suspension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were instructed to use the second suspension on the same schedule as the&#xD;
      first, and with the same instructions. The participants were contacted initially after the&#xD;
      first day of the intervention to discuss any concerns or questions they may have. Every week,&#xD;
      reminder phone calls were made for them to fill out the forms from the investigator and to&#xD;
      check for any side effects from the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data We protected the patients' information by assigning each individual with a study number&#xD;
      that was correlated with the medical record number on a master list. The master list was&#xD;
      secured in a password-protected file on a password-protected computer stored in a locked&#xD;
      office. The collected data were stored separately. The list was not placed on a portable&#xD;
      device. Only the research committee members and the personnel required for the statistical&#xD;
      analysis had access to the files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data will be kept indefinitely but will only be linked until December 31, 2019.&#xD;
      Only the investigators will have access to the identifiable data unless otherwise required by&#xD;
      law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS results were measured in millimeters and entered as whole numbers. T-tests for means&#xD;
      were used to compare VAS scores at the following time points: baseline, days 4 and 7 of&#xD;
      treatment condition # 1, at baseline #2 (following the wash-out period), and at days 4 and 7&#xD;
      of treatment condition #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple linear regression was used to determine the difference in effect between the active&#xD;
      medication and placebo groups by including the difference between reports at baseline, day 4&#xD;
      and at day 7. Both univariate models and models including age and duration of chief complaint&#xD;
      were used to assess the effect of these variables. There was insufficient variance in both&#xD;
      gender and race to assess for these effects. Although randomization of the treatment order&#xD;
      should eliminate order effect, tests for order effect were performed using regression&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For drug effect assessment, in addition to using VAS scores themselves, percent change in VAS&#xD;
      scores was used to normalize distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and Human Participant Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      All experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board IRB&#xD;
      and Committee on human participant research at the University of Washington.&#xD;
