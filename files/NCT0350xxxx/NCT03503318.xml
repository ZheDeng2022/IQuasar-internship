    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of different&#xD;
      dose regimens of TV-46000 administered subcutaneously (SC) as compared to placebo during&#xD;
      maintenance treatment in adult and adolescent participants with schizophrenia. The study will&#xD;
      include male and female participants, 13 to 65 years of age, who have a confirmed diagnosis&#xD;
      of schizophrenia, are clinically stable, and are eligible for risperidone treatment&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, endpoint and end of treatment (up to Week 108)</time_frame>
    <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. The DAI-10 contains 6 items (1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10) that a participant who was fully adherent to the prescribed medication answered as &quot;True&quot; and 4 items (2, 5, 6, and 8) that a participant who was fully adherent to the prescribed medication answered as &quot;False.&quot; A correct answer was scored +1 and an incorrect answer was scored -1. The total score was the sum of pluses and minuses, which ranged from -10 to 10 in increments of 2. A positive total score indicated a positive subjective response (compliant) and a negative total score indicated a negative subjective response (non-compliance). Higher scores denoted better compliance. (Adult participants only)</description>

    <description>The SQLS comprises 33 items categorized in 2 domains: psychosocial feelings (20 items) and cognition and vitality (13 items). The items were scored on a 5-point scale (1 - never, 2 - rarely, 3 - sometimes, 4 - often, 5 - always). Individual domain and total scores were standardized by scoring algorithm to a 0 (best health status) to 100 (worst health status) scale, with higher scores indicating comparatively lower quality of life. The last valid participant assessment was used as the endpoint. (Adult participants only)</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization up to 120 days after last dose of study drug (up to Week 125)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. TEAEs are defined as AEs occurring after the first dose of the study drug until 120 days after the last dose of study drug. Serious AEs are defined as death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (up to 108 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS is a 14-item scale that includes assessments of orofacial movements, extremity and truncal dyskinesia, examiner's judgment of global severity, subjective measures of awareness of movements and distress, and a yes/no assessment of problems concerning teeth and/or dentures. Total AIMS score is a sum of item 1 through 7. Items 1 through 7 include facial and oral movements (Items 1-4), extremity movements (Items 5-6), and trunk movements (Item 7). Each item was rated on a 0 (no dyskinesia) to 4 (severe dyskinesia) scale. Total AIMS score for Items 1-7 ranged from 0 to 28; with higher scores indicating greater severity of the condition.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) Mean Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (up to 108 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS is a 10-item instrument for the assessment of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. The items on the scale include measurements of hypokinesia, rigidity, glabellar reflex, tremor, and salivation. Each item was rated on a 5-point scale (0 [None/Normal] to 4 [Extreme/Severe]). The mean score was calculated by adding the individual item scores and dividing by 10. The total mean score ranged from 0-40, with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (up to 108 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The BARS is an instrument that assesses the severity of drug-induced akathisia. The BARS includes 3 items for rating objective restless movements, subjective restlessness, and any subjective distress associated with akathisia that were scored on a 4-point scale of 0 (normal/no distress) to 3 (constant restlessness/severe distress). Total score was the sum of scores of each item and ranged from 0-9, with higher scores indicating greater severity of akathisia.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-baseline (up to 108 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal behavior was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any one of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (up to 108 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CDSS is specifically designed to assess the level of depression separate from the positive, negative, and EPS in schizophrenia. This clinician-administered instrument consists of 9 items, each rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) that were added together to form the total CDSS depression score of the participant. The total score ranged from 0-27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of the condition.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality (CGI-SS) Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (up to 108 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-SS scale provides an overall clinician-rated assessment of the risk of suicidality. The CGI-SS consists of a 5-point scale in Part 1 (the most severe level of suicidality experience) ranging from 1 (not at all suicidal) to 5 (attempted suicide) and a 7-point scale in Part 2 (change in participant suicidality) ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
