    <textblock>
      This trial is a phase 1/1b study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of&#xD;
      APX005M in combination with nivolumab and cabiralizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study will enroll patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 6&#xD;
      cohorts to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of APX005M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1b dose expansion portion will study the triple drug combination separately in the&#xD;
      three disease cohorts: melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC.&#xD;

             lesions used for efficacy assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Prior focal radiotherapy is allowed. Radiation to brain, pulmonary or intestinal sites&#xD;
             must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to study Day 1. There is no time restriction&#xD;
             prior to study Day 1 for patients who have received radiation to bone, soft tissue or&#xD;
             other sites. No radiopharmaceuticals (strontium, samarium) within 8 weeks before first&#xD;
             dose of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Prior surgery that requires general anesthesia must be completed at least 1 week&#xD;
             before first dose of study drug administration. Surgery requiring local/epidural&#xD;
             anesthesia must be completed at least 72 hours before first dose of study drug&#xD;

          1. Untreated brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A patient who has had prior immune therapy or chemotherapy, within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             study Day 1, or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse&#xD;
             events due to a previously administered agent will be excluded. The exception is&#xD;
             targeted therapy that must have been completed at least 2 weeks or after 5 half-lives,&#xD;
             which ever is shorter, prior to study Day 1. Patients who have had prior ipilimumab&#xD;
             must have received their last dose no less than 4 weeks prior to study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from&#xD;
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Note: Toxicity that has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 is allowed if it meets the&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Has had prior treatment with any other CSF1R inhibitor or CD40 agonist&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of corticosteroids to control immune related adverse events at enrollment will not&#xD;
             be allowed, and patients who previously required corticosteroids for symptom control&#xD;
             must be off steroids for at least 2 weeks. Low-dose steroid use (≤10 mg of prednisone&#xD;
             or equivalent) as corticosteroid replacement therapy for primary or secondary adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiency is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to prior&#xD;
             treatments with the exception of clinically insignificant adverse events such as&#xD;
             alopecia, clinically insignificant laboratory abnormalities, clinically insignificant&#xD;
             rash and Grade 2 neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of grade 3-4 neurologic or cardiac toxicity or life-threatening liver toxicity&#xD;
             poorly responsive to steroids with prior anti-PD-1/anti-PDL1 monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has active autoimmune disease unrelated to use of immune checkpoint inhibitors that&#xD;
             has required systemic treatment in the past year (i.e. with use of disease modifying&#xD;
             agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg.,&#xD;
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or&#xD;
             pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with nivolumab, cabiralizumab or&#xD;
             APX005M, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents and may not have&#xD;
             participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Either a concurrent condition (including medical illness, such as active infection&#xD;
             requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics or the presence of laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities) or history of a prior condition that places the patient at unacceptable&#xD;
             risk if he/she were treated with the study drug or a medical condition that confounds&#xD;
             the ability to interpret data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Concurrent, active malignancies in addition to those being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Active (non-infectious) pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B (HBV), or Hepatitis C&#xD;
             (HCV) acute or chronic infection.&#xD;
