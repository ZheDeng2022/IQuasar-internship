  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that placebo effects contribute substantially to clinical outcomes. Recent&#xD;
      evidence suggests that placebos remain effective even if they are openly described as&#xD;
      placebos (so-called Open-Label Placebos). In this study, the investigators examine components&#xD;
      of open-label placebos and traditional deceptive placebos in an experimental study&#xD;
      investigating sadness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of research has indicated that placebos contribute substantially to clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Yet, the implementation of deceptive placebos in clinical practice is incompatible&#xD;
      with key principles of openness and patient autonomy. However, recent research suggests that&#xD;
      placebos remain effective even if they openly described as placebos (so-called Open-Label&#xD;
      Placebos (OLP)), hence questioning the necessity of deception in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, comparisons between OLP and deceptive placebos (DP) with regard to their particular&#xD;
      mechanisms are lacking. Therefore, the current study aims to identify components of OLP and&#xD;
      DP. For this purpose, experimentally induced sadness is examined using a standardized&#xD;
      paradigm which has previously been developed by our working group. In particular, healthy&#xD;
      volunteers are informed that a new application method for a well-known antidepressant would&#xD;
      be tested. Sadness is assessed before and after receiving a nasal spray. Two experimental&#xD;
      groups (DP groups) are informed that they would receive an antidepressant nasal spray,&#xD;
      another two experimental groups (OLP groups) are informed that they would receive a placebo.&#xD;
      In fact, all nasal sprays are active placebos inducing prickling nasal sensations (sesame oil&#xD;
      with 0.014% capsaicin). In addition to the factor &quot;Transparency&quot; (DP vs. OLP), the&#xD;
      instruction is experimentally varied, with which the substance is administered&#xD;
      (scientifically-objective vs. personally-affective), resulting in a 2x2 design. Further,&#xD;
      there is an additional fifth group receiving no intervention. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      self-rated sadness after taking the nasal spray.&#xD;
