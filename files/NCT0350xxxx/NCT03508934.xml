  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 25% of the patients admitted in the general wards have a history of Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus (DM). Up to 30% of the hospitalized diabetics develop hypoglycemia (low glucose&#xD;
      values); a condition that is associated with seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.&#xD;
      In Veterans, the prevalence is disproportionally higher. It is estimated that 40-50% of&#xD;
      hospitalized Veterans are diabetics. In this clinical trial the investigators describe the&#xD;
      development of a novel system, the Glucose Telemetry System (GTS), with which glucose values&#xD;
      can be wirelessly transmitted from the patient's bedside to a monitor device at the nursing&#xD;
      station. The goal of this work is to develop a more effective glucose surveillance system at&#xD;
      the general wards, which can decrease hypoglycemia in the hospital and improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 25% of patients admitted to general wards/non Intensive Care Unit (non-ICU) setting&#xD;
      have a history of Diabetes Mellitus (DM); and as for 2012, $125 billion dollars were costs&#xD;
      associated with hospitalization of diabetics in the United States (US). Up to 30% of the&#xD;
      hospitalized diabetics develop hypoglycemia, a condition that is associated with higher&#xD;
      hospital charges, prolonged length of stay, and increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing hypoglycemic events in the inpatient setting has led hospitals to develop&#xD;
      hypoglycemia prevention policies; policies which are however limited by the infrequent Point&#xD;
      of Care (POC) capillary blood glucose testing in the general wards. Continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring (CGM) devices represent additional ways to monitor blood glucose levels. Only a&#xD;
      limited number of studies have examined the use of CGM devices in the non-ICU setting. In all&#xD;
      these studies, CGM use was found to be superior compared to POC in hypoglycemia detection.&#xD;
      However, as the results of CGM were blinded (alarms were turned off) for both the&#xD;
      investigators and the participants, interventions to prevent hypoglycemia were not performed.&#xD;
      Additionally, one major limitation of CGM technology is that CGM receiver/monitor needs to be&#xD;
      located in the patient's room, due to Bluetooth Technology signal-strength restrictions,&#xD;
      necessitating nurses to enter frequently the patient's room in order to check CGM glucose&#xD;
      values. In the current application, the investigators are going to evaluate whether an&#xD;
      innovative system that the investigators call &quot;Glucose Telemetry System&quot; (GTS) can decrease&#xD;
      hypoglycemia and improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized Veterans with DM2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discovering novel ways to monitor glucose values in the hospital setting could have a&#xD;
      significant impact in preventing hypoglycemia in the inpatient setting- a condition that is&#xD;
      associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The investigators believe that this proposal is&#xD;
      highly innovative. The trial may lead to future wider use of CGM in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      with DM who are at a higher risk for hypoglycemia, similar to the way that the investigators&#xD;
      use cardiac telemetry for patients who are at an increased risk for developing arrhythmias.&#xD;
