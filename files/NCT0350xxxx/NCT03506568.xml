  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the second leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Eye drop medications&#xD;
      reduce vision loss from glaucoma by at least 60%, but eye drops must be taken every day to be&#xD;
      effective. However, adherence to eye drop treatment is poor with only 50% of patients&#xD;
      regularly taking their prescribed eye drops. The investigators are developing the Devers Drop&#xD;
      Device (D3) eye drop monitor to accurately measure eye drop cap removal and to improve eye&#xD;
      drop-taking behavior. The investigators will test eye drop adherence with the D3 device in a&#xD;
      randomized, prospective clinical trial.&#xD;

      Universal Adherence is an emerging medical device company dedicated to improving adherence to&#xD;
      ocular medications through innovative technical solutions. The Devers Drop Device (D3) will&#xD;
      accurately track when a patient removes an eye drop bottle cap, communicate usage data&#xD;
      wirelessly to a database that researchers can access, and send alerts to patients when a&#xD;
      medication is due. In addition to helping patients maintain their dosing schedule, the D3&#xD;
      will also provide adherence information to researchers and eye care providers, which will&#xD;
      help to understand poor treatment outcomes and to develop improved treatment strategies.The&#xD;
      clinical benefits of the device in improving adherence will initially be assessed and&#xD;
      targeted towards glaucoma, but the ability of the device to be attached to all FDA-approved&#xD;
      eye drop bottle caps will make this device attractive to all patients that need consistent&#xD;
      daily use of eye drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, prospective clinical trial: The investigators will enroll 50 participants (25&#xD;
      male, 25 female) into a prospective trial with duration of up to 50 days. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are those who are prescribed latanoprost eye drop to be used once per day at&#xD;
      bedtime, and own a functioning Android or Apple iphone smartphone (iOs) with Bluetooth and&#xD;
      cellular connectivity. The investigators will exclude patients who currently use smartphone&#xD;
      medication reminders and those with severe cognitive impairment limiting their ability to&#xD;
      understand a questionnaire. The 50-day period is useful for glaucoma studies because patients&#xD;
      revert to their normal dosing pattern within two weeks after their last visit. This study&#xD;
      will include two stages: Stage 1) a 25-day period evaluating baseline patient adherence with&#xD;
      the D3 device; and Stage 2) a subsequent 25-day period to determine the effect of no reminder&#xD;
      versus daily reminder using the D3 app, which includes integrated audio and visual reminders.&#xD;
