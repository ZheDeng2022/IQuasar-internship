      A prospective Phase 2, single-center, single-allergen OIT of cashew or shrimp in participants&#xD;
      with proven allergies to either cashew or shrimp, respectively. We intend to treat 72&#xD;
      participants, ages 7 to 55 years with an allergy to either cashew, or shrimp determined by&#xD;
      Double Blind-Placebo Controlled-Food Challenge (DBPCFC), allergy history, clinical symptoms,&#xD;
      food-allergen (FA)-specific IgE levels, and skin prick test (SPT).&#xD;

      A prospective Phase 2, single-center, single-allergen OIT of cashew or shrimp in participants&#xD;
      with proven allergies to either cashew or shrimp, respectively. We intend to treat 72&#xD;
      participants, ages 7 to 55 years with an allergy to either cashew or shrimp determined by&#xD;
      Double Blind-Placebo Controlled-Food Challenge (DBPCFC), allergy history, clinical symptoms,&#xD;
      food-allergen (FA)-specific IgE levels, and skin prick test (SPT). Enrolled participants must&#xD;
      be positive at or before the 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) dosing level of FA protein. OIT&#xD;
      treatment groups will be cashew or shrimp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cohorts will undergo an updosing regimen starting at 5 mg allergen, with dose escalation&#xD;
      every 2 weeks to reach a 1000 mg dose at week 28, after which they will be maintained at that&#xD;
      dose for 24 weeks. At the conclusion of the maintenance phase (Week 52), participants will&#xD;
      undergo DBPCFC. Participants that pass their food challenge with no or mild objective&#xD;
      reactions to up to a cumulative 2043 mg of the FA allergen in their OIT at the end of this&#xD;
      phase (primary outcome) will be considered desensitized and have successfully met the primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants then will continue in the study by undergoing withdrawal from OIT for 6&#xD;
      weeks to examine mechanisms underlying sustained responsiveness (SU) which will be defined as&#xD;
      a participant's passing a DBPCFC with no or mild objective reaction to up to a cumulative&#xD;
      2043 mg of the FA allergen in their DBPCFC at week 58.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those participants who pass the Week 58 challenge up to a cumulative of 2043 mg will be given&#xD;
      the option to continue the withdrawal phase up to Week 64 which will be end of study. Week 58&#xD;
      will be end of study for those who do not opt for this continuation of withdrawal.&#xD;
