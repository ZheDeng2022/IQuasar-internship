      Evaluation of fenestration benefit in Extra-cardiac total cavo-pulmonary connection (Fontan&#xD;
      procedure) in single ventricle anomaly, comparing clinical outcomes of patients with low&#xD;

      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include all patients referred for an elective Fontan procedure at the period&#xD;
      of the study, who demonstrated a standard risk profile. An Informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from the guardians before enrollment in the investigation. All procedures followed will be in&#xD;
      accordance with institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to undergo either a fenestrated or non-fenestrated Extra-cardiac&#xD;
      Fontan, based on a table of randomly generated numbers. Preoperative clinical data will be&#xD;
      collected and compared to ensure appropriate randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative evaluation consists of ECG, transthoracic echocardiogram, and complete cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the following parameters will be eligible for enrollment in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinus Rhythm Atriovnetricular valve regurgitation not more than mild Aortic (neoaortic) valve&#xD;
      regurgitation not more than mild Normal systolic dominant ventricle function Mean pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressure not more than 15 mmHg (measured directly or estimated by pulmonary vein wedge&#xD;
      pressure) Pulmonary vascular resistance not more than 2 woods unit End diastolic ventricular&#xD;
      filling pressure not more than 8 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with the following will not be eligible for inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pulmonary artery distortion, stenosis or thrombus requiring surgical or&#xD;
      interventional additional procedures before or during the Fontan operation. Pacemaker&#xD;
      insertion before or during Fontan operation. Significant pulmonary arteriovenous&#xD;
      malformations (AVMs) rendering fenestration potentially a cause of excessive cyanosis.&#xD;
      Patients for whom the cardiology/cardiac surgery case conference decision is strongly in&#xD;
      favor of fenestration for any other cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventricular filling pressure will be directly measured as the end-diastolic pressure in the&#xD;
      dominant systemic ventricle. The degree of systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation will&#xD;
      be assessed semi-quantitatively by echocardiographic color Doppler, primarily based on width&#xD;
      of jet origin. The regurgitation jet will be graded as none, mild, moderate, or severe.&#xD;
      Rhythm is assessed with preoperative ECG or Holter monitor (if required). Coil occlusion of&#xD;
      aortopulmonary collaterals is not an exclusion criterion and is recommended before the Fontan&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative Technique and postoperative management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Patients underwent an extracardiac Fontan operation. The extracardiac Fontan&#xD;
      channel will be constructed with a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube graft from the&#xD;
      inferior vena cava to the pulmonary artery. The size if the graft is determined by the&#xD;
      surgeon and ranged from 16 to 22 mm in diameter. The fenestration consists of a single 3- to&#xD;
      6-mm communication between the Fontan channel and the common atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative treatment will include administration of captopril, and aggressive use of&#xD;
      diuretics. All patients will receive aspirin (81 mg per day) and warfarin with a target&#xD;
      International Normalized Ration INR of 2-2.5 beginning on the first postoperative day. To&#xD;
      maximize caloric intake, patients ill not be fluid restricted after the initial postoperative&#xD;
      period. All patients will be placed on fat free diet for 6 weeks. Chest tubes will be left in&#xD;
      place until drainage is less than 5 mL/kg in a 24-hour period. A chest tube will be&#xD;
      reinserted only if a symptomatic pleural effusion is diagnosed. Steroids and Octreotide will&#xD;
      be started after 2 weeks of persistent drainage or immediately if Chylothorax is diagnosed&#xD;
      biochemically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attending cardiologist and surgeon determined the need for and timing of postoperative&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization. Patients will be discharged from the intensive care unit when&#xD;
      hemodynamic and respiratory stability is ensured and a stable heart rhythm is maintained. The&#xD;
      patients will be discharged from hospital after all chest tubes are removed and when the&#xD;
      clinical status permits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end is the total length of chest tube drainage in days. If chest tube reinsertion&#xD;
      is required during the same admission, this time will be added to the primary outcome. Other&#xD;
      outcome variables include length of stay in the intensive care unit, total hospital stay in&#xD;
      days, total amount of chest tube drainage, occurrence of stroke,readmissions, reoperation, or&#xD;
      death within 90 days of discharge. All end points are defined a priori. The day of surgery&#xD;
      counted as day 1 for all variables. All reoperations will be assessed including returning to&#xD;
      the operating room for bleeding or poor hemodynamics, replacement of chest tubes, cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization, and late fenestration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimates is based on a retrospective analysis of the last 100 patients who&#xD;
      underwent the Fontan procedure at out institutionwith 80% power to avoid a type II&#xD;
      statistical error. A reduction in total chest tube drainage days of 15% is considered&#xD;
      clinically significant. The median length of chest tube drainage (estimated as one day less&#xD;
      than the median postoperative length of hospitalization) was 19 days. Given a clinically&#xD;
      significant difference of 15%, the calculated days of difference were 19 X 0.15 = 2.85. We&#xD;
      set the relevant difference to be 3 days. Using a modified Lehr's equation for sample size in&#xD;
      count data, we estimate the number in each group to be, n=4/〖(√(γ_1 )-√(γ_2 ))〗^2&#xD;
      =4/〖(√19-√16)〗^2 =31patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables. Medians and ranges describe&#xD;
      continuous variables. Categorical variables will be summarized as frequencies. The Mann&#xD;
      Whitney U test will be used for all continuous variables; analysis and Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      will be applied for all dichotomous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Count data for hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and length of&#xD;
      chest tube drainage will be compared by means of Poisson regression or Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazards models. A probability value of 0.05 will indicate statistical significance. All&#xD;
      calculations were performed with R-project statistical software (www.r-project.org).&#xD;
