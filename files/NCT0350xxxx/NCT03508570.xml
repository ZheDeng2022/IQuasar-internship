  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab with or without&#xD;
      ipilimumab in treating patients with female reproductive cancer that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent) or is high grade and has spread extensively throughout the peritoneal cavity&#xD;
      (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of intraperitoneal (i.p.) nivolumab in&#xD;
      combination with ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicities, and immune-related adverse events&#xD;
      associated with i.p. checkpoint inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the clinical benefit rate (rate of partial response [PR], complete response&#xD;
      [CR], and stable disease [SD] using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]&#xD;
      version 1.1 modified to include immune-related response criteria) for the expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine blood based transcriptional changes associated with pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      time points and determine their correlation with serum drug concentrations, clinical&#xD;
      response, and immune related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine baseline and on-treatment molecular alteration (ribonucleic acid [RNA] and&#xD;
      protein) associated with i.p. and nivolumab (Nivo) (for the expansion cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive nivolumab i.p. over 90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive nivolumab as in group I and ipilimumab i.p. on day 1. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for at least&#xD;
      100 days.&#xD;
