      Cancer is one of the leading causes of death internationally. When planning treatment for&#xD;
      most cancers, it is important to know how far it has spread, including whether or not the&#xD;
      cancer has spread to the local lymph nodes (LNs) because this affects the treatment strategy.&#xD;
      This is termed &quot;staging&quot;, and can be achieved by medical imaging, such as by ultrasound,&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However, these are&#xD;
      imperfect, and sometimes incorrect treatment decisions are made because of errors in staging&#xD;
      by imaging. Improved accuracy would be of great clinical value for almost all solid organ&#xD;
      tumours. An emerging technique to address this is photoacoustic tomography (PAT), a&#xD;
      non-invasive, safe modality that relies on light and sound to generate images. Laser light is&#xD;
      applied to the area to be imaged; this is absorbed, and causes the illuminated tissue to emit&#xD;
      ultrasound waves. These can be detected and turned into an image by post-processing&#xD;
      techniques similar to those used in conventional diagnostic ultrasound. By changing the&#xD;
      wavelength of light used, the technique can be adjusted to optimise detection of various body&#xD;
      components, including fat, water and both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. This means the&#xD;
      images can represent tissue composition and function rather than just anatomical structure.&#xD;
      Hitherto, most work on PAT has been on healthy volunteers, and has focused on imaging the&#xD;
      vasculature. We would like to see whether we are able to generate images of deeper structures&#xD;
      inside the body. Initially we will focus on patients with vascular disease, whom we expect to&#xD;
      have abnormal blood vessels; and subsequently we will attempt to image tumours and LNs in&#xD;
      patients with cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer affects nearly 50% of individuals in the UK, and accounts for around 30% of all&#xD;
      deaths. For almost all cancers, both prognosis and treatment fundamentally depend on the&#xD;
      degree of spread at diagnosis i.e. tumour stage. For example, early stage bowel (colorectal)&#xD;
      cancer confined to the bowel wall has a cure rate of nearly 95% whereas it is lower than 50%&#xD;
      by the time it has spread to the lymph nodes (LNs). Similarly, patients with LN involvement&#xD;
      from breast cancer may require more extensive surgery to remove the affected node, and have&#xD;
      poorer long-term survival than patients without LN disease, even with small volumes of nodal&#xD;
      tumour. The same is true for most other solid organ malignancies. So, as a general&#xD;
      oncological principle, patients with advanced disease often require more aggressive treatment&#xD;
      such as pre-operative (neo-adjuvant) chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both; and usually need&#xD;
      more extensive surgery / radiotherapy when definitive treatment is instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such therapeutic decision-making depends fundamentally on the advance knowledge of whether or&#xD;
      not a particular patient has disease spread. This, in turn, requires a battery of tests&#xD;
      designed to accurately pinpoint the extent and anatomical location of cancer dissemination&#xD;
      throughout the body. This is typically achieved via a combination of medical imaging tests&#xD;
      (such as ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and nuclear&#xD;
      medicine techniques e.g. positron emission tomography [PET]) and tissue sampling (biopsy).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, these techniques are imperfect, both for local staging of the primary cancer&#xD;
      and its spread to local LNs. For example, in some cancers, over 50% of malignant LNs measure&#xD;
      less than 10mm, the most commonly-used cut-off to define an abnormal lymph node using&#xD;
      conventional medical imaging[9]. Therefore, for many tumours it is common practice to treat&#xD;
      the entire regional LN group, either by surgical removal or radiotherapy. This strategy risks&#xD;
      overtreatment for many and introduces the adverse effects associated with such extensive&#xD;
      tissue damage. Regarding primary tumours, the precise extent of local tumour spread can&#xD;
      determine whether or not a limited, local resection can be achieved rather than a more&#xD;
      radical excision. A rapid, non-invasive, well-tolerated test that could improve local and&#xD;
      regional nodal cancer staging would be of great clinical value, since it would immediately&#xD;
      permit more accurate individualized treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a relatively novel technology that may be able to help&#xD;
      address this urgent clinical need. PAT relies upon the absorption of laser-generated light of&#xD;
      specific wavelengths (often in the infra-red spectrum) by intrinsic components of the imaged&#xD;
      tissue. Such absorption results in emission of sound waves, which are ultrasonic (i.e. very&#xD;
      high frequency). Images can then be reconstructed in a similar manner to that employed by a&#xD;
      clinical ultrasound scanner. By imaging at multiple wavelengths, tissue distribution of&#xD;
      water, lipid (fat) and haemoglobin (in red blood cells and therefore blood vessels) can be&#xD;
      mapped with extremely high resolution (~100 microns), raising the possibility that PAT can&#xD;
      depict the small volume tumour that existing techniques cannot.&#xD;
