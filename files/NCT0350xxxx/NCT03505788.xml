  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study is being conducted in multiple hospitals in Belgium and&#xD;
      approximately 519 patients with acute decompensated heart failure are expected to&#xD;
      participate. Large-scale research shows that 90% of the physicians treat volume overload with&#xD;
      high doses of loop diuretics. However, there is not a lot of scientific data available&#xD;
      regarding the optimal doses of these diuretic medications. In addition, it is observed that a&#xD;
      lot of people, treated with these drugs, are being readmitted to the hospital due to a new&#xD;
      episode of heart failure. The hypothesis of this study is that the volume overload could be&#xD;
      better treated when patients receive a combination of different types of diuretics.&#xD;
      Additionally, the total dose of the administrated diuretics might be lower this way.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind study with 2 treatment groups. This means that the&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups by chance. Patients randomized&#xD;
      to the first group will receive standard treatment with high doses of intravenous loop&#xD;
      diuretics and a placebo. Patients randomized to the other treatment group will receive a&#xD;
      combination of the same doses of loop diuretics and an additional diuretic, acetazolamide&#xD;
      (Diamox®). All diuretics will be administered intravenously. It is expected that the patients&#xD;
      of the treatment group with the combination therapy will have a faster reduction of their&#xD;
      fluid overload. In consequence the treatment duration and total dose of diuretics&#xD;
      administered will be shorter. Acetazolamide (Diamox®) is a diuretic that acts at a different&#xD;
      location in the kidney compared to the loop diuretics. This mutual reinforcement will&#xD;
      probably reduce the total dose and duration of the diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start during the hospitalization and will last around 3 months.&#xD;
