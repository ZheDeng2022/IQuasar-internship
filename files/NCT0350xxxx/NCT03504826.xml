  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locomotor training is an established rehabilitation approach that is beneficial for improving&#xD;
      walking function in individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCIs). This approach focuses on&#xD;
      repetitive practice and appropriate stepping movements to activate spinal neural networks and&#xD;
      promote rhythmic motor output associated with walking. Assistance with stepping movements is&#xD;
      often provided by physical therapists and trainers, but this can be costly and difficult to&#xD;
      deliver in the cost-constrained U.S. healthcare market. Robotic devices have been used as an&#xD;
      alternate method to deliver locomotor training, but current robotic approaches often lack the&#xD;
      natural movement variations that characterize normal human stepping. Furthermore, studies to&#xD;
      compare locomotor training approaches have not shown any specific benefits of using robotic&#xD;
      devices. A new type of robotic device has emerged that uses an individual's muscle activation&#xD;
      and stepping movements to control the robot during walking. This adaptive robotic device&#xD;
      adjusts to the user's intentions and can assist with stepping during locomotor training in a&#xD;
      manner that matches natural human stepping. While this type of adaptive robot has been&#xD;
      preliminarily tested, the safety and efficacy of locomotor training using adaptive robotics&#xD;
      are not well-established in patients with SCI. This is a critical step to determine if&#xD;
      individuals with SCI may benefit from use of this device and for preliminary adoption of this&#xD;
      technology. Recent studies have used the Cyberdyne Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) to deliver&#xD;
      locomotor training and have reported outcomes suggesting that the HAL adaptive robot is safe&#xD;
      and efficacious for walking rehabilitation in European SCI patients. Therefore this study&#xD;
      will use the HAL adaptive robot to deliver locomotor training. This research is necessary to&#xD;
      determine if use of the HAL is potentially beneficial and warranted for use with locomotor&#xD;
      training and SCI patients receiving care in the U.S. Results of this study may contribute to&#xD;
      the development and implementation of effective walking rehabilitation approaches for people&#xD;
      with SCIs.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of locomotor training using&#xD;
      adaptive robotics in adults with chronic SCI. Safety will be determined by monitoring of&#xD;
      adverse responses such as skin irritation, pain, changes in spasticity and function.&#xD;
      Preliminary efficacy for improving walking function will be determined by tests of walking&#xD;
      speed and endurance prior to and following 60 daily sessions of locomotor training using&#xD;
      adaptive robots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that locomotor training using adaptive robotics such as&#xD;
      the Cyberdyne Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is safe for individuals with chronic incomplete&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI). Safety will be demonstrated by an adverse response rate that does&#xD;
      not exceed the frequency and severity of adverse responses reported for other&#xD;
      well-established locomotor rehabilitation approaches. Safety will be assessed by monitoring&#xD;
      of specific conditions such as skin integrity, pain, and spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that locomotor training using adaptive robotics such as&#xD;
      the Cyberdyne HAL (5x/week for 12 weeks, 60 sessions, 2 hours each) is efficacious for&#xD;
      improving walking function in adults with chronic incomplete SCIs. Walking function may be&#xD;
      assessed using standard clinical tests to measure walking speed and walking endurance. A&#xD;
      battery of clinical tests (listed in Outcome Measures) will be selected for use based on each&#xD;
      participant's functional capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the aims of the study, the investigators will use a pre-post repeated measures&#xD;
      study design. Following phone and in-person screenings and physician approval, individuals&#xD;
      will provide informed consent to the study procedures. Non-invasive tests of physical&#xD;
      function and health will be conducted prior to and following 60 sessions of locomotor&#xD;
      training using the HAL, an adaptive robotic device that is custom fitted to each individual&#xD;
      to provide assistance to the lower limbs during locomotor training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment: Individuals with chronic SCI (&gt;1 year) who meet the given enrollment&#xD;
      criteria (see inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be included for this study. Recruitment&#xD;
      will occur from within the Brooks Health System which includes the Brooks Cybernic Treatment&#xD;
      Center, as well as from their healthcare providers and advertisements in the community.&#xD;
