      Background/Rationale Acute rejection (AR) is common in the first year after lung&#xD;
      transplantation. AR has usually been reversible with treatment, but it can trigger chronic&#xD;
      rejection that is the leading causes of late morbidity and mortality. Extracorporeal&#xD;
      photopheresis (ECP) has emerged as a promising treatment for chronic rejection. The&#xD;
      investigators postulate that the immunoregulatory property of ECP could promote graft&#xD;
      tolerance immediately after lung transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ECP as induction&#xD;
      therapy for prevention of AR in recipients affected with cystic fibrosis in the first year&#xD;
      after lung transplantation. The extracellular vesicles in the cell-to-cell communication and&#xD;
      immunomodulation will be also investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results (personal) A preliminary study, conducted in Vienna, demonstrated that 9&#xD;
      patients treated with ECP as induction therapy had 0% of chronic rejection versus 50% in the&#xD;
      control group. The Institution hosting the current project is among largest lung&#xD;
      transplantation centers in Italy with high rate of cystic fibrosis recipients. The&#xD;
      Institution has experience in ECP and a dedicated instrument was specifically bought for the&#xD;
      project. Internal collaborators have strong expertise in biological aspects including the&#xD;
      extracellular vesicle compartment.&#xD;

      The aim of this pilot trial is evaluate the efficacy and safety of ECP as induction therapy&#xD;
      for prevention of AR in recipients affected of cystic fibrosis in the first year after lung&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators postulate that ECP could induce graft immunotolerance avoiding the&#xD;
      development of chronic rejection. Exposing T-cells to ultraviolet light results in DNA damage&#xD;
      and apoptosis; such form of cell death does not typically stimulate a prolonged inflammatory&#xD;
      cascade. When re-infused to the patient, apoptotic T-cells are surrounded by antigen&#xD;
      presenting cells (APCs). The large number of APCs encircling the damaged T-cells limits the&#xD;
      inflammatory response and stimulates specific signalling cascades in APCs that result in&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokine production; finally, immature dendritic cells could gain&#xD;
      tolerogenic phenotypes. Based on this process, a theory postulates that the immuno-modulation&#xD;
      secondary to ECP is related to a general increase in regulatory T-cells that cause a&#xD;
      down-regulation of immune responses involved in chronic rejection onset. Another theory&#xD;
      assumes that suppressor T-cells may acquire anti-clonal immunity prompted by the APCs;&#xD;
      therefore, a sort of T-cell vaccination is the result of leukocyte apoptosis. The intention&#xD;
      is to use this T-cell regulation to induce immunotolerance toward the graft before the&#xD;
      development of chronic rejection, in spite to operate when the damage is in progress. To&#xD;
      activate this effect from the first hours after transplantation, it can be useful the&#xD;
      immunomodulatory activity of extracorporeal photopheresis, already established by clinical&#xD;
      studies applied to the treatment of acute and chronic rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of ECP as induction therapy will be measured with the identification of AR rate&#xD;
      in the study group versus the control group. AR is diagnosed with trans-bronchial biopsy and&#xD;
      graded using standard histological criteria: A0 (none), A1 (minimal), A2 (mild), A3&#xD;
      (moderate) or A4 (severe). A stable 10% decrease of forced expiratory volume in 1 second&#xD;
      (FEV1) on baseline will be considered as AR even though trans-bronchial biopsy is not&#xD;
      available. In addition, lymphocyte immunophenotype (with particular regard to CD4 + and CD25&#xD;
      +), the cytokine profile (interleukine (IL) 4, IL-10, IL-12 measured by High Resolution&#xD;
      Cytokines Array) and the extracellular vesicles content are tested to assess the therapeutic&#xD;
      response. Finally, anti-HLA antibodies are tested to understand their dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECP safety is assessed by recording every adverse effect with specific attention to&#xD;
      opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this study aims to verify whether the induction therapy with ECP can&#xD;
      dramatically decrease the rate of acute rejection in order to impact positively on the main&#xD;
      cause of mortality in lung transplantation: the chronic rejection.&#xD;
