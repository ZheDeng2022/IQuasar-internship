  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A reflectance confocal microscope is a machine which is able to examine the upper layers of&#xD;
      the skin painlessly and without the need for taking a biopsy. We would like to examine the&#xD;
      images taken by the confocal microscope to see if it can help more accurately identify&#xD;
      lesions which are worrying rather than a benign mole. We are performing this study in&#xD;
      patients in whom we have recommended excising a mole to exclude a cancer. If the results of&#xD;
      the study show that the confocal microscope can help more accurately diagnose Melanomas then&#xD;
      this would reduce the number of biopsies that are taken that turn out not to be cancerous (ie&#xD;
      unnecessary biopsies).&#xD;

      Study Design This is an observational, non-randomised, non-controlled, prospective cohort&#xD;
      study to look at the efficacy of in vivo RCM as a diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of MM and&#xD;
      LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints The hypothesis of this study is that the use of RCM is would reduce the NNE&#xD;
      prior to definitive treatment by at least 30% from the current value of approximately 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis is that the intra- &amp; inter-observer agreement for interpreting the&#xD;
      RCM images will have kappa scores 0.6 or greater (indicating good agreement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and recruitment Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Skin&#xD;
      Care Network Barnet, and from the outpatient clinics of the Chase Farm and Barnet sites of&#xD;
      Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The number of true negative lesions examined in this study will be 654. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that this will result in a total of 661 lesions being recruited. 10% of&#xD;
      participants are expected to have more than one lesion sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of biopsy for each lesion will not be known until after the lesion has been&#xD;
      included in the study. Therefore lesions will be added to the study until the required number&#xD;
      of true negatives has been included.&#xD;
