      Background (brief):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Burden: Abnormal prolonged labour and its effects are important contributors to maternal&#xD;
           and perinatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Although the partograph has been shown&#xD;
           to be an efficacious tool for monitoring labor and identifying women in need of an&#xD;
           comprehensive emergency obstetric intervention, it's appropriate use is questionable&#xD;
           throughout the world. Evidence suggests that very few service provider use partograph&#xD;
           despite recognizing its usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge gap: In Bangladesh partograph is hardly used by the concern person though its&#xD;
           importance and positive outcome is acknowledged at the national level. To introduce a&#xD;
           digital partograph Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and&#xD;
           Obstetrics (Jhpiego) developed an ePartogram device and WHO created partograph&#xD;
           e-Learning tool. Jhpiego is currently testing three ePartogram implementations. However,&#xD;
           till today, no data has been collected or analysed for any of these ePartogram models.&#xD;
           The WHO e-Learning tool has been distributed to facilities like Kenyatta National&#xD;
           Hospital via CD-ROM. In Kenya, a study also being conducted using a digital partograph&#xD;
           (partopen) and results are yet to come.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relevance: The use of the paper partograph is found to be complex and too much&#xD;
           time-consuming for effective use in low-resource settings where there has been&#xD;
           inadequate health care staffing. These challenges highlight a need for strengthening&#xD;
           providers' skills and/or developing new technologies that are suitable for low-resource&#xD;
           countries and promote consistent, correct use of the partograph as well as, a labour&#xD;
           monitoring system for the peripheral level health facilities. The benefits of this&#xD;
           device are: ease of use, minimal training requirements, improved data quality and&#xD;
           capture, and seamless integration into current local practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The current study aims-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the feasibility, acceptability of digital partograph use among health service&#xD;
           providers in selected district hospitals in Bangladesh;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the user rate between paper and digital partograph during labour monitoring&#xD;
           process in district hospitals in Bangladesh;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the outcome of paper and digital partograph use in respect to the birth&#xD;
           asphyxia and prolonged labour rate after introducing digital partograph in selected&#xD;
           district hospitals in Bangladesh;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the barriers and facilitating factors of introducing electronic partograph&#xD;
           in district hospital in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A mixed-method prospective follow-up study with crossover design will be conducted&#xD;
      in two DHs. One DH will serve as intervention (electronic partograph) hospital and another as&#xD;
      control hospital (paper-based partograph). After applying the crossover design this&#xD;
      allocation will be reversed. The total study will be completed within 18 months period.&#xD;
      Nurse-midwives posted in obstetric wards will be the study participants. The sample size in&#xD;
      each DH will be 506 mothers who will deliver their baby during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility and acceptability of digital partograph use will be assessed among health&#xD;
           service providers in selected DH in Bangladesh;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The user rate of digital partograph will be estimated during labour monitoring process&#xD;
           in DHs in Bangladesh;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The birth asphyxia and prolonged labour rate will be estimated after introducing digital&#xD;
           partograph in selected DHs in Bangladesh;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The barriers and facilitating factors of introducing electronic partograph will be&#xD;
           determined in DHs in Bangladesh.&#xD;

      Study design, site and duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, follow-up crossover study design was used. Two secondary level referral&#xD;
      hospitals in Jessore and Kushtia districts were selected as study sites. The selected&#xD;
      facilities were similar in terms of infrastructure, human resources, and service delivery&#xD;
      scenarios to typical district hospitals and were thus representative of public hospitals in&#xD;
      Bangladesh. However, there were a few differences in the number of c-section and stillbirth&#xD;
      rates in between two study hospitals. The crossover study design adopted under this study was&#xD;
      designed to minimize the impact of this non-similarity on the study outcomes. The same&#xD;
      facility was served as its own control at different time point in time. The study was&#xD;
      conducted in two phases with an intervening pause period. During the first phase, an&#xD;
      electronic partograph was used in Kushtia district hospital and a paper based partograph was&#xD;
      used in Jessore district hospital. Both of these hospitals were being crossed to alternate&#xD;
      partograph tool after the pause period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse-midwives from each hospital posted in obstetric wards were the user who observed&#xD;
      the calculated deliveries (N=506 for each facility) during the study period. Each participant&#xD;
      attended a two-day long training to become acquainted with the respective partograph that&#xD;
      they would be utilizing in the first phase of the study. Another training session was also&#xD;
      arranged during the pause period. Clinical parameters recorded in the partograph were&#xD;
      validated by the project appointed research assistants with midwifery qualifications who&#xD;
      observed labor progression and deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were completed on the basis of existing prevalence of partograph use&#xD;
      (17.1 %), and delivery outcome data related to paragraph use such as incidence of birth&#xD;
      asphyxia (22%) and prolonged labour (7%) . Sample size calculations also took into account&#xD;
      the refusal rate (10%) and design effects. Thus to observe the 50% improvement for all three&#xD;
      mentioned clinical parameters (increased use of partograph, decreased level of birth&#xD;
      asphyxia, and prolonged labour), the number of deliveries that needed to be observed were as&#xD;
      follows, 105, 216 and 506 respectively at 80% power and 5% significance level. Thus the final&#xD;
      sample size in each district hospital was taken as 506; half of the sample (253) before and&#xD;
      the other half (253) after applying the crossover design. Field data collection continued for&#xD;
      12 months and the data collectors tried to capture all deliveries until the required minimum&#xD;
      sample size was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Inclusion criteria for the study were women with spontaneous labour in the&#xD;
      first stage of labour with cervical dilatation in between 4-7 centimeters, singleton&#xD;
      pregnancy, gestation of at least 37 completed weeks, cephalic presentations, and no&#xD;
      additional complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Exclusion criteria for the study were women with ante partum hemorrhage,&#xD;
      breech presentation, multiple pregnancies, premature labour (before 37 weeks), eclampsia,&#xD;
      elective caesarean section, and induced labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expert obstetrician, who was also a study investigator, provided training to the nurses&#xD;
      and midwives. The basics for the paper and electronic partographs were essentially the same,&#xD;
      so the training methods were not vastly different. For the e-partograph, a junior programmer&#xD;
      was available by mobile phone, around-the-clock, to provide any instant trouble shooting or&#xD;
      feedback. In addition, the Android Tablet was used for implementing the digital partograph&#xD;
      study. Participants were also introduced to varying inconsistencies and errors they might&#xD;
      face when utilizing the e-partograph. The research assistants became expert users of the&#xD;
      e-partograph and facilitated the usage for the weak users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e-partograph: The electronic version of the partograph was a state-of-the-art application&#xD;
      that is accessed through smart phone or tablet pc or computer device. The application's user&#xD;
      interface (UI) is segmented; users will have to concentrate only on a single portion at a&#xD;
      time that would lessen the existing complexity of using paper-based partograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e-partograph application's user interface in Android programming language for smart tabs, and&#xD;
      in ASP.net with C# language for personal computers. The application has options to save the&#xD;
      data in local storage and in a remote central database storage concurrently. Local storage&#xD;
      contains data for temporarility; the remote server contains the data permanently which makes&#xD;
      the partograph information searchable at any time and place. This application allows&#xD;
      partograph data to be monitored remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing knowledge on how to use the paper and e-partograph was assessed for each&#xD;
      participant before the start of the training to understand the skill status of the&#xD;
      individuals. The training consisted of two days of intensive hands on training as well as a&#xD;
      refresher course that was organized six months after the first training to ensure that&#xD;
      participants would not forget the information. In order to measure user rates, rates of birth&#xD;
      asphyxia, and prolonged labour, record reviews generated by the partographs were collected&#xD;
      and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS 23 statistical software. The outcome variables were&#xD;
      use of the partograph and delivery outcomes (prolonged labour and birth asphyxia). The&#xD;
      independent variables covered maternal demographic and obstetric variables along with fetal&#xD;
      characteristics as well as partograph type and facility. Partograph was considered done when&#xD;
      it was correctly used for labour monitoring among the delivered women who fall under&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Prolonged labour was defined as labour extending more than 12 hours and&#xD;
      birth asphyxia was defined as an APGAR score less than 7 on the 5th minute after delivery.&#xD;
      Discrete variables were expressed as percentages and presented as frequency tables and cross&#xD;
      tabulations. Chi square (χ2) tests were employed to test the association between proportions&#xD;
      of respondents and type of partograph. Statistical significance was defined as p-values of&#xD;
      &lt;0.05. The data collected between the two groups was analyzed in such a way that a clear&#xD;
      comparison could be made between the user rate of different periods (before and after&#xD;
      applying the crossover design). Potential confounding factors were adjusted using binary&#xD;
      logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Review Committee (RRC) of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease&#xD;
      Research, Bangladesh (icddr, b) approved the technical part of the proposed study. Then the&#xD;
      Ethical Review Committee (ERC) of icddr, b who oversees the protection of human rights,&#xD;
      approved the study. In addition, informed consent was obtained from the hospital&#xD;
      administration, health workers, and the laboring mothers.&#xD;
