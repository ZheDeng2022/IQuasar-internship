      Many health-relevant decisions involve intertemporal (now vs. later) tradeoffs. Extensive&#xD;
      literature indicates that many negative health and financial consequences suffered in&#xD;
      mid-life are linked to adversity and disadvantage during early developmental periods of life.&#xD;
      Individuals who continue to engage in these types of unhealthy behaviors despite awareness of&#xD;
      the health consequences are exhibiting an inability to delay gratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delay discounting (DD) is quantified in human studies by determining the rate at which an&#xD;
      individual discounts a delayed reward, while executive function (EF) is defined as the set of&#xD;
      cognitive processes that are responsible for helping individuals manage life tasks and&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many health-relevant decisions involve intertemporal (now vs. later) tradeoffs, where&#xD;
      unhealthy choices involve immediate benefits and delayed costs, compared to healthy choices&#xD;
      with immediate costs and delayed benefits. Reinforcement for unhealthy behaviors are&#xD;
      immediate, while the reinforcement for healthier alternatives are delayed. Thus individuals&#xD;
      who continue to engage in these types of unhealthy behaviors despite awareness of the health&#xD;
      consequences are exhibiting an inability to delay gratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delay discounting (DD) is quantified in human studies by determining the rate at which an&#xD;
      individual discounts a delayed reward, typically assessed by having subjects choose between a&#xD;
      rewards available immediately and a larger reward available following a delay. For the&#xD;
      purpose of this study, the investigators define executive function (EF) as the set of&#xD;
      cognitive processes that are responsible for helping individuals manage life tasks and&#xD;
      achieve goals (e.g., planning, working memory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach of targeting preference for immediate rewards (exhibited by elevated DD) is&#xD;
      highly innovative. Multiple studies provide compelling evidence that strengthening EF may&#xD;
      decrease DD. Extensive literature indicates that many negative health and financial&#xD;
      consequences suffered in mid-life are linked to adversity and disadvantage during early&#xD;
      developmental periods of life. By targeting a mechanism of various negative aging-related&#xD;
      outcomes (elevated DD), the proposed research may have the novel impact on broadly&#xD;
      remediating the health and wellness of mid-life individuals at increased risk for poor&#xD;
      consequences due to early-life disadvantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will attempt to reduce Delay Discounting via Executive Functioning training in&#xD;
      a population of mid-life individuals with risk factors established during early-life&#xD;
      disadvantage. DD, EF, and associated health behaviors/outcomes will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      following training, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Participants will receive Active EF&#xD;
      training, or Control training. Given the established effect of Active training in reducing DD&#xD;
      in stimulant-dependent individuals, the study team expect reductions in DD, improvements in&#xD;
      EF, and improvements in associated health behaviors/outcomes following Active training and at&#xD;
      follow-up, with no improvements in the Control group.&#xD;
