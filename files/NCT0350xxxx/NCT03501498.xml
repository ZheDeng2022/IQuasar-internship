    <textblock>
      A study to determine the influence of changing intestinal transit time of the enterohepatic&#xD;
      recirculation of bile acids.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The digestion of food by human body starts from oral cavity and continues until its excreted&#xD;
      as faeces. There are different factors affecting this process. Important factors are movement&#xD;
      through the GI Tract, breakdown of food material and absorption by the body to produce&#xD;
      energy. The unabsorbed waste material is then excreted by the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different enzymes are produced by human body which are responsible for digestion of food. One&#xD;
      important chemical is bile which is produced in the gall bladder. It is important in&#xD;
      digestion of fatty foods but affects the movement of food material as well. There are&#xD;
      numerous bacteria present in human GI tract especially in mouth and large bowel which also&#xD;
      play an important role in process of digestion of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different conditions of health and disease can affect how food moves through the GI tract&#xD;
      (known as intestinal transit). It also affects the activity of different digestive enzymes&#xD;
      and chemicals in body. The bacterial population in the body is also affected by changes&#xD;
      described above. The purpose of this study is to observe how these different processes&#xD;
      especially the intestinal transit, bile salts and gut bacteria affect each other. This will&#xD;
      help to identify mechanisms responsible for different disorders of human gut like irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome. The study is part of an effort to identify new and future treatment of these&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Randomised cross-over study. Volunteers will be assessed at baseline, then after either taking loperamide or senna at the maximally tolerated dose for 2 days prior to the 'assessment period' then during the assessment period (5-7 days). After a washout period of at least 21 days, volunteers will then repeat the same assessments but cross over to take the second drug either loperamide or senna.</intervention_model_description>
