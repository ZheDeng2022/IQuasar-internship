    <textblock>
      The Gonda Vascular Center- Thrombophilia Clinic at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota&#xD;
      utilizes a standardized, guideline-directed, yet patient-oriented approach for treating&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE).This study is the ongoing registry of&#xD;
      clinical practice with standardized approach to patient assessment and therapy. As most of&#xD;
      registries it does not have any definite number of recruited subjects or the date of study&#xD;
      completion but provides anticipated number of recruited subjects and the time of anticipated&#xD;
      enrolment which was provided only because of formal requirement related to structure of&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov website. This number will be updated and upgraded as we continue this&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rates of VTE recurrence, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB)&#xD;
      and survival in patients treated with anticoagulation for acute VTE are assessed during&#xD;
      prospective observation. VTE cases include an acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of lower or&#xD;
      upper extremities, splanchnic veins, gonadal, renal, cerebral veins thrombosis and pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism (PE). Therapy includes the whole spectrum of FDA approved anticoagulants such as&#xD;
      &quot;classic&quot; agents: warfarin and heparinoids and the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)&#xD;
      such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When a patient has positive testing for acute VTE the radiologist interpreting the study&#xD;
      contacts the Thrombophilia Center and the patient is immediately evaluated. Standardized&#xD;
      information about guidelines endorsed anticoagulation therapy is provided in a uniform&#xD;
      fashion with a standardized script for providers and a short summary table for the patient.&#xD;
      This initial review also includes patient-specific cost information by contacting a pharmacy&#xD;
      service phone-line. Patients with cancer-related VTE are counselled regarding the guideline&#xD;
      endorsed use of low molecular heparin (LMWH) as the preferred option of anticoagulation and&#xD;
      available data on DOACs. After the shared decision making is complete, the prescription is&#xD;
      promptly filled at the pharmacy located within the same building, with the first dose&#xD;
      administered within the ensuing hour. For patients with acute VTE diagnosed after hours,&#xD;
      evaluation is accomplished in the Emergency Department; one dose of LMWH is administered and&#xD;
      the patient is referred the next day to the Thrombophilia Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with symptomatic PE or extensive symptomatic iliofemoral DVT are referred for prompt&#xD;
      hospitalization. While in the hospital, they are consulted by a Vascular Medicine service and&#xD;
      an appropriate follow up visit at the Thrombophilia Clinic is arranged. For patients with&#xD;
      asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic pulmonary embolism (simplified Pulmonary Embolism&#xD;
      Severity Index (PESI) score of 0), outpatient management is offered. All patients with&#xD;
      cancer-associated PE are referred for lower extremity duplex ultrasound, and if symptomatic&#xD;
      or if a central venous catheter is in place, also for upper extremity venous assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data are entered into a REDCap. The registry is maintained on&#xD;
      institutional servers, which are backed-up nightly and protected in controlled computer room&#xD;
      with uninterrupted power supplies, data will never reside on a desktop computer system.&#xD;
      Transfer of registry data will occur inside the Mayo Clinic firewall via our integrated high&#xD;
      speed network. Analysis will be done using the most current version of SAS® software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the most recent update, over 2775 patients were enrolled. These data are used to analyze&#xD;
      currently relevant clinical questions and are presented and published.&#xD;
