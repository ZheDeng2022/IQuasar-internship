  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to assess the needs, barriers, and knowledge gaps of hypertension&#xD;
      control programs in the national health care systems of the Central America 4 region LMIC&#xD;
      (CA-4: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua); to conduct a cluster randomized&#xD;
      trial to test the effect of a multilevel and multicomponent intervention program leveraging&#xD;
      an existing subnational primary healthcare system in Guatemala, on blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      control among hypertensive patients; and to evaluate the adaptability, feasibility, fidelity,&#xD;
      and sustainability of implementing the program in the primary health care systems of the CA-4&#xD;
      region. The comprehensive intervention, which includes protocol-based treatment using a&#xD;
      standard BP management algorithm, team-based collaborative care, BP audit and feedback, home&#xD;
      BP monitoring, and health coaching on antihypertensive medication adherence and lifestyle&#xD;
      modification, will last for 18 months. This implementation research study presents high&#xD;
      public health impact because it will generate urgently needed data on effective, practical,&#xD;
      and sustainable intervention strategies aimed at reducing BP related disease burden in&#xD;
      Central America and other low- and middle-income countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in hypertension prevention and treatment research, its prevalence is high&#xD;
      and increasing, while the proportions of hypertensive patients who are aware, treated, and&#xD;
      controlled are low, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The investigators&#xD;
      propose to: assess the needs, barriers, and knowledge gaps of hypertension control programs&#xD;
      in the national health care systems of the Central America 4 region LMIC (CA-4: Guatemala,&#xD;
      Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua); conduct a cluster randomized trial to test the effect&#xD;
      of a multilevel and multicomponent intervention program on blood pressure (BP) control among&#xD;
      Guatemalan hypertensive patients; and evaluate the adaptability, feasibility, fidelity, and&#xD;
      sustainability of implementing the program in the primary health care systems of the CA-4&#xD;
      region. The investigators will conduct formative research to assess the needs of system-wide&#xD;
      intervention programs, barriers and facilitators of BP control strategies, and knowledge gaps&#xD;
      about implementation for improving hypertension control in the CA-4 health care systems. The&#xD;
      proposed trial will recruit 1,770 study participants from 32 primary care districts (55&#xD;
      patients aged ≥22 years with uncontrolled hypertension/district) within a subnational primary&#xD;
      care network managed by the Guatemalan Ministry of Health. Sixteen health districts will be&#xD;
      assigned to an 18-month multicomponent intervention, which includes protocol-based treatment&#xD;
      using: a standard blood pressure (BP) management algorithm, team-based collaborative care, BP&#xD;
      audit and feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching on antihypertensive medication&#xD;
      adherence and lifestyle modification, and 16 to usual care. BP and other indicators will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and at months 6, 12, and 18. The primary clinical outcome is the&#xD;
      difference in the proportion of patients with controlled BP (&lt;140/90 mmHg) between the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups at 18 months. The secondary outcome is net change in systolic&#xD;
      and diastolic BP from baseline to 18 months. Fidelity of the intervention measured monthly by&#xD;
      intensification of treatment by provider-teams (titration or addition of new medications) and&#xD;
      adherence to medications in patients will be the primary implementation outcome. Other&#xD;
      implementation outcomes will be measured every 6 months. The RE-AIM framework will guide the&#xD;
      development, implementation, and assessment of the intervention, which will translate and&#xD;
      adapt the Hypertension Control Program in Argentina that has been proven effective and&#xD;
      feasible. This project have assembled a multidisciplinary investigative team, which will&#xD;
      collaborate with the public primary care network in Guatemala to conduct this implementation&#xD;
      research project. The intervention and study outcomes are patient-centered, and patients, MOH&#xD;
      provider-teams, and other stakeholders will be engaged at every step of the proposed study.&#xD;
      The investigators will disseminate the study findings and promote scale-up of the proven&#xD;
      effective intervention program, which will generate urgently needed data on effective,&#xD;
      adoptable, and sustainable intervention strategies aimed at reducing BP-related disease&#xD;
      burden in CA-4 and other low-income settings.&#xD;
