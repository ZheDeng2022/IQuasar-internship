      This study aimed to develop two poly herbal capsule formulations for arthritis through&#xD;
      granulation and conduction of their clinical trial in order to achieve quality, efficacy and&#xD;
      safety. Arthritis is a chronic disease of unknown cause. An inflammatory disease of the&#xD;
      synovium, it results in pain, stiffness, swelling, deformity and, eventually, loss of&#xD;
      function in the joints. Despite early detection, current treatment medications are limited in&#xD;
      their efficacy and are frequently toxic. Many patients look for complementary and alternative&#xD;
      medicine (CAM) options in coping with this debilitating disease. Research has indicated that&#xD;
      people suffering from chronic pain, as in arthritis, and those dissatisfied with current&#xD;
      treatment are very likely to seek alternative treatments, and an estimated 60-90% of persons&#xD;
      with arthritis use complementary and alternative medicines. Among the most widely used&#xD;
      treatments are chiropractic and herbal therapies. This growing interest in alternative&#xD;
      medical practices clearly indicates the need for more thorough investigation into the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of herbal medicine. Thousand years of traditional use can provide us with&#xD;
      valuable guidelines to the selection, preparation and application of herbal formulation. To&#xD;
      be accepted as viable alternative to modern medicine, the same vigorous method of scientific&#xD;
      and clinical validation must be applied to prove the safety and effectiveness of a&#xD;
      therapeutical product.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there are more than 100 different kinds of arthritis, the three most common are&#xD;
      gout, osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Gout occurs in response to the&#xD;
      presence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints, bones and soft tissues, and is usually&#xD;
      treated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intravenous colchicines,&#xD;
      and oral, intravenous or intraarticular glucocorticoids. All these drugs can abort acute&#xD;
      attacks, but they also may have severe side effects. OA results from articular cartilage&#xD;
      failure induced by a combination of genetic, metabolic, biochemical and biomechanical&#xD;
      factors. OA is normally treated with analgesics such as acetaminophen and opioids, NSAIDs,&#xD;
      and intraarticular therapies such as glucocorticoids and hyaluronans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In RA, 75% of the sufferers are women, suggesting the importance of hormones in the etiology&#xD;
      of the disease. Smoking and stress are also thought to contribute to this disease, which is&#xD;
      characterized by joint stiffness and swelling, often in a symmetrical pattern on both sides&#xD;
      of the body. The goals of management of patients with RA are to control pain and swelling,&#xD;
      delay disease progression, minimize disability, and improve quality of life. For pain control&#xD;
      and swelling, treatment includes analgesics such as acetaminophen and opioids, NSAIDs, and&#xD;
      intra-articular therapies such as glucocorticoids. In addition, disease modifying&#xD;
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to modify the clinical and radiological course of RA.&#xD;
      Examples include methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and newer&#xD;
      therapies such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a therapy (etanercept, infliximab and&#xD;
      adalimumab), anti-CD20 therapy (rituximab) and abatacept However, all of these agents are&#xD;
      associated with numerous side effects Promising evidence has been found for the effective use&#xD;
      of some herbal preparations in the treatment of arthritis. Furthermore, evidence suggesting&#xD;
      that some herbal preparations reduce consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It&#xD;
      has been evident that some herbal preparations (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F) monotherapy is&#xD;
      not inferior then methotrexate and in combination with methotrexate showed better result than&#xD;
      alone. In addition, adverse effect associated with trials of herbal preparation for arthritis&#xD;
      is not only fewer but also minor. Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine&#xD;
      treatments are remarkably successful in addressing not only chronic but acute health issues&#xD;
      as well. It is strongly perceived that different complementary and alternative medicine&#xD;
      treatments exerts their healing potential by influencing immune system.&#xD;

    <description>Allopurinol is used to treat gout and certain types of kidney stones. It is also used to prevent increased uric acid levels in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. These patients can have increased uric acid levels due to release of uric acid from the dying cancer cells. Allopurinol works by reducing the amount of uric acid made by the body. Increased uric acid levels can cause gout and kidney problems</description>
