  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of MRI imaging and image fusion in radiation therapy has dramatically increased&#xD;
      during the past decade. However, the existing MRI-imaging protocols, imaging software and&#xD;
      pulse sequences are all optimized for diagnostic purposes. With the introduction of the&#xD;
      MR-linac, there is a critical and imminent need to develop imaging protocols that build and&#xD;
      adapt the existing imaging parameters within the scope of the FDA-approved software to&#xD;
      acquire MRI images that have less geometric distortion and better spatial resolution.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate and optimize advanced magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging pulse sequences for&#xD;
           patients undergoing radiation treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the feasibility of using weekly MRI to assess anatomic and functional&#xD;
           treatment responses of tumors and critical organs during radiation therapy (RT), thus&#xD;
           enabling adaptive radiation therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To obtain imaging data and clinical data from participants, for additional research&#xD;
           focused on MRI use for radiation therapy, hypothesis-driven research protocols may&#xD;
           access;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To obtain MRI scans from healthy volunteers from the Department of Radiation Oncology.&#xD;
           These scans will be used to optimize scanning parameters for various body sites and to&#xD;
           identify appropriate positioning methods for future patient treatments.&#xD;
