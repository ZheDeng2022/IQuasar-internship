      This clinical trial evaluates the influenza virus vaccination in evaluating human immune&#xD;
      response in patients with lymphoma. Evaluating immune response may increase the understanding&#xD;
      of how the immune system changes when patients receive treatment for lymphomas by looking at&#xD;
      the antibody levels and the level of the different cells that make up the immune system over&#xD;
      time compared to those without lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the seroprotection and seroconversion rates after influenza or SARS-CoV2&#xD;
      vaccination in patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize virus-specific plasmablasts and memory B cells after vaccination in&#xD;
      patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the longevity of viral-specific humoral immunity to influenza virus in&#xD;
      patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the timing and strength of the peak immune response to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the effect of different lymphomas and treatment modalities in the immune&#xD;
      response to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 28, 90, 180, and&#xD;
      365.&#xD;
