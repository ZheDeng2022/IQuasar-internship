  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and potential effects of an&#xD;
      innovative, individualized electronic inpatient sexual health intervention (iRAP) for&#xD;
      adolescent females. The central hypothesis is that the electronic intervention, a sexual&#xD;
      health questionnaire with tailored feedback based on the Trans Theoretical Model (TTM) of&#xD;
      behavior change, will significantly increase adolescent females' requests for sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infection (STI) screening and sexual health management during their hospital&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are disproportionately common among 15-24 year-old&#xD;
      females, and can have detrimental effects including pelvic inflammatory disease and&#xD;
      infertility. Most STI's are asymptomatic, especially for females, making screening programs&#xD;
      essential. Current guidelines recommend HIV screening for all adolescents, and yearly&#xD;
      chlamydia and gonorrhea screening for sexually active females under 25 years-old. Yet only&#xD;
      one-third of primary care physicians report screening asymptomatic adolescents. Most&#xD;
      adolescents report no sexual health discussion during preventative healthcare visits.&#xD;
      Furthermore the majority do not regularly attend preventative healthcare visits. Therefore,&#xD;
      urgent healthcare visits, often in emergency departments (ED) and inpatient settings, provide&#xD;
      an important point of contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given adolescents infrequently obtain outpatient sexual health services, the inpatient stay&#xD;
      may serve as a critical intervention point. Other studies have found success with STI&#xD;
      screening programs in the ED; none to our knowledge examined the efficacy of an inpatient&#xD;
      sexual health screening protocol. Previous pilot data demonstrated, however, significant&#xD;
      interest in sexual health information and desire for STI testing among adolescents admitted&#xD;
      to a children's hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators conducted an exploratory study to evaluate the feasibility and potential&#xD;
      effects of an innovative, individualized electronic inpatient sexual health intervention&#xD;
      (iRAP) for adolescent females. The central hypothesis is that the electronic intervention,&#xD;
      based on the Trans Theoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change, will significantly increase&#xD;
      adolescent females' requests for STI screening and sexual health management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators enrolled 70 14-18 year-old, medically stable female inpatients admitted to the&#xD;
      hospitalist service at Hasbro Children's Hospital for a randomized control trial during a&#xD;
      one-year period. Participants were randomized to receive an electronic sexual risk assessment&#xD;
      with or without real-time tailored feedback. Feedback was based on the TTM, utilizing&#xD;
      readiness for change to determine appropriate messaging. Participants were then able to&#xD;
      electronically request sexual health management options, including STI testing, discussion&#xD;
      with their inpatient or outpatient physician, or technology-hosted information on&#xD;
      contraception. Investigators conducted a chart review of enrolled adolescents to determine if&#xD;
      sexual health topics were addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are examining participation rates, length of time to perform all study&#xD;
      elements, and proportion of teens that obtain requested service. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators are comparing participants' perceived reproductive health risk and uptake of&#xD;
      offered services between the intervention and control groups.&#xD;

    <description>All participants were able to request sexual health services while admitted to the hospital (options included: STI testing, speak with their MD, or watching contraception video). The services were offered using an electronic REDCap questionnaire, with prompt of &quot;Would you like to request X during your hospital stay?&quot; and response options of yes/no. The outcome will be assessed for each sexual health option (number of participants requesting STI testing, discussion with MD, or contraception video viewing) individually, as well as a variable created to show &quot;any uptake&quot; ie. request made for any one or more services.</description>
