    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of zolbetuzimab&#xD;
      as a single agent as assessed by an independent central reader. This study will also assess&#xD;
      the ORR and Progression Free Survival (PFS) of zolbetuximab in combination with mFOLFOX6&#xD;
      (with or without Nivolumab) and in combination with pembrolizumab, assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, assess the effects on CLDN18.2 expression and assess the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects of zolbetuximab as a single agent and in combination with mFOLFOX6&#xD;
      (with or without Nivolumab) and in combination with pembrolizumab. This study will also&#xD;
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of zolbetuximab, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil (5-FU), and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, evaluate health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), evaluate the Disease Control&#xD;
      Rate (DCR), Duration of Response (DOR), PFS of zolbetuximab as a single agent, in combination&#xD;
      with mFOLFOX6 (with or without Nivolumab) and in combination with pembrolizumab based on both&#xD;
      investigator and independent central reader assessment, assess Overall Survival (OS) of&#xD;
      zolbetuximab as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the antitumor activity of zolbetuximab, an Immunoglobulin (IgG1)&#xD;
      chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against CLDN18.2, in subjects with recurrent locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma whose tumors have&#xD;
      high or intermediate CLDN18.2 expression. For each cohort, the study consists of the&#xD;
      following periods: pre-screening; screening; treatment; and follow-up for disease&#xD;
      progression. In addition, there will be a survival follow-up period for Cohort 1A and Cohort&#xD;
      4B participants only. Tolerability of zolbetuximab in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      Japanese participant(s) will be evaluated in Cohort 3A DLT assessment. Tolerability of&#xD;
      zolbetuximab in combination with mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab in Japanese subject(s) will be&#xD;
      evaluated in Cohort 4B, if Japanese subjects are not enrolled in the Cohort 4A DLT&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a generic, preference-based measure of health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item self-reported measure of functioning and wellbeing, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. This questionnaire also records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples.</description>
