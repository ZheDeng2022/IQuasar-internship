      This study is a cross-sectional study to evaluate the relationship between coronary calcium&#xD;
      score and clinical parameters of asthma such as onset of disease, lung function parameter and&#xD;
      airway inflammation parameter (sputum eosinophil or FeNO) in Korean elderly asthma&#xD;
      (regardless of whether they have concomittent COPD or not) patients&#xD;

      Subjects who visited Allergy Clinic in SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center for asthma or ACO will&#xD;
      be recruited consecutively. Subjects who meets the inclusion criteria and agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will take coronary artery calcium scoring CT and asthma CT&#xD;
      (inspiration and expiration images). The correlation between the degree of coronary&#xD;
      calcification and airway diameter, airway wall thickness, air-trapping and emphysema will be&#xD;
      evaluated as well as clinical parameters of asthma. We will also compare those correlations&#xD;
      from the images of healthy control subjects who performed the coronary calcium scoring CT for&#xD;
      health checkup purpose.&#xD;
