  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sacroiliac(SI) joint pain can lead to long-lasting severe pain and reduce physical function.&#xD;
      It is shown to be the source of pain in 13-30% of patients with low back pain. Former&#xD;
      surgical techniques had a high level of complications and low success rates. Newer&#xD;
      mini-invasive surgical approaches have shown promising results in scientific studies. It is&#xD;
      difficult to find an adequate control group for surgery as most patients already have tried&#xD;
      conservative and alternative treatments without effect. A sham-designed study is the best&#xD;
      alternative. This study is designed as a prospective randomized double blinded controlled&#xD;
      mulitcenter trial. The investigators want to examine whether there is a difference in SI&#xD;
      joint pain in patients operated with miniinvasive arthrodesis of the SI joint compared to a&#xD;
      sham operated control group. Patients with SI joint pain are included. They will be&#xD;
      randomized to either surgery with arthrodesis or sham surgery. Neither patient nor health&#xD;
      personell who work with the patient after the surgery will know what has been done. The&#xD;
      primary end point for the study is group difference in sacroiliac joint pain on the operated&#xD;
      side after 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention Group receives operation with SI-joint arthrodesis with the iFuse implant. The patient undergoes full anesthesia. The procedure starts with an approximately 5cm long skin incision over the posterolateral aspect of the pelvis. A guide-pin is inserted over the sacroiliac joint at the desired entry-point, verified by fluoroscopy. The surgeons drills and boraches over the pin and the ifuse implant is inserted. This is repeated for a total of three implants. The wound is closed with non-resorbable suture. An injection of the SIJ with local anesthetic is performed under guidance of fluoroscopy at the time of the procedure.</description>

    <description>The sham operation will consist of the surgeon making the same skin incision as for an iFuse procedure, although nothing more, and then closing the wound.&#xD;
The patients undergoing a sham operation will be under general anesthesia for a random time of 20-40minutes in order to keep the two procedures as similar as possible.&#xD;
An injection of the SIJ with local anesthetic is performed under guidance of fluoroscopy at the time of the procedure.</description>

    <description>The Swedish patients will also undergo quantitative sensory testing at inclusion and at 6 month follow-up. At the same time they will undergo a cerebral MRI and a Functional MRI looking at activation of the CNS from pain in the sacroiliac joints induced by one leg lift. The purpose of this study is to look at contributing factors in treatment response. One hopes to map which CNS mechanisms are involved in causing the chronic pain these patients experience as well as how they respond to treatment.</description>
