      This phase Ib/II clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax and how&#xD;
      well it works when given together with vincristine liposomal in treating patients with T-cell&#xD;
      or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment.&#xD;
      Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine liposomal, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving venetoclax together with vincristine&#xD;
      liposomal may work better in treating patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of venetoclax in combination with vincristine&#xD;
      liposomal (liposomal vincristine) in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell and B-cell&#xD;
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). (Phase I) II. Safety assessment and toxicity&#xD;
      characterization after treatment of venetoclax in combination with liposomal vincristine in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell and B-cell ALL. (Phase I) III. To determine the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of venetoclax in combination with liposomal vincristine to induce&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) by day 70 in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell and B-cell&#xD;
      ALL. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression free survival, overall survival and toxicity after the&#xD;
      combination treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell and B-cell ALL. (Phase&#xD;
      II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if genetic signature as determined by next generation sequencing can predict&#xD;
      response to combination. (Phase II) II. To determine if immunophenotype of ALL is associated&#xD;
      with response to combination. (Phase II) III. To determine if the BH3 profile is associated&#xD;
      with response to combination. (Phase II) IV. To determine if relative expression of BCL-2&#xD;
      measure by flow cytometry is associated with response to combination. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of venetoclax, followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42 of course 1 and days&#xD;
      43-70 of course 2. Patients also receive vincristine liposomal intravenously (IV) weekly for&#xD;
      4 weeks starting on day 14 of course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.&#xD;
