      Study Title A post market registry of Abluminus® sirolimus eluting coronary stent system for&#xD;
      percutaneous intervention in patients with diabetes mellitus Purpose The purpose of this&#xD;
      registry is to prospectively capture clinical data of ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent in&#xD;
      patients with Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Device ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent consists of four components; a bare&#xD;
      metal stent (BMS), a delivery system, the bio absorbable polymer delivery matrix and&#xD;
      Abluminal surface coating on stent and parts of balloon in Pre-crimped condition the&#xD;
      anti-proliferative drug, Sirolimus.&#xD;

      patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Lesion Failure that is composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, and clinically indicated target lesion revascularisation within 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Components of the primary end point are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac Death: any death due to immediate cardiac cause, deaths related to the&#xD;
           procedure, unwitnessed death, and death of unknown cause.&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Era of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) started with plain old balloon&#xD;
           angioplasty (POBA) and progressed to bare metal stent (BMS) and then to drug-eluting&#xD;
           stent (DES). In DES, polymer was used in addition to the drug, so that it could hold the&#xD;
           drug on the stent platform and could facilitate controlled drug release. Thus, drug and&#xD;
           polymer became hallmark of DES [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Current DES consist of a metal stent platform and a therapeutic agent, which is either&#xD;
           directly immobilized on the stent surface or released from a polymer matrix. While&#xD;
           drug-eluting stents without surface polymer are available, the reduction in angiographic&#xD;
           and clinical restenosis is less potent and appears therefore less promising for clinical&#xD;
           utilization. In contrast, polymer-based, drug-eluting stents allow for controlled&#xD;
           release of therapeutic agents at the site of injury [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The most effective drugs utilized with drug-eluting stents for prevention of restenosis&#xD;
           up to this point in time have been Sirolimus and Paclitaxel. Both drugs are highly&#xD;
           lipophilic and show rapid and strong uptake in arterial wall tissue. In addition,&#xD;
           Sirolimus and paclitaxel have been shown to reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and&#xD;
           neo-intimal hyperplasia, the principal cause of restenosis after coronary stenting in&#xD;
           experimental models. Sirolimus and Paclitaxel have the same effect on cells&#xD;
           proliferation, but with a different mode of action.A recent meta-analysis of&#xD;
           drug-eluting stent trials confirmed the reduction in restenosis and repeat&#xD;
           revascularization procedures for polymer-based, drug-eluting stents. Moreover, the rates&#xD;
           of death and myocardial infarction were comparable to those with bare-metal stents,&#xD;
           attesting to the safety of these devices, which have been approved by the US Food and&#xD;
           Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with diabetes mellitus referred for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&#xD;
           represent one of the greatest challenges for the interventional cardiologist. Restenosis&#xD;
           continues to be the major limitation of PCI, particularly in patients with diabetes [2].&#xD;
           Restenosis rates after balloon angioplasty in diabetic patients can be very high (up to&#xD;
           63%), and although stenting has been shown to decrease these rates, diabetic patients&#xD;
           continue to have significantly higher restenosis rates and clinical events following&#xD;
           PCI. Slight elevations in fasting blood glucose levels, the need for insulin, and&#xD;
           suboptimal blood glucose control may have a significant impact on the prognosis.&#xD;
           Drug-eluting stents (DES) have been shown to have a considerably lower risk of&#xD;
           restenosis and as a result, there is growing interest in using such stents to treat&#xD;
           coronary lesions in complex scenarios. Sub studies carried out in diabetic patients from&#xD;
           large clinical trials conducted with DES have found considerable decreases in the risk&#xD;
           of restenosis and new revascularizations. [3,4] Nevertheless, despite the availability&#xD;
           use of DES, diabetic patients show a higher risk than non-diabetics.Hyperinsulinemia and&#xD;
           insulin resistance are implicated in a variety of molecular mechanisms that could&#xD;
           predispose diabetics to a higher incidence of restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this registry is to capture clinical data of ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting&#xD;
           stent in in real world, all come patients with Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Device Description&#xD;
&#xD;
           The device ABLUMINUS® Sirolimus eluting coronary stent integrates well known and&#xD;
           accepted Sirolimus drug on the proven CYGNUS Cobalt chromium platform with biodegradable&#xD;
           polymer matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The device ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system has a combination of inactive and&#xD;
           active component. The active component is Sirolimus drug. The inactive component is PLLA&#xD;
           polymer (biodegradable polymer). The polymer-drug combination is applied solely to a&#xD;
           unique abluminal coating technology known as &quot;ënvisõlution™ Technology&quot; which is a&#xD;
           highly effective drug delivery technology with target specific coating in abluminal&#xD;
           configuration on stent and parts of balloon. It also uses biodegradable polymer to&#xD;
           achieve longer drug release.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The stent platform is a thin strut (73 microns) of L605cobalt chromium stent with open&#xD;
           and closed cell (hybrid) design, which provides good radial strength and side branch&#xD;
           accessibility. The thin struts enhance the trackability and gives lower crossing profile&#xD;
           to the device for navigating through difficult and tortuous lesions. The delivery system&#xD;
           is a Rapid exchange (Rx) System.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is expected that ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system will significantly reduce&#xD;
           delay in healing and thrombosis events, while providing comparable results, regarding&#xD;
           restenosis, to other DES systems on the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Therapeutic Agent-Sirolimus Drug&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sirolimus is a cytostatic drug used for treatment of various disease in Humans. The drug&#xD;
           works on FKBP-12 protein and inhibits growth factor-simulated cell proliferation.&#xD;
           Sirolimus forms a complex with FKBP Protein that inhibits the cell cycle between G0 and&#xD;
           G1 phase. This results in interruption of the cascade governing cell growth, metabolism&#xD;
           and proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 STENT PLATFORM ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system is a combination product&#xD;
           comprised of two key components: the Stent (which includes the active pharmaceutical&#xD;
           ingredient (API) Sirolimus drug incorporated into a bio-degradable polymer coating), and&#xD;
           delivery catheter. A balloon expandable L605 chromium cobalt stent with bio-degradable&#xD;
           polymer coating containing Sirolimus drug is pre-mounted onto a highly deliverable&#xD;
           semi-compliant rapid exchange delivery system. The delivery catheter has two radiopaque&#xD;
           markers, which mark the ends of the stent to facilitate proper positioning and&#xD;
           placement. The catheter has hydrophilic coating facilitating easy delivery of the&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Stent has a biodegradable polymer matrix consisting of Poly L Lactic acid (PLLA)&#xD;
           which has been wide spread application in medical devices. The Poly lactic acid, its&#xD;
           co-polymers and mixtures have been evaluated in pre-clinical studies and clinical&#xD;
           studies around the world, revealing favourable bio-compatibility profile. The&#xD;
           bio-degradable polymer has been demonstrated to be safe when used as an implant or drug&#xD;
           release-control polymer for both animal and humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RISK ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. AIM OF THE REGISTRY&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this registry is to capture clinical data of ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting&#xD;
           stent in real world, all comer patients with Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. REGISTRY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prospective, Observational, Multi-center clinical registry to be conducted in Italy at&#xD;
           15 Interventional cardiology centers. 1000 patients will be enrolled and evaluated. All&#xD;
           the patients will be followed up for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Treatment Strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will determine the treatment strategy. It is recommended that each&#xD;
           enrolling investigator review the most recent IFU to assess contraindications, warnings,&#xD;
           and precautions for treating potential patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. ENDPOINT&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           Target Lesion Failure, which is composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, and clinically indicated target lesion revascularisation within 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Components of the primary end point are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Cardiac Death: any death due to immediate cardiac cause, deaths related to the&#xD;
           procedure, unwitnessed death, and death of unknown cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Target Vessel Myocardial infarction: categorized according to the Minnesota&#xD;
                electrocardiographic criteria (Q-wave and non-Q-wave). Spontaneous myocardial&#xD;
                infarction was defined as a typical rise and fall of creatinine kinase-MB fraction&#xD;
                or troponin in the presence of at least one of several conditions: ischemic&#xD;
                symptoms, new pathological Q waves, ischemic electrocardiographic changes, or&#xD;
                pathological evidence of acute myocardial infarction. Peri-procedural myocardial&#xD;
                infarction was defined as an increase in creatinine kinase to more than twice the&#xD;
                normal value with increased values of confirmatory biomarkers (creatinine kinase-MB&#xD;
                fraction or troponin higher than usual). Target-vessel-related myocardial&#xD;
                infarction was one related to the target vessel or that could not be clearly&#xD;
                related to another vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinically indicated target lesion revascularisation: any repeat percutaneous or&#xD;
                surgical intervention due to a stenosis or occlusion within the device of the index&#xD;
                procedure 5.2 Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stent thrombosis [Time Frame: 1 month, 12 months, yearly]: Definite and probable&#xD;
                stent thrombosis according to ARC definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cardiac death [Time Frame: 1 month, 12 months, yearly]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Target Vessel Myocardial infarction [Time Frame: 1 month, 12 months, yearly]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Target Lesion Revascularisation [Time Frame: 1 month, 12 months, yearly]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Device Success at 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lesion Success at 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Procedural Success at 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. REGISTRY POPULATION&#xD;

&#xD;
             8. Lesions not allowing a complete balloon inflation or stent deployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. REGISTRY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.1 Patient Information&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible patients will be informed about the registry and have to sign informed consent&#xD;
           before or after the procedure (see Appendix I: informed consent form).&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.2 Baseline Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           At inclusion into registry, the following routine examination, if performed, will be&#xD;
           captured:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Physical examination and relevant medical history; 2. Angina status; 3. Routine&#xD;
           laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry, blood sugar and&#xD;
           lipids, CK and/or CK-MB prior to the procedure. In case of acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
           or infarct extension we suggest CK and/or CK-MB immediately prior to the procedure and&#xD;
           serial measurements every 8 hours after the procedure until the peak CK level has been&#xD;
           defined 4. 12-lead electrocardiogram before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.3 Stent Implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the index procedure, only ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system will be&#xD;
           implanted. Using the instruction for use (IFU), provided with the device, the&#xD;
           investigator will choose the appropriate length and diameter of the stents to be&#xD;
           implanted by visual estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The choice of the length of the stent should ensure complete coverage of the lesion. If&#xD;
           more than one stent is implanted, at least 2 mm overlap should be achieved. In case of&#xD;
           insufficient stent expansion, the stent will be post-dilated with an appropriately sized&#xD;
           balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment of multiple target vessels (within the same procedure) and staged procedures&#xD;
           which occur within 90 days of the initial implant procedure are allowed. ABLUMINUS®&#xD;
           sirolimus eluting stent system implanted in non-target vessels after &gt; 90 days after the&#xD;
           initial implant procedure will not be followed under the ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting&#xD;
           stent system registry protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As such, any subsequent treatment of the lesion already present at the time of baseline&#xD;
           procedure will be considered as a staged procedure, instead of a repeat PCI. In the CRF&#xD;
           (Case Report Form), the investigator will complete a 'staged procedure' module&#xD;
           indicating that this lesion was present at the time of first procedure. The lesions&#xD;
           diagnosed and treated at the later stages will not be considered as &quot;repeat&quot;&#xD;
           revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each individual lesion treated, a separate lesion form in the CRF needs to be&#xD;
           completed. Every vessel in which anABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system is&#xD;
           implanted (or in which an attempt to implant anABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system&#xD;
           is made) within 90 days of the initial implant procedure is considered a target vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For patient undergoing a staged procedure, the follow up schedule will be calculated&#xD;
           from the date of initial ABLUMINUS® sirolimus eluting stent system implant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8. ANTITHROMBOTIC TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre- procedure*: Aspirin 75mg minimum;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients without any therapy: clopidogrel bisulphate: loading dose of 300-600mg per os&#xD;
           before or during the procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient on clopidogrel therapy (within 7 days prior) no loading dose required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ticagrelor or Prasugrel in the case of Acute Coronary Syndromes&#xD;
&#xD;
           During Procedure*: At least 5000IE or 70-100IE/Kg unfractioned heparin to maintain an&#xD;
           ACT &gt; 250 seconds during the procedure.**&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-procedure*: DAPT Therapy for at least 6 months (IFU), or longer according to&#xD;
           current Guidelines Aspirin 75mg per os life long.&#xD;
&#xD;
           *Or according to standard clinical practice. / **The use of GP IIB/ IIIA inhibitors is&#xD;
           left to the discretion of the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9. FOLLOW-UP PERIOD&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be followed after hospital discharge up to 5 years after the index&#xD;
           procedure. This includes telephone contacts to obtain information regarding medical&#xD;
           history, cardiovascular drug use, hospitalizations, and adverse events at 1 month, 6&#xD;
           months 12 months, and then yearly post procedure. Apart from clinical follow -ups there&#xD;
           is angiographic follow-up which is clinically driven (symptom driven).&#xD;
&#xD;
           10. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING&#xD;
&#xD;
           10.1 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
           An adverse event (AE) is report as serious which lead to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Life-threatening illness or injury, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In-patient or prolonged hospitalization (see note below), or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or&#xD;
                permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Note: For the purposes of this study, in-patient hospitalization is defined as the&#xD;
           subject being admitted to the hospital, with the exception of any planned&#xD;
           hospitalization for a pre-existing condition or a procedure required by the local&#xD;
           standard of care, which do not have to be reported as an SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All serious adverse events must be reported to the Principal Investigator within 24&#xD;
           hours of discovery or notification of the event and to the local EC, as per local&#xD;
           requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Principal Investigator is responsible for reporting adequate information on SAEs&#xD;
           that may be related to the study device to the regulatory authorities per country's&#xD;
           applicable reporting requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10.2 Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (USADE)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any serious adverse effect on the health or safety or any life-threatening problem or&#xD;
           death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not&#xD;
           previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational&#xD;
           plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other&#xD;
           unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights,&#xD;
           safety, or welfare of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects must be reported to the manufacturer as soon as&#xD;
           possible following the standard vigilance route. Reporting the event ONLY in the CRF is&#xD;
           not an option.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11. MACE ADJUDICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           All registry devices related Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) will be reviewed &amp;&#xD;
           classified by the treating physician. In case of a stent thrombosis or severe stent&#xD;
           restenosis, these events will verify the stent thrombosis &amp; determine the % Diameter&#xD;
           Stenosis (DS) by QCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           12.1 Analysis Population All patients who are successfully registered will be included&#xD;
           in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12.2 Sample Size Calculations and Assumptions Being this an observational registry&#xD;
           aiming at quantifying effect estimates without direct comparisons to literature&#xD;
           benchmarks, we proceeded without a formal power analysis. As the main analysis is a&#xD;
           pooled analysis of all included patients, an overall and comprehensive analysis is&#xD;
           planned as the primary analytical approach to reflect real-world patients and practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12.3 Statistical Analyses Continuous endpoints will be summarized by presenting the&#xD;
           total number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.&#xD;
           Tabulation of categorical parameters will include counts and percentages. Survival&#xD;
           analysis will be performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical inference will be&#xD;
           based on the computation of 95% confidence intervals using the adjusted Wald method.&#xD;
           Additional analyses will involve key subgroups defined according to baseline and&#xD;
           procedural features, with statistical significance set at the 5% 2-tailed level.&#xD;
           Specifically, Student t, Fisher exact, and log-rank tests will be used for such&#xD;
           bivariate analyses, whereas multivariable linear regression, logistic regression, and&#xD;
           Cox proportional hazard analyses will be used to adjust for confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           13. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
           13.1 Quality Assurance The Principal Investigator of the Centre is responsible for the&#xD;
           overall clinical management of patients admitted to his center, and assumes global&#xD;
           responsibilities for him and his staff and the data obtained from study participants; he&#xD;
           ensures compliance with the protocol, laws and regulations, ensures informed consent to&#xD;
           be signed and that the CRF is accurate and complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In accordance with Italian law and the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigators and the&#xD;
           institution will allow representatives of regulatory agencies and Ethics Committee&#xD;
           direct access for review of the original documentation of patients, to verify compliance&#xD;
           with the procedures and the veracity of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           13.2 Source Data The investigator assures that medical files are appropriately stored&#xD;
           and completed. Each follow up contact will be reported in the source data &amp; should at&#xD;
           least contain the information collected by the registry. The investigator assures that&#xD;
           medical files and case record forms are accessible for inspection by Competent&#xD;
           Authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           13.3 Monitoring The study will be performed according to &quot;good clinical practice &quot;. The&#xD;
           collection of personal, procedural and clinical data of patients must take place into&#xD;
           the electronic CRF, to which will only have access the individual investigators and the&#xD;
           study principal investigator (Dr Luca Testa) as &quot;administrator &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           13.4 Publication policy All study investigators are committed to publishing the results&#xD;
           at both conferences and international journals. The P.I. of the study will have the&#xD;
           right to present the main results before other investigators and will be the owner of&#xD;
           the data. After obtaining the consent of the P.I., the other experimenters will publish&#xD;
           and present the full or partial results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All investigators undertake to publish the study results, whether they are positive,&#xD;
           negative, or unexpected.&#xD;
&#xD;
