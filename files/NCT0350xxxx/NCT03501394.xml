  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women. To treat locally advanced breast&#xD;
      cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is often carried out before surgery to reduce the&#xD;
      tumour size to allow breast conservation surgery. However, treatment response for individual&#xD;
      patients varies, where the tumour may not respond to treatment and the quality of patient&#xD;
      care is compromised if the NACT treatment plan is not optimised. Therefore, the assessment of&#xD;
      NACT efficacy is beneficial for the early identification of these patients and appropriate&#xD;
      management of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast tumours have unique features compared to healthy tissue, including abnormal tissue&#xD;
      structure and biochemical composition. With NACT there are specific changes to such tumour&#xD;
      features indicating tumour treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to establish how the changes to breast tumour features following&#xD;
      NACT treatment are seen in non-invasive imaging. This study will look at scans of breast&#xD;
      tumours using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Changes to tissue structure will be measured&#xD;
      by advanced diffusion MRI techniques and changes to tumour related biochemical substances&#xD;
      will be measured by advanced magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to assess if these techniques can provide information on the tumour treatment response&#xD;
      following subsequent rounds of NACT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this longitudinal study, 25 patients undergoing NACT will be recruited for four repeated&#xD;
      MRI investigations over the course of NACT treatment. Magnetic resonance (MR) measurements of&#xD;
      tissue microstructure and biochemical composition will be compared against histological&#xD;
      measurements and radiological assessments of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit patients undergoing treatment at the NHS Grampian. This research is&#xD;
      funded by Friends of ANCHOR, Tenovus Scotland Grampian and the NHS Grampian Endowment&#xD;
      Research Fund.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single group longitudinal study, the investigators propose that functional images&#xD;
      from magnetic resonance (MR) methods performed at baseline and after 6 cycles of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (NACT) are in agreement with histological findings from pre-treatment biopsy and&#xD;
      post-treatment surgically excised tissue. MR methods will be performed at baseline&#xD;
      (pre-treatment) and after the 1st, 3rd and 6th (post-treatment) cycles of NACT treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that specific physiological changes detected through MR methods are&#xD;
      a manifestation of tumour response to NACT confirmed by histology and radiological assessment&#xD;
      (Hypothesis 1). The investigators further hypothesise that early sensitivity to physiological&#xD;
      changes manifesting from tumour response to NACT can be revealed by MR measurements after the&#xD;
      first and third cycle of treatment (Hypothesis 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 1: Is there a difference in physiological parameters revealed by MR&#xD;
      measurements at baseline and after completion of NACT?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 2: Do the physiological measurements at the completion of NACT from MR&#xD;
      measures agree with histological findings?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 3: Is there a difference between MR measurements at baseline and after the&#xD;
      first and third cycle of NACT?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 4: Is there a difference in MR measurements at baseline, first and third&#xD;
      cycle of NACT, between positive treatment responders and non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR measurements will be compared against clinical and study specific results from&#xD;
      histological analysis and radiological assessment of MRI, mammography and ultrasound measures&#xD;
      of tumour treatment response. Information collected from a health questionnaire will&#xD;
      supplement interpretation of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the effects of NACT on specific aspects of tumour physiology, paired t-tests will be&#xD;
      performed on MR measures of lactate concentration, lipid composition and diffusion&#xD;
      parameters, between baseline and post-treatment assessments (Research Question 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the relationship between MR measurements and histology, correlation analysis will&#xD;
      be conducted between baseline and post-treatment assessments. MR measures will be correlated&#xD;
      against corresponding percentage changes in histological findings between biopsy and tumour&#xD;
      excision (Research Question 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate MR measures as early markers of NACT efficacy, paired t-tests will be carried out&#xD;
      between MR measures at pre-treatment and post 1st and 3rd cycles of NACT treatment (Research&#xD;
      Question 3), with independent group difference determined between responders and&#xD;
      non-responders (Research Question 4).&#xD;
