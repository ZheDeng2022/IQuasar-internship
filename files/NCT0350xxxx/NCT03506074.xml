  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary choices are influenced by several factors, including physiological, social or genetic&#xD;
      factors. Among these, flavor is the most important determinant modulating the preferences&#xD;
      versus specific foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flavor perception is the result from the sensory integration of taste and odor properties of&#xD;
      food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present study was to assess flavor abilities in a large population using a&#xD;
      validated perceptive test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol investigates flavor perception using the flavor test, a specific test to assess&#xD;
      the retro-nasal olfactory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decrease in taste and smell abilities can result in loss of appetite, inadequate dietary&#xD;
      intake and malnutrition. Several diseases and conditions have been associated with taste&#xD;
      disorders and a decline in gustatory function is very common in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flavor test was previously developed, validated and patented by our group. It consists of&#xD;
      a series of 20 aromatic extracts, corresponding to routine dietary use flavors for Italian&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each tastant, originally stored in a 30 mL amber bottle, is diluted in distilled water and&#xD;
      stored at 4 °C, then it is kept at room temperature for 20 min before administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An aliquot of approximately 0,5 mL of each tastant is administered in the oral cavity using a&#xD;
      3mL Transfer Pipet and left for approximately 5 seconds; the mouth is then rinsed twice with&#xD;
      distilled water before the administration of the following tastant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each administration, participants are invited to identify the aromatic by making a choice&#xD;
      from 5 proposed items. A total of 21 aromatics (including one blank) are administered&#xD;
      sequentially. The flavor score (FS) is calculated as the sum of correctly identified&#xD;
      aromatics and ranged from 0 to 21.&#xD;
