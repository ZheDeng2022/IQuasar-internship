    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of L-leucine (LEU) or different&#xD;
      protein supplements standardized to LEU (~3.0 g/serving) on changes in body composition,&#xD;
      strength, and histological attributes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Seventy-five&#xD;
      untrained, college-aged males (mean±SE; age=21±1 yr, body mass=79.2±0.3 kg) were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to an isocaloric, lipid-, and organoleptically-matched maltodextrin placebo (PLA,&#xD;
      n=15), LEU (n=14), whey protein concentrate (WPC, n=17), whey protein hydrolysate (WPH,&#xD;
      n=14), or soy protein concentrate (SPC, n=15) group. Participants performed whole-body&#xD;
      resistance training three days per week for 12 weeks while consuming supplements twice daily.&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle and subcutaneous (SQ) fat biopsies were obtained at baseline (T1) and ~72 h&#xD;
      following the last day of training (T39). Tissue samples were analyzed for changes in type I&#xD;
      and II fiber cross sectional area (CSA), non-fiber specific satellite cell count, and SQ&#xD;
      adipocyte CSA. On average, all supplement groups including PLA exhibited similar training&#xD;
      volumes and experienced statistically similar increases in total body skeletal muscle mass&#xD;
      determined by dual x-ray absorptiometry (+2.2 kg; time p=0.024) and type I and II fiber CSA&#xD;
      increases (+394 µm2 and +927 µm2; time p&lt;0.001 and 0.024, respectively). Notably, all groups&#xD;
      reported increasing Calorie intakes ~600-800 kcal/d from T1 to T39 (time p&lt;0.001), and all&#xD;
      groups consumed at least 1.1 g/kg/d of protein at T1 and 1.3 g/kg/d at T39. There was a&#xD;
      training, but no supplementation, effect regarding the reduction in SQ adipocyte CSA (-210&#xD;
      µm2; time p=0.001). Interestingly, satellite cell counts within the WPC (p&lt;0.05) and WPH&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05) groups were greater at T39 relative to T1. In summary, LEU or protein&#xD;
      supplementation (standardized to LEU content) does not provide added benefit in increasing&#xD;
      whole-body skeletal muscle mass or strength above PLA following 3 months of training in&#xD;
      previously untrained college-aged males that increase Calorie intakes with resistance&#xD;
      training and consume above the recommended daily intake of protein throughout training.&#xD;
      However, whey protein supplementation increases skeletal muscle satellite cell number in this&#xD;
      population, and this phenomena may promote more favorable training adaptations over more&#xD;
      prolonged periods.&#xD;

      OVERALL STUDY DESIGN The study design implemented was double-blinded and placebo-controlled.&#xD;
      Likewise, guidelines established by the CONSORT Transparent Reporting of Trials established&#xD;
      in 2010 (www.consort-statement.org) were followed. Participants were encouraged to refrain&#xD;
      from rigorous physical activity for 4-5 days prior to baseline testing (T1). For T1,&#xD;
      participants were instructed to report to the laboratory in a well-hydrated, 4-hour fasted&#xD;
      state whereby they were subjected to the following assessments: a) urine specific gravity, b)&#xD;
      height and body mass, c) body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)&#xD;
      (General Electric Lunar Prodigy enCORE, software version 10.50.086; Madison, WI, USA), d)&#xD;
      vastus lateralis thickness using ultrasonography (General Electric LOGIQ S7 Expert; Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA), e) venipuncture, f) percutaneous skeletal muscle biopsy collection from the vastus&#xD;
      lateralis, and g) a percutaneous SQ fat biopsy from the gluteal region. Two to three days&#xD;
      following T1, subjects reported back to the laboratory in a 4-hour fasted state for a second&#xD;
      visit (T2) whereby maximal force production capacity was assessed using an isometric&#xD;
      mid-thigh pull (IMTP) test, lower body strength was assessed using a three repetition maximum&#xD;
      (3-RM) squat, and upper body strength was assessed using a 3-RM bench press. Additionally,&#xD;
      during T2, subjects were familiarized with all lifts that were to be performed during the&#xD;
      training intervention. Following T2, subjects engaged in 12 weeks of resistance training and&#xD;
      supplementation. The last training bout (T38) consisted of IMTP as well as squat and bench&#xD;
      press 3-RM re-assessments in a 4-hour fasted state. Seventy two hours following T38, subjects&#xD;
      reported back to the laboratory in a 4-hour fasted state for post-testing (T39) which&#xD;
      consisted of all body composition, and blood and biopsy collection procedures noted for T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESISTANCE TRAINING PROTOCOL For visits 3-37 (T3-T37), a daily undulating periodization&#xD;
      training model was employed over the 12-week training period given that this model has been&#xD;
      shown to be more beneficial in eliciting greater increases in strength and hypertrophy than&#xD;
      traditional linear training models. Specifically, participants were instructed to perform&#xD;
      free-weighted barbell squats, bench press, deadlifts, and bent-over-rows for 4 sets of 10&#xD;
      repetitions (Monday or Tuesday), 6 sets of 4 repetitions (Wednesday or Thursday), and 5 sets&#xD;
      of 6 repetitions (Friday or Sunday). Immediately following each completed set, a rating of&#xD;
      perceived exertion score was acquired from each participant (scale: 1-10) in order to monitor&#xD;
      and progress each participant accordingly while minimizing the potential risk of injury. The&#xD;
      RPE scale was described to participants as the remaining number of repetitions that the&#xD;
      participant would be able to complete while employing good technique (i.e., 1 = 9 remaining&#xD;
      repetitions in reserve, 10 = 0 remaining repetitions in reserve). More information on&#xD;
      relative training intensities and progression can be found in Table 1. Participants were&#xD;
      instructed to attend all 36 resistance training sessions throughout the duration of the&#xD;
      study, but those that missed more than 4 sessions were not included in the analysis due to&#xD;
      lack of training compliance. All participants were supervised by laboratory personnel for&#xD;
      each training session to ensure that proper lifting technique was executed, and training&#xD;
      volumes for each session were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL As stated above, participants were assigned to ingest either a PLA,&#xD;
      LEU, WPC, WPH, or SPC supplement throughout the training intervention. On training days&#xD;
      (T3-T37), participants consumed an individually-packaged serving in ~500 ml of tap water&#xD;
      immediately following each training session under direct observation of the study personnel.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants were instructed to consume an individual serving within 30 min&#xD;
      prior to bedtime. On non-training days, participants were instructed to consume an individual&#xD;
      serving between a meal of their choosing and 30 min prior to bedtime. Supplements were&#xD;
      separated into individual ready-made supplement-coded packets for daily consumption, and&#xD;
      participants were given a 3-week supply. Study personnel collected and counted empty packets&#xD;
      from each participant every 3 weeks before the next 3-week supply was distributed.&#xD;
      Participants that did not consume &gt;80% were not included in the analysis due to lack of&#xD;
      compliance. Each supplement, except PLA, was formulated to provide ~3 g of leucine, per&#xD;
      serving. Furthermore, each supplement was formulated to yield similar amounts of total energy&#xD;
      (kcal) and fat (g), and was double-blinded to laboratory personnel and participants for&#xD;
      group, appearance, taste, texture, and packaging. The WPC supplement was formulated using an&#xD;
      agglomerated, 80% WPC (Hilmar™ 8010, Hilmar Ingredients; Hilmar, CA, USA). The WPH supplement&#xD;
      was formulated using an agglomerated, partially hydrolyzed [12.5% degree of hydrolysate&#xD;
      (12.5% DH), yielding approximately 67% of peptides as &lt;5 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular&#xD;
      weight] 80% whey protein concentrate (Hilmar™ 8360, Hilmar Ingredients); SPC used an&#xD;
      agglomerated, 80% soy protein concentrate (ALPHA® 5812, Solae, LLC; St. Louis, MO, USA); LEU&#xD;
      used an agglomerated, L-Leucine (L-Leucine USP, Glambia Nutritionals; Carlsbad, CA, USA) and&#xD;
      non-GMO, corn-derived maltodextrin (MALTRIN®-M100; Grain Processing Corporation; Muscantine,&#xD;
      IA, USA); and, the PLA group was formulated using maltodextrin (MALTRIN®-M100; Grain&#xD;
      Processing Corporation). All five supplements were manufactured at JW Nutritional, LLC&#xD;
      (Allen, TX, USA), a United States Food and Drug Administration cGMP-compliant facility&#xD;
      independently audited and pre-qualified by Obvium*Q, LLC (Phoenix, AZ, USA), a GMP regulatory&#xD;
      compliance firm. Personnel at JW Nutritional, LLC and a third-party organization (Lockwood,&#xD;
      LLC; Draper, UT, USA) formulated and maintained blinding of groups, and each supplement was&#xD;
      assigned a randomly generated item number. Manufacturing batch records for production of each&#xD;
      of the five supplements were reviewed by a trained, independent expert in dietary supplement&#xD;
      quality control and assurance before approval for use within the present study. All&#xD;
      supplements were independently validated for nutritional facts and total amino acids using&#xD;
      validated, approved methods at Covance Laboratories, Inc. (Madison, WI, USA), a pre-qualified&#xD;
      third-party analytical laboratory, and results reviewed by a third-party organization&#xD;
      (Lockwood, LLC) prior to the supplements being approved for use within the present study.&#xD;
      Once analysis was complete, a third-party organization (Lockwood, LLC) representative not&#xD;
      involved in the study released the code for all treatments.&#xD;
