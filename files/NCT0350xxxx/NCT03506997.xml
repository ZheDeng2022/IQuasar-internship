      PERSEUS1 is an open-label, single arm, phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients (Part A)&#xD;
      with a biomarker enrichment stage (Part B) if efficacy is shown in part A.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, single arm, phase II trial initially pursuing a two-stage Simon Minimax design.&#xD;
      The null hypothesis Po will be 0.20; the alternative hypothesis Pa will be 0.40 (type 1 error&#xD;
      will be 0.05 and type 2 error will be 0.10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with metastatic CRPC tumours characterised by high mutational load, high&#xD;
      microsatellite instability as established, for example, by the Promega MSI 1.2 analysis&#xD;
      system, or a DNA repair defect including loss of MMR, identified on archival or fresh tissue&#xD;
      biopsy specimens (through a TMG approved sequencing study e.g. the MAESTRO study) who have&#xD;
      either exhausted established active anticancer drugs, or preferred not to have established&#xD;
      agents, will be offered entry into the PERSEUS1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Part A is an open-label, single arm, two-stage Simon Minimax design phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Patients will continue their LHRH analogue therapy. This cohort will include 24&#xD;
      patients as the first stage of a two-stage Phase II. If more than 5 responses in these first&#xD;
      24 patients are reported then the study will proceed to stage 2. Anti-tumour activity will be&#xD;
      assessed (measured by response rates) by PSA, imaging assessments (CT &amp; bone scans or when&#xD;
      indicated whole body MRI) and CTC count measures. Whole Body MRI (WB-MRI) will be performed&#xD;
      instead of CT in patients with contraindications to CT contrast), or instead of bone scan in&#xD;
      patients with widespread bone disease at baseline thought to be non-evaluable by PCWG&#xD;
      criteria due to inability to reliably identify two new lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: This will enrol a further 21 patients to a total of 45 patients. Ineffectiveness&#xD;
      will be concluded if ≤5 and ≤13 responses are seen in the stage 1 and stage 2 respectively&#xD;
      and the null hypothesis will be rejected (i.e. further research would be warranted) if &gt;13&#xD;
      responses are reported from the first 45 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this Simon Minimax design the probability of early termination of this trial when the&#xD;
      true response probability (P0) is &lt;0.20 is 0.66.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Biomarker enrichment stage: If the null hypothesis is rejected (and with Sponsor&#xD;
      approval and confirmation of sufficient funding) the study will continue with stratified&#xD;
      recruitment into biomarker defined cohorts in order to increase the precision with which the&#xD;
      response rate can be estimated within mCRPC molecular subgroups of interest. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that approximately 55 patients will be included in Part B, which will make a&#xD;
      total of 100 mCRPC patients in part A and B together, including ≥9 patients for each of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) MMR defective mCRPC; B) High mutational load mCRPC without MMR defects; C) mCRPC with&#xD;
      deleterious homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair aberrations (BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, PALB2,&#xD;
      others); D) mCRPC with deleterious nucleotide excision repair (NER) aberrations; E) mCRPC&#xD;
      with deleterious base excision repair (BER) aberrations; F) mCRPC with deleterious&#xD;
      aberrations in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for more than one cohort is anticipated to be uncommon; where this occurs&#xD;
      &quot;allocation&quot; to a cohort will be determined in discussion with the CI based on initial&#xD;
      sequencing results and with priority given to driver (rather than sub-clonal) mutations.&#xD;
      Patients recruited in Part A will be retrospectively &quot;allocated&quot; to a cohort on the basis of&#xD;
      their initial sequencing data (reported prior to trial entry) prior to any response&#xD;
      assessments, for the purposes of analysis. Within each biomarker subgroup (A-F) this will&#xD;
      allow us to reject the probability of a &gt;30% response rate if we see no responses in&#xD;
      9-patients, with a 5% false negative risk (Gehan design). If ≥1 responses are seen in 9&#xD;
      patients in a subtype, recruitment will continue to that subtype with a further 20-25&#xD;
      patients such that the final estimate of the response rate has a standard error of 10%.&#xD;
      Response rates with confidence intervals will be reported for each subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of any safety concerns from the IDMC, recruitment will continue seamlessly&#xD;
      from Part A stage 1 to Part A stage 2 and from Part A stage 2 to the Part B biomarker&#xD;
      enrichment cohorts. It is possible that at the time of the Part A stage 1 and 2 overall&#xD;
      analysis (based on 45 patients), the graduation of some of the more common subgroups to the&#xD;
      enrichment phase will be known (e.g. if more than 1 response from 9 patients recruited to a&#xD;
      biomarker subgroup that cohort would continue to at least 20 patients). Conversely, if no&#xD;
      successes have been seen in 9 patients of a particular subtype, recruitment to that subtype&#xD;
      would not proceed to the enrichment stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biomarker defined cohorts may accrue at different rates related to genomic prevalence. At&#xD;
      each stop/go decision point (end of enrichment stage 1 in a particular cohort) overall&#xD;
      progress of all the ongoing enrichment cohorts will be reviewed by the IDMC/TSC. They will be&#xD;
      asked to advise on the value of continued accrual to the cohorts particularly in light of&#xD;
      slow recruitment.&#xD;

             prior to trial entry and for subsequent biomarker analysis. All patients must be&#xD;
             willing to have fresh biopsies to obtain tumour tissue for biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Identified high mutational load (defined as 11 or more mutations per targeted panel -&#xD;
             see Section 5.5 below) on next generation sequencing and/or a DNA repair defect that&#xD;
             can increase mutation load including MMR deficiency and/or high MSI by next generation&#xD;
             sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with no measurable disease and only widespread bone disease must have a CTC&#xD;
             count &gt;5.&#xD;

          8. At least 28-days washout at trial entry since the completion of prior therapy,&#xD;
             including major surgery, chemotherapy and other investigational agents. For hormonal&#xD;
             treatment and radiotherapy refer to the guidelines below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • At least 28-days since the completion of prior flutamide treatment. Patients whose&#xD;
             PSA did not decline in response to antiandrogens given as a second line or later&#xD;
             intervention will only require a 14-day washout prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 42-days since the completion of prior bicalutamide (Casodex) and&#xD;
                  nilutamide (Nilandron) treatment. Patients whose PSA did not decline for at least&#xD;
                  3-months in response to antiandrogens given as second line or later intervention&#xD;
                  will require only a 14-day washout period prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Surgically or medically castrated, with testosterone levels of &lt;50 ng/dL (&lt;2.0 nM). If&#xD;
             the patient is being treated with LHRH agonists (patient who have not undergone&#xD;
             orchiectomy), this therapy must have been initiated at least 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1&#xD;
             Day 1 and must be continued throughout the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
             • High dose of steroids (low dose of steroids as 10mg of prednisolone or equivalent&#xD;
             are allowed if the patient is not able to discontinue this treatment; patient needs to&#xD;
             be on a stable dose for at least 4-weeks before the enrolment);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cytotoxic agents (such as alkylating agents or antimetabolites);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antibodies (polyclonal antibodies; monoclonal antibodies different from&#xD;
                  pembrolizumab);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Drugs acting on immunophilins (cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other drugs (interferons, TNF binding proteins, mycophenolate). 14. History of&#xD;
                  any autoimmune disease: patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;

                  arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus&#xD;
                  erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]); CNS or&#xD;
                  motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome&#xD;
                  and myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis). Patients with controlled Graves'&#xD;
                  disease will be allowed.&#xD;

                  Known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
                  [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  17. History of congenital platelet function defect (e.g., Bernard-Soulier&#xD;

                  within 30 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients on a stable bisphosphonate&#xD;
                  regimen are eligible and may continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  20. Presence of a condition or situation, which, in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;
                  may put the patient at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may&#xD;
                  interfere significantly with the patient's participation in the study.&#xD;
