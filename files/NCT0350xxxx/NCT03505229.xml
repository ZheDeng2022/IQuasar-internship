  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the freedom from local failure at 12 months after Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SBRT). Also to assess the safety, efficacy and feasibility of SBRT in the treatment of high&#xD;
      risk localised pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed high risk localised&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, including patients with extrapancreatic extension (Stage&#xD;
      IIA), node positive (Stage IIB), borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      as defined by Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group (AGITG) guidelines. ECOG&#xD;
      performance status 0-1, suitable for chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a minimum of 2 months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using either an oxaliplatin- based&#xD;
      regimen (FOLFOX, FOLFIRINOX, mFOLFIRINOX)+/- immunotherapy/molecular agent or gemcitabine&#xD;
      based chemotherapy (eg gemcitabine / gemcitabine/abraxane). Participants will receive SBRT&#xD;
      (30-45Gray in 5 fractions over 2 weeks. Prior to SBRT, fiducial markers will be placed to aid&#xD;
      with image guidance during radiation delivery. Four weeks after completion of SBRT&#xD;
      participants will have re-staging using positron emission tomography (PET) and computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan. Participants will be discussed in the multidisciplinary team meeting&#xD;
      for consideration of surgery. Those considered to be resectable will proceed to have surgery&#xD;
      6-10 weeks post SBRT.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to SBRT, fiducial markers will be placed to aid with image guidance during radiation delivery. Fiducials will be inserted endoscopically (preferable) or intraoperatively. After this procedure, patients will have radiotherapy planning. During treatment, the fiducials will be used for registration with the images acquired during treatment (including kV fluoroscopy, MV or optical). The acquired images may be processed to determine fiducial location using KIM or MATT software from University of Sydney. SBRT 30-45Gray in 5 fractions will be given over 2 weeks.&#xD;
Four weeks after completion of SBRT participants will repeat a re-staging PET and CT scans. Those considered to be resectable will proceed to have surgery 6-10 weeks post SBRT.</description>
