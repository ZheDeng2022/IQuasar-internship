  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      CS1001 monotherapy for relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (rr-cHL)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects with rr-cHL who failed at least two prior lines of therapies are planned to&#xD;
      receive CS1001 1200 mg intravenous infusion every three weeks until progression of disease,&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity, consent withdrawn or death.The primary endpoint of this trial is&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by independent radiological review committee&#xD;
      (IRRC) based on Criteria for Response Assessment of Lymphoma: Lugano 2014 Classification.&#xD;
