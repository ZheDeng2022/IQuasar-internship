      A phase 2 non-randomized study to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      tucatinib and trastuzumab with capecitabine for the treatment of leptomeningeal metastases in&#xD;
      HER2-neu positive breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new treatment for patients with HER2+ metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer (MBC) with leptomeningeal disease (LMD). This is a rare and fast-growing form&#xD;
      of cancer. Leptomeningeal disease refers to the seeding of tumor cells to the leptomeninges&#xD;
      and dissemination in the cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are is no standard of care treatment for LMD. However, we think the&#xD;
      combination therapy will be safe and well-tolerated and may also improve survival. Blood and&#xD;
      spinal fluid samples will be collected to evaluate the effects on the body and the cancer,&#xD;
      which will help provide greater understanding to therapy response in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a two-stage design with the first stage including 15 subjects from up to ten&#xD;
      institutions nationwide. If it advances to the second stage based on the number of successes,&#xD;
      another 15 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
