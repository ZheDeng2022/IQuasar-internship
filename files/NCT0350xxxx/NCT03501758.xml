      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is remitting disease with a variable course. Predicting disease&#xD;
      relapse after remission is important for the adjustment of medical treatment. Ileocolonoscopy&#xD;
      is the best tool for doing this, but due to its invasiveness should be replaced by a method&#xD;
      better accepted by the patient. Gastrointestinal ultrasound (GIUS) could be such a method.The&#xD;
      PRELAPSE study will include UC patients who have been on maintenance anti-TNF therapy for at&#xD;
      one year or more and in clinical remission for the 3 past months at least in two centres,&#xD;
      Haukeland University Hospital and Ålesund Hospital. The infrastructure for recruiting these&#xD;
      patients has already been established in the BIOSTOP study (Protocol ID no: HMR2016-0.6 and&#xD;
      EudraCT (European Clinical Trials Database) no: 2016-001409-18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study if GIUS or individual US parameters can predict endoscopic relapse at follow up&#xD;
      examinations in a group of patients with ulcerative colitis in sustained clinical and&#xD;
      endoscopic remission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, longitudinal, explorative, observational multi-centric study for diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy Study population: Adult patients with histo-pathologically confirmed diagnosis of UC&#xD;
      between 18 and 80 years of age that have entered the BIOSTOP trial (Trial number: EudraCT:&#xD;
      2016-001409-18) will be considered for inclusion in the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to trans-abdominal gastrointestinal ultrasound and&#xD;
      ileocolonoscopy. Blood and faeces samples will be collected at one time point for measuring&#xD;
      relevant inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameter: Ultrasound measurements of the intestine of patients with ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and&#xD;
      group relatedness: All patients will be examined repeatedly with gastrointestinal ultrasound&#xD;
      (GIUS) and at certain time points with ileocolonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. As all these&#xD;
      procedures already are scheduled as a part of the BIOSTOP study the only extra burden for the&#xD;
      patients will be the ultrasound examination. GIUS is a safe procedure that uses high&#xD;
      frequency sound waves for the visualization of internal organs. The implementation of GIUS&#xD;
      for the assessment of disease activity in UC patients might result in a reduced need for&#xD;
      ileocolonoscopy, thereby reducing costs and the burden for patients. Compared to invasive&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures GIUS can be performed without preparation, which is an advantage for&#xD;
      the patients as treatment decisions can be made without delay. GIUS is also cheaper than&#xD;
      ileocolonoscopy, causes little discomfort and has few or no complications.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Introduction This protocol describes PRELAPSE, an explorative, prospective, longitudinal&#xD;
      observational study of diagnostic accuracy comparing trans-abdominal gastrointestinal&#xD;
      ultrasound (GIUS) with ileocolonoscopy for the assessment of disease activity in patients&#xD;
      with ulcerative colitis (UC) and with regards relapse as an outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Background Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation mostly limited to the colon mucosa. The diagnostic &quot;gold standard&quot; is&#xD;
      ileocolonoscopy and histologic examination of the biopsies. The disease has a variable cause&#xD;
      and objective diagnostic criteria are needed to evaluate disease activity (1, 2). Although,&#xD;
      the disease is mild in many patients some require biologic treatment with tumor necrosis&#xD;
      alpha receptor inhibitors (anti-TNFs). These are expensive drugs with potentially serious&#xD;
      adverse effects and patients should have repeated examinations to evaluate treatment effect.&#xD;
      Although ileocolonoscopy currently is the best method for objectively assessing disease&#xD;
      activity both bowel preparation and the examination causes patients considerable discomfort&#xD;
      (3, 4). Therefore, GIUS for the evaluation of disease activity could be a good alternative&#xD;
      for treatment follow up in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ulcerative colitis the term relapse is commonly used for a flare of symptoms in patients&#xD;
      previously in clinical remission. It can either occur in patient without ongoing treatment or&#xD;
      during maintenance treatment as a loss of treatment effect (5). Although increased stool&#xD;
      frequency, rectal bleeding and abnormal mucosa found by sigmoidoscopy were considered&#xD;
      important in defining relapse, a consensus was not reached in the definition in the 2nd ECCO&#xD;
      guidelines from 2012 (5). However, it was suggested that the criteria for relapse should be&#xD;
      predefined in clinical studies. Commonly, a combination of clinical scores and an endoscopic&#xD;
      score has been used for assessment of relapse in clinical trials (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of relapse after discontinuing anti-TNF treatment varies between 20-50% during the&#xD;
      first year (7-9). For patients receiving treatment with anti-TNF the rates of relapse is&#xD;
      about 10-30% (10, 11). Thus the overall risk of relapse in both populations is quite high. A&#xD;
      strategy for detecting relapse in the patients in an objective manner without discomfort and&#xD;
      lower cost and risk is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GIUS is a rapid, efficient, non-invasive and cheap imaging technique. It can be used for&#xD;
      diagnosing IBD and for determining the extent and location of disease (12). Longitudinal&#xD;
      studies have shown that GIUS can be used for monitoring the effect of therapy in IBD patients&#xD;
      (13-16) and is well accepted by the patients as a method for monitoring (17). However, only a&#xD;
      few studies have been performed that compare GIUS with endoscopy (13, 18-21). There is only&#xD;
      one prospective study looking at the detection of relapse and this suggest increased flow in&#xD;
      the inferior mesenteric artery associated with increased risk of relapse (22). Due to the&#xD;
      variability and the difficulty in obtaining these measurements they are clinically of little&#xD;
      use, however (23). A study using endoscopic ultrasound showed that oedema in rectal mucosa&#xD;
      was associated with increased risk of relapse (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies from our research group we have examined patients with familial GUCY2C&#xD;
      diarrhea syndrome (FGDS) (n=35) caused by an activating mutation encoding for guanylate&#xD;
      cyclase C (GC-C) receptor on the brush border of the intestinal cells (25, 26). This&#xD;
      activation leads to increased intracellular cGMP and to increased secretion of Cl- and HCO3-&#xD;
      leading to increased fluid intraluminal in gut. The GC-C receptor is activated by the&#xD;
      endogene hormones guanylin (GN) and uroguanylin (UGN), which can be measured as the&#xD;
      prohormones ProGN and ProUGN in plasma (27, 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of the FGDS patients have diarrhea (median 4 per day) and susceptibility to&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (20 % have Crohn's Disease). Unpublished results from our group&#xD;
      (von Volkmann et al) show that plasma levels of ProGN and ProUGN are significantly lower in&#xD;
      patients with FGDS and CD compared to a healthy age and gender matched group. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the investigators have found that the number of diarrhea in CD patients correlated negatively&#xD;
      with plasma levels of ProGN while there were no correlation between guanylins and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers such as fecal Calprotectin and CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings may suggest a link between the endogenous hormone regulation of guanylins and&#xD;
      diarrhea. The investigators speculate that decreased secretion of guanylins could counter&#xD;
      diarrhea, and therefore this study should evaluate if these peptides may be of importance&#xD;
      also in UC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Rational for the study and purpose The study will include UC patients whom have been on&#xD;
      maintenance anti-TNF therapy for at one year or more and in clinical remission for the 3 past&#xD;
      months at least. The patients will be included from the same patient population included in&#xD;
      the Biostop study (Protocol ID no: HMR2016-0.6 and EudraCT no: 2016-001409-18) in two&#xD;
      centers, Haukeland University Hospital and Ålesund Hospital. The infrastructure for&#xD;
      recruiting these patients has already been established and the parameters collected in the&#xD;
      BIOSTOP study can be accessed in the electronic patient journal and used in the PRELAPSE&#xD;
      study. These parameters include endoscopy, repeated simple symptom scoring (6-point Mayo&#xD;
      score) (29-32), blood chemistry, faecal calprotectin (33-36) and histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is explorative and aimed at finding ultrasound parameters that can be used&#xD;
      to predict the risk of relapse in patients in endoscopic remission and early predictors of&#xD;
      disease relapse during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in several previous important studies (3, 11, 37-40) mucosal healing is defined as a Mayo&#xD;
      endoscopic subscore (MES) &lt;2 and thus the outcome relapse is defined as MES ≥ 2. As some&#xD;
      argue that patients with a MES =0 fare better than those with MES=1 (41, 42) and others that&#xD;
      histological remission should be used as a reference (43-45), the investigators will also&#xD;
      examine these as exploratory outcomes (6, 35, 45-48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, monitoring by repeated symptom scoring and faecal calprotectin testing&#xD;
      will be evaluation tools before performing unscheduled rectosigmoidoscopy to confirm early&#xD;
      stages of true relapse defined as Mayo endoscopic score (MES) ≥2. At the discretion of the&#xD;
      responsible physician and in agreement with the patient, anti-inflammatory treatment will&#xD;
      then be intensified without delay as described in the BIOSTOP study. In the PRELAPSE study&#xD;
      the follow up will stop if a patient reaches the primary end-point in the 2 year follow up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the BIOSTOP study patients will be randomized to either continue or discontinue the&#xD;
      anti-TNF treatment at inclusion time. In PRELAPSE all patients will be included regardless of&#xD;
      which group they are randomized to. Differences between the groups with regards to ultrasound&#xD;
      appearance of relapse will be examined as an exploratory objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if GIUS or individual US parameters at baseline can predict endoscopic and&#xD;
           clinical relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess inter-observer variation of GIUS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if GIUS or individual US parameters at baseline can predict strict endoscopic&#xD;
           relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if GIUS or individual US parameters at baseline can predict histological&#xD;
           relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if GIUS or individual US parameters at relapse is different in patients with&#xD;
           and without maintenance treatment with anti-TNFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if GIUS or individual US parameters correlate with factors indicating relapse&#xD;
           such as histology score, CRP, calprotectin&#xD;
&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Overview of study design The PRELAPSE study is an exploratory, prospective, longitudinal,&#xD;
      multicentre trial that investigates the applicability of GIUS for the prediction of disease&#xD;
      relapse in UC patients compared to colonoscopy as the reference standard. 40 patients will be&#xD;
      included, total inclusion time will be 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an established diagnosis of ulcerative colitis that have been treated for a&#xD;
      minimum of one year with anti-TNF maintenance therapy and that have been in clinical&#xD;
      remission during the last 3 months are potential study patients. Eligibility criteria are&#xD;
      described in section 5.3 (Inclusion criteria) and 5.4 (Exclusion criteria) as in the&#xD;
      BIOSTOP-study. Finally, only patients who are included in BIOSTOP are eligible for inclusion&#xD;
      in PRELAPSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both patients discontinuing anti-TNF treatment and patients continuing treatment will be&#xD;
      included. The patients will follow the same scheduled and unscheduled regime as described in&#xD;
      the BIOSTOP protocol (Included)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: Estimated first patient enrolled: September 30th. 2017 Anticipated recruitment&#xD;
      period: September 30th. 2017 to 31stDes2019 Estimated date of last patients completed 31stDes&#xD;
      2021&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study follow up: 104 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint evaluation 104 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Location The study will be performed at the department medicine in Haukeland University&#xD;
      Hospital in Bergen and Ålesund Hospital, Ålesund.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Population (base) Adult male and female patients with an established diagnosis of&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis treated for minimum 1 year with anti-TNF maintenance therapy and in&#xD;
      clinical remission during the last 3 months. Patients will be included from two hospitals in&#xD;
      Norway (Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen and Ålesund Hospital in Ålesund.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Number of patients Forty patients are planned for inclusion in this study. The inclusion&#xD;
      period is estimated to last for two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since all the patients in the PRELAPSE study also will participate in the BIOSTOP study they&#xD;
      will follow the same treatment regime as they do BIOSTOP study. No treatment interventions&#xD;
      will be performed as result of participation in the PRELAPSE trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Study visits The regular study visits will be carried out by study nurse and study&#xD;
      investigator every 3 months the first year. The study investigator will perform the GIUS&#xD;
      while the study nurse performes the other tasks related to the study. After 12 months the&#xD;
      frequency of visits will bed reduced to one every 6 months. During the 2 years (104±4 weeks)&#xD;
      study period there will be 7 regular study visits, one baseline visit including&#xD;
      ileocolonoscopy, and 1 scheduled rectosigmoidoscopy at study end visit at 2 years. The&#xD;
      assessments performed at different visits are presented in section 8. Prior to inclusion,&#xD;
      assumed eligible patients will receive a letter with information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.1 Screening evaluation In the BIOPSTOP study patients with ulcerative colitis who fulfill&#xD;
      the criteria below and who fulfills the main inclusion criteria, can be scheduled for&#xD;
      baseline visit, which should be carried out after two consecutive faecal calprotectin within&#xD;
      the inclusion limits. The time frame between screening and baseline visit should not be&#xD;
      longer than 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-point MAYO score ≤ 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two consecutive faecal calprotectin tests &lt; 200mg/kg (Calpro)&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.2 Baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent the following assessments will be done in accordance with&#xD;
      the BIOSTOP-study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A &quot;baseline ileocolonoscopy&quot; A. If the Mayo endoscopic score (MES) is 0 or 1, the&#xD;
           patient can be included in the study Biopsies from rectum will be sent to a to central&#xD;
           laboratory for histological assessment (formalin fixed).&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. If the Mayo endoscopic score (MES) is &gt; 1, the patient can not be randomized. The&#xD;
           patients will be treated by responsible physician according to local and international&#xD;
           guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fasting plasma for ProGN and ProUGN as well as serum samples for local laboratory&#xD;
           analyses (CRP, Hb, platelet count, leucocyte count, and ferritin will be obtained.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study nurse/investigator assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Demographics (sex, birth date and ethnic origin) ii. Clinical status (medical history&#xD;
           including comorbidity, physical examination and vital signs, smoking history) iii. IBD&#xD;
           history (age at diagnosis, time from diagnosis to anti-TNF start, Montreal&#xD;
           classification, Mayo endoscopic score at diagnosis, previous antiinflammatory UC&#xD;
           treatment, need for anti-TNF dose escalation to achieve remission) iv. Concomitant&#xD;
           medication (immunomodulator, 5-aminosalisylates, other)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.3 Baseline gastrointestinal ultrasound Performed within 14 days before bowel preparation&#xD;
      before ilecolonoscopy starts or between 2-7 days after the ilecolonoscopy by study&#xD;
      investigator. Ultrasound cannot be performed in relation to to bowel preparation as this&#xD;
      theoretically could cause mucosal edema confounding the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.4 Regular visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled visit by study nurse in BIOSTOP study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-point Mayo scoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood and fecal samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting ProGN and ProUGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration of concomitant medication of any kind according to a patient&#xD;
           self-report-diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled examination in PRELAPSE study performed on the same day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Gastrointestinal ultrasound by study investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory samples for clinical chemistry and faecal analyses will be collected preferably on&#xD;
      the same day and not more than 7 days before or after every regular visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients on infliximab additional blood samples for drug concentration and anti drug&#xD;
      antibody measurements will be collected within 3 days before every scheduled treatment dose.&#xD;
      For patients on subcutaneously administered anti-TNFs samples for drug concentration and&#xD;
      antibody measurements will be collected at regular visits every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two years a scheduled rectosigmoidoscopy with biopsy specimens are performed in all&#xD;
      patients still in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.5 Unscheduled visit in case of disease worsening If the patient, study nurse or&#xD;
      investigator suspects disease worsening between or at regular visits, an unscheduled visit&#xD;
      including an additional faecal calprotectin test should be organized without delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.6 End of follow up period and end of study visit The end of the study visit will be&#xD;
      performed at or near week 104 ±4 (2 years) or when relapse occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.7 After End Follow-up Further treatment will be decided by the treating physician. 6.3&#xD;
      Criteria Defining Relapse 6.3.1 Indication for Unscheduled GIUS and Endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-point Mayo score ≥2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two consecutive faecal calprotectin measurements &gt;200mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the discretion of investigator or patient In order to verify disease relapse an&#xD;
           unscheduled rectosigmoidoscopy will be performed without delay. Disease relapse in this&#xD;
           study is defined as Mayo endoscopic (MES) ≥2. GIUS will be performed within 7 days&#xD;
           before preparation for the sigmoidoscopy or 2 days after and before a change in medical&#xD;
           treatment is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Procedures for relapse treatment If relapse is found the patient follow up in the&#xD;
      PRELAPSE study will stop. Ongoing treatment is dependent if the patient had continued the&#xD;
      anti-TNF treatment at the start of the study or not. Patient stopping anti-TNF treatment at&#xD;
      study start will follow the treatment algorithm as described in the BIOSTOP study. Patients&#xD;
      who continued anti-TNF treatment at study start, who during follow up years of the study&#xD;
      period are experiencing an endoscopically verified relapse, are considered to be treatment&#xD;
      failures and will be treated on an individual basis at the discretion of the responsible&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 Criteria for patient discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be discontinued from the study at any time. Specific reasons for discontinuing a&#xD;
      patient from this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Voluntary discontinuation by the patient who is at any time free to discontinue his/her&#xD;
           participation in the study, without prejudice to further treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major protocol deviation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incorrect enrolment i.e., the patient does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient lost to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6 Procedures for discontinuation 6.6.1 Patient Discontinuation Patients have the right to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. In the case that a patient decides to&#xD;
      prematurely withdraw from the study, he or she should be asked if they can still be contacted&#xD;
      for further information, so that a final evaluation can be made with an explanation of why&#xD;
      the patient is withdrawing from the study, including assessment of possible adverse events.&#xD;
      Although a subject is not obliged to give his or her reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely&#xD;
      from a trial, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s),&#xD;
      while fully respecting the subject's rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient withdraws from the study, the investigators should make an effort (if possible)&#xD;
      to do all assessment as if it was &quot;the end of study at 2 years&quot; - see flow trial flow chart&#xD;
      for details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6.2 Treatment discontinuation Patients who for some reason (e.g. pregnancy, reactions to&#xD;
      treatment, surgical interventions or other safety issues) must stop with anti TNF treatment&#xD;
      during the study will be asked to continue follow-up in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6.3 Trial discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole trial may be discontinued at the discretion of the PI in the event of any of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulties in the recruitment of patients The principal investigator will inform all&#xD;
           investigators, the relevant Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees of the&#xD;
           termination of the trial along with the reasons for such action. If the study is&#xD;
           terminated early on grounds of safety, the Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees&#xD;
           will be informed within 15 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.7 Laboratory tests Blood samples for clinical chemistry analyses will be collected and,&#xD;
      depending on availability, analysed at the local laboratory according to hospital procedures.&#xD;
      Faecal samples for calprotectin will be referred to a central laboratory for analysis (CALPRO&#xD;
      AS). Blood samples for measurements of drug concentrations and anti-drug antibodies, as well&#xD;
      of additional blood will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis and biobanking in&#xD;
      accordance with the BIOSTOP study. However, copies from the results of these analyses will be&#xD;
      sent to both hospitals in PRELAPSE study and made available to the primary investigators in&#xD;
      the electronic patient journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. ASSESSMENTS 7.1 Efficacy assessments 7.1.1 General Efficacy Assessments Inflammation&#xD;
      assessment by biochemical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following laboratory tests and faecal analyses will be recorded at all regular visits&#xD;
      according to the BIOSTOP study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood chemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haemoglobin, CRP, ferritin (analysed at local laboratories)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug levels anti-TNF and antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Faecal analyses: Calprotectin measurement (analysed at central laboratory, CALPRO AS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following laboratory test is exclusive for the PRELAPSE study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ProGN and ProUGN (analysed at Haukeland University Hospital) 7.1.2 Disease Specific&#xD;
           Efficacy Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mayo Score The Mayo score (49) consists of four components (rectal bleeding, stool&#xD;
           frequency, physician rating of disease activity, and mucosal appearance at endoscopy)&#xD;
           rated from 0-3 (Mayo endoscopic subscore, Appendix 14.2) that are summed to give a total&#xD;
           score that ranges from 0-12. The non-invasive 6-point Mayo score (29-32) does not&#xD;
           require either endoscopy or physician's rating, and thereby ranges from 0-6 (see&#xD;
           appendix 14.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical remission is defined as a 6-point Mayo score of ≤ 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.3 Determination of guanylines in EDTA plasma 3 ml EDTA full blood has to be obtained in a&#xD;
      fasting state and thereafter centrifuged at 1800 x g, 4 °C for 10 minutes. Plasma samples are&#xD;
      then frozen in aliquots of 250 µl and stored at -80 °C until analyzing. Plasma proGN and&#xD;
      proUGN concentrations are determined by using sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits&#xD;
      (BioVendor, Karasek, Czech Republic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Ålesund, the plasma aliquots can be stored temporary at -80°C until an appropriate number&#xD;
      of samples are collected and will be sent on dry ice to Haukeland University Hospital in&#xD;
      Bergen for long time storage and analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.4 Assessment with gastrointestinal ultrasound The main study parameter of this study is a&#xD;
      simplified ultrasound score based on a combination of bowel wall thickness (BWT) and&#xD;
      detection of vessels in the thickest area of the colon (See below and appendix 14.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters of this study are as seen with GIUS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colon wall thickness Colon wall vascularity Colon wall layer stratification Colon&#xD;
      haustrations Colon visibility Colonic content Relative submucosal thickness Lymph nodes Bowel&#xD;
      wall elasticity Free fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in these features are typical in ulcerative colitis and have been identified in&#xD;
      previous studies (13, 18, 19). The examinations will be performed by all collaboratorating&#xD;
      physicians in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Logiq E9 ultrasound machine (GE, Milwaukee, USA) will be used with the following ultrasound&#xD;
      transducers: C1-5 and C1-6 curved array and 9L linear array. The C1-5 will be used for&#xD;
      overview of the abdomen and the 9L for detailed examination of the GI wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency, focus and gain settings are optimised to get the best images in the patient. The&#xD;
      examination will be performed with the patient in the supine position. The large intestine&#xD;
      will be scanned by following its course from the terminal ileum to the rectum. All segments&#xD;
      (ileum, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum) will be&#xD;
      scanned in longitudinal and transverse sections. At least one brief cine loop (&lt;5 seconds)&#xD;
      will be obtained from each bowel segment, in each plane and annotated with text and/or&#xD;
      external markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colon wall thickness will be measured from, but not including, the central hyperechoic line&#xD;
      of the lumen to the end of the outer hypoechoic margin of the wall (representing the&#xD;
      muscularis propria). Cut off between normal and pathological bowel is defined as 3 mm except&#xD;
      in the rectum where the cut off is 4 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In areas of affected bowel (bowel wall thickness &gt;3 mm) colour Doppler measurements will be&#xD;
      made. The rectum will not be included as it is very deeply located. Each area scanned on the&#xD;
      B-mode exam is also examined with colour Doppler. Cine loops of 5 seconds are saved. The&#xD;
      colour Doppler measurements are performed with standardised presets on the transducer with a&#xD;
      velocity scale of 5 cm/s for detection of vessels with slow flow in the GI wall. Vessel&#xD;
      density with colour Doppler will be scored as 0=No or only single visible vessel,&#xD;
      1=scattered, spotted vessel signals, 2= scattered, elongated vessel signals, 3 confluent,&#xD;
      elongated vessel signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound score has been adopted from Parente et al (19), but adjusted and is defined as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound score: Findings on GIUS 0 BTW&lt;3 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BWT=3-4.9 mm and colour Doppler score 1 BWT=2-2.9 and colour Doppler score 2-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BWT=3-4.9 mm and colour Doppler score 3 BWT=3-7.9 mm and colour Doppler score 2 BWT≥&#xD;
           5-7.9 mm and colour Doppler score 1 BWT≥ 8 mm and colour Doppler score 0&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BWT≥5-7.9 and colour Doppler score 3 BWT≥ 8 if colour Doppler score 1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic accuracy of the ultrasound score will be investigated both for the cut off ≥1&#xD;
      and ≥2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally five wall layers can be seen in the GI wall with high frequency ultrasound. In the&#xD;
      anterior wall of the bowel and labelled from the lumen, the first layer is hyperechoic and&#xD;
      the interface echo between the luminal content and the mucosa. The second layer is hypoechoic&#xD;
      corresponding partially to the mucosa. The third layer is hyperechoic corresponding partially&#xD;
      to the submucosa. The fourth layer is hypoechoic corresponding partially to the proper&#xD;
      muscle. Finally, the fifth layer is hyperechoic corresponding to the interface echo between&#xD;
      the serosa and whichever structure is adjacent. If all layers are present, there is normal&#xD;
      stratification. Focal and diffuse loss of haustrations in the GI wall will be registered per&#xD;
      segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence or absence of haustrations, free fluid in the abdomen, colonic contents and normal&#xD;
      (short axis &lt;5mm) or enlarged lymph nodes (short axis ≥5mm) in the mesentery will also be&#xD;
      registered per segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elasticity of the bowel wall will be measured in kilopascal using shear wave elastography in&#xD;
      the subset of patients at Haukeland University Hospital (50, 51).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All registered parameters are shown in the form &quot;Ultrasound parameters&quot; (Appendix14.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.5 Inter-observer assessment of images and cine loops Measurements on recorded images and&#xD;
      cine loops will be performed by two observers for 20 patients randomly selected using&#xD;
      appropriate software for viewing and editing DICOM files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.6 Blinding The ultrasound examinations will be performed by an investigator unaware of&#xD;
      the endoscopic results. At the time of endoscopy the performing gastroenterologist will be&#xD;
      unaware of the results of the ultrasound examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Assessment of Disease worsening A disease worsening in ulcerative colitis is defined as&#xD;
      an increase in 6-point Mayo score to a total of ≥ 2 points and/or faecal calprotectin &gt; 200&#xD;
      mg/kg in 2 consecutive measurements regardless of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Biobank samples The plasma obtained for ProGN and ProUGN will be stored in a biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4 Other assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following samples will be collected as a part of the BIOSTOP study at inclusion and 2&#xD;
      years, and at unscheduled endoscopy visits for patients that relapse during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples from rectum mucosa (8 specimens per endoscopy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine white light histologic interpretation and classification by local pathologist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history will be carefully assessed and information on the duration of ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis, Montreal classification (Appendix 14.1) concomitant disease, previous medical and&#xD;
      surgical treatment, age, sex weight, height will be collected. At baseline and after 2 years&#xD;
      pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.1 Determination of sample size: This is an exploratory study and the sample size is based&#xD;
      on the primary end-point which is relapse at ileocolonoscopy defines as MES score ≥2 during&#xD;
      the study period. Since approximately half of the patients will receive anti TNF treatment&#xD;
      and the other half will not approximately 1/3 of the patients are expected to relapse during&#xD;
      the follow up. This will be sufficient for examining if the ultrasound score is useful for&#xD;
      detecting relapse in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concordance between the Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) and the GIUS score at the different&#xD;
      time points will be determined using kappa statistics. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy&#xD;
      for predicting relapse will also be calculated for the suggested ultrasound score. To&#xD;
      investigate how the individual ultrasound parameters contribute stepwise logistic regression&#xD;
      will be performed with the MES a dependent variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For inter-observer variability of the measurements, kappa statistics will be performed for&#xD;
      categorical data while Bland Altmann analysis will be performed for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of correlation between the various ultrasound parameters, endoscopic findings as&#xD;
      scored with the Mayo endoscopic subscore and biochemical markers will be performed.&#xD;
