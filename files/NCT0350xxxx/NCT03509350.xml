    <textblock>
      The VItamin C, Thiamine And Steroids in Sepsis (VICTAS) Study is a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, adaptive randomized clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the combined use of vitamin C, thiamine and corticosteroids versus indistinguishable&#xD;
      placebos for patients with sepsis. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy&#xD;
      of combination therapy using vitamin C, thiamine and corticosteroids in reducing mortality&#xD;
      and improving organ function in critically ill patients with sepsis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is an inflammatory syndrome with life threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a&#xD;
      dysregulated host response to infection. The global burden is estimated to exceed 15 million&#xD;
      cases annually. In the United States, the incidence is increasing and currently there are&#xD;
      more 1,750,000 cases each year, with more than half requiring intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      admission. Further, sepsis cases account for 30%- 50% of all hospital deaths, making it the&#xD;
      3rd leading cause of death in the United States, and is the most expensive reason for&#xD;
      hospitalization with annual expenditures exceeding $20 billion. Notably, even among those&#xD;
      that do survive, many endure significant reductions in physical, emotional and cognitive&#xD;
      quality of life. New therapeutic approaches to reduce the high morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      sepsis are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current management strategies focus on early aggressive fluid resuscitation, blood pressure&#xD;
      support with vasopressors, early appropriate antibiotics, and the identification and control&#xD;
      of infected sites. Though outcomes have improved with the bundled deployment of these&#xD;
      strategies, mortality remains high at 20 - 30%. Despite over a hundred phase 2 and phase 3&#xD;
      clinical trials of pharmacological agents with the potential to improve sepsis outcomes, only&#xD;
      antibiotics have demonstrated reproducible benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is therefore to determine (or confirm) the efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination therapy consisting of vitamin C, thiamine, and corticosteroids in the management&#xD;
      of patients with circulatory and/or respiratory dysfunction resulting from sepsis. This&#xD;
      subset of sepsis patients has been chosen because they are easily identified, have a high&#xD;
      mortality, and consume significant critical care resources. As such, any improvements in&#xD;
      outcomes attributed to effective therapies would be of great value to patients, as well as&#xD;
      their care providers and healthcare systems. Further, because the promulgated therapies are&#xD;
      composed of three inexpensive and readily available drugs, its efficacy would have important&#xD;
      implications the management of sepsis in both well and poorly resourced settings worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VItamin C, Thiamine And Steroids in Sepsis (VICTAS) Study is a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, adaptive randomized clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the combined use of vitamin C, thiamine and corticosteroids (the Treatment Protocol)&#xD;
      versus indistinguishable placebos (the Control Protocol) for patients with sepsis. The trial&#xD;
      will enroll up to 2000 participant and employs a novel endpoint that approximates a patient's&#xD;
      risk of death based on the time spent on vasopressors or receiving respiratory support. Time&#xD;
      spent on vasopressors or receiving respiratory support captures a patient's speed of&#xD;
      recovery. Mortality rate is a key secondary endpoint for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate the efficacy of combination therapy using vitamin C, thiamine and&#xD;
           corticosteroids to reduce the duration of cardiovascular and respiratory organ&#xD;
           dysfunction in critically ill patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate the efficacy of combination therapy using vitamin C, thiamine and&#xD;
           corticosteroids to reduce 30-day mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explicit subject consent for participation in long term telephone follow-up will be sought&#xD;
      for all patients at all sites. Participation in long term outcome assessments is not required&#xD;
      for participation in other aspects of the VICTAS study, i.e., patients may individually opt&#xD;
      out of this portion of the study. In these participants a diverse array of neurocognitive&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed approximately 6 months after patient discharge. Evaluations will be&#xD;
      done using a specially-designed battery of tests that evaluates key aspects of functioning&#xD;
      and behavior and will be administered via phone by the Vanderbilt Long-Term Outcomes team,&#xD;
      which will serve as the coordinating center for these follow-up assessments. The battery,&#xD;
      which takes about 40 minutes to complete, will assess cognition, mental health, quality of&#xD;
      life, and employment - all of which have been shown to be adversely affected in between one&#xD;
      third and two thirds of survivors of sepsis.&#xD;

    <measure>Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) is an 11-item instrument assessing orientation.

    <time_frame>Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Reasoning is assessed with the WAIS-IV Similarities instrument. Participants were asked to explain how two words are alike. Responses are scored according to how correct they are, with a score of 0 for incorrect answers. After 3 consecutive scores of 0 the survey is stopped. Total raw scores vary depending on the number of word pairs presented. Higher scores indicate better performance. Scores will be compared between study arms.</description>

        <description>The Digit Span Test is used to assesses attention. In the Digit Span Test, participants are read a series of numbers and are asked to repeat them back in the same order. The Digit Span test is scored by the number of digits the participant is able to remember in each test. Higher scores indicate greater ability to pay attention and to remember sequences. The average adult can remember about 7 numbers, plus or minus two, without making an error.</description>
