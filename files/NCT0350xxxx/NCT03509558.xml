  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence indicates that electrical spinal cord stimulation improves motor functions&#xD;
      both immediately and over the long term via modulating the excitability of spinal circuitry&#xD;
      in patients with spinal cord injury. Recently, a novel, non-invasive, well-tolerated and&#xD;
      painless lumbosacral transcutaneous electrical stimulation strategy was demonstrated to be&#xD;
      effective for improving lower limb motor function in participants with spinal cord injury.&#xD;
      Our current project, cervical transcutaneous electrical stimulation and intensive exercise&#xD;
      for arms and hands, is also revealing significant improvement of upper extremity function.&#xD;
      Additionally, the subject and caregiver noted that stair climbing ability has been&#xD;
      substantially enhanced starting from the first week of cervical stimulation treatment and&#xD;
      continues to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective efficacy trial of combined transcutaneous cervical and&#xD;
      lumbosacral electrical stimulation with intensive physical therapy for improving locomotion&#xD;
      in people with incomplete tetraplegia and paraplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment design consists of two to four phase intervention program including one-month&#xD;
      physical therapy (PT) only (A) followed by one-month spinal stimulation with PT (B). Between&#xD;
      each intervention, washout periods of up to one-month may be used to determine any&#xD;
      after-effect of the interventions. The AB or BA interventions will be repeated if the&#xD;
      functional improvement does not reach a plateau during the first two month of interventions.&#xD;
      Sessions will last up to 2 hours/day, 2 to 5 days/week for each arm. Both immediate and&#xD;
      lasting improvements in lower extremity function and autonomic function via transcutaneous&#xD;
      spinal stimulation and intensive physical therapy will be evaluated.&#xD;
