    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA will be assessed for both eyes using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity (VA) chart. BCVA test should be performed prior to pupil dilation, and distance refraction should be carried out before BCVA is measured. Initially, letters are read at a distance of 4 meters from the chart. If &lt;20 letters are read at 4 meters, testing at 1 meter should be performed. BCVA is to be reported as number of letters read correctly by the participant using the ETDRS Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study to have&#xD;
             both eyes treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have documentation of a genetically-confirmed diagnosis of CHM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have active disease clinically visible within the macular region of both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a BCVA of â‰¥34 ETDRS letters (20/200 or better Snellen acuity) in both eyes, or in&#xD;
             the untreated eye, if the other eye was previously treated with BIIB111*&#xD;
&#xD;
             *If previously treated with BIIB111 in an antecedent study, participants may be&#xD;
             eligible for participation following Sponsor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For participants who received treatment with BIIB111 in an antecedent study, have&#xD;
             biological samples available to complete an adequate immunology profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a history of amblyopia or inflammatory disorder in either eye.&#xD;

             to participate in the study. This includes but is not limited to a potential&#xD;
             participants:&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  with clinically significant cataract in either eye&#xD;
&#xD;

                  for sub-retinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have participated in another research study involving an investigational product in&#xD;
             the past 12 weeks or received a gene/cell-based therapy at any time previously, except&#xD;
