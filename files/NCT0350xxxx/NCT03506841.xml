    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to assess the effect of Cerebrolysin on physical and mental&#xD;
      development of preterm infants by Denver Scale II at different ages of 5, 7 and 12 months&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an inverse relationship between birth weight or gestational age and risk for&#xD;
      developmental impairment, with increasing incidence as birth weight or gestational age&#xD;
      decreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious impairment, defined as problems in body function or structure which may be temporary&#xD;
      or permanent, is generally a more stable condition and typically leads to a disability&#xD;
      requiring rehabilitation. Mild impairment is a more reversible condition amenable to early&#xD;
      intervention. Studies that have followed extremely preterm and extremely low birth weight&#xD;
      infants into school age and early adulthood have shown higher rates of motor, cognitive or&#xD;
      behavioral impairments as compared with infants born at term. The neurologic consequences of&#xD;
      extreme prematurity range from mild behavioral and cognitive defects to severe disability.&#xD;
      Perinatal neuroprotection aims to reduce these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin is a porcine brain-derived peptide preparation that acts like endogenous&#xD;
      neurotrophic factors. It is produced by a standardized enzymatic breakdown of lipid-free&#xD;
      brain protein powder and consists of low molecular weight peptides and free amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacodynamic effects of Cerebrolysin can be categorized in terms of neuronal survival&#xD;
      (e.g. trophic and survival promoting actions), neuroprotection (e.g. limiting neuronal&#xD;
      dysfunction, especially in adverse conditions), neuroplasticity (e.g. adaptive responses to&#xD;
      changing conditions) and neurogenesis (e.g. promoting differentiation of progenitor cells).&#xD;
      We aim to assess the effect of Cerebrolysin on physical and mental development of preterm&#xD;
      infants at different ages of life at 5, 7 and 12 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High risk preterm infants born with gestational age less than 32 weeks and have a&#xD;
             corrected postnatal age of 5 months at time of enrollment. Included preterm infants&#xD;
             should have one or more of the following risk factors which may affect their&#xD;
             neurodevelopmental outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Infants diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia requiring oxygen therapy more&#xD;
                  than 30% FIO2 at 36 weeks corrected gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Infants with culture proven early or late onset neonatal sepsis with or without&#xD;
                  neonatal meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Infants diagnosed to have peri- ventricular leukomalacia diagnosed by brain&#xD;
                  imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient with persistent uncontrolled fits (all possible reasons for these uncontrolled&#xD;
             seizures, including non-epileptic seizures, pseudo intractability, and medically&#xD;
             refractory epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient with brain malformation.&#xD;
