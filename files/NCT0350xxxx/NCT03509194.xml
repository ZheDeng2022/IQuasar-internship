      The aim of this study is to validate and develop a new diagnostic and prognostic approach for&#xD;
      assessment of liver function in children and adolescents with acute liver failure and chronic&#xD;
      liver insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A carefully selected panel of functional and genomic tests along with diagnostic imaging and&#xD;
      analysis of the microbiota will be performed in children and adolescents with acute liver&#xD;
      failure and chronic liver insufficiency at Rigshospitalet. The tests will be performed in a&#xD;
      serial manner in order to detect changes in outcomes. The study is an unblinded descriptive&#xD;
      study, and approximately 20 patients with acute liver failure and 100 patients with chronic&#xD;
      liver disease will be included in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first of it's kind worldwide. The investigators expect the study to&#xD;
      improve future diagnostic and prognostic accuracy and help the clinicians in identifying&#xD;
      those patients in which the liver will regenerate itself, from those patients in which a&#xD;
      liver transplantation will be lifesaving. Furthermore this study aims to help the clinicians&#xD;
      in defining the optimal time for pediatric liver transplant in a narrow window of&#xD;
      opportunity.&#xD;

      1) Research question: Liver disease in childhood and adolescence can present as chronic liver&#xD;
      disease (CLD) or acute liver failure (ALF), with different interim stages, and with the&#xD;
      possibility of a presentation with acute on chronic liver failure as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the department of Pediatrics at Rigshospitalet the investigators follow around 150&#xD;
      children and adolescents with CLD and many of these patients develop chronic liver failure&#xD;
      (CLF). The pediatric department at Rigshospitalet receives approximately 20 new outpatient&#xD;
      CLD patients per year. Causes of CLD are diverse and include congenital anatomic&#xD;
      abnormalities, metabolic disorders, infections, autoimmunity, toxicity, vascular lesions and&#xD;
      nutritional disorders. The process of fibrosis and cirrhosis is a key factor of CLD. The&#xD;
      clinical presentation and features of CLD include different stages of systemic complications&#xD;
      due to the process of fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver insufficiency with the formation of&#xD;
      ascites, portal hypertension and coagulopathy as commonly found symptoms. The stages vary&#xD;
      from mild disease to severely affected liver function. In severe cases liver transplantation&#xD;
      (LT) is indicated and every year around 6 Danish children and adolescents with CLD receives a&#xD;
      LT. LT is a complicated surgical intervention with subsequent life-long immunosuppressive&#xD;
      treatment and a high risk of surgical complications. New diagnostic tools for following and&#xD;
      evaluating the liver function of patients with CLD are crucial in order to define the optimal&#xD;
      timing of a potential LT, and searching for the cause of the liver disease among the 25% of&#xD;
      the children with no aetiologic explanation. Furthermore it is of great importance to&#xD;
      differentiate the group of CLD patients in which the level of liver fibrosis and liver&#xD;
      function deteriorate, from those in which they do not, in order to ensure that only patients&#xD;
      with uncorrectable deterioration are transplanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical presentation and features of ALF are different from that of CLD. ALF in children&#xD;
      is a severe life threatening condition with a mortality of 50-70% in a general pediatric&#xD;
      setting. ALF present in a child with no evidence of known chronic liver disease, elevated&#xD;
      liver enzymes and hepatic-based coagulopathy that is not corrected by administration of&#xD;
      vitamin K. The speciality of ALF in children and adolescents is centered at the department of&#xD;
      Pediatrics at Rigshospitalet with treatment and follow-up of all childhood ALF cases in&#xD;
      Denmark, and in this setting mortality of ALF has been decreased to 25%. In Denmark 6-8 new&#xD;
      cases of childhood ALF are diagnosed every year. The aetiology of ALF is only known in around&#xD;
      50% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALF survivors have either regained a normal or subnormal liver function or received a LT.&#xD;
      Whether a child with ALF needs a LT, or the liver function will recover by itself with time,&#xD;
      observation and basic supportive care and treatment, is a complex clinical issue to assess.&#xD;
      Internationally we lack validated objective and prognostic measures of the liver's potential&#xD;
      for regenerating itself. On the basis of this lack of knowledge clinicians treating ALF in&#xD;
      children and adolescents primarily base their evaluation of the prognosis on overall and&#xD;
      unspecific biochemical markers and the clinical appearance of the patient. Furthermore most&#xD;
      children with ALF lack signs of Hepatic Encephalopathy which in adults is a compelling&#xD;
      feature of a bad prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By performing a multimodality-model including functional liver testing, diagnostic imaging,&#xD;
      physiological liver tests and genetic liver tests, the investigators will be able to evaluate&#xD;
      the usefulness and the accuracy of the different tests in predicting spontaneous&#xD;
      regeneration, stabilization of the degree of liver fibrosis and the need for LT respectively,&#xD;
      in both CLD and ALF. Based on these results the investigators will be able to provide the&#xD;
      clinician with an essential tool and recommendations for deciding which tests to perform in&#xD;
      the child with CLD or ALF. In addition the project will clarify less useful tests for&#xD;
      evaluating CLD and ALF respectively. This will help the clinician in identifying those&#xD;
      children and adolescents where survival is dependent on LT, from those in which the liver&#xD;
      will regenerate with normalization of the liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods The study is carried out as an unblinded descriptive study which aims&#xD;
      to investigate the genetic background and compare different diagnostic modalities in liver&#xD;
      failure among children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out at Rigshospitalet, where children and adolescents with ALF and&#xD;
      CLD are treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this part of the study different diagnostic tests are conducted in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with ALF or CLD with the aim of characterizing and quantifying liver function in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children and adolescents diagnosed with ALF (increased Alanine Aminotransferase and INR &gt;&#xD;
      2,0 or coagulation factors II, VII, X &lt; 0,40 units/L, despite sufficient vitamin K&#xD;
      administration) will be included in the project. Likewise children and adolescents with CLD&#xD;
      (level of liver fibrosis of II and two measurements of INR &gt; 1,3 despite sufficient vitamin K&#xD;
      administration) are included in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ALF the tests will be performed within the first week of ALF, 2-3 weeks after diagnosed&#xD;
      ALF and at 3 months after diagnosed ALF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CLD the tests will be performed at inclusion and 6 months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests will be conducted in included patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA-scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Galactose Elimination Capacity (GEC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indocyanine Green Retentiontest (ICGr15)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonography of the liver and biliary system including elastography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) elastography (not in acute liver failure patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elastography measured by Fibroscan (not in acute liver failure patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection for biomarker analysis and genetic/epigenetic testing along with&#xD;
           metabolomics and proteomics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of the microbiota&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary sample for metabolomics and proteomics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy of the liver (not in acute liver failure patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of testing the children in a serial manner is to detect differences in the&#xD;
      outcomes of the different tests, and compare this to the clinical outcome in order to&#xD;
      identify the most optimal timing of the tests. Such outcomes include spontaneous regeneration&#xD;
      of the liver function or worsening of the liver function, steady level of fibrosis or&#xD;
      deterioration of the level of fibrosis, survival or dead, liver transplantation or no liver&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence LT is not the only important outcome. Evaluation of the different tests in both&#xD;
      worsening and improvement of CLD, CLF and ALF is just as important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be performed on all children and adolescents included in the project. Liver&#xD;
      biopsy will only be conducted if the clinical condition and liver biochemistry allow it.&#xD;
