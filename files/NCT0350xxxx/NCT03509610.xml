  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugar is perceived negatively, leading to government taxation and targets to reduce&#xD;
      consumption. These actions have been taken based on the limited evidence that high-sugar&#xD;
      diets are associated with greater total energy intake. However, energy intake comprises just&#xD;
      one half of the energy balance equation (e.g. balance = intake - expenditure). Without&#xD;
      considering energy expenditure, it is impossible to understand the effects of sugar on&#xD;
      health. Sugar, and perhaps total carbohydrate intake, may be important for energy balance -&#xD;
      perhaps by stimulating increased energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding dietary regulators of energy balance is more important than ever before,&#xD;
      because diseases like obesity are a consequence of energy surplus (i.e. energy intake &gt;&#xD;
      energy expenditure). No studies have investigated a causal role of dietary sugar or&#xD;
      carbohydrate on energy balance. The proposed research will seek to understand the acute (e.g.&#xD;
      24-hour) responses to manipulating dietary carbohydrate and sugar content on energy balance&#xD;
      and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will contribute to enabling individuals to make informed dietary choices about&#xD;
      carbohydrate and sugar consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, healthy non-obese adults will be recruited to a randomised crossover study.&#xD;
      Measures of energy intake, energy expenditure, metabolic health, appetite, food preference,&#xD;
      and gut microbiota will be taken. All laboratory trials will take place at the University of&#xD;
      Bath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three diets will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control - reflecting the composition of a typical European diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low sugar - the same composition of a typical European diet but with &lt;5% energy intake&#xD;
           from sugar&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low carbohydrate - low carbohydrate diet with &lt;5% energy intake from sugar and &lt;8%&#xD;
           energy intake from carbohydrate, replacing carbohydrate energy with fat&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a 3-day lead-in period with the control diet followed by one trial&#xD;
      day with each diet.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary sugar is increasingly perceived in a negative way. This has led to taxation by&#xD;
      government and guidelines by global public health bodies to reduce sugar intake to &lt;5% of&#xD;
      energy intake. All available public health guidelines regarding sugar advocate a reduction in&#xD;
      sugar intake, despite a lack of evidence to support these recommendations. These guidelines&#xD;
      focus on the association between sugar intake and energy intake, without regard for energy&#xD;
      expenditure. This oversimplifies situations in which energy surplus is pathological, for&#xD;
      example in diseases like obesity. This complexity is demonstrated by evidence that dietary&#xD;
      sugar intake is decreasing in the United Kingdom, whilst rates of obesity have increased in&#xD;
      the same timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to consider energy expenditure in the context of health. The most variable&#xD;
      component of energy expenditure between individuals is physical activity energy expenditure&#xD;
      (PAEE), which varies from ~600-2100 kcal per day in men of a similar demographic. Current&#xD;
      guidelines do not regard the effect that changing dietary sugar might have on PAEE and&#xD;
      therefore total energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbohydrate availability dictates the capacity to perform physical work. However, the role&#xD;
      of carbohydrate in regulating physical activity behaviours has only recently been considered.&#xD;
      Ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich breakfast causes a significant increase in 24-hour PAEE&#xD;
      compared with no breakfast consumption before midday. The magnitude of this difference is&#xD;
      greatest prior to midday, near to when carbohydrate had been ingested and when glucose uptake&#xD;
      to peripheral tissue is increased. This points towards a stimulatory role of carbohydrate or&#xD;
      sugar on PAEE when carbohydrate is readily available to peripheral tissue. The amount of&#xD;
      carbohydrate present in skeletal muscle is dictated by the amount of carbohydrate in the&#xD;
      diet. As physical activity is performed by skeletal muscle, dietary carbohydrate intake may&#xD;
      regulate physical activity behaviour. Consequently, reducing total carbohydrate intake may&#xD;
      result in reduced PAEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in which carbohydrate has been manipulated and physical activity has been measured&#xD;
      have not been sufficient in answering this research question. Often self-report measures of&#xD;
      physical activity are used, which are not sensitive enough to discern meaningful differences.&#xD;
      Studies which have measured physical activity objectively, i.e. using pedometers or&#xD;
      accelerometers, are confounded by a lack of information about actual carbohydrate intake or&#xD;
      concurrent prescription of exercise interventions. Furthermore, government targets of reduced&#xD;
      sugar intake to &lt;5% of total energy intake are not aimed at overall carbohydrate intake per&#xD;
      se. In the breakfast study mentioned, sugar intake was significantly greater amongst&#xD;
      individuals who ate breakfast compared with individuals who fasted until midday. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is also plausible that a regulatory role of carbohydrate on PAEE may be due to the type of&#xD;
      carbohydrate rather than the absolute amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the availability of carbohydrate to peripheral tissue plays a regulatory role on PAEE,&#xD;
      then theoretically the effects of manipulating the amount or type of carbohydrate will be&#xD;
      detectable acutely, within 24 hours.&#xD;
