      This study will test the within and between day variability of spinal kinematics and trunk&#xD;
      muscle activity in healthy subjects and chronic low back pain patients during various&#xD;
      daily-life activities. Participants will come twice to the motion laboratory. During the&#xD;
      first session, participants will first perform different functional activities (V1), such as&#xD;
      sit-to-stand, gait, lifting tasks, stepping up. Their spinal kinematics will be measured with&#xD;
      a camera-based system (VICON) using a multi-segment spinal model and trunk muscles activity&#xD;
      will be recorded with surface electromyography. After a break, participants will have to&#xD;
      perform all the functional activities a second time (V2). These two measures (V1 and V2) will&#xD;
      be used to determine the within day variability of spinal kinematics. Finally, all&#xD;
      participants will come one week later (V3) to repeat all the measurements to determine the&#xD;
      between day variability.&#xD;
