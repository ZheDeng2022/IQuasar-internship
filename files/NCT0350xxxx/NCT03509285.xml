  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-dose, placebo- and active-controlled, crossover study will evaluate&#xD;
      the abuse liability potential of cenobamate in recreational drug users with sedative drug use&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Qualification phase, subjects will receive a single dose of either alprazolam or&#xD;
      placebo in a crossover design, with a wash-out period of at least 24 hours between&#xD;
      treatments. Subjects who are clearly able to distinguish the positive control from placebo&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the Treatment phase and will be randomized to single oral doses of&#xD;
      cenobamate (2 dose levels), alprazolam (2 dose levels), and placebo in a double-blind,&#xD;
      double-dummy, 5-way crossover design. Washout-periods between the 5 treatment periods in the&#xD;
      Treatment phase will be at least 16 days.&#xD;
