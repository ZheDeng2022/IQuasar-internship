  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower respiratory infections, or pneumonia, remain the third leading cause of death&#xD;
      worldwide, despite progress in vaccinating at-risk populations and improved resuscitation&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research shows that immune defences are weakened during severe infections. This immune&#xD;
      weakening could alter resistance to bacterial infection and facilitate death, but also&#xD;
      facilitate the onset of secondary infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, investigators wish to evaluate a biomedical test (derived from a blood&#xD;
      sample - Quantiferon Monitor test), aimed at measuring the immune response of certain immune&#xD;
      cells (lymphocytes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine whether this test can predict the occurrence of&#xD;
      death during pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this hypothesis is verified, it would make it possible to use this test as a marker to&#xD;
      identify patients at risk of death, and would open up new therapeutic prospects in order to&#xD;
      provide patients with severe pneumonia with a treatment that stimulates their immune&#xD;
      defences.&#xD;
