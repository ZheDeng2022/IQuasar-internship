      Clinical Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects having actinic keratoses and meeting Glogau Photoaging Class III or IV complete the&#xD;
      FDA approved 3 day course of Picato® 0.015% gel as approved for the treatment of facial&#xD;
      Actinic Keratosis. Each subject undergoes clinical multiple-angle standardized photographs on&#xD;
      day 1, day 7, day 30, and day 60. Full face photography will be obtained with the medical&#xD;
      research digital camera. Both subjects and investigators complete questionnaires at each&#xD;
      visit with individual questions regarding improvement in actinic keratoses and overall skin&#xD;
      appearance, wrinkling, dyschromia, erythema, and textural quality of skin. Each&#xD;
      characteristic listed above will be graded on a 5 point scale ranging from 0 (lowest&#xD;
      quality/worst appearance) to 5 (highest quality/best appearance). In addition, investigators&#xD;
      will examine the subject's face and assign a numeric assessment on a 9 point scale ranging&#xD;
      from 0 to 8 using previously published verified Griffiths' Photonumeric Photoaging scale. A&#xD;
      second and third investigator will be presented at random blinded pretreatment (day 0) and&#xD;
      posttreatment (day 60) photographs of each subject and be asked to assign a numerical value&#xD;
      from Griffiths' Photonumeric Photoaging Scale. These blinded investgators will be given no&#xD;
      information regarding which day each photograph represents. Comparison will be made of skin&#xD;
      quality questionnaire scores from each visit and the pre and post treatment Griffiths'&#xD;
      Photonumeric Grades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator opted against a split-face study design given the difficulty of blinding&#xD;
      with this type of study as well as difficulty recruiting subjects willing to treat for two&#xD;
      separate courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologic Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard 3mm dermatology punch biopsies from clinically sun damaged skin will be taken.&#xD;
      Biopsy will be taken from either the cosmetically acceptable pre-or infra-auricular area. A&#xD;
      digital photograph will be taken and used to identify the pre-treatment biopsy site. Biopsies&#xD;
      will be taken of 5 subjects before treatment and at day 60. Day 60 biopsies will be taken&#xD;
      immediately adjacent to previously photographed and identified pre-treatment biopsies.&#xD;
      Biopsies will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin and histologic features of pre and post&#xD;
      treatment skin will be evaluated. Measurement of actinic keratoses, solar elastosis and&#xD;
      overall epidermal and dermal thickness pre and post treatment will be compared.&#xD;
