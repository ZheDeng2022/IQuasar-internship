  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, global, multicenter, single arm post-approval study is designed to&#xD;
      investigate the clinical use and safety of the Lutonix® 035 AV Drug Coated Balloon (DCB) PTA&#xD;
      Catheter in subjects presenting with clinical and hemodynamic abnormalities in native&#xD;
      arteriovenous (AV) fistulae located in the upper extremity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This post-market approval study (PAS) is required by the FDA as a condition of approval for&#xD;
      the Lutonix drug coated balloon catheter. It is intended to demonstrate safety and assess the&#xD;
      clinical use and outcomes of the LUTONIX Catheter in dysfunctional arteriovenous fistulae&#xD;
      (AVF) in a heterogeneous patient population in real world clinical practice.&#xD;
