  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the risks and benefits of ceritinib (ZYKADIA)&#xD;
      given in combination with trametinib (MEKINIST) in patients who have progressed on prior&#xD;
      melanoma therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ceritinib that has been approved for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While ceritinib is not currently&#xD;
      FDA-approved specifically in melanoma, researchers believe ceritinib may also help keep&#xD;
      melanoma cancer cells from growing and therefore potentially help patients with melanoma as&#xD;
      well. Trametinib is currently FDA-approved for melanoma with a BRAFV600-mutation.&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be defined by proportion of patients who have achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined from the time of on-treatment to time of progression, censoring at last clinical follow up or if no longer followed at Moffitt, then based on date of last medical documentation of no progression. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as from the time of on-treatment to the time of death, censoring at last date known alive.</description>

    <description>Study treatment will be given in cycles. Each cycle will be 4 weeks (28 days). Post-Treatment (follow-up) Period: Participants will return to the study site between 30-40 days after the last dose of trametinib + ceritinib for an end-of-treatment assessment. Additional follow-up will occur for related Adverse Events (AEs) that are not resolved by this time and related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur after the time of this visit. Participants will be followed for survival every 3 months for the first year following end of treatment, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years after end of treatment.</description>
