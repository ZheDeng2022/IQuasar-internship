  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal obesity during pregnancy is a serious public health concern as it contributes to&#xD;
      inflammation, insulin resistance, and excessive gestational weight gain- all of which&#xD;
      negatively impact maternal and neonatal health. Fortunately, physical activity during&#xD;
      pregnancy improves obstetric and infant outcomes associated with obesity. Specifically, data&#xD;
      from our group demonstrated that irrespective of body weight, women who were&#xD;
      physically-active during pregnancy had lower levels of systemic inflammation; however, the&#xD;
      mechanism/s driving these changes are poorly understood. Previous studies in non-gravid&#xD;
      populations suggest obesity-associated overnutrition may contribute to inflammation and this&#xD;
      subsequent inflammation may lead to further metabolic dysfunction- perpetuating a vicious&#xD;
      cycle. However, the connections between physical activity, inflammation, and metabolic&#xD;
      dysfunction (i.e. metabolic inflexibility), particularly in response to a high-fat meal&#xD;
      (similar to that which is typically consumed in a Western diet), among lean and obese&#xD;
      pregnant women have not been studied. Thus, this study will examine the impact of a&#xD;
      physically-active lifestyle on inflammatory and metabolic responses to a high-fat meal in&#xD;
      lean and obese pregnant women. Understanding mechanisms connecting maternal physical activity&#xD;
      to improved outcomes will better inform future targeted intervention strategies. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the role of a physically-active lifestyle during pregnancy on&#xD;
      metabolic function and inflammation following a high-fat meal in lean and obese pregnant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal obesity is a significant public health concern in the United States as one in three&#xD;
      women enter pregnancy obese, and maternal obesity is associated with a large number of&#xD;
      unfavorable maternal and neonatal outcomes. Fortunately, a physically active lifestyle during&#xD;
      pregnancy has been shown to improve unfavorable outcomes often associated with obesity.&#xD;
      Physical activity during pregnancy has been shown to improve maternal insulin resistance and&#xD;
      reduce maternal gestational weight gain. In addition, neonates of physically active women&#xD;
      have lower adiposity compared to neonates born to inactive women. Although the relationships&#xD;
      between physical activity and maternal and neonatal outcomes are well-established, little is&#xD;
      known about the potential for metabolic dysfunction and/or inflammation to serve as&#xD;
      mechanisms mediating the positive impact of physical inactivity on maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      health. Understanding mechanisms connecting maternal physical activity to improved outcomes&#xD;
      will better inform future targeted intervention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic adaptations, specifically changes in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, occur&#xD;
      during normal physiologic pregnancy to provide an adequate nutrient supply to the developing&#xD;
      fetus despite intermittent maternal dietary intake. However, in obese pregnant women these&#xD;
      metabolic adaptations may be augmented by additional maternal metabolic dysfunction. Further,&#xD;
      it is well-established that metabolic dysfunction in obese pregnant women has serious&#xD;
      implications for maternal and neonatal health. Maternal substrate metabolism not only&#xD;
      contributes to maternal health conditions such as gestational diabetes, but it also plays a&#xD;
      major role in fetal growth and development. The &quot;fetal origins hypothesis&quot; suggests that an&#xD;
      altered intrauterine metabolic environment may contribute to the programming of short and&#xD;
      long-term neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic inflexibility may play a major role in maternal and neonatal health; however, it&#xD;
      has not been studied during pregnancy. In non-gravid populations, physical activity is&#xD;
      positively correlated with metabolic flexibility, and physical activity improves metabolic&#xD;
      flexibility in lean and obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of physical activity in modulating metabolic inflexibility in lean and obese&#xD;
      pregnant women has not been studied. However, an impaired ability to switch to fat metabolism&#xD;
      after a high-fat load is likely a better indicator of metabolic dysregulation than metabolism&#xD;
      during resting conditions. Therefore, the current study proposes to look at the role of a&#xD;
      physically active lifestyle on metabolic function in lean and obese pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will also determine the relationships between inflammation, metabolic&#xD;
      flexibility, and other important maternal (gestational weight gain) and neonatal (adiposity&#xD;
      and insulin resistance) outcomes.The goal of this project is to investigate the impact of a&#xD;
      physically-active lifestyle on inflammatory and metabolic responses to a high-fat meal in&#xD;
      lean and obese pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a physically-active lifestyle among lean and obese&#xD;
      pregnant women will improve metabolic function and inflammation thus mediating the positive&#xD;
      effects of physical activity on maternal and neonatal health outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty women (30 lean, 30 obese) will be recruited between 28-32 weeks of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent and Physical Activity Assessment The study team will meet and consent the patient at&#xD;
      a private office. Participants will be given an Actigraph Link Accelerometer (ActiGraph LLC,&#xD;
      Pensacola, FL) to objectively confirm their self-reported physical activity levels. The Link&#xD;
      will be placed on the non-dominant wrist with non-removable hospital-grade wristbands.&#xD;
      Wrist-worn tri-axel accelerometers are a valid measure of physical activity energy&#xD;
      expenditure in pregnant women. In addition, previous data on acceptability suggest&#xD;
      participants do not object to wearing wrist-worn devices 24 hours/day, and we believe&#xD;
      wrist-worn devices with hospital-type wristbands would give us the best compliance and 24&#xD;
      hours/day wear data. Data will be collected for seven consecutive days at 30 Hz. The&#xD;
      accelerometer output will be sampled by a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter. The percentage&#xD;
      of time spent sedentary as well as the amount of time spent participating in different&#xD;
      categories of physical activity ranging from light and lifestyle to moderate will be&#xD;
      calculated using algorithms corresponding to the following activity counts: sedentary: 0 - 99&#xD;
      counts/min, light: 100 - 759 counts/min, lifestyle: 760 - 1951 counts/min, moderate:&#xD;
      1952-5724 counts/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal Metabolic Inflexibility and Inflammation in Response to a High-Fat Meal Participants&#xD;
      will report to the Exercise Laboratory located on the Medical Health Complex in Bowling&#xD;
      Green, KY at approximately 8:00am after a 10-hour fast. Participants will be provided with&#xD;
      written instructions for consuming a standardized diet the day before with approximately 50%&#xD;
      carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 20% protein. The participant's weight, height, and vitals will be&#xD;
      taken upon arrival. Body composition will be measured using skinfold anthropometry in order&#xD;
      to determine maternal percent body fat. Body fat percentage will be determined by pressing&#xD;
      folds of the skin at seven sites with a caliper (Harpenden Skinfolds Caliper, Baty&#xD;
      International, United Kingdom), recording skin fold thickness, and entering the data into a&#xD;
      standardized equation that accounts for age, a technique that has been used during pregnancy&#xD;
      in prior studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting metabolic rate and respiratory quotient will be measured for ~30minutes using the&#xD;
      TrueOne Canopy Option and TrueOne Metabolic Cart (TrueOne 2400, Parvomedics, Sandy, UT).&#xD;
      Lipid and carbohydrate oxidation rates will be calculated by measurement of oxygen&#xD;
      consumption and carbon dioxide production as previously described. After the baseline resting&#xD;
      metabolism measurement, a baseline blood draw will be obtained (time point- 0). After the&#xD;
      baseline blood draw, participants will consume a standard 1000-kcal meal that is high in fat,&#xD;
      similar in composition to previous studies. The high-fat meal will consist of a Smoothie from&#xD;
      Smoothie King (55.9% fat, 29.4% carbs, 14.7% protein). Additional blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      60, 120, and 240 minutes after the meal is consumed. Resting metabolic rate and respiratory&#xD;
      quotient will be obtained a second time for ~30minutes from minute 210 to 240 minutes post&#xD;
      meal consumption. A total of 32mL maternal blood will be drawn. Time points for assessment of&#xD;
      metabolic responses to a high-fat load were chosen based on data from previous studies&#xD;
      exploring metabolic inflexibility and inflammation in response to a high-fat meal in other&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood draws will be used to analyze maternal plasma glucose, insulin, c-peptide, free fatty&#xD;
      acids, lipids (triglycerides, HDL, LDL), and inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1α). All&#xD;
      blood samples will be analyzed using standardized protocols at the Biochemistry Lab at WKU or&#xD;
      the Washington University Core Laboratory for Clinical Studies. These data will provide&#xD;
      additional information regarding metabolic responses to the high-fat load. Baseline insulin&#xD;
      and glucose levels will be used to calculate the homeostatic model assessment-insulin&#xD;
      resistance (HOMA-IR), an index of insulin resistance that reflects fasting glucose&#xD;
      concentration measured at the fasting insulin concentration. Data on each participants' oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (performed ~24-28 weeks gestation) will also be obtained from prenatal&#xD;
      charts to examine insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the four hour study period, participants will be asked to remain reclined and resting.&#xD;
      Participants will complete several surveys during this time as well including the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health's validated Dietary History Questionnaire II to determine potential&#xD;
      differences in day-to-day diet and the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire to determine&#xD;
      domain and mode of physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal Outcomes At parturition, neonatal weight, length, and head circumference will be&#xD;
      obtained via labor and delivery nurses. Approximately 20mL umbilical cord blood will be&#xD;
      obtained, centrifuged within one hour of delivery, and placed in a -80º C freezer. Neonatal&#xD;
      insulin, glucose, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1α), and free fatty acids will be&#xD;
      determined from the umbilical cord plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 48 hours of delivery, neonatal body composition (fat and lean mass) will be measured&#xD;
      by skin fold thickness measurement at the patients' bedside. Maternal prenatal charts will be&#xD;
      obtained in order to determine gestational weight gain and any other medical conditions that&#xD;
      may influence the interpretation of study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Procedures Sample Size Calculation Due to the lack of data regarding metabolic&#xD;
      inflexibility during pregnancy and the exploratory nature of the study, data from a previous&#xD;
      study comparing metabolic inflexibility between several non-gravid populations using the same&#xD;
      methodology as the current study was used, where 29 subjects per group would provide 80%&#xD;
      power to detect differences in metabolic flexibility (via indirect calorimetry) between&#xD;
      active and inactive pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses Normality of the distribution for each variable will be tested using&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients for normally&#xD;
      distributed variables or Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient for non-normally&#xD;
      distributed variables will be used to assess the degree of the relationship between&#xD;
      variables. Partial correlations will be used to adjust for potential confounders. Student's&#xD;
      independent t-tests for normally distributed variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for&#xD;
      non-normally distributed variables will be used to compare outcomes between lean and obese&#xD;
      pregnant women. All tests will be two-sided with a p-value &lt;0.05 denoting statistical&#xD;
      significance. All data analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 22&#xD;
      (Armonk, New York).&#xD;
