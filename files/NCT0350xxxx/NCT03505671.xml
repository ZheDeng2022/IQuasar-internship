    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to obtain preliminary evidence of the effect of 8 acupuncture&#xD;
      treatments over 10 weeks in breast and GI cancer patients who are currently receiving or&#xD;
      recently completed active neurotoxic chemotherapy and have clinically documented grade 1 or 2&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary evidence of the clinical effects of acupuncture compared to usual&#xD;
      care on the change in sensory neuropathic pain as measured by the European Organization of&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (QLQ)-Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) 20 item (20) sensory subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Change in the motor and autonomic neuropathic pain subscores on the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Change in patient-reported assessment of numbness and tingling using the 2-item&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Preventing the escalation of CIPN from grade 1 or 2 to a higher grade. IV. Amount and&#xD;
      intensity of planned chemotherapy relative to completed chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Effect on sensory and motor nerve function via nerve conduction studies (NCS) (e.g.&#xD;
      conduction velocity, latency, and amplitude).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Effect on peripheral nerve swelling via nerve ultrasound (e.g. cross sectional area,&#xD;
      CSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary evidence on phenotypic differences between African-American and non&#xD;
      African-American (A-A) (i.e., white, Asian, etc.) with regard to presentation of CIPN as well&#xD;
      as response to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of the effect of acupuncture on intraepidermal nerve fiber&#xD;
      density (IENF) via skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the associations among the peripheral nerve assessment measures (nerve&#xD;
      conduction, peripheral nerve ultrasound, skin biopsy) and of the peripheral nerve assessment&#xD;
      measures with the patient reported outcomes (EORTC QLQ-CIN20, PRO-CTCAE) at baseline, week&#xD;
      12, and for the change from baseline to week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To examine the association between expectations of the effectiveness of acupuncture to&#xD;
      reduce peripheral neuropathy and baseline, 12 week, and change in patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      on the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 and PRO-CTCAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1: Participants undergo 8 45-minute acupuncture treatments over 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2: Participants receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 12 weeks.&#xD;
