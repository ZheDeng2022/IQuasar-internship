  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the requirement for leucine, an essential amino acid, in adults&#xD;
      over the age of 60 years. It is known that protein and amino acid metabolism may be altered&#xD;
      with age and leucine, in particular, may be important in the diet of older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight different levels of leucine intake will be tested in each subject in random order. Each&#xD;
      level of leucine intake will involve a 3-day maintenance diet, with measures being collected&#xD;
      on the third.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leucine is an essential amino acid that is an important component of protein and stimulator&#xD;
      of muscle protein synthesis. It is known that as people get older, over the age of 60, our&#xD;
      body goes through many changes such as increase in fat mass and decrease in lean mass such as&#xD;
      muscle. This is why we are studying how much of the essential amino acid, leucine, the body&#xD;
      needs at this particular age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method is a minimally invasive method for&#xD;
      determining essential amino acid requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As essential amino acids cannot be stored in the body, they are either partitioned into&#xD;
      protein synthesis or oxidized if in excess. The premise of the IAAO is that when any&#xD;
      essential amino acid is limiting in the body then all other amino acids lose their ability to&#xD;
      contribute to protein synthesis and are instead oxidized. The method therefore involves&#xD;
      providing graded intakes (from deficient to excess) of the test amino acid, leucine, and then&#xD;
      measuring the oxidation of another amino acid, which is called the indicator amino acid. This&#xD;
      is done by isotopically labelling the indicator amino acid (we often use 13C- phenylalanine)&#xD;
      and then measuring the appearance of labelled carbon dioxide (13CO2) in breath with the&#xD;
      different intakes of the test amino acid, leucine. The requirement for leucine will be&#xD;
      determined by the &quot;breakpoint&quot; - the point at which oxidation of 13C- phenylalanine will&#xD;
      plateau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study, subjects will first participate in a pre-study assessment in which height,&#xD;
      weight, body composition (fat mass and muscle mass) and resting energy expenditure and&#xD;
      medical history will be assessed. Also, 10 ml of blood will be collected to test for diabetes&#xD;
      and kidney function. The purpose of the pre-assessment is to calculate subject's dietary&#xD;
      requirements for the study, and to assess health status, activity level and dietary patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then participate in up to 8 different 3-day studies that will be separated by a&#xD;
      minimum of 1 week between each 3-day study. The first 2 days are adaptation days and subjects&#xD;
      will consumed the maintenance diet at home s 4 equal meals. The 3rd day is called a study day&#xD;
      and subjects will consumed 8 hourly formulas; the first 3 at consumed at home and the&#xD;
      remaining 5 are consumed at the Clinical Research Centre at the Hospital for Sick Children.&#xD;
      Immediately after the 4th meal, 4 baseline breath and 3 baseline urine samples are collected.&#xD;
      After the 5th meal, rate of carbon dioxide production (VCO2) is measured by indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry for a period of 20 minutes. The 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th meal will contain a small&#xD;
      amount of isotope labelled phenylalanine (13C phenylalanine). Two and a half hours after the&#xD;
      isotope (13C phenylalanine) is given, 4 plateau breath and 3 plateau urine samples are&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath samples are used to measure the enrichment of isotopic labelled CO2 (13CO2). Urine&#xD;
      samples are used to measure the enrichment of isotopic labelled phenylalanine (13C&#xD;
      phenylalanine). Through a series of calculations and applying a two-phase regression&#xD;
      analysis, we will be able to determine the requirement for leucine.&#xD;
