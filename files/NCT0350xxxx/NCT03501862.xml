  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with psychosis demonstrated a tendency to use maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation&#xD;
      strategies as compared with healthy control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is the first randomized controlled trial of group mindfulness-based&#xD;
      intervention for psychosis. Half group will join the mindfulness-based cognitive intervention&#xD;
      while another half will participate in psychoeducation to examine whether mindfulness will&#xD;
      have a positive impact on emotion regulation and distress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrently with positive and negative symptoms, affective symptoms and full affective&#xD;
      disorder episodes are common in psychotic disorders particularly in the acute phase of&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affective symptoms are a significant risk factor accounting for approximately 5-6% of suicide&#xD;
      rates which remain or becomes higher shortly after a psychotic episode or hospital discharge&#xD;
      (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). It has been proved that the emotion management and&#xD;
      cognitive reappraisal were negatively associated with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, it is hypothesized that the intervention will have a positive impact on&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms, general symptoms such as affective symptoms, psychological flexibility,&#xD;
      mindfulness skills, quality of life and re-hospitalization by facilitating strategies on&#xD;
      emotion regulation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants referred to the study will be assessed at a screening examination to ensure eligibility and obtain written consent by a research assistant. Eligible participants will undertake a further interview on outcome measures prior to randomization within 3 weeks the commencement of intervention.&#xD;
Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy for Psychosis (MBCTp) plus TAU or TAU plus Psychoeducation for Psychosis (PEp).&#xD;
Simple randomization will be used to ensure that participants will have equal opportunity to be included into the study (Altaman and Bland, 1999).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale - short form (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be assessed pre-study; at one week, 3-month and 6-month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>). It is chosen as the primary outcome measurement because scales of anxiety and depression possess the capacity to differentiate from the related state of tension and stress linking with environmental demands and emotional and physical disturbance. It is a 21-item instrument that measures over the past week symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress rated by 4-point severity or frequency scale. The scale is from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time).</description>

    <measure>The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be assessed pre-study; at one week, 3-month and 6-month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 10-item scale that was developed to measure participants' tendency to regulate their emotions in cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Items are scored on a 7- point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>The WHOQOL-100</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be assessed pre-study; at one week, 3-month and 6-month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 100 items and among them, there are six domains: physical, psychological, level of independence, social relationship and environmental and spirituality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be assessed pre-study; at one week, 3-month and 6-month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 30-item, 7-point scale measuring positive and negative syndrome, differentiation of clinical symptoms and severity of illness. The seven rating points represent increasing levels of psychopathology from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptance and Action Scale (AAQII)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be assessed pre-study; at one week, 3-month and 6-month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A seven-item questionnaire that is a commonly used self-report measure of experiential avoidance which also measures psychological inflexibility. The items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true).</description>

    <measure>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be assessed pre-study; at one week, 3-month and 6-month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 39-item self-report questionnaire that measures five facets of mindfulness: observing; describing; acting with awareness; non-judging and non-reacting. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true).</description>
