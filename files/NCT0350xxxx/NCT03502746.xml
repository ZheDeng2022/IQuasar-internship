      This study will evaluate the combination of Nivolumab and Ramucirumab in patients with&#xD;
      previously-treated mesothelioma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) [16] and VEGFR2 [34] are highly-expressed on&#xD;
      mesothelioma cells, and are therefore attractive options for this cancer. We chose to study&#xD;
      the combination of ramucirumab with nivolumab because of the potential efficacy of these two&#xD;
      agents in mesothelioma and because of the potential synergistic activity between them [30].&#xD;
      As previously discussed, immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 inhibitors must contend with a&#xD;
      hostile, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment due to angiogenesis that results in&#xD;
      hypoxia. This hypoxia decreases the ability of antibodies to infiltrate the tumor. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the normalization of tumor vasculature (by reducing the area of the tumor&#xD;
      that is hypoxic) with an anti-VEGF strategy (i.e., ramucirumab) used in synergy with a PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor will facilitate the infiltration of T-lymphocytes into tumor parenchyma. We will&#xD;
      conduct a phase II study based on this premise using nivolumab and ramucirumab as second-line&#xD;
      therapy in patients with malignant mesothelioma who have failed standard doublet platinum and&#xD;
      anti-folate therapy.&#xD;
