  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      a total of 80 patients age of 36 years old to 65 years old, (ASA) physical status I and II&#xD;
      undergoing oesophageal procedures.The patients will randomised using concealed envelope&#xD;
      method into 2 groups, allocation of patients to either group will be done by clinician not&#xD;
      involved in the study. There are 2 groups of patients: TEA combined with GA (TEA group) or&#xD;
      bilateral erector spinae block combined with GA (erector group). . In TEA group, patients&#xD;
      will receive TEA where an epidural catheter will be placed at the T7-8 interspace after&#xD;
      proper sterilization and positioning of the patient in the sitting position then standard&#xD;
      technique of application will be applied, then a test dose consists of 3 ml of 1.5%&#xD;
      preservative free lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine will be injected followed by 5-6 ml of&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.25%. Anaesthesia will be standardised In the TEA group, an additional 4-5mL&#xD;
      epidural doses of bupivacaine 0.25% will be administered at 1 h intervals. In the second&#xD;
      group, patients will receive bilateral ESP block which will be performed as follows. The&#xD;
      patient will be placed in a lateral position ultrasound transducer will be placed in a&#xD;
      longitudinal orientation 3 cm lateral to the T7 spinous process. Three muscles will be&#xD;
      identified superficial to the hyperechoic transverse process shadow as follows: trapezius,&#xD;
      rhomboid major, and erector spinae. An 8-cm 22-gauge block needle will be inserted in a&#xD;
      cephalad-to-caudad direction until the tip lay in the interfascial plane between rhomboid&#xD;
      major and erector spinae muscles, as evidenced by visualization of local anesthetic spreading&#xD;
      in a linear pattern between erector spinae and the bony acoustic shadows of the transverse&#xD;
      processes. A total of 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected then it will be repeated on&#xD;
      the other side and preformed in the same way without changing the position of the patient to&#xD;
      achieve sensory block T5-T10 .&#xD;

      The patients will randomised into 2 groups. There are 2 groups of patients: TEA combined with&#xD;
      GA or bilateral erector spinae block combined with G. In TEA group, patients will receive&#xD;
      TEA, an epidural catheter will be placed at the T7-8 interspace after positioning of the&#xD;
      patient in the sitting position then standard technique of application will be applied, then&#xD;
      a test dose consists of 3 ml of 1.5% preservative free lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine&#xD;
      will be injected followed by 5-6 ml of bupivacaine 0.25%. Anaesthesia will be standardised. A&#xD;
      left-sided, double-lumen thoracostomy tube will be inserted and confirmed by&#xD;
      bronchofiberoscopy. In the TEA group, an additional 4-5mL epidural doses of bupivacaine 0.25%&#xD;
      will be administered at 1 h intervals. In the second group, patients will receive bilateral&#xD;
      ESP block which will be performed as follows. The patient will be placed in a lateral&#xD;
      position and a high-frequency linear ultrasound transducer (GE LOGIQe, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin)&#xD;
      will be placed in a longitudinal orientation 3 cm lateral to the T7 spinous process. Three&#xD;
      muscles will be identified superficial to the hyperechoic transverse process shadow as&#xD;
      follows: trapezius, rhomboid major, and erector spinae. An 8-cm 22-gauge block needle&#xD;
      (EchoStim; Benlan Inc, Oakville, Canada) will be inserted in a cephalad-to-caudad direction&#xD;
      until the tip lay in the interfascial plane between rhomboid major and erector spinae&#xD;
      muscles, as evidenced by visualization of local anesthetic spreading in a linear pattern&#xD;
      between erector spinae and the bony acoustic shadows of the transverse processes. A total of&#xD;
      20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected then it will be repeated on the other side and&#xD;
      preformed in the same way without changing the position of the patient to achieve sensory&#xD;
      block T5-T10 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamics as heart rate, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation will be monitored intraoperatively. The heart rate and arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      will be maintained within 20% of the preoperative values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, in both groups, anesthesia will be discontinued and&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade will be antagonized with neostigmine, intravenous (0.05 mg/kg) and&#xD;
      atropine intravenous (0.03 mg/kg) at appropriate doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be transported postoperatively to the intensive care unit. if VAS &gt; 5 ,&#xD;
      Patient-controlled analgesia using elastomeric pump will be established with IV doses of&#xD;
      morphine in the erector group (basal rate about 0.5mg/h to 1 mg/h and bolus dose of 2 mg ,&#xD;
      300 mL maximum dose) and epidural analgesia in the TEA group (top up doses of about 4 ml of&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.125% + morphine 20 Î¼g/mL, bolus doses 2 mL to 3 mL, 300 ml maximum dose). The&#xD;
      patients will be monitored in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU)&#xD;
