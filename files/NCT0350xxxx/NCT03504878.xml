    <textblock>
      In the world, there are several studies comparing the cost-effectiveness between laparoscopic&#xD;
      appendectomy and open appendectomy. But in Vietnam, health economics studies for acute&#xD;
      appendicitis surgery in general and laparoscopic appendectomy in particular has hardly been&#xD;
      available, and in the context of reform of the financial mechanism for payment, questions&#xD;
      about the cost-effectiveness between the two surgical methods are particularly concerned.&#xD;
      Therefore, we conducted a study &quot;Cost-effectiveness analysis and case-based payment norm&#xD;
      modeling in patients with appendectomy at Hanoi Medical University Hospital&quot;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Appendicitis (AA) is a surgical emergency most common stomach. Appendicitis occurs at&#xD;
      all ages. Recently, the rate tends to increase VRTC with age. In the United States, there are&#xD;
      about 300,000 cases of appendectomy surgery per year. In Vietnam, according to statistics&#xD;
      from a number of other authors showed that the rate of appendectomy surgery accounted for&#xD;
      40.5% - 49.8% of total number of cases of abdominal emergency. Open appendectomy (OA) has&#xD;
      long been applied as the gold standard surgical procedure for the treatment of AA for over a&#xD;
      century, since it was introduce by McBurrney in 1894 and still be common choice for procedure&#xD;
      in many center. In 1981, due to the growth of endoscopic surgery, Semm first introduced the&#xD;
      laparoscopic appendectomy, which render a minimal invasive procedure for abdomen and skin,&#xD;
      nevertheless, its superiority over open appendectomy (OA) is still being debated. Some more&#xD;
      recent paper demonstrate that Laparoscopic Appendectomy is the technique of choice in&#xD;
      treatment of AA because of its clinical advantage and cost-effectiveness, however, more than&#xD;
      20 years later, the benefits of LA still remain a controversy for many researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several studies comparing the cost-effectiveness between laparoscopic appendectomy&#xD;
      and open appendectomy in the world. But in Vietnam, health economics studies for appendix&#xD;
      removal surgery in general and laparoscopic appendectomy in particular has hardly been&#xD;
      available, and in the context of reform of the financial mechanism for payment, questions&#xD;
      about the cost-effectiveness between the two surgical methods are particularly concerned.&#xD;
      Therefore, we conducted a study &quot;Cost-effectiveness analysis and case-based payment norm&#xD;
      modeling in patients with appendectomy at Hanoi Medical University Hospital&quot; with two main&#xD;
      purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyze cost-effectiveness between laparoscopic and open surgery in patients undergoing&#xD;
           appendectomy at Hanoi Medical University Hospital in 2011 - 2013&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Model case-based payment norm of appendectomy patients at Hanoi Medical University&#xD;
           Hospital&#xD;

    <description>The laparoscopic appendectomy was performed with three trocars. Pneumoperitoneum was created using an open Hasson technique. The mesoappendix was divided using a harmonic scalpel or endoscopic tissue fusion device. The appendix was divided by placing one endoscopic loop and cut with harmonic scalpel. The specimen was removed through the umbilical port.</description>
