  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual dysfunction affects approximately 45% of women with an even greater incidence reported&#xD;
      in women with overactive bladder symptoms, despite this there is a lack of FDA approved&#xD;
      treatments for sexual dysfunction in this population. While both medical therapy and&#xD;
      electrical neuromodulation have been shown to improve urinary function as well as sexual&#xD;
      function, there is a dearth of literature about their comparative effectiveness in the&#xD;
      latter. The purpose of this study is to examine the comparative effectiveness of&#xD;
      neuromodulation via percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and medical therapy with&#xD;
      anticholinergics or beta-agonists in improving female sexual function. This will be a&#xD;
      prospective multi-center cohort study comparing improvement in sexual function as measured by&#xD;
      the female sexual function index (FSFI). It is hypothesized that PTNS will improve sexual&#xD;
      function to a greater degree than medical therapy as there may be mechanisms by which PTNS&#xD;
      directly affects sexual function. Enhanced understanding of the effects of neuromodulation&#xD;
      and medical therapy on sexual function may allow for improved patient selection and better&#xD;
      outcomes which may lead to widespread use of neuromodulation for female sexual dysfunction.&#xD;

      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine if there is greater improvement in female sexual function as measured by&#xD;
      the female sexual function index (FSFI) with percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) as&#xD;
      compared to medical therapy (MT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be a greater improvement in overall FSFI with PTNS as compared to MT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine if improvement in female sexual function with percutaneous tibial nerve&#xD;
      stimulation or medical therapy is correlated with improvement in urinary symptoms as measured&#xD;
      by the OAB-q questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Improvement in urinary symptoms will be correlated with improvement in sexual&#xD;
      function but that the difference in FSFI between groups will not be solely attributable to&#xD;
      differences in urinary symptom improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine if changes in sexual function are greater with beta agonist medications&#xD;
      as compared to anticholinergic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Beta agonists will result in improved sexual function as compared to&#xD;
      anticholinergics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To determine if those patients with female sexual dysfunction as defined as an overall&#xD;
      FSFI score below 26.5 have greater improvements than those without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients with female sexual dysfunction will have a greater improvement in FSFI&#xD;
      than those without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) affects approximately 45% of women with an even greater&#xD;
      incidence reported in women with overactive bladder symptoms, despite this there is a lack of&#xD;
      FDA approved treatments for sexual dysfunction in this population. Female sexual function is&#xD;
      complex and can be affected by pain, depression, and comorbidities as well as bowel and&#xD;
      bladder function. There are numerous treatments for women with overactive bladder (OAB)&#xD;
      defined as urinary urgency, frequency, urge urinary incontinence (UUI) and nocturia. These&#xD;
      treatments include medical therapy (MT) with anticholinergics and beta agonists and&#xD;
      neuromodulation via implantable sacral nerve stimulator (SNM) and percutaneous tibial nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (PTNS). Sexual function, which can be measured by the Female Sexual Function&#xD;
      Index (FSFI) has been shown to improve with both neuromodulation and anticholinergic therapy,&#xD;
      although less is known about the effects of beta agonists. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      examine the comparative effectiveness of neuromodulation via percutaneous tibial nerve&#xD;
      stimulation and medical therapy with anticholinergics or beta-agonists in improving female&#xD;
      sexual function. Additionally this study will assess whether improvement in sexual function&#xD;
      is correlated with improvement in urinary symptoms. Furthermore the effectiveness of&#xD;
      anticholinergics as compared to beta agonists with respect to changes in sexual function will&#xD;
      be examined. Lastly patients with sexual dysfunction will be comapred to those without to&#xD;
      determine if patients with female sexual dysfunction have greater improvements than those&#xD;
      without, as this may open the door to future studies using PTNS for the primary indication of&#xD;
      female sexual dysfunction. Enhanced understanding of the effects of neuromodulation and&#xD;
      medical therapy on sexual function may allow for improved patient selection and better&#xD;
      outcomes which may lead to widespread use of neuromodulation for female sexual dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective multi-center cohort study organized through the American&#xD;
      Urogynecological Society Fellows Pelvic Research Network comparing changes in sexual function&#xD;
      in women undergoing PTNS or MT for OAB/UUI. Recruitment is being conducted at MedStar&#xD;
      Washington Hospital Center, MedStar Franklin Square, Indiana University, University of Texas&#xD;
      Southwestern, University of Louisville and the University of Oklahoma. Potential subjects are&#xD;
      adult women presenting to a urogynecology clinic for symptoms of overactive bladder such as&#xD;
      urgency and UUI. Eligible subjects must report urinary urgency or urge incontinence and be&#xD;
      recommended for treatment with medical therapy (with anticholinergic or beta agonist) or PTNS&#xD;
      by the treating physician. Potential subjects are approached by their treating physician in&#xD;
      the context of a private clinical visit regarding enrollment. Women who enroll are asked to&#xD;
      complete the validated OAB-q, FSFI, Beck Depression Inventory and a visual analog pain scale&#xD;
      prior to therapy and then again after twelve weeks of therapy. These forms may be completed&#xD;
      in person on paper or via the online RedCap database. Demographic data including age,&#xD;
      comorbidities and menopausal status are extracted from the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is improvement in overall FSFI score which is hypothesized&#xD;
      to be greater in the PTNS group. Sample size calculations were conducted using&#xD;
      http://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx with the primary endpoint of FSFI assessed as a&#xD;
      continuous variable. Group sample sizes of 63 per group (total 126 patients) will be&#xD;
      necessary to detect a clinically relevant difference of 5 points in FSFI assuming standard&#xD;
      deviation of 10 and achieve a power of 80%, alpha=0.05. By incorporating a 10% loss to&#xD;
      follow-up rate, the plan is to to recruit 70 patients per group, with a total of 140&#xD;
      patients. Because approximately 45% of patients with OAB will have FSD as determined by an&#xD;
      FSFI score below 26.5, the study may include up to 312 patients in the study. A planned&#xD;
      interim analysis will be conducted comparing patients receiving anticholinergics and those&#xD;
      receiving beta agonists. This will be conducted once 63 patients receiving anticholinergics&#xD;
      and 63 receiving beta agonists have completed the study. This will address Aim 3. A&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare FSFI between patients receiving anticholinergics&#xD;
      and beta agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Transmission:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be approached by their treating physician in the context of a private&#xD;
      clinical visit regarding enrollment in the study. After discussion of the risks and benefits&#xD;
      and obtaining written informed consent, each subject will be assigned a participant&#xD;
      identification number (ID). Those patients who express interest but are unable to sign&#xD;
      consent in the context of an office visit due to time constraints will be contacted via&#xD;
      telephone to complete the consent process; once consent is obtained these patients will have&#xD;
      the option of completing paper questionnaires which will be mailed to them or online&#xD;
      questionnaires which they will receive through a secured email link. Treating physicians and&#xD;
      investigators will monitor patients at clinic visits. Case report forms will be generated for&#xD;
      each subject and completed by the investigator or study coordinator at each site, these will&#xD;
      then be entered by the investigator or study coordinator into a password protected REDCap&#xD;
      database with each patient identified only by ID. Patients will be asked to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires in the setting of clinic visits to minimize mailings and their potential for&#xD;
      privacy breach. Mailing of questionnaires will only be used if patients are unable to return&#xD;
      to clinic for follow up; forms may also be returned via fax or secure email. Patients may&#xD;
      also complete questionnaires online directly in the REDCap database. Patients will be&#xD;
      encouraged to complete forms in REDCap to minimize the potential for transcription error and&#xD;
      breach of privacy. For those patients who cannot mail the forms or access them online, they&#xD;
      may be completed via phone with an investigator or study coordinator. Original case report&#xD;
      forms and questionnaires will be securely maintained on site in a locked file cabinet within&#xD;
      a locked office. MedStar Washington Hospital Center will be the Data Collecting Center (DCC).&#xD;
      Copies of the case report forms and questionnaires will be forwarded by courier or fax to the&#xD;
      DCC with participant ID number visible and personal information obscured. The following&#xD;
      interim data will be monitored via review of the database at scheduled six-month intervals by&#xD;
      the PI: accrual rate, patient adherence, adverse events and accuracy and completeness of the&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
