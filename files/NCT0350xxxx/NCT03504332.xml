    <textblock>
      The object of this study is to compare the effect of Calcium Hydroxide and Di-antibiotic&#xD;
      paste as intracanal disinfectants in the 1st visit of revascularization of necrotic immature&#xD;
      permanent anterior teeth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental trauma is common in children and it is the main cause of loss of pulp vitality in&#xD;
      immature permanent anterior teeth with prevalence rate of 11% and about of 27% of traumatized&#xD;
      anterior teeth are left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentists face many challenges during the treatment of infected immature permanent teeth. This&#xD;
      is mainly due to the thin dentinal walls of the root and blunderbuss apices that make these&#xD;
      teeth susceptible to fracture during and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, Calcium Hydroxide apexification has been the only method for managing these&#xD;
      cases.. however, it was found that this technique caused additional reduction in root&#xD;
      strength due to the long-term application of Calcium Hydroxide which may end in fracture of&#xD;
      the tooth. The time needed for complete apexification using Calcium Hydroxide was reported to&#xD;
      be variable ranging from 5 to 20 months, with failure rate 0f 30% . Therefore, this technique&#xD;
      is no longer recommended for the treatment of such cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently proposed technique for the treatment of immature necrotic permanent teeth is&#xD;
      revascularization regenerative endodontic therapy (RET). It is a biologically based technique&#xD;
      that allow the continuation of root development and thickening of dentinal walls. This is&#xD;
      achieved through proper disinfection o the root canal system, creation of scaffold and&#xD;
      perfect coronal seal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For proper disinfection of the root canal system, antibiotic paste was applied as intracanal&#xD;
      dressing for 2-3 weeks. However, the recent recommendations by the European society of&#xD;
      Endodontology advices the use of Calcium Hydroxide as intracanal medication instead of&#xD;
      intracanal antibiotics. This is because of some concerns regarding the use of antibiotics&#xD;
      which include: cytotoxicity to stem cells needed for the revascularization process, risk of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance and the risk of sensitization. Calcium Hydroxide on the other hand is&#xD;
      widely used as intracanal disinfectant and some studies were found supporting its use in the&#xD;
      revascularization technique, [9, 10]. However, the data available is not sufficient regarding&#xD;
      the effectiveness of Calcium Hydroxide in revascularization of necrotic pulp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, more trials are needed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of RET in management&#xD;
      of immature necrotic permanent teeth as the evidence of using this technique is still weak.&#xD;
