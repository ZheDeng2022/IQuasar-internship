  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the well-established benefits of physical activity, only 23% of pregnant women report&#xD;
      exercising in accordance with guidelines recommended by the American Congress of&#xD;
      Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Further, pregnant women report receiving little or no advice&#xD;
      about physical activity during pregnancy from their health care provider; thus, the&#xD;
      scientific evidence supporting physical activity during pregnancy does not appear to be&#xD;
      translating into the clinic and the community. The goal of this project is to determine if&#xD;
      the distribution of evidence-based educational materials and local resources will increase&#xD;
      knowledge regarding the benefits of physical activity during pregnancy, patient-provider&#xD;
      communication about physical activity during pregnancy, and physical activity levels during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis A: Pregnant women who receive evidence-based educational materials and local&#xD;
      resources will have increased knowledge regarding the benefits of physical activity during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis B: Pregnant women who receive evidence-based educational materials and local&#xD;
      resources will have more communication with their health care provider about physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis C: Pregnant women who receive educational information and local resources will&#xD;
      report increased physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis D: Pregnant women who receive evidence-based educational materials and local&#xD;
      resources will have improved pregnancy outcomes including lower gestational weight gain,&#xD;
      lower insulin resistance (as determined by their clinical oral glucose tolerance test), and&#xD;
      healthier neonatal birthweight.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Physical activity during pregnancy has been shown to be safe and effective in improving&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal short and long-term outcomes. Despite all of the benefits, only 23% of&#xD;
      all pregnant women report exercising in accordance with guidelines recommended by the&#xD;
      American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Further, pregnant women report&#xD;
      receiving little or no advice about physical activity during pregnancy from their health care&#xD;
      provider; thus, the scientific evidence supporting exercise during pregnancy does not appear&#xD;
      to be translating into the clinic and the community. With maternal obesity becoming a serious&#xD;
      public health concern, the need for awareness and communication about physical activity&#xD;
      during pregnancy is more important than ever before. Kentucky-specific data suggests that the&#xD;
      incidence of obesity at the first prenatal visit has increased from 7% to 24% over the past&#xD;
      20 years, and local interventions to reduce obesity during pregnancy are limited. Thus,&#xD;
      physical activity interventions designed to combat obesity and improve maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      health are warranted, specifically in rural Kentucky where rates of obesity and physical&#xD;
      inactivity are considerably higher than the national averages. A goal of this project is that&#xD;
      it will be the start of a sustainable program that will improve the lives of pregnant women&#xD;
      and their neonates in the community. The proposed program can grow beyond the city of Bowling&#xD;
      Green, KY, and this model can be adopted across the state of Kentucky. This program will not&#xD;
      only educate the population about all of the benefits of physical activity during pregnancy&#xD;
      (which is important as a previous study demonstrated that rural communities have perceptions&#xD;
      that support myths about exercise during pregnancy), but it will increase physical activity&#xD;
      levels among pregnant women. The long-term impact of increased maternal physical activity&#xD;
      levels in the city, state, and nation is substantial as many studies have shown that physical&#xD;
      activity during pregnancy has a long-term impact of maternal and neonatal health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because Kentucky is one of the most obese states in America, it is important local&#xD;
      interventions are designed to reduce obesity in future generations in order to stop the&#xD;
      vicious cycle of obesity. If the program succeeds and grows, it has the potential to improve&#xD;
      the overall health of the city of Bowling Green (and beyond) for years to come. Although&#xD;
      obesity is a multifaceted issue, and much larger steps need to be taken at the national level&#xD;
      to combat it, programs such as this are a small step in the right direction. Intervening as&#xD;
      early as possible (neonatal level) is an important opportunity to improve health in future&#xD;
      generations. Previous studies have demonstrated that antenatal lifestyle advice improves&#xD;
      maternal physical activity during pregnancy, and that information regarding risks and&#xD;
      benefits of exercise during pregnancy can be a source of exercise motivation for pregnant&#xD;
      women. In addition,this study design removes common barriers to participating in physical&#xD;
      activity during pregnancy by providing a number of medically-supervised exercise options (one&#xD;
      of which offers childcare, one of which can be done without leaving the home, and many of&#xD;
      which have safe and comfortable options for pregnant women), all at no cost to the pregnant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of Specific Aim 2 are to increase patient awareness about the benefits of physical&#xD;
      activity during pregnancy, increase patient-provider communication about physical activity&#xD;
      during pregnancy, and increase physical activity levels during pregnancy in rural Kentucky&#xD;
      through the use of evidence-based educational materials and local resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team hypothesizes that providing pregnant women with evidence-based educational&#xD;
      materials and a selection of local resources will increase knowledge about the benefits and&#xD;
      risks of physical activity, increase patient-provider communication about physical activity,&#xD;
      and increase physical activity levels during pregnancy. If physical activity levels are&#xD;
      increased, this study may also help to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study may&#xD;
      help pregnant women gain less weight during pregnancy, and thus, combat maternal obesity in&#xD;
      the years following pregnancy.In addition, this study may contribute to healthier offspring&#xD;
      as physical activity during pregnancy has been shown to reduce offspring birth weight and&#xD;
      body fat percentage into childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (N=80) will be recruited from Graves Gilbert Obstetrics, a rural healthcare&#xD;
      clinic, between 8 and 12 weeks gestation. Once consented to participate, all women will take&#xD;
      baseline surveys between 8 and 12 weeks gestation. Surveys will be taken before or after&#xD;
      their prenatal appointment at Graves-Gilbert. If this is not feasible for the participant,&#xD;
      surveys can be taken home and mailed back to the study team upon completion. Baseline surveys&#xD;
      will assess knowledge, beliefs, and motivation to be physically active during the index&#xD;
      pregnancy. In addition, all women will be asked to report physical activity levels during&#xD;
      their pregnancy. In addition to surveys about physical activity during pregnancy, all&#xD;
      participants will also receive a Xaomi Mi Band, a wrist-worn physical activity monitor that&#xD;
      calculates steps and kilocalories expended per day for 30 days at a time. If possible,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to sync the device with their smart phone and text the study team&#xD;
      information regarding their steps and energy expenditure. If this is not feasible, the study&#xD;
      team will meet them once a month at their clinic appointment and sync the data directly to a&#xD;
      portable laptop device. After baseline surveys are complete, each participant will be&#xD;
      randomized to the physical activity group (PAG) or the standard of care group (SOC). The PAG&#xD;
      will receive evidence-based educational information as well as a list of local resources for&#xD;
      pursuing physical activity. Local resources will be provided to the pregnant women in the&#xD;
      study at no charge, thus, financial constraints will not be a barrier to physical activity&#xD;
      during pregnancy for women in the present study. SOC will receive no additional information&#xD;
      beyond standard-of-care brochures and information. At 32-34 weeks gestation, all women will&#xD;
      be surveyed once again regarding knowledge and beliefs, motivation, and physical activity&#xD;
      levels during their pregnancy. The Dietary History Questionnaire II will also be administered&#xD;
      in order to control for dietary differences between groups that could contribute to outcomes&#xD;
      being assessed. In addition to the baseline surveys, all women will be surveyed about&#xD;
      patient-provider communication regarding physical activity during their pregnancy. Outcomes&#xD;
      will be compared between PAG and SOC groups. Prenatal charts will be obtained after infant&#xD;
      delivery. Additional maternal and neonatal outcomes will be examined to determine the effect&#xD;
      of the intervention on outcomes (i.e. gestational weight gain, postpartum weight retention,&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test results, neonatal birth weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence-based educational materials are adopted from previous research that demonstrated&#xD;
      educational materials motivate pregnant women to exercise as well as alter their beliefs&#xD;
      about physical activity during pregnancy The evidence-based brochure has been designed and&#xD;
      made culturally appropriate. Surveys were designed using constructs of the Theory of Planned&#xD;
      Behavior (knowledge and beliefs) and the Protection Motivation Theory and Health Action&#xD;
      Process Approach (motivation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Procedures Repeated measures ANOVAs will be used to compare scores on the&#xD;
      Exercise Belief's Questionnaire I (agree/disagree) and physical activity levels (PPAQ, Mi&#xD;
      Band data) between the two groups before and after the intervention. Motivation outcomes will&#xD;
      be assessed by identifying recurring themes in relation to the Protection Motivation Theory&#xD;
      and Health Action Process Approach and comparing responses between groups. Recurrent themes&#xD;
      will be identified regarding the Exercise Beliefs Questionnaire II, and improvement will be&#xD;
      based on the number of correct responses for each question before and after the intervention.&#xD;
      Patient-provider communication frequency and topic will be compared between the groups using&#xD;
      chi-square tests. All tests will be two-sided with a p-value &lt;0.05 denoting statistical&#xD;
      significance. All data analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 22&#xD;
      (Armonk, New York).&#xD;
