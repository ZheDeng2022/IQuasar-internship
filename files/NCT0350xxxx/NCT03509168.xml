  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open myomectomy remains the principal treatment for symptomatic fibroids in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      countries irrespective of fertility desires. This however has got to be balanced against&#xD;
      potential risks such as profuse hemorrhage; blood loss at open myomectomy remains dreary with&#xD;
      the use of various pharmacologic agents yielding inconclusive results. This trial is aimed at&#xD;
      exploring the benefit of preoperative use of a readily available uterotonic, Misoprostol in&#xD;
      reduction of intraoperative blood loss during open myomectomy with the Null hypothesis&#xD;
      stating: there is no difference in mean blood loss during open myomectomy whether one&#xD;
      preoperatively inserts a single dose of 400mcg vaginal misoprostol or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate hypothesis: single dose 400mcg vaginal Misoprostol given 60 minutes preoperatively&#xD;
      during open myomectomy reduces intra-operative blood loss by at least 20% as measured by&#xD;
      surgical mops and suction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from two referral hospitals in Uganda with symptomatic fibroids and scheduled&#xD;
      for open myomectomy will be recruited. 48 women that meet the inclusion criteria and have&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria and provide signed informed consent will be enrolled. The&#xD;
      screening will be done on the gynecological wards and patients will be randomized to either&#xD;
      the control or interventional arm by means of sealed, sequentially numbered opaque envelopes&#xD;
      containing computer-generated random numbers. Blinding will affect theatre team and patients.&#xD;
      Primary (blood loss as estimated by surgical mops and suction) and secondary endpoints (e.g.&#xD;
      postoperative drop in Hb) will be calculated. Data analysis: Data will be analyzed on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis. Analysis will be done using STATA software 14.0. This will include&#xD;
      descriptive statistics for measures of central tendency and dispersion. Student t-test and&#xD;
      Mann Whitney U test will be used for mean blood loss. Stratification for age, parity,&#xD;
      complaints, total fibroid mass and usage of other intraoperative blood-loss techniques will&#xD;
      be analyzed. categorical data to be analyzed by coefficients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study are meant to better inform clinicians about the use of misoprostol for&#xD;
      this role and possibly include it in the management protocols for open myomectomy in&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan countries where burden of blood products is strained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are the commonest benign gynecological tumors in pre-menopausal women&#xD;
      affecting over 80% of African women by age of 50. Myomas are clinically apparent in&#xD;
      approximately 12 to 25% of reproductive age women and noted coincidentally on pathological&#xD;
      examination in approximately 80% of surgically excised uteri. Fibroids; clinically apparent&#xD;
      in up to one third of women in reproductive age, cause significant morbidity including&#xD;
      prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, dyspareunia and in other&#xD;
      cases, reproductive dysfunction; all of which affect their quality of life. Although, the&#xD;
      definitive mode of management is complete uterine removal (Hysterectomy), a significant&#xD;
      fraction of patients prefer preserving their uterus irrespective of fertility desires.&#xD;
      Myomectomy remains the mainstay of management for such patients. Open myomectomy, is a major&#xD;
      surgical procedure associated with considerable morbidity with significant intraoperative&#xD;
      hemorrhage. Fletcher in 1996 reported that 23% patients undergoing open myomectomy lost over&#xD;
      1000ml of blood. Another study of 91 women who underwent this procedure for uterine size&#xD;
      greater than 16 weeks, the operative blood loss ranged between 50ml and 3000 ml. Other series&#xD;
      reported transfusion rates between 18% and 24%. Surgical hemorrhage may result in anemia,&#xD;
      hypovolemia, and coagulation abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the many advances in therapeutic options for uterine masses, open myomectomy poses&#xD;
      the most efficacious mode of management in resource limited settings for symptomatic relief&#xD;
      in women that wish to preserve their uteri. Laparoscopic myomectomy would offer a relatively&#xD;
      more cosmetic and blood-sparing alternative but the high costs and the need for proficient&#xD;
      personnel have left its advent in developing countries elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous strategies to reduce blood loss during abdominal myomectomy both mechanical and&#xD;
      pharmacologic techniques have been tried but excessive hemorrhage during abdominal myomectomy&#xD;
      remains a challenge to gynecologic surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative prostaglandins, have offered a more reliable and realistic hope in&#xD;
      resource-limited settings to lower intraoperative blood loss. It stimulates uterine&#xD;
      contractions and this leads to occlusion of the vessels supplying blood to the leiomyomas.&#xD;
      These strong myometrial contractions induced by misoprostol indirectly cause relative&#xD;
      avascularity in the myoma and contributes to a reduction in bleeding. This subsequently may&#xD;
      redistribute the blood from the diseased uterus back to the circulation, hence reducing&#xD;
      operative blood loss during abdominal myomectomy. A few studies done have demonstrated safety&#xD;
      and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complications and burden of this hemorrhage are even greater in resource-limited&#xD;
      settings. In Mulago National Referral Hospital, Misoprostol has not been assimilated into the&#xD;
      standard of care for reduction of intraoperative blood loss during open myomectomy. This&#xD;
      study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of Misoprostol in such settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROBLEM STATEMENT Uterine fibroids are major cause of gynaecological clinic attendance&#xD;
      worldwide with approximately 20-30% of females affected. In Uganda, however, the burden of&#xD;
      uterine fibroids across the whole country is not well documented. Unpublished Records from&#xD;
      Mulago hospital, Uganda show that of the 2,088 patients that presented at the gynaecological&#xD;
      outpatient clinic between September 2015 and September 2017, 525 (25.14%) had symptomatic&#xD;
      fibroids. Additionally, gynaecological emergency records reveal that 210 of 16,121 (1.30.%)&#xD;
      emergency patients presented with uterine fibroids within the same period. (Mulago Hospital&#xD;
      records, 2017) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic women complain about abnormal uterine bleeding, dyspareunia cyclic pelvic pain,&#xD;
      and Infertility. Among the women with uterine fibroids who presented to Mulago Hospital&#xD;
      Gynecological department between September 2015 to August 2017, 64 / 525 (12.2%) underwent&#xD;
      open myomectomy. The major contributor to this low myomectomy rate was lack of theatre space&#xD;
      for all consenting patients with uterine fibroids. Other reasons included scarcity of blood&#xD;
      products to book prior to this elective case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study in Nigeria found that post-myomectomy complications ranged from post&#xD;
      operative pyrexia (13.5%), blood loss warranting blood transfusion (12.8%), postoperative&#xD;
      anaemia (10.4%), wound infection (8.7%), vault infection (5.1%) and prolonged hospital stay&#xD;
      (4.2%).Wound dehiscence (2.5%), vesicovaginal fistula (0.3%), ureteric (0.3%) and bladder&#xD;
      injuries (0.6%) were other complications recorded. The postoperative complications also&#xD;
      result in increased costs to the already strained health system. In particular the excessive&#xD;
      blood loss(&gt;1000ml) encountered in open myomectomy poses great challenges to the surgeons in&#xD;
      the current use of tourniquets, preoperative Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)&#xD;
      agonists,clamping of the bilateral uterine and /or ovarian arteries, injection of vasopressin&#xD;
      into myometrium for hemostasis and scarce blood resources. In Mulago hospital, about 42 of 64&#xD;
      (65.6%) women who underwent open myomectomy in 2015/2017 received blood transfusions and 2&#xD;
      (3.0 %) underwent hysterectomies due to intractable intraoperative bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden imposed on a resource-limited health setting with the direly needed scarce blood&#xD;
      products potentially brought by avoidable and feasible measures to reduce blood loss is&#xD;
      imminent. The availability, affordability and minimal side effects of a potentially effective&#xD;
      uterotonic, prostaglandin E1 analogue, Misoprostol offers prospect in resource-constrained&#xD;
      settings. A few studies done show efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is therefore meant to feed the need for a safer and effective method of&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss control within limited resource settings. In addition it will also&#xD;
      contribute to the body of knowledge on use of misoprostol that will guide formation of&#xD;
      national and local health protocols and policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective To determine the efficacy and safety of pre-operative 400mcg vaginal&#xD;
      Misoprostol in the reduction of intra-operative hemorrhage during open myomectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of administration of preoperative 400μg vaginal Misoprostol in&#xD;
           reduction of intraoperative blood loss versus its non-administration during open&#xD;
           myomectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of using preoperative 400μg vaginal Misoprostol during open&#xD;
           myomectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter-randomized double blind controlled trial with a (1:1) allocation ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mulago Referral Hospital (central Uganda) and Lacor hospital (northern Uganda). A review of&#xD;
      theatre records for the complete three months of January, February and March 2017 in each of&#xD;
      these hospitals was done to ascertain the average number of open myomectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mulago National Referral Hospital is situated in Kampala, 2 kilometres from the city centre&#xD;
      and serves as Makerere University College of Health Sciences teaching hospital as well as a&#xD;
      National referral hospital for Uganda. Mulago hospital had eight open myomectomies done&#xD;
      between the start of January and end of March 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      St. Mary's Hospital Lacor is a referral private not-for-profit (PNFP) hospital situated 5km&#xD;
      out of Gulu town and is a Gulu university teaching hospital. It has a 482-bed capacity and&#xD;
      does an average of 467 major surgeries per month. Lacor Hospital managed to perform 36 open&#xD;
      myomectomy cases within the stipulated months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration Duration of Subject Participation Participant accrual to last between 72 to 96&#xD;
      hours depending on the duration of postoperative care. This includes the enrolment or the&#xD;
      preoperative day, the operation day and 48-72 hours follow up post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of study period will be approximately 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' recruitment: this will be ongoing throughout the study period and will only be&#xD;
      halted before if any of the stopping rules are encountered. (Refer to stopping rules ahead)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGET POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women of reproductive age with symptomatic uterine fibroids&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic participants with fibroids going for open myomectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLING PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive sampling as participants with the said symptoms presenting to the respective&#xD;
      health units will be enrolled as they come. Those admitted to the gynecology wards with&#xD;
      symptomatic fibroids scheduled for open myomectomy and meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Participants will be enrolled into the study by proportion proportional to the size&#xD;
      sampling. Participants' pre-operative Hb and anesthetic review to be performed. The research&#xD;
      assistant on site who will then get informed consent for enrollment into study will identify&#xD;
      them. Participants will then be issued a brown envelop or kit initially randomized to either&#xD;
      arm and either administered an Misoprostol tablet or not. Patients in the control arm get the&#xD;
      usual care. The respective research assistant will ensure transportation to and from theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION Sample size estimation for testing mean differences of intraoperative&#xD;
      blood lost between the Misoprostol arm and the non intervention arm;-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size estimation is based on hypothesis that blood loss intra-operatively during&#xD;
           open myomectomy will be comparable between the intervention (400mcg Misoprostol) and the&#xD;
           control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assuming a type 1 error of 5%, power (type II error) of 80% and mean blood loss of&#xD;
           621mls in the placebo arm based on previous studies (Eugene J Kongnyuy &amp; Wiysonge,&#xD;
           2014); and a 20% reduction in blood loss when misoprostol will be used; - N= [(1/q1 +&#xD;
           1/q2) S2(Zα + Zβ)^2] / [μ1 - μ2]^2&#xD;
&#xD;
      N = (1/0.5 + 1/0.5)(121)2(1.96 + 0.84)2&#xD;
&#xD;
      N = 21 participants in each arm. Considering 10% estimation of loss to follow up Adjusted&#xD;
      sample size = 23 participants in each arm Total estimated sample size = 46 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION Sequence generation and Randomization Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either control or experimental group with a 1:1 allocation as per a computer generated&#xD;
      randomization schedule stratified by site using permuted blocks of random sizes. An&#xD;
      independent statistician will be responsible for this generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment In order to protect the randomization code until a participant has&#xD;
      irrevocably been enrolled into the trial, the trial assistants at both sites will receive&#xD;
      codes from trial statistician for each study kit of trial medicines per participant&#xD;
      enrollment. Only the manufacturer (who will not participate in participant enrollment) and&#xD;
      trial statistician will have access to the linked data of the study kit serial numbers and&#xD;
      randomization of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permuted blocked randomization with two arms so as to ensure a balance of numbers in each&#xD;
      group will be used. Block randomization to be achieved by a computer generated sequence&#xD;
      operated by the statistician. The computer-generated list of interventions will consist of&#xD;
      blocks containing 400mcg Misoprostol and others without Misoprostol. A block size of 6 will&#xD;
      be used. This will be divided into smaller blocks of 4:2 and will be changed along the way to&#xD;
      avoid predicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation to each block will be made and patients allocated as per the flow of the&#xD;
      block sequence indicated so as to achieve allocation concealment. This will ensure even&#xD;
      distribution in both arms of the study. Study assistants will submit the patient's&#xD;
      identification to the principal investigator who will transfer them to the statistician to&#xD;
      enter these against the intervention allocated thus keeping the randomization code unknown to&#xD;
      the study assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding single blind randomized controlled trial. Blinding will both patients and the&#xD;
      theatre team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prepackaged sample of Misoprostol in sequentially numbered brown envelopes will be availed to&#xD;
      the study assistant and administered to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment assignment kit will be concealed until the participant is enrolled into the&#xD;
      study through sending of serialized kits with no (random assignment) revealing information to&#xD;
      the onsite pharmacists. This will ensure that the person enrolling participants does not know&#xD;
      in advance which trial arm the next person will get, thus shielding knowledge of forthcoming&#xD;
      assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of interventional drug Misoprostol (Cytotec®: trade name of Pfizer) is formulated&#xD;
      as a white hexagonal tablet. It is supplied as a blister pack. Each tablet contains 200-mcg&#xD;
      Misoprostol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage regimen All participants who are eligible for enrollment and have given consent, will&#xD;
      then be randomized to either Misoprostol or control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, single dose vaginal 400mcg Misoprostol will be administered 60&#xD;
      minutes preoperatively and those in the control group will not receive any misoprostol. The&#xD;
      individuals in the control arm of this study will be given the standard of care at each of&#xD;
      the study sites which entails non administration of misoprostol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Withdrawal Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant included in the study, will be withdrawn from scheduled treatment if any of the&#xD;
      following criteria is observed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe adverse events (AEs) with severity grade &gt; 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse events (SAEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the request of the participant (withdrawal of consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the discretion of the principal investigator Participants who are withdrawn from the&#xD;
           study will be replaced. Patients who have withdrawn due to non-compliance will be&#xD;
           receiving the standard of care outside the trial framework. In case of AEs or SAEs,&#xD;
           whenever possible, they will be followed up for safety assessments until the clinical&#xD;
           problems have resolved. Reasons for their withdrawal will be fully documented in the&#xD;
           case report form (CRF) Adverse Event Assessments A complete physical examination will be&#xD;
           carried out on all participants recruited and will involve, a general and a systemic&#xD;
           examination. Safety and tolerability of the trial procedure will be assessed based on&#xD;
           clinical and laboratory assessments during follow up, according to NIH/NCI Common&#xD;
           Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. (CTCAE 2010) Adverse events will be&#xD;
           recorded during the study period. The information on the occurrence of all adverse&#xD;
           events will be obtained by questioning plus results recorded at physical examination.&#xD;
           All AEs will be recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the CRF/data collection tool with&#xD;
           the following information: duration (start and end dates); severity grade (mild,&#xD;
           moderate, severe); pattern, causality (relationship to the study drugs) and action(s)&#xD;
           taken and, as relevant, the endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity/Severity: classification according to the NIH/NCI CTCAE into grade 1 (mild), 2&#xD;
      (moderate), 3 (severe) and 4 (potential life-threatening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will comment (in the respective section of the CRF) on any change compared&#xD;
      to baselines that are considered as clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Event The investigator will report serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAEs) occurring or observed during the period of the study to the Data Safety and&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (DSMC). As soon as an SAE has been noted, the alert form must be sent by&#xD;
      phone call (then, send via email) within 24 hours after the SAE has been noted, this will be&#xD;
      followed by &quot;Serious Adverse Event Report&quot; form (copies included in the Investigator's File)&#xD;
      within 5 working days. In case of incomplete information, the investigator has to provide&#xD;
      follow-up information as soon as possible, again using the SAE report form. Information will&#xD;
      include participants' details, participant study number, date of administration, participant&#xD;
      hospital number, study drug taken, onset of event, type of adverse event, classification of&#xD;
      adverse event, relationship to study agent, unexpectedness, and follow-up. The principal&#xD;
      investigator will provide the SAE report to National Ethics Committee if required. All SAE&#xD;
      will also be record in AE page of the data collection form or Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS PLAN Data collection and entry Data will be collected using a&#xD;
      pretested questionnaire that the study investigator and assistants completed. The research&#xD;
      assistant will follow the participant to theatre and gather information on the details of the&#xD;
      procedure as directed by the CRF. The assistant will follow through to estimate the blood&#xD;
      lost. Completeness and accuracy of the data will be checked daily and organized before&#xD;
      storage. The principal investigator will clean, compile, code, store and double-enter the&#xD;
      data into a computer data base using Epidata, which will then be analyzed on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis using STATA Data Handling and Record Keeping All trial data will be&#xD;
      recorded on the collection tools or CRF (appendix III). Only the investigators and authorized&#xD;
      co-workers, according to the list of Authorized Signatory Form (ASF), are authorized to make&#xD;
      entries on the CRFs. CRFs should be completed in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completed data collection tools will be dated and signed by the investigator All clinical&#xD;
      data will be entered into hospital sheet from where back-translation will be made into the&#xD;
      collection tools. Original lab data will be attached in hospital file and only the results&#xD;
      will be transferred into data collection tools. Data collection tools will be kept under lock&#xD;
      and key.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the collection tools by the investigator, the clinical monitor will&#xD;
      review for completeness and accuracy before sending them to the statistician. The data will&#xD;
      be double entered into a database (Epi-data software version 3.1) where computer checks are&#xD;
      used to identify selected protocol violations and data errors. Requests for clarifications or&#xD;
      correction will be sent to the investigator, if necessary. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out after all enquiries have been done and data has been locked. ID number&#xD;
      (randomization number) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS Description of Statistical Methods Data Analysis will be done using&#xD;
      STATA version 14.0 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent variables All primary and secondary endpoints for efficacy will be summarized using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics for measurements of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion&#xD;
      (standard deviation, range, 95% C.I. values) or frequency and percentage, where appropriate.&#xD;
      The main analysis of efficacy parameters will be done using the intention-to-treat approach.&#xD;
      The student's t-test or Mann Whitney U test will be used to assess for difference in mean&#xD;
      blood loss. A 95% confidence interval will be used and the coefficients between the two&#xD;
      groups for mean intraoperative blood loss, mean in the difference of pre- and post-operative&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels, mean duration of operation and transfusion rates will be analyzed as a&#xD;
      measure of association. Significance will be denoted with a p value of 0.05 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints for safety will be summarized descriptively. AEs will be summarized with&#xD;
      descriptive measures by time point (mean, median and standard deviation, range or 95% C.I.&#xD;
      values) and classifications according to the reference ranges. The main analysis for safety&#xD;
      variables will be done using the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. Comparison of categorical&#xD;
      variables (incidence of adverse events) between the two treatment groups will be done using&#xD;
      χ2 or Fisher exact test. A table summarizing adverse events and tolerability will be&#xD;
      generated. The endpoints will then be compared using a log rank test to determine if&#xD;
      differences were statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables Stratification will be done to assess independent effects of&#xD;
      participants' characteristics on the different endpoints. Risk estimates for multiple strata&#xD;
      will be examined using Mantel Haenzel (MH) estimates of the RR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figures and tables to present will include: Baseline Characteristics, Effect of misoprostol&#xD;
      and standard care on mean amount of intraoperative blood loss, mean difference in hemoglobin&#xD;
      concentration and operation times and parameters to indicate drug safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct Access to Source Data/Documents The investigator will provide written agreement that&#xD;
      the investigator/institution will permit clinical monitors, institutional review board (IRB)&#xD;
      review, and regulatory inspection with direct access to source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control/Quality Assurance This study will be conducted in accordance with &quot;Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice&quot; (GCP) and all applicable regulatory requirements, including the latest&#xD;
      version of the Declaration of Helsinki (October 2013) The investigator will implement and&#xD;
      maintain quality assurance and quality control systems with written Standard Operating&#xD;
      Procedures (SOPs) to assure the trial is conducted and data are generated, recorded, and&#xD;
      reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial team will consist of 5 research nurses, a principal investigator and 2 trial&#xD;
      clinical monitors. The research nurses will poses at least a diploma course in nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the trial, the investigator will ensure that all research personnel&#xD;
      have gone through training in accordance with GCP. They will have revisions of drug&#xD;
      administration and infection control. There will be a post-test to evaluate competence of&#xD;
      research personnel before they can be involved in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the enrollment of any participant at the site, the investigator will review the&#xD;
      protocol and all trial related procedures, information of study drugs, procedures for&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, procedures for reporting adverse experiences and procedures for&#xD;
      completing the data collection tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized digital weighing scales calibrated to two decimal points in grams will be&#xD;
      availed to each of the sites. These will be reset to zero prior to every reading. Pre-weighed&#xD;
      disposable dry mops will be used for each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical monitor on a regular basis will schedule site-monitoring visits. During these&#xD;
      visits, information recorded in the collection tools will be verified against source&#xD;
      documents for accuracy and completion. The clinical monitor will review the informed consent&#xD;
      procedure, product accountability and storage, trial documents and trial progress. The&#xD;
      clinical monitor will verify that the investigator follows the approved protocol or&#xD;
      amendments (if any), she/he will observe trial procedures and will discuss any problems with&#xD;
      the investigator. Monitoring visits will be recorded in the Monitoring Log at the&#xD;
      investigator's site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification (verification of data by comparing collection tools' entries with&#xD;
      original laboratory reports and other participant records of the investigator): All data will&#xD;
      be checked for each participant. These will include: participant identification, informed&#xD;
      consent, selection criteria, drug administration, adverse events, primary and secondary&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety parameters. The investigator will arrange for the retention of the&#xD;
      Participant Identification List for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of&#xD;
      the trial. The investigator is required to retain all participant files and source documents&#xD;
      for 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SAFETY The data will be stored onto two separate drives and flash discs that are to be&#xD;
      kept in separate and secure places. A questionnaire pre-test will be carried out before the&#xD;
      study formally commences to recruit study personnel. They will be trained on the use of the&#xD;
      questionnaire, patient approach, blinding, intervention administration, as well as assessment&#xD;
      and monitoring for treatment success and failures. The questionnaires will be re-examined by&#xD;
      the researcher to avoid any mistakes that will have been overlooked by the research&#xD;
      assistants, before data compilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE AND SAFETY MONITORING Data Safety and Monitoring Committee&#xD;
      (DSMC) Members of Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be composed of five members&#xD;
      consisting of independent clinical experts. No investigator directly involved in the care of&#xD;
      the subjects recruited will be a member of the DSMC. Ad hoc meetings can be convened if&#xD;
      necessary. The principal investigator will be responsible for continuous close monitoring of&#xD;
      all adverse effects that might occur on recruited subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Data Protection and Confidentiality The investigator and other members of the&#xD;
      study team will keep confidential any information related to this study and all data and&#xD;
      records generated in the course of conducting the study, and will not use the information,&#xD;
      data, or records for any purpose other than those specified in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools or other documents will identify a patient by initials and number only.&#xD;
      The investigator will keep in his file a Patient Identification List and Screening/Enrollment&#xD;
      Log. At all times records will be referred to by code and not by name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analyses will be done once (at the midpoint of participant recruitment) during the&#xD;
      trial to assess recruitment and safety of the participants on the study.The interim analysis&#xD;
      will be done by an independent statistician on the DSMC and will consider the following&#xD;
      stopping rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STOPPING RULES Pocock's approach of stopping rules will be used as it offers the same&#xD;
      significance level at the interim analysis and final trial trial data analysis. This study&#xD;
      will be halted if; -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standards of care in the control of bleeding during open myomectomy change to involve&#xD;
           preoperative misoprostol use prior to completion and publishing of the research results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean difference in blood loss between the placebo arm and intervention arm is more than&#xD;
           30 % at interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lethality from intervention. Evidence of death of any participant from usage of vaginal&#xD;
           misoprostol will culminate into immediate halt of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permission from regulatory/supervising bodies will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality assurances The information provided by the patients will remain confidential.&#xD;
      Nobody except principal investigator will have access to it. A study number known to the&#xD;
      patient and the study personnel will be used instead of the name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No Conflicts of Interest to declare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Information and Informed Consent All potential participants will be provided&#xD;
      information regarding the study and allowed to make decisions of whether to participate or&#xD;
      not with assurances of no compromise in care provided. Research assistants who will not be&#xD;
      part of the care team will be involved in this screening of participants to minimize biases&#xD;
      in recruitment&#xD;
