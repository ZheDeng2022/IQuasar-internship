    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of an HIV-1 RNA testing intervention targeting adult&#xD;
      patients aged 18-39 years who seek urgent care for symptoms at primary care facilities and&#xD;
      meet specific risk criteria for acute HIV infection. All newly diagnosed HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients in the intervention arm will be linked to care and offered both immediate treatment&#xD;
      and assisted partner notification. Partners will also be tested using the HIV testing&#xD;
      intervention, and pre-exposure prophylaxis will be offered to uninfected individuals with&#xD;
      HIV-infected partners. The cost-effectiveness of this intervention will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept study comparing outcomes of a health facility-based acute HIV&#xD;
      infection (AHI) and prevalent HIV testing intervention using point of care HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      detection, combined with assisted partner services (aPS) and follow-up in an antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) cohort for all newly diagnosed individuals and follow-up in a pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) cohort for the uninfected partners of newly diagnosed individuals,&#xD;
      compared to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized stepped-wedge study with prospective cohort follow-up of all&#xD;
      individuals newly diagnosed with acute or prevalent HIV infection and of up to 300 identified&#xD;
      partners of these persons. Individuals enrolled in the observation phase will be compared to&#xD;
      those enrolled in the intervention phase at each facility, after undergoing the following&#xD;
      procedures in each phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study population will be recruited from among male and female adult&#xD;
      patients who present for care at 6 public or private outpatient clinics in coastal Kenya.&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria for the HIV-1 RNA testing intervention include: 1) age from 18-39 years;&#xD;
      2) not previously diagnosed with HIV infection; and 3) a score ≥2 on our AHI risk score&#xD;
      algorithm. Eligibility criteria for partners of newly diagnosed cases with acute or prevalent&#xD;
      HIV infection include: 1) age over 18 years; and 2) not previously diagnosed with HIV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 3,175 study participants total, including 2,875 participants in the&#xD;
      stepped-wedge study (1,375 in the observation period and 1,500 in the intervention period).&#xD;
      We estimate that approximately 2% of participants in the observation period (n=28) and&#xD;
      approximately 5% of participants in the intervention period (n=75) will test positive for HIV&#xD;
      infection and continue in the study. We estimate that up to 300 partners of newly diagnosed&#xD;
      individuals will be offered enrollment and tested for HIV using standard tests (observation&#xD;
      period) or HIV-1 RNA testing (intervention period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating Sites: Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Wellcome Trust Programme,&#xD;
      Kilifi, Kenya with stepped wedge trial implementation at 6 community health facilities (2-4&#xD;
      public, 2-4 private) and ART and PrEP cohort follow-up at the KEMRI Research Clinic in&#xD;
      Mtwapa, Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of Procedures: Individuals eligible for the HIV-1 RNA testing intervention will be&#xD;
      offered enrollment when they seek care at one of the study facilities, with testing taking&#xD;
      place on that same day. For individuals with negative test results for both acute and&#xD;
      prevalent HIV infection, no further follow-up will occur. One 6-week follow-up visit will&#xD;
      occur after testing for all individuals who are newly diagnosed with HIV. Procedures for the&#xD;
      aPS intervention, the ART cohort, and the PrEP cohort are detailed in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Study enrollment will occur over 24 months. Following enrollment and study&#xD;
      procedures (1-2 hours of time), all participants who test negative for HIV infection will&#xD;
      have no further visits. All participants newly diagnosed with HIV will have a 6-week&#xD;
      follow-up visit. All participants who enroll in the ART or PrEP cohort will be followed for a&#xD;
      total of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Testing for acute and prevalent HIV infection, followed by partner notification&#xD;
      services and immediate ART (provided by the Kenyan Ministry of Health) for newly diagnosed&#xD;
      individuals and PrEP (provided by Gilead) for uninfected partners in serodiscordant&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
