      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate anesthetic efficacy and overall patient experience with use of Kovanaze&#xD;
      tetracaine/oxymetazoline nasal spray for root canal treatment of vital premolar and anterior&#xD;
      teeth needing root canal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 adult patients with a vital upper anterior or premolar tooth (#4-13) with a diagnosis&#xD;
      indicating need root canal treatment and who are seeking treatment in the UNC Chapel Hill&#xD;
      School of Dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualifying patients will be anesthetized with tetracaine/oxymetazoline nasal spray anesthetic&#xD;
      in order to facilitate completion of their clinically required, standard of care root canal&#xD;
      treatment. Research procedures include blood pressure monitoring and pain assessment using a&#xD;
      visual analogue pain scale.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be undertaken in the UNC Chapel Hill School of Dentistry student clinics.&#xD;
      Eligible patients seeking treatment at the School of Dentistry will be recruited to the study&#xD;
      and written informed consent obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operator Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operators will obtain online and in person training to ensure consistent, accurate use of the&#xD;
      nasal spray. Anesthesia of all study subjects will be performed by UNC Chapel Hill Graduate&#xD;
      Endodontics residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of thirty adult subjects (&gt;18years old) seeking endodontic treatment will be&#xD;
      recruited to the study. Inclusion criteria are: American Society of Anesthesiologists class I&#xD;
      or II; Preoperative heart rate of 55 to 100 beats per minute; a maximum blood pressure&#xD;
      reading of 166/100 mmHg; maxillary anterior tooth or premolar with a diagnosis or treatment&#xD;
      plan which indicates root canal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are based on recommendations made by the FDA label as well the adverse&#xD;
      effects reported in prior clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History, examination, and recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information including history of present illness, vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure)&#xD;
      and medical history will be obtained. Standardized, calibrated examiners will perform a&#xD;
      standard endodontic clinical exam including the response to cold ascertained using a cold&#xD;
      stimulus (EndoIce, Colt√®ne/Whaledent, Cuyahoga Falls, OH). Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from patients who meet the study criteria and agree to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients will be asked to rate their current pain on a 100 mm Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale. No pain will correspond to 0 mm, mild pain as less than 30 mm, moderate to severe pain&#xD;
      from 30 to 100 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two intranasal sprays of anesthetic (each spray 6mg tetracaine HCl, 0.1mg oxymetazoline) will&#xD;
      be administered 4 minutes apart on the side of the tooth to be treated. After an interval of&#xD;
      10 minutes, pulpal anesthesia will be ascertained by re-evaluating pain level with the VAS&#xD;
      scale, as well as application of a cold stimulus. If adequate pulpal anesthesia is noted, the&#xD;
      operator will commence with treatment. If the patient has a positive response to cold&#xD;
      stimulus on the tooth or a persisting spontaneous moderate to severe pain on the VAS, then a&#xD;
      third spray of tetracaine/oxymetazoline will be administered. After a time interval of 4&#xD;
      minutes the operator will again test for pulpal anesthesia. If at this point pulpal&#xD;
      anesthesia is not noted then the failure to obtain adequate anesthesia will be recorded and&#xD;
      rescue anesthesia will be provided. Root canal treatment will be initiated immediately once&#xD;
      pulpal anesthesia has been ascertained. A timer will be started at this point in order to&#xD;
      record any subsequent time of failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tooth will be isolated with a rubber dam and the pulp chamber will be accessed with a&#xD;
      high-speed dental handpiece. Standard root canal treatment will subsequently be initiated and&#xD;
      performed. If at any point during treatment the patient feels pain, the procedure will be&#xD;
      stopped and pain intensity will be assessed via the aforementioned VAS pain scale. A reported&#xD;
      moderate to severe pain score will necessitate additional anesthetic. The stage and time&#xD;
      after initiation of treatment that pain occurred (access, instrumentation, or obturation)&#xD;
      will be recorded. After three tetracaine/oxymetazoline sprays, rescue anesthesia will be&#xD;
      administered if a moderate to severe pain score persists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success will be defined as ability to perform complete cleaning and shaping of the tooth's&#xD;
      root(s). If additional rescue anesthesia is required at any point in during treatment, the&#xD;
      nasal spray anesthesia will be considered a failure. If rescue anesthesia is required during&#xD;
      subsequent stages of treatment, the stage will be recorded for subjective documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exact binomial test with a nominal 0.05 two-sided significance level will have 93% power&#xD;
      to detect the difference between the null hypothesis proportion of 0.5 (random chance) and&#xD;
      the alternative proportion of 0.8 when the sample size is 30. Secondary analysis will&#xD;
      evaluate the proportion of patients that demonstrated sufficient pulpal anesthesia to&#xD;
      commence treatment. For patients who required rescue anesthesia, the stage of treatment and&#xD;
      time until rescue was needed will be analyzed. The success rate of premolars vs. anterior&#xD;
      teeth will also be evaluated.&#xD;
