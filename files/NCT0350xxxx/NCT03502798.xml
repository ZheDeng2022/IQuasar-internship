  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a low coherence interferometry (LCI) endoscopic probe&#xD;
      that can examine the cervix for evidence of cervical dysplasia. The device will make optical&#xD;
      measurements of the cervix to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the difference between two different types of cervical cells: ectocervical cells and&#xD;
           endocervical cells. Cervical dysplasia is most likely to occur at the junction between&#xD;
           these two types of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. features of individual cervical cells that indicate whether the cell is normal or&#xD;
           abnormal (cervical dysplasia).&#xD;

    <measure>Sensitivity of Scanning a/LCI Probe to Detect Cervical Dysplasia as Measured by Percentage of Correctly Identified Positive Biopsies</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity of the scanning a/LCI probe's ability to detect cervical dysplasia determined by calculating the percentage of correctly identified positive optical biopsies measured by the scanning a/LCI probe when compared to the gold standard, histopathology.&#xD;
There are two dichotomies of classification used in this study: one that focuses on the morphological differences between cells (histology-based classification), and one that focuses on the urgency of corresponding treatment (response-based classification). In the histology-based classification, a result of benign alone is a negative result and a result of LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) or HSIL (high-grade squamous epithelial lesion) is a positive result. In the response-based classification, both benign and LSIL are treated as negative results and HSIL is treated as a positive result.</description>

          <title>Scanning a/LCI (Pilot)</title>
          <description>Pilot study conducted at Duke University (Durham, NC). Exclusion criteria included: current gynecological infection or discharge, prior cervical surgery, or positive urine pregnancy test. The scanning a/LCI probe was inserted into the vagina and placed against the cervix using direct visualization provided by a white light camera incorporated into the probe. Optical interferometric data were acquired to characterize the instrument's ability to detect cervical dysplasia via depth-resolved nuclear morphology measurements.</description>

          <title>Scanning a/LCI (Jacobi)</title>
          <description>Primary arm of present study, conducted at New York City Health + Hospitals / Jacobi (Bronx, New York, NY). Exclusion criteria included: current gynecological infection or discharge, prior cervical surgery, or positive urine pregnancy test. In addition, participants abstained from sexual intercourse for at least 24 hours prior to the study visit.&#xD;
A speculum was inserted prior to the a/LCI probe for ease of tissue biopsy collection after a/LCI scanning. The scanning a/LCI probe was inserted through speculum and placed against the cervix using white light visual guidance from the probe's integrated camera. The a/LCI imaging sequence was initiated, with 36 scan points spaced across an area of 50 mm2. 80 a/LCI optical biopsy scans were at 4 selected biopsy sites (20 per quadrant). The a/LCI probe was removed and a Wallach colposcope was used to take a digital image of the cervix for co-registration with the a/LCI image. Some women underwent a previously scheduled loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) immediately following data collection; tissue biopsies were taken either with the assistance of the colposcope or during the LEEP and all specimens were analyzed by pathologists to provide a histological diagnosis for comparison with the a/LCI measurements. Tissue biopsies for each quadrant were assigned a classification (negative, CIN-1, CIN-2, or CIN-3) as well as notes for any additional findings (koilocytic atypia, abnormal acetowhite epithelium, etc.).</description>

        <title>Sensitivity of Scanning a/LCI Probe to Detect Cervical Dysplasia as Measured by Percentage of Correctly Identified Positive Biopsies</title>
        <description>Sensitivity of the scanning a/LCI probe's ability to detect cervical dysplasia determined by calculating the percentage of correctly identified positive optical biopsies measured by the scanning a/LCI probe when compared to the gold standard, histopathology.&#xD;
There are two dichotomies of classification used in this study: one that focuses on the morphological differences between cells (histology-based classification), and one that focuses on the urgency of corresponding treatment (response-based classification). In the histology-based classification, a result of benign alone is a negative result and a result of LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) or HSIL (high-grade squamous epithelial lesion) is a positive result. In the response-based classification, both benign and LSIL are treated as negative results and HSIL is treated as a positive result.</description>
        <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
        <population>40 women enrolled at the Jacobi site, but successful a/LCI scans were only acquired from 20 participants due to equipment failures (mechanical breaks in probe, electrical component failures, software errors). For each participant analyzed, optical biopsies (a/LCI scans) and corresponding physical tissue biopsies were collected at four sites (12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock). No pilot study participants were analyzed as no physical tissue biopsies were done in the pilot phase.</population>

            <description>Primary arm of present study, conducted at New York City Health + Hospitals / Jacobi (Bronx, New York, NY). Exclusion criteria included: current gynecological infection or discharge, prior cervical surgery, or positive urine pregnancy test. In addition, participants abstained from sexual intercourse for at least 24 hours prior to the study visit.&#xD;
A speculum was inserted prior to the a/LCI probe for ease of tissue biopsy collection after a/LCI scanning. The scanning a/LCI probe was inserted through speculum and placed against the cervix using white light visual guidance from the probe's integrated camera. The a/LCI imaging sequence was initiated, with 36 scan points spaced across an area of 50 mm2. 80 a/LCI optical biopsy scans were at 4 selected biopsy sites (20 per quadrant). The a/LCI probe was removed and a Wallach colposcope was used to take a digital image of the cervix for co-registration with the a/LCI image. Some women underwent a previously scheduled loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) immediately following data collection; tissue biopsies were taken either with the assistance of the colposcope or during the LEEP and all specimens were analyzed by pathologists to provide a histological diagnosis for comparison with the a/LCI measurements. Tissue biopsies for each quadrant were assigned a classification (negative, CIN-1, CIN-2, or CIN-3) as well as notes for any additional findings (koilocytic atypia, abnormal acetowhite epithelium, etc.).</description>

          <title>Scanning a/LCI (Pilot)</title>
          <description>Pilot study conducted at Duke University (Durham, NC). Exclusion criteria included: current gynecological infection or discharge, prior cervical surgery, or positive urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
The scanning a/LCI probe was inserted into the vagina and placed against the cervix using direct visualization provided by a white light camera incorporated into the probe. Optical interferometric data were acquired to characterize the instrument's ability to detect cervical dysplasia via depth-resolved nuclear morphology measurements.</description>

          <title>Scanning a/LCI (Jacobi)</title>
          <description>Primary arm of present study, conducted at New York City Health + Hospitals / Jacobi (Bronx, New York, NY). Exclusion criteria included: current gynecological infection or discharge, prior cervical surgery, or positive urine pregnancy test. In addition, participants abstained from sexual intercourse for at least 24 hours prior to the study visit.&#xD;
A speculum was inserted prior to the a/LCI probe for ease of tissue biopsy collection after a/LCI scanning. The scanning a/LCI probe was inserted through speculum and placed against the cervix using white light visual guidance from the probe's integrated camera. The a/LCI imaging sequence was initiated, with 36 scan points spaced across an area of 50 mm2. 80 a/LCI optical biopsy scans were at 4 selected biopsy sites (20 per quadrant). The a/LCI probe was removed and a Wallach colposcope was used to take a digital image of the cervix for co-registration with the a/LCI image. Some women underwent a previously scheduled loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) immediately following data collection; tissue biopsies were taken either with the assistance of the colposcope or during the LEEP and all specimens were analyzed by pathologists to provide a histological diagnosis for comparison with the a/LCI measurements. Tissue biopsies for each quadrant were assigned a classification (negative, CIN-1, CIN-2, or CIN-3) as well as notes for any additional findings (koilocytic atypia, abnormal acetowhite epithelium, etc.).</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The fragility of the instrument resulted in repeated breakage. Traveling from Durham to NYC to retrieve the broken instrument, repair it, and send it back several times set the timeline back substantially, resulting in insufficient time to perform the secondary outcome measure.&#xD;
Instrument fragility, complexity of instrument set up and initiation, and poor signal quality are responsible for the low yield of evaluable a/LCI scans.</limitations_and_caveats>
