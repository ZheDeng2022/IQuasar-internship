  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New and creative approaches are needed to address childhood obesity. Current strategies&#xD;
      result in suboptimal outcomes and are intensive and costly. It has been theorized that&#xD;
      overeating, may have addictive qualities, although few weight management interventions have&#xD;
      tested therapeutic techniques founded on addiction medicine principles, such as, withdrawal,&#xD;
      tolerance and craving control1, 2. A pilot study utilizing an addiction model based mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) weight-loss intervention in adolescents showed that the app intervention&#xD;
      reduced BMI Z-score (zBMI) to a greater extent than youth participating in an in-clinic&#xD;
      multidisciplinary weight management intervention, and appeared to be a cost-effective, labor&#xD;
      efficient method for adolescent weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed multi-site randomized control trial (RCT) will test the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      addiction-based weight loss intervention, embodied first as a smartphone app with telephone&#xD;
      coaching and second as an identical approach phone-coaching alone intervention compared to&#xD;
      age matched controls participating in an in-clinic weight management interventions in a&#xD;
      larger sample of economically, racially and ethnically diverse adolescents (ages 14-18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and eighty adolescents will be recruited from pediatric interdisciplinary weight&#xD;
      management clinics operating out of five different hospital systems in Southern California&#xD;
      and through targeted mailing to 40 ethnically, racially and economically diverse&#xD;
      neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. The adolescents will be randomized 1:1 via stratified&#xD;
      block randomization to either receive 1) interactive addiction model based mobile health&#xD;
      (mHealth) weight-loss intervention with personalized phone-coaching (AppCoach), 2)&#xD;
      interactive addiction model based mHealth weight-loss intervention alone (App) or 3)&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary in-clinic weight management program (Clinic). Assessment of the&#xD;
      intervention's effect on zBMI and percent over the 95th percentile (%BMIp95), fasting&#xD;
      metabolic parameters, addictive eating habits, executive function, and motivation for change&#xD;
      will be obtained at enrollment, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months (1 year post intervention follow up).&#xD;
      In addition, a real-life economic analysis (cost, cost-saving and non-monetary benefits)&#xD;
      analysis will be completed comparing AppCoach to 1) App and 2) Clinic. We will further&#xD;
      explore whether primary and secondary outcomes differ by race and whether race moderates the&#xD;
      relationship between initial intervention efficacy and prolonged weight maintenance.&#xD;

      Aim 1 (Primary Outcomes): To test the effectiveness of an addiction-based weight loss&#xD;
      intervention, embodied first as a smartphone app with telephone coaching (AppCoach) compared&#xD;
      to (1) addiction model based weight-loss app alone (App) and (2) multi-disciplinary in-clinic&#xD;
      weight loss intervention (Clinic) on weight outcomes of overweight and obese adolescents at&#xD;
      3, 6, 12 and 18 months post enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Participants who complete the six month AppCoach will have a greater decrease&#xD;
      in their zBMI and %BMIp95 compared to baseline at completion of the 6 months intervention,&#xD;
      than those receiving App or Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: Participants who completed the six month AppCoach will have greater decrease&#xD;
      in their zBMI and %BMIp95 compared to baseline at 6 and 12 months post intervention&#xD;
      completion compared to App and Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Secondary Outcomes): To compare the effects of AppCoach on addictive eating behaviors,&#xD;
      motivation and self-regulatory behaviors at completion of the intervention and 6 and 12&#xD;
      months post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Compared to App or Clinic, AppCoach will result in lower YFAS-c scores, higher&#xD;
      motivation and improved self- regulatory behaviors scores when evaluated at completion of the&#xD;
      intervention and 6 and 12 months post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (Mediators): To test whether baseline traits and behaviors mediate the effect of&#xD;
      AppCoach compared to App and Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Higher baseline YFAS-c scores lower executive function scores and previous&#xD;
      history with mobile platforms will mediate the efficacy of AppCoach and App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To conduct a real-life economic analysis (costs, cost-savings and non-monetary&#xD;
      benefits) of delivering AppCoach compared to 1) App and 2) Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: An addiction-based weight loss mHealth intervention will be more cost-effective&#xD;
      than weight-loss coaching alone and in-person delivery of multidisciplinary weight-loss&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
