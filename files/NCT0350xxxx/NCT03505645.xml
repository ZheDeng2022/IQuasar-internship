      Study Background Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common degenerative musculoskeletal&#xD;
      condition which affects nearly five million people in the United Kingdom. Some patients will&#xD;
      require total knee replacement surgery if their symptoms of pain and disability are not&#xD;
      controlled adequately by so-called 'conservative' measures such as weight-loss, activity&#xD;
      modification and analgesic (pain-killer) medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past ten years our understanding of pain-relief strategies during total knee&#xD;
      replacement, often termed 'Enhanced Recovery' principles, has helped improve patient care and&#xD;
      reduced length of hospital admission. 'Enhanced Recovery' principles recommend the use of&#xD;
      analgesic medications which can be delivered in a variety of ways e.g. tablets and&#xD;
      injections. This is termed 'multi-modal' analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to total knee replacement, the patient will receive an injection around the nerves in&#xD;
      the spine (regional anaesthesia) which numbs the patient from the waist down and allows the&#xD;
      surgeon to perform the operation in a safe and pain-free manner. During the operation,&#xD;
      surgeons often choose to deliver extra local anaesthetic to prolong the degree of pain-relief&#xD;
      in the immediate post-operative period. This can enable patients to mobilise early and is&#xD;
      associated with greater long-term satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main methods of delivering this extra form of pain-relief during the operation.&#xD;
      Peri-articular injection involves multiple injections of local anaesthetic into the&#xD;
      soft-tissues surround the knee. In contrast, Intra-articular injection involves a single&#xD;
      injection directly into the knee joint once the operation is finished. Currently, there is no&#xD;
      clear evidence available to Orthopaedic surgeons to inform us which technique is better at&#xD;
      providing pain relief for patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in this study. We intend to recruit a total of 120 patients. During&#xD;
      the patient's total knee replacement surgery, they shall receive an injection of local&#xD;
      anaesthetic around the soft-tissues of the knee (Peri-Articular Injection) or directly into&#xD;
      the knee joint itself (Intra-Articular Injection). The decision regarding which treatment&#xD;
      they receive is decided entirely by randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the operation, a member of the research team will assess the patient on the ward to&#xD;
      collect information regarding levels of pain and overall satisfaction. The type of injection&#xD;
      received shall be kept secret from both the patient and the member of the research team&#xD;
      collecting the post-operative pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient has been safely discharged from hospital, we intend to follow-up all&#xD;
      participants for one year. This will involve routine clinic appointments at six weeks and&#xD;
      twelve months following surgery. This will involve review and clinical examination by a&#xD;
      member of the orthopaedic team who have treated the patient whilst in hospital and/or a&#xD;
      member of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, all patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire at twelve months&#xD;
      regarding their level of function and pain. These questionnaires have been used widely in the&#xD;
      medical literature and have a strong evidence base for their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the aim of this study? The aim of this study is compare the amount of pain relief&#xD;
      provided by two different methods of local anaesthetic injection techniques used in total&#xD;
      knee replacement surgery. In addition, we would like to know if this influences the patient's&#xD;
      immediate and long-term recovery after surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is compare the amount of post-operative pain relief provided by two&#xD;
      different methods of local anaesthetic injection techniques used in total knee replacement&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Enhanced Recovery After Surgery' protocols has significantly shortened recovery-time and&#xD;
      length of hospital admission after total knee replacement (TKR). A major factor in this&#xD;
      improvement has been the incorporation of multi- modal therapies which deliver adequate pain&#xD;
      relief, limit post-operative nausea and enable early mobilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral nerve blocks are performed by the anaesthetist immediately prior to surgery. This&#xD;
      involves injecting local anaesthetic around the nerves which supply sensation around the&#xD;
      knee. Injecting directly into the nerve can damage it and lead to significant disability. For&#xD;
      this reason peripheral nerve blocks are often performed under ultrasound guidance. This can&#xD;
      be time-consuming and does not negate the risk of nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-articular infiltration is performed during the operation by the surgeon. In the knee&#xD;
      this involves injecting a solution of local anaesthetic into multiple specified soft-tissue&#xD;
      and bony regions around the knee. It is performed blind without ultrasound guidance and also&#xD;
      carries risk of nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-articular injections involve the surgeon injecting local anaesthetic solution into the&#xD;
      knee joint itself. During TKR, this can be performed after closure of the joint capsule&#xD;
      immediately prior to skin closure. This avoids risks to nerves and arteries as it is placed&#xD;
      into the large knee joint, and not blindly around the joint capsule. In addition, it is&#xD;
      simple to perform and less time-consuming than peri-articular infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised controlled trials have previously compared femoral (peripheral) nerve blocks to&#xD;
      periarticular infiltration, periarticular infiltration with and without posterior capsule&#xD;
      infiltration, and periarticular infiltration to the front versus the back of the knee.&#xD;
      However, to our knowledge the technique of intra-articular injection has not been compared to&#xD;
      peri- articular infiltration for immediate post-operative analgesia following total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design A double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in a single&#xD;
      hospital, with four Consultant Knee Surgeons recruiting patients. It is anticipated from a&#xD;
      previous RCT performed at the same centre, that recruitment be completed within 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants All patients undergoing primary total knee replacement for osteoarthritis under&#xD;
      the care of 4 Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeons at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh will be&#xD;
      assessed for eligibility for study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive trial information (patient information sheet) when they are placed&#xD;
      on the waiting list for TKR. Patients currently wait 12 weeks for surgery. When patients are&#xD;
      reviewed at a pre-assessment clinic 2-4 weeks prior surgery, those who fulfil the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will have the trial explained in full by the research team, supervised by the lead&#xD;
      investigator Ms Chloe Scott, and will decide whether they wish to be involved. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained at this stage. Patients will then have 2-4 weeks before surgery to&#xD;
      opt out of the study if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation Audit of 10 TKR patients measuring VAS pain scores at 6 and 24 hours has&#xD;
      demonstrated a standard deviation of 2.14 points. The minimum clinically important difference&#xD;
      (MCID) for this score is 12mm (1.2 points). Assuming approximate normality for the VAS,&#xD;
      primary outcome data on 102 patients (51 in each arm) will be required for 80% power at 5%&#xD;
      significance. Allowing for a dropout rate of 10%, 120 patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization A total of 120 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      Treatment Group 1 (periarticular infiltration) or Treatment Group 2 (intraarticular&#xD;
      injection) using the sealed opaque envelope randomization technique. This will be performed&#xD;
      after spinal anaesthetic has been administered before surgery commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information All patients will be initially evaluated with a complete history and&#xD;
      physical examination. For all patients entering the study the following baseline information&#xD;
      will be recorded: Age, sex, BMI, Kellgren-Lawrence grade of osteoarthritis, preoperative&#xD;
      analgesia regime, length of knee pain duration, employment status, and postcode. Baseline VAS&#xD;
      Pain scores, Oxford Knee Scores and EQ-5D scores will be collected as is routine for all of&#xD;
      our arthroplasty patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-operative Protocol All patients will be admitted on the day of surgery and undergo a&#xD;
      standardised enhanced recovery anaesthetic protocol including spinal anaesthetic (with no&#xD;
      intrathecal diamorphine) and no peripheral nerve blocks (femoral, sciatic or adductor canal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a cemented Triathlon (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ, USA) cruciate retaining&#xD;
      TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be prescribed standardised post-operative analgesia including Oxycodone MR&#xD;
      15mg twice daily for 4 doses with stepdown to weaker opiate, usually Cocodamol 30/500 2 tabs&#xD;
      4 times per day, Oxycodone IR 5-10mg prn for breakthrough pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be placed first or second on the operating list to enable VAS pain scores to be&#xD;
      collected at the assigned times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal injection The injection will consist of the same drugs for all patients: 150mg&#xD;
      levobupivacaine 0.25%, 10mg morphine; and 30mg ketorolac made up to a volume of 150ml with&#xD;
      saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between treatment groups is how the multimodal injection is administered:&#xD;
      either by periarticular infiltration around the knee, or by simple intra-articular injection&#xD;
      after the knee joint capsule has been closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group 1: Periarticular infiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operatively after bone cuts have been made and prior to implant cementation, the&#xD;
      multimodal injection will be infiltrated around the knee at 6 specific sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medial femoral condyle periosteum&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medial gutter&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lateral femoral condyle periosteum&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lateral gutter&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Posteromedial capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Posterolateral capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 2: Intra-articular infiltration After implant cementation and watertight&#xD;
      joint capsular closure, the multimodal injection will be injected intra-articularly through&#xD;
      the closed capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative protocol and Follow-up Postoperatively patients will complete a VAS pain score&#xD;
      at 6, 12 24 and 48 hours postoperatively with research staff blinded to the infiltration&#xD;
      technique employed. All analgesia required in the first 24 hours will be recorded and an&#xD;
      opiate equivalency dose calculator used to determine opiate intake (Joint Formulary Committee&#xD;
      2016). At 48 hours, in addition to recording a VAS pain score, patients will be asked how&#xD;
      satisfied they were with their pain relief as scored on a 5 point Likert score from very&#xD;
      satisfied to very dissatisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo routine postoperative management with review by arthroplasty&#xD;
      practitioners blinded to their treatment arm at 6 weeks where they will be examined and will&#xD;
      be asked to complete an adverse events questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcomes including Oxford Knee Scores and EQ-5D scores will be collected as&#xD;
      standard at 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a validated measure of pain and function following total knee replacement. The OKS is comprised of 12 questions which can be scored from 0 to 4 (with 0 being the worst outcome and 4 being the best outcome). The scores are then summed up to produce an overall score running from 0 (worst possible) to 48 (best possible). The OKS has sub-scales based on 'Functional Components' (questions 2, 3, 7, 11, 12) and 'Pain Components' (Questions 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10). A raw score is created for each sub-scale based on the 0-4 scoring system. To enable easier interpretation, each sub-scale is standardised to a range from 0 (worst possible) to 100 (best possible). This is done by multiplying the 'Functional Component' raw score by 5 and 'Pain Component' score by 3.57. We intend to record and report the change in Pre-operative and 12 months post-operative OKS using the total score and also providing data on the Pain and Functional Component scores.</description>
