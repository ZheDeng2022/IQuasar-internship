    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, randomized controlled trial investigating the use of an&#xD;
      abdominal closure bundle to reduce surgical site infection in patients undergoing cesarean&#xD;
      section. The abdominal closure bundle consists of surgeon repeat scrub, changing gown and&#xD;
      gloves, as well as usage of new instruments for closure of fascia, subcutaneous tissue, and&#xD;
      skin. Patients will be randomized to either abdominal closure bundle or normal operative&#xD;
      procedure. Primary outcome is surgical site infection within 30 days of procedure.&#xD;

      All patients, aged 18 years or older, greater than 34 weeks of gestation who will be&#xD;
      undergoing a scheduled cesarean section to be performed by Abington Primary Women's Health&#xD;
      Care Group, Abington Ob/Gyn Associates, Womencare, Women's Health Care Group, Dr. Ron&#xD;
      Hoffman, or the Ob/Gyn Chief Service will be considered for participation in this study.&#xD;
      Scheduled cesarean sections include all routine cesarean sections- whether receiving spinal&#xD;
      or general anesthesia, as well as patients who present to obstetrical triage in labor or with&#xD;
      ruptured membranes who are for cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following patients will be excluded from our study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unscheduled, STAT or urgent cesarean sections from the labor floor (failure to descend,&#xD;
           failure to progress, non-reassuring fetal heart tracing, chorioamnionitis, placental&#xD;
           abruption, prolapsed cord, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOAT (Surgical Operative Assist Team) cesarean sections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age &lt; 34 weeks for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preterm premature rupture of membranes from antepartum unit&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there are no published prospective trials abdominal closure bundles in cesarean sections,&#xD;
      sample size calculations were completed using a recently published meta-analysis of multiple&#xD;
      retrospective studies.4 These studies investigated various surgical site reduction techniques&#xD;
      as applied to cesarean sections. Using this data, which shows an average pre-intervention SSI&#xD;
      rate of 6% and post-reduction SSI rate of 2%, to detect a statistically significant&#xD;
      reduction, we will need to enroll approximately 850 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either normal operative procedure or the&#xD;
      closing bundle through a randomized process. Simple randomization in a 1:1 ratio will be&#xD;
      completed via Microsoft Excel. Group assignments will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes&#xD;
      which will be located on the labor and delivery unit. The envelope will be opened by the&#xD;
      resident physician or advanced practice professional who will be assisting with the cesarean&#xD;
      section on arrival to the operating room. This will allow the scrub tech to prepare the&#xD;
      closing tray prior to the start of the procedure if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive pre-operative antibiotics, chlorhexidine abdominal preparation,&#xD;
      thirty second betadine vaginal preparation, hair removal by clippers at the operative site,&#xD;
      lower extremity forced air warmer, subcutaneous tissue closure &gt;2cm, subcuticular skin&#xD;
      closure, and removal of surgical bandage on post-operative day 2. The abdominal closure&#xD;
      bundle includes changing of the surgical gown and gloves, repeat surgical scrub, and usage of&#xD;
      new surgical instruments, light handles, suction, and bovie tip for closure of fascia,&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue, and skin. Given the nature of the intervention, the surgeon and patient&#xD;
      will not be blinded to group assignment.&#xD;
