  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the superiority of an Optical&#xD;
      Coherence Tomography (OCT)-guided stent implantation strategy as compared to an&#xD;
      angiography-guided stent implantation strategy in achieving larger post-PCI lumen dimensions&#xD;
      and improving clinical cardiovascular outcomes in patients with high-risk clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and/or with high-risk angiographic lesions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-blind clinical investigation randomizing subjects to OCT-guided&#xD;
      coronary stent implantation vs. angiography-guided coronary stent implantation in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. The clinical investigation will be conducted at approximately 125 centers in North&#xD;
      America (US and Canada), Europe, Middle East and Asia-Pacific.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo baseline and post PCI imaging with their randomized modality. In&#xD;
      addition, the Angiography group will undergo a blinded post-PCI OCT run to allow comparison&#xD;
      of OCT derived minimum stent area (MSA) in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospital discharge, all patients will have clinical follow-up at 30 days, 1 year, and 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria (all must be present)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable angina, silent&#xD;
             ischemia (ischemia in the absence of chest pain or other anginal equivalents),&#xD;
             unstable angina, or acute myocardial infarction) suitable for elective PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients undergoing planned XIENCE stent implantation during a clinically indicated&#xD;
             PCI procedure meeting one or more of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A) High clinical-risk, defined as;&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Medication-treated diabetes mellitus, AND/OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             B) High angiographic-risk lesion(s), with at least one target lesion in each target&#xD;
             vessel planned for randomization meeting at least one of the following criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Target lesion is the culprit lesion responsible for either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NSTEMI, defined as a clinical syndrome consistent with an acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
                  and a minimum troponin of 1 ng/dL (may or may not have returned to normal), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  STEMI &gt;24 hours from the onset of ischemic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. long or multiple lesions (defined as intended total stent length in any single&#xD;
             target vessel ≥28 mm), Note: For a long target lesion, this would permit treatment by&#xD;
             a single long stent or overlapping stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: For up to two target lesions located in a single target vessel and treated with&#xD;
             non-overlapping stents, they may be located in a continuous vessel or split up between&#xD;
             a main vessel and a side branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. bifurcation intended to be treated with 2 planned stents (i.e. in both the main&#xD;
             branch and side branch), and where the planned side branch stent is ≥ 2.5 mm in&#xD;
             diameter by angiographic visual estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iv. angiographic severe calcification (defined as angiographically visible&#xD;
             calcification on both sides of the vessel wall in the absence of cardiac motion),&#xD;
&#xD;
             v. chronic total occlusion (CTO) (enrolment and randomization in this case performed&#xD;
             only after successful antegrade wire escalation crossing and pre-dilatation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             vi. in-stent restenosis of diffuse or multi-focal pattern. Lesion must be at or within&#xD;
             the existing stent margin(s) and have angiographically visually-assessed DS ≥70% or DS&#xD;
             ≥50% with non-invasive or invasive evidence of ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All target lesions (those lesions to be randomized) must have a visually estimated or&#xD;
             quantitatively assessed %DS of either ≥70%, or ≥50% plus one or more of the following:&#xD;
             an abnormal functional test (e.g. fractional flow reserve, stress test) signifying&#xD;
             ischemia in the distribution of the target lesion(s) or biomarker positive ACS with&#xD;
             plaque disruption or thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: For purposes of study eligibility, a minimum troponin of 1 ng/dL at the time of&#xD;
             screening will be considered biomarker positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All target lesions must be planned for treatment with only ≥2.5 mm and ≤3.5 mm stents&#xD;
             and post-dilatation balloons based on pre-PCI angiographic visual estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No more than 2 target lesions requiring PCI are present in any single vessel., and no&#xD;
             more than 2 target vessels are allowed. Thus, up to 4 randomized target lesions per&#xD;
             patient in a maximum of 2 target vessels are allowed, including branches. The intended&#xD;
             target lesions will be declared just prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: A lesion is defined as any segment(s) of the coronary tree, no matter how long,&#xD;
             which is planned to be covered with one contiguous length of stent, whether single or&#xD;
             overlapped. A bifurcation counts as a single lesion even if the side branch is planned&#xD;
             to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: All lesions in a randomized target vessel that are intended to be treated by PCI&#xD;
             are designated as target lesions, and at least one target lesion in each randomized&#xD;
             target vessel must meet angiographic high-risk inclusion criteria summarized above in&#xD;
             3B). The only exception is for patients who qualify for the trial on the basis of&#xD;
             medication-treated diabetes, in which case no target lesion is required to meet&#xD;
             angiographic high-risk inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. All target lesions intended to be treated by PCI in the target vessel are amenable to&#xD;
             OCT-guided PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Example: If a qualifying angiographic high-risk lesion is in the proximal LAD, and&#xD;
             there is a second target lesion in the distal LAD which is a focal lesion not&#xD;
             otherwise meeting high-risk criteria, both the proximal LAD and distal LAD lesions&#xD;
             must be amenable to OCT (e.g. no excessive tortuosity or calcification precluding&#xD;
             delivering the OCT catheter), and each lesion must undergo OCT-guided stenting.&#xD;
             Otherwise the vessel should be excluded from randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject must provide written Informed Consent prior to any study related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (none may be present)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. STEMI ≤24 hours from the onset of ischemic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Creatinine clearance ≤30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (as calculated by MDRD formula for estimated&#xD;
             GFR) and not on dialysis. Note: chronic dialysis dependent patients are eligible for&#xD;
             enrolment regardless of creatinine clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hypotension, shock or need for mechanical support or intravenous vasopressors at the&#xD;
             time the patient would be undergoing the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. CHF (Killip class ≥2 or NYHA class ≥3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. LVEF ≤30% by the most recent imaging test within 3 months prior to procedure. If no&#xD;
             LVEF test result within 3 months is available, it must be assessed by&#xD;
             echocardiography, multiple gated acquisition (MUGA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
             ventriculography (LV gram) or other method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unstable ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Inability to take DAPT (both aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor) for at least 12 months in&#xD;
             the patient presenting with an ACS, or at least 6 months in the patient presenting&#xD;
             with stable CAD, unless the patient is also taking chronic oral anticoagulation in&#xD;
             which case a shorter duration of DAPT may be prescribed per local standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Planned major cardiac or non-cardiac surgery within 24 months after the index&#xD;
             procedure Note: Major surgery is any invasive operative procedure in which an&#xD;
             extensive resection is performed, e.g. a body cavity is entered, organs are removed,&#xD;
             or normal anatomy is altered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Minor surgery is an operation on the superficial structures of the body or a&#xD;
             manipulative procedure that does not involve a serious risk. Planned minor surgery is&#xD;
             not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Prior PCI within the target vessel within 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Prior PCI within the target vessel within 12 months is allowed for in-stent&#xD;
             restenosis (target lesion is the prior PCI site) if no more than one layer of&#xD;
             previously implanted stent is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: In-stent restenosis involving two or more layers of stent implanted at any time&#xD;
             prior to index procedure (i.e. an earlier episode of in-stent restenosis previously&#xD;
             treated with a second stent) is excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any planned PCI within the target vessel(s) within 24 months after the study&#xD;
             procedure, other than a planned staged intervention in a second randomized target&#xD;
             vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Planned staged interventions must be noted at the time of randomization, and the&#xD;
             decision to stage may be modified within 24 hours of completion of the index PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: PCI in non-target vessels is permitted &gt;48 hours after the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any prior PCI in a non-target vessel within 24 hours before the study procedure, or&#xD;
             within previous 30 days if unsuccessful or complicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients requiring non-target vessel PCI may be enrolled and the non-target&#xD;
             vessel(s) may be treated in the same index procedure as the randomized lesions (in all&#xD;
             cases prior to randomization), as long as treatment of the lesion(s) in the non-target&#xD;
             vessel is successful and uncomplicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Successful and uncomplicated definition for non-target vessel treatment during the&#xD;
             index procedure: Angiographic diameter stenosis &lt;10% for all treated non-target&#xD;
             lesions, with TIMI III flow in this vessel, without final dissection ≥ NHLBI type B,&#xD;
             perforation anytime during the procedure, prolonged chest pain (&gt;5 minutes) or&#xD;
             prolonged ST-segment elevation or depression (&gt;5 minutes), or cardiac arrest or need&#xD;
             for defibrillation or cardioversion or hypotension/heart failure requiring mechanical&#xD;
             or intravenous hemodynamic support or intubation).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the study drugs&#xD;
             (including all P2Y12 inhibitors, one or more components of the study devices,&#xD;
             including everolimus, cobalt, chromium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, acrylic and&#xD;
             fluoropolymers, or radiocontrast dye that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has received a solid organ transplant which is functioning or is active on a&#xD;
             waiting list for any solid organ transplants with expected transplantation within 24&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or&#xD;
             severe autoimmune disease that requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). Note: corticosteroids are&#xD;
             not included as immunosuppressant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject has previously received or is scheduled to receive radiotherapy to a coronary&#xD;
             artery (vascular brachytherapy), or the chest/mediastinum.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject has a platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject has a documented or suspected hepatic disorder as defined as cirrhosis or&#xD;
             Child-Pugh ≥ Class B.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or has had a significant&#xD;
             gastro-intestinal or significant urinary bleed within the past six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic neurological attack&#xD;
             (TIA) within the past six months, or any prior intracranial bleed, or any permanent&#xD;
             neurologic defect, or any known intracranial pathology (e.g., aneurysm, arteriovenous&#xD;
             malformation, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath&#xD;
             insertion. Note: femoral arterial disease does not exclude the patient if radial&#xD;
             access may be used.&#xD;

             following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site&#xD;
             standard test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Presence of other anatomic or comorbid conditions, or other medical, social, or&#xD;
             psychological conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could limit the&#xD;
             subject's ability to participate in the clinical investigation or to comply with&#xD;
             follow-up requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the clinical&#xD;
             investigation results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Angiographic exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Syntax score ≥33, unless a formal meeting of the Heart Team, including a cardiac&#xD;
             surgeon, concludes that PCI is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Planned use of any stent &lt;2.5 mm in a target vessel based on visual estimation (note:&#xD;
             a smaller stent may be used in a bail-out scenario - e.g. to treat a distal dissection&#xD;
             - but its use cannot be planned prior to enrolment)&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Severe vessel tortuosity or calcification in a target vessel such that it is unlikely&#xD;
             that the OCT catheter can be delivered (note: severe vessel calcification is allowed&#xD;
             if it is expected that the OCT catheter can be delivered at baseline or after vessel&#xD;
             preparation with balloon pre-dilatation or atherectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The target vessel has a lesion with DS ≥ 50% that is not planned for treatment at the&#xD;
             time of index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The target lesion is in the left main coronary artery&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The target lesion is in a bypass graft conduit. Note: A native coronary artery may be&#xD;
             randomized if a prior bypass graft conduit to the vessel is totally occluded, but not&#xD;
             if it is patent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The target lesion is an ostial RCA stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The target lesion is a stent thrombosis&#xD;
