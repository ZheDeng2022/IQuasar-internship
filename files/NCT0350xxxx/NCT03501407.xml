  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticks are the major arthropod vectors transmitting pathogenic agents to humans and domestic&#xD;
      animals in Europe, and currently, the incidence of tick-borne disease is rising. The most&#xD;
      common European human tick-borne disease is Lyme borreliosis, with an estimated 90 000 new&#xD;
      cases every year (compared to 300 000 new cases in the United States annually). This disease&#xD;
      is initially clinically diagnosed by the presence of migrating erythema following a tick&#xD;
      bite, which is then subsequently confirmed by serological tests. In parallel with classic&#xD;
      Lyme borreliosis cases, tick-bitten patients can also present with polymorphic and&#xD;
      on-specific clinical symptoms (asthenia, fever, myalgia, etc. …) for which there is no known&#xD;
      etiological diagnosis. It is extremely difficult to determine the proportion of tick-bitten&#xD;
      patients with these symptoms compared to patients which have actually contracted Lyme&#xD;
      disease, although it is estimated that 50% of fevers following a tick bite have an unknown&#xD;
      infectious origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical tick habitats are woodlands, prairies, pastures, and gardens. Ticks are extremely&#xD;
      sensitive to environmental fluctuations, which are often brought about by human&#xD;
      socio-economic changes, thus tick-borne diseases are excellent candidates for emergence.&#xD;
      Consequently, it is incontestable that tickborne diseases pose a significant threat to our&#xD;
      society. In addition to improving diagnostic techniques, one of the major hurdles relates to&#xD;
      improving public and health professional knowledge about tick disease risk. The battle&#xD;
      against tick-borne diseases is based on relatively simple prevention measures, and their&#xD;
      effectiveness is immeasurably improved when citizens are more informed and&#xD;
      involved.Therefore, a multidisciplinary project, bringing together veterinarians, doctors,&#xD;
      scientists, and consultant sociologists has been designed to create a global &quot;One Health&quot;&#xD;
      approach to tick-borne diseases. Specific scientific project objectives are to (1) detect,&#xD;
      identify, and isolate new microorganisms-both unknown or unexpected-from patients or animals&#xD;
      suffering from unexplainable symptoms following tick bites; (2) to demonstrate tick&#xD;
      competence in their ability to transmit these agents; and (3) to generate concrete&#xD;
      recommendations to improve tick-borne disease management.&#xD;
