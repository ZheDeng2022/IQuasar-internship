  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project MADD was designed to attempt to curb the alarming trends related to drunk driving and&#xD;
      to move the field forward by testing a brief parent-intervention's ability to change&#xD;
      adolescents' drinking, impaired driving, and riding with impaired driver behaviors. The aim&#xD;
      of this project is to provide an easy-to-implement and low-cost alternative parent-based&#xD;
      intervention that can be widely disseminated to address this important public health problem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drunk driving is a major public health problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety&#xD;
      Administration reported nearly 10,000 people died in alcohol-related crashes in the U.S. in&#xD;
      2014. The problem is further magnified when one considers that each year over 1.3 million&#xD;
      drivers in the U.S. are arrested for alcohol-impaired driving. As alarming as these&#xD;
      statistics are they pale by comparison to estimates indicating that they only represent 1% of&#xD;
      the 121 million self-reported episodes of alcohol-impaired driving among U.S. drivers each&#xD;
      year. The proposed research will attempt to curb these alarming trends and move the field&#xD;
      forward by conducting a randomized controlled trial testing a brief parent intervention's&#xD;
      ability to change adolescents' drinking, impaired driving, and riding with impaired driver&#xD;
      behaviors. Prior brief parent-based interventions fro this lab have provided sufficient&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of participation, communication, and efficacy for changing under-age&#xD;
      drinking to warrant a large-scale comprehensive study. The study will use an extremely&#xD;
      rigorous design that meets the Society for Prevention Research Criteria for Efficacy as&#xD;
      described in Flay et al., a nationally representative sample assessed at 3-waves (baseline, 6&#xD;
      mo. and 12 mo.) to examine generalizability and sustained effects, and an oversampled&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latino subgroup to examine the parent-intervention's potential to reduce a health&#xD;
      disparity in an underserved population. The aims are as follows: Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the parent intervention (short and long term); Aim 2: Examine mediators of the PBI that&#xD;
      directly influence drinking, impaired driving, and riding with impaired driver behaviors; and&#xD;
      Aim 3: Identify moderators to help inform future tailoring and improvement in intervention&#xD;
      effectiveness. To the extent that the research is successful, it will provide an easy to&#xD;
      implement and low cost alternative that can be widely disseminated to address this important&#xD;
      public health problem.&#xD;
