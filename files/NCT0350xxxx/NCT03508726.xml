  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open-label phase Ib/II clinical study assessing the efficacy of&#xD;
      concurrent high dose ascorbate in combination with radiotherapy in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced, resectable, high grade sarcomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Phase Ib:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase Ib portion of this study is to ensure the safety and tolerability of high dose&#xD;
      ascorbate in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as assessed by incidence&#xD;
      of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). EBRT will be given at the standard dose for resectable&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcomas according to the NCCN sarcoma guidelines.2 Patients will receive 50 Gy&#xD;
      over 5 weeks, during which time they will be receiving three times a week IV high dose&#xD;
      ascorbate. IV ascorbate infusions will be continued until the end of radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed 4-6 weeks from the end of radiation to allow for adequate tissue&#xD;
      healing and resolution of acute toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 part of the study will provide an estimate of the relative treatment effect of&#xD;
      pharmacological ascorbate in combination with preoperative EBRT in subjects with locally&#xD;
      advanced, resectable, extremity, trunk or retroperitoneal high grade sarcomas, as measured by&#xD;
      pathological response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As above, patients will receive the first dose of pharmacological ascorbate intravenously on&#xD;
      day 1 of week 1 provided no reactions are seen to the test dose. This will be followed by 3&#xD;
      times a week dosing at Dose 0 until completion of EBRT. Standard doses of radiation for&#xD;
      resectable soft tissue sarcomas according to the NCCN sarcoma guidelines will be&#xD;
      administered.2 Patients will receive preoperative radiation at a dose of 50 Gy over 5 weeks&#xD;
      starting on week 1 day 1. Subjects will be followed either by clinic visit or phone contact&#xD;
      every 12 weeks for approximately 24 months after the end of the treatment phase, at which&#xD;
      time the initial survival data and disease recurrence will be assessed.&#xD;
