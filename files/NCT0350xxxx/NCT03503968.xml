    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, non-randomized, open-label, Phase I/II clinical trial of MDG1011, an&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product (IMP), consisting of patient-derived autologous T cells,&#xD;
      persistently transduced with a Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME)-specific&#xD;
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01-restricted T cell receptor (TCR).&#xD;

      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I dose escalation part will establish the MTD/RP2D in subjects with high risk&#xD;
      myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, a total of 3 disease entities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I subjects will be enrolled into the following cohorts and treated with a single&#xD;
      intravenous (i.v.) infusion of IMP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: target dose of 1 x 105 T cells/kg ± 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: target dose of 1 x 106 T cells/kg ± 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: target dose of 5 x 106 T cells/kg ± 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional cohort 4: up to 1 x 107 T cells/kg + 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II part consists of two arms, each representing one disease entity. Within each&#xD;
      arm, representing a disease entity, subjects will be enrolled in 2 different treatment groups&#xD;
      to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IMP in the treatment group (up to 20 subjects who are positive for human leukocyte&#xD;
           antigen (HLA)-A*02:01); Or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. therapy as per Investigator's discretion in the concurrent control (up to 20 subjects&#xD;
           who are negative for HLA-A*02:01).&#xD;
