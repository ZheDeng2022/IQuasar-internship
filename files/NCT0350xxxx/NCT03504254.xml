  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical myelopathy (CM), a chronically compressive spinal cord lesion, is the most common&#xD;
      cause of non-traumatic paraparesis/quadriparesis among the elderly. Hong Kong is facing a&#xD;
      heavy social economic burden from CM with the rapidly aging population. Surgical&#xD;
      decompression is considered as the mainstay of the treatment for CM patients to relieve their&#xD;
      symptoms and signs. Yet the surgical outcome is not always satisfactory. There is a pressing&#xD;
      need for understanding the exact mechanism of surgical decompression on the recovery of&#xD;
      myelopathic cord in order to improve the prognosis of CM patients in near future.This project&#xD;
      will evaluate neuronal activities and axon regeneration by longitudinally monitoring at time&#xD;
      zero, 3 and 6 month after the surgery in CM patients using UTE, BOLD-fMRI and DTI, and to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship of preoperative neuronal activities of myelopathic cord with&#xD;
      axon regeneration.&#xD;

      This study aims to monitor the structural and functional changes of chronically compressed&#xD;
      spinal cords longitudinally after surgical decompression in vivo. Three kinds of MRI&#xD;
      techniques will be used in this study. These are (1) axial T1-weighted (T1WI) and T2-weighted&#xD;
      imaging (T2WI), UTE MRI, (2) BOLD-based fMRI, and (3) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To&#xD;
      quantitatively investigate the structural deficits, T1/T2 MRIs will delineate the gross&#xD;
      morphology of the spinal cord, CSF, and surrounding anatomical structures, while DTI will&#xD;
      quantify the fiber orientation and integrity within the spinal cord. BOLD-based functional&#xD;
      MRIs will assess the local hemodynamic changes and neuron activities in response to the motor&#xD;
      or sensory stimulation along the C3 to C8 spinal nerve levels. The MRI evaluations will be&#xD;
      applied to the same cervical myelopathy (CM) patient before surgery and 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post-surgery, when clinical recovery reaches a plateau9. Clinical examination will include&#xD;
      neurological evaluation, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring assessment, and&#xD;
      clinical electrophysiological evaluation.&#xD;
