  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While many short-term morbidities associated with extreme prematurity have declined over the&#xD;
      last two decades, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has increased to a rate&#xD;
      of approximately 45% in neonates &lt;28 weeks gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) &lt;1,500&#xD;
      g. Neonates with BPD are at increased risk for adverse short-and long-term neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      and respiratory outcomes that often persist into adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing body of pathological and biochemical evidence that implicates inflammation&#xD;
      in its pathogenesis. This is further supported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that&#xD;
      demonstrate the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in facilitating extubation and reducing&#xD;
      BPD. However, several short- and long-term adverse effects associated with the use of&#xD;
      systemic corticosteroids have been described, the most concerning of which is their effect on&#xD;
      neurodevelopment, specifically an increased rate of cerebral palsy (CP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are an attractive alternative to systemic steroids because of&#xD;
      these concerns. Earlier systematic reviews had not found any benefit in using ICS for the&#xD;
      prevention or treatment of BPD. However, a recent systematic review showed a significant&#xD;
      reduction in death or BPD at 36 weeks' corrected GA (CGA) (risk ratio=0.86, 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval 0.75, 0.99), BPD (RR=0.77, 95% CI 0.65, 0.91), and use of systemic steroids&#xD;
      (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.76, 0.98) in infants treated with ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of ICS for BPD, uncertainty remains over&#xD;
      treatment timing, effective dose, and long-term effects. There is also variation in the&#xD;
      delivery systems used for delivery of ICS. These concerns continue to be echoed in a recent&#xD;
      review by Nelin et al. Given that the long-term neurodevelopmental impact of ICS were unknown&#xD;
      at the time of this study and many infants are able to wean from ventilation without&#xD;
      steroids, the investigators conducted an escalating-dose ranging study of late ICS (i.e.&#xD;
      administered after the first week of life) delivered by a metered dose inhaler (MDI)&#xD;
      utilizing a specially designed valved delivery system to determine the minimum effective dose&#xD;
      necessary to achieve extubation or reduction in oxygen requirements and the long-term&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental impact of increasing doses of ICS.&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the effective dose of inhaled steroids (HFA-BDP) in ventilated preterm infants?&#xD;
      Material and Methods Objective: The primary purpose of this study is to determine the optimal&#xD;
      dose of inhaled steroids (using HFA-BDP) in ventilated preterm infants. The result from this&#xD;
      study will determine the dose of inhaled steroids to be used for a subsequent randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial with sufficient power to determine if inhaled steroid is associated&#xD;
      with reduction in CLD in ventilated preterm infants without any detrimental effect on long&#xD;
      term neurodevelopmental outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Escalating dose-ranging study Study Population: Babies with birth weights &lt;&#xD;
      1,250 grams and gestational age &lt; 32 weeks admitted in the NICU at Sunnybrook and Women's&#xD;
      College Health Sciences Centre and Mount Sinai Hospital Inclusion Criteria: Birth weight &lt;&#xD;
      1,250 grams and gestational age &lt; 32 weeks, Need for assisted mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      (ventilation rate &gt; 15 breaths/min, and fractional oxygen concentration of inspired gas&#xD;
      (Fio2) &gt; 0.3 but &lt; 0.6), Postnatal age 10-21 days, Stable ventilatory requirements over the&#xD;
      48-72 hours prior to enrollment Exclusion Criteria: Actual or suspected sepsis, Congenital&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory malformation, Patent ductus arteriosus, Presence of necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or perforation, Treatment with systemic&#xD;
      dexamethasone Duration of therapy: 7 days Drug Regimen: Groups of neonates will be treated&#xD;
      with an escalating dose of HFA-BDP until either efficacy equal to that seen with&#xD;
      dexamethasone or significant side-effects are observed. 10 neonates will be treated at each&#xD;
      dosage level before moving up to the next dose. Each neonate will be treated with only one&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowser et al have performed an in vitro evaluation of drug deposition of HFA-BDP (QVAR*) and&#xD;
      CPC-BDP MDI (Beclovent) via an aerosol delivery chamber (Aerochamber) and endotracheal tube&#xD;
      (uncuffed Portex 3.5, 3.0 and 2.5) at low tidal volumes. The PARI Compas Breath Simulator was&#xD;
      used to simulate neonatal and infant respiratory cycles. For both formulations and all&#xD;
      endotracheal tubes, the output (*g) increased significantly at the tidal volume and&#xD;
      inspiratory flow rates were increased. The 3.5 endotracheal tube side gave greater&#xD;
      output/puff at all tidal volumes and for both formulations as compared to the smaller&#xD;
      endotracheal tubes. Greater in vitro deposition was measured for QVAR than for beclovent,&#xD;
      possibly leading to greater in vivo delivery to the lung of this new HFA-BDP MDI formulation&#xD;
      to intubated infants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, for the purpose of this study Beclomethasone Dipropionate (HFA-BDP, QVAR*) in the&#xD;
      following doses will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 200 *g bid&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 400 *g bid&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 600 *g bid&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 800 *g bid Inhaled steroids will be administered using a specially designed neonatal&#xD;
           aerosol delivery system manufactured by Trudell Canada (see diagram, Appendix I). The&#xD;
           device will be connected directly to the endotracheal tube on one side with the&#xD;
           ventilator circuit on the other. The ventilator settings will be temporarily adjusted to&#xD;
           achieve an expiratory tidal volume of 7ml/kg (based on birth weight) and a rate of 30&#xD;
           breaths/min and an inspiratory time of 0.5 seconds. There will be a one-minute interval&#xD;
           between each actuation from the MDI. Continuous cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring&#xD;
           will be used throughout the treatment period. One-minute after the final puff has been&#xD;
           administered, the delivery system will be removed and the baby returned to the&#xD;
           ventilator settings previously used. The total daily dose will be administered in two&#xD;
           divided doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the infant is extubated during the study period administration of inhaled medications will&#xD;
      be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures - Efficacy Primary Outcome: Reduction in Fio2 from the 2 days prior to&#xD;
      treatment to the final 2 days of the study period or extubation during the study period.&#xD;
      Extubation is considered to be successful if the infant does not require assisted ventilation&#xD;
      in the next 48 hours. A reduction in additional Fio2 of 75% or greater will be considered a&#xD;
      significant improvement (i.e. a baby with a baseline Fio2 of 0.51 who requires less than 0.28&#xD;
      [0.21 + 0.25 (0.51-0.21)] at the end of the treatment period will be considered a treatment&#xD;
      success).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilatory status: Ventilator rate Mean airway pressure Peak inspiratory pressure&#xD;
      Ventilatory parameters will be assessed at the same time intervals as Fio2 described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event Monitoring Each patient will be carefully monitored for adverse events by the&#xD;
      investigators. The following events will be specifically monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypertension: Blood pressure (BP) will be noted every 12 hourly using an automatic&#xD;
           sphygmomanometer (Dinamap, Criticon Inc.). Hypertension is defined as BP higher than 2&#xD;
           SD above the mean for the infant's gestational and postnatal age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hyperglycemia: Urine and blood glucose will be monitored as per nursing standard&#xD;
           protocol for infants who are on steroids. Hyperglycemia will be defined as a blood&#xD;
           glucose &gt; 10 *mol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Growth: Weight and head circumference will be recorded prior to and after completion of&#xD;
           the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Infection: Sepsis is defined as a need for antibiotic therapy because of a positive&#xD;
           blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture or clinical diagnosis of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evidence of feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis or intestinal perforation&#xD;
           will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Candidiasis of the mouth and throat will be noted. Assessment will be made of the&#xD;
           seriousness, intensity and relationship to the administration of the study medication.&#xD;
           If, in the opinion of the investigator, the adverse event is not tolerated, the patient&#xD;
           will be withdrawn from the study and monitored until resolution of the adverse event or&#xD;
           until a conclusion is reached as to its irreversible nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenal suppression is an important adverse effect, which occurs during glucocorticoid&#xD;
      therapy (particularly when administered systemically). Controversy exists regarding the&#xD;
      variable effect of glucocorticoid therapy on the immature HPA axis. The dose and duration of&#xD;
      therapy, methodology and timing of adrenal function assessment and inter-patient variablity&#xD;
      influence the degree and duration of suppression. Also, there is no consensus regarding&#xD;
      normal HPA function in extremely premature infant. Therefore, for the purpose of this pilot&#xD;
      study where the drug is administered for a very short duration the HPA axis will not be&#xD;
      investigated. Assessment of the HPA axis will be part of the larger randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory test abnormalities considered by the Investigator to be clinically relevant will&#xD;
      be reported on the Adverse Event Page of the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities fulfilling the definition of &quot;serious&quot; must,&#xD;
      in addition, be reported in detail on the Serious Adverse Event Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs and symptoms of each AE should be described in detail: start and stop dates, intensity,&#xD;
      relationship it investigational product, action taken and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessment Adverse events will be tracked as described below. After each serious AE,&#xD;
      the safety monitoring committee will be informed and will investigate the relationship&#xD;
      between the AE and study drug administration. Any time a serious AE is felt to be &quot;probably&#xD;
      related&quot; to the therapy, consideration will be given to stopping the study. If a series of&#xD;
      serious AE events are felt to be &quot;possibly related&quot; or a series of minor events felt to be&#xD;
      &quot;probably related&quot; to treatment with the study drug, the study may also be stopped. The REB,&#xD;
      3M pharmaceuticals and HPB will be kept informed of all such deliberations. The members of&#xD;
      the safety committee include Dr. Arne Ohlsson, Director Evidence Based Neonatal Care and&#xD;
      Outcomes Research, MSH, Dr. Elizabeth Asztalos, Staff Neonatologist, SWCHSC and Joseph&#xD;
      Beyene, Biostatistician, MSH. After enrollment of 10 neonates at a particular dosing level&#xD;
      the safety committee will be requested to review the data for efficacy and safety. If no&#xD;
      benefit or no significant adverse events are noted then the decision will be made to move to&#xD;
      the next dosing level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning Protocol Respiratory therapists will use set criteria for weaning from ventilation.&#xD;
      For 48 hours prior to commencement of treatment, a record will be made of the baseline&#xD;
      ventilator settings. A transcutaneous pCO2 monitor will be applied daily for the duration of&#xD;
      the study. Blood gases (capillary or arterial) will be performed as clinically indicated: ie.&#xD;
      in response to changes in clinical status, oxygen requirements (oxygen saturation) or&#xD;
      transcutaneous pCO2. Supplemental oxygen and ventilation will be adjusted to maintain an&#xD;
      oxygen saturation of 90-95%, carbon dioxide tension between 45-60mm Hg (5.8-7.8 KPA) and a&#xD;
      blood pH of at least 7.25. If clinically indicated, the proximal airway pressure will be&#xD;
      reduced in decrements of 2mm Hg until a mean airway pressure of 8mm Hg is reached, following&#xD;
      which the ventilator rate will be reduced in decrements of 2-5 breaths/min until a rate of&#xD;
      10-12 breaths/min is achieved. Neonates will be extubated from a rate of 10-12 breaths/min a&#xD;
      mean airway pressure of 8mm Hg and Fio2 concentration of &lt; 0.3. A record will be made of the&#xD;
      need for nasal CPAP following extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation The study design is an escalating dose ranging study with an aim to&#xD;
      identify both an effective and a safe dose of inhaled steroids. 10 babies will be enrolled in&#xD;
      each dose category. The study will be stopped if the therapeutic efficacy is achieved in a&#xD;
      given dosage group or if significant side effects are noted. Therapeutic efficacy will be&#xD;
      considered to have occurred in a group of 6 or more babies out of 10 meet the primary outcome&#xD;
      [based upon response expected with dexamethasone therapy - data from Ohlsson et al&#xD;
      (Unpublished data from MSc thesis)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Analysis of variance for repeated measures will be used to assess the&#xD;
      effect of therapy over time in each dosage group. This analysis will be applied to Fio2 and&#xD;
      ventilatory parameters&#xD;
