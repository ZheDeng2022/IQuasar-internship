      Hypothesis: Medication Review with follow-up can improve clinical, health related quality of&#xD;
      life and economic outcomes. To prove this hypothesis a cluster randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      will be held in primary care centres of the public health system of Chile. Patients of the&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease prevention program, older than 65 years and with poly pharmacy (more&#xD;
      than 5 drugs) will be recruited. Control group will receive usual care and the intervention&#xD;
      arm will have medication review consultations by a pharmacist every 4 months for one year.&#xD;
      Clinical interventions will be made with physician authorisation. Participating pharmacist&#xD;
      will be trained in cardiovascular prevention pharmacotherapy in the elderly, interview skills&#xD;
      and educational techniques. A practice change facilitator will assist the pharmacist in any&#xD;
      matters regarding the methodology and will asses barriers and facilitators to the&#xD;
      implementation of the medication review with follow-up service. A personalised plan will be&#xD;
      developed for every pharmacist. Clinical outcomes (blood pressure, HbA1c, LDL cholesterol,&#xD;
      overall cardiovascular risk, among others), number of medications, adherence rate and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life will be evaluated. A cost-utility analysis will be made&#xD;
      through the health ministry of Chile perspective.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was approved by the ethics committee from the Metropolitan Southeastern health&#xD;
      service and the University of Technology Sydney (UTS)'s Human Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (HREC). All patients are compelled to sign an informed consent document before the first&#xD;
      interview, explaining that they can leave the study whenever they want without punishment or&#xD;
      justification. All data will be coded and stored without any personal information, to comply&#xD;
      with the Chilean law 19,628 for protection of personal data and 20,584 for rights and duties&#xD;
      of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and losses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated with data from the pilot study conducted between March and July of&#xD;
      2017. The effect size was determined by the reduction of CHD risk (0.324). Cluster size was&#xD;
      of 24, clustering effect of 1.57, control-intervention relationship of 1:1, with an 80% of&#xD;
      statistical power and type I error of 5%. A 20% attrition rate was assumed. With this data&#xD;
      the calculated sample size was 576, with 288 patients and 11-12 clusters in each study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, primary care centers will recruit participants following the proportion of older&#xD;
      adults (OA) in the Cardiovascular disease care program (PSCV in spanish) of each one . If a&#xD;
      center gathers more than 10% of the total population, that center must recruit 10% of the&#xD;
      sample in that group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study structure&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two stages: stage one is the preparation of the participating pharmacist&#xD;
      in the intervention group and stage two is the development of the fieldwork.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of pharmacists in the intervention group will consist of 15 hours of topics&#xD;
      developed in theory and practice, focusing on the resolution of clinical cases. The topics&#xD;
      will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacist-physician and pharmacist-patient relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of vitals (blood pressure, cardiac frequency, weight and height&#xD;
           determination, waist circumference, and capillary glycaemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Communication abilities and health education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geriatrics pharmacotherapy in hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group will only be prepared in control of vitals and survey application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilitator pharmacist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilitator Pharmacists (FAPHA) are pharmacists trained in MRF and implantation of&#xD;
      professional pharmaceutical services. Its main objective is to conduct a systematic&#xD;
      evaluation of implantation factors of the MRF service in the Polaris program, being positive&#xD;
      -facilitators- or negative -barriers- and to support the pharmacists that provide the service&#xD;
      in each individual center and municipality. Each Pharmacist will be supervised by a FAPHA,&#xD;
      who will conduct weekly evaluations in the initial phase and monthly thereafter during the&#xD;
      followup period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each FAPHA will be trained in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication review with follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacotherapy of chronic diseases in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of implantation factors of a pharmaceutical service.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention strategies to overcome barriers and increase facilitators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main functions of the FAPHA are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To promote the collaborative work between each pharmacist and authorities of the Family&#xD;
           health care center (CESFAM in spanish) or municipality..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect causes of barriers and facilitators of the service in the primary care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase and spread facilitators between primary care centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To overcome barriers by implementing specific action plans in each primary care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the implementation of MRF service according to the Polaris method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To register the process and analysis in the corresponding data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication review with follow-up (MRF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRF will be conducted according to the Polaris methods developed for this study. Each&#xD;
      participant will be interviewed at least seven times, and possibly more in the intervention&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service offer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRF service will be offered in two levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health Service and municipalities: the investigation team will introduce the program to&#xD;
           each health service authorities and to each municipality (managers of each health care&#xD;
           center and health authorities).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CESFAM: the program will be presented to all health care professionals in each CESFAM by&#xD;
           the pharmacist of that center. If needed, the assigned FAPHA can support this with the&#xD;
           help of the pharmacist in chief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invitation to the service&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different methods can be used and will be compared to perform patient recruitment. This will&#xD;
      be defined by each health care center's availability of resources. Each method requires that&#xD;
      the participants of the study to go to each interview with all their medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suggested methods are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary care center customer service: the invitation to participate in the study will be&#xD;
           made by each center customer service. The investigator team will prepare a script for&#xD;
           the administrative personal to use for recruiting and a list of patients to be recruited&#xD;
           by phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacy unit: patients will be recruited in the pharmacy unit by each participant&#xD;
           pharmacist. This will be conducted with spontaneous recruitment, at the moment of&#xD;
           dispensation. In that instance, each participant should sign the informed consent&#xD;
           document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral of other professionals: patients could be invited to the service through&#xD;
           referral to the pharmacist if they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is suggested to make the community aware of the service by making presentations of the&#xD;
      program in different community instances, like the council of users of each primary care&#xD;
      centre where the patients show their problems and participate in designing and proposing&#xD;
      health practices and services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the data obtained during the pilot study, this interview should last maximum 30 minutes.&#xD;
      The following structure will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of clinical records and pharmacy registry. This should be conducted previously by&#xD;
           the pharmacist, and should be used to complete before the interview some of the patient&#xD;
           information in the registry like health problems, prescriptions, laboratory tests and&#xD;
           any other relevant information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first interview, pharmacist will apply the Morisky-green survey of four&#xD;
           questions to determine medication adherence and the EuroQoL 5D-3L survey to determine&#xD;
           perceived quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete review of medications brought by the patient, including prescription and&#xD;
           self-administered drugs. In addition, information about the use of each medication will&#xD;
           be assessed while interviewing, like drug adherence, knowledge about the medication,&#xD;
           reason of the prescription, signs or symptoms of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR), among&#xD;
           other information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other relevant information will be registered, and the pharmacist must perform a&#xD;
           review of the interview to summarize the topics of interest and to receive any&#xD;
           additional information that the patient considers relevant and has not been spoken&#xD;
           previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invitation to next interviews should be made at the end of every session and scheduled&#xD;
      according their prescription refill, to increase adherence to the program and to confirm the&#xD;
      appointment with the patient. All information gathered in the first interview will be&#xD;
      registered in the MRF profile. After the initial analysis, patient will be classified in&#xD;
      compensation or follow-up stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation stage&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be classified in this stage if they are not controlled in their&#xD;
      Hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus or Dyslipidemias, to assess the greater risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications. These patients will have a greater number of interviews and&#xD;
      interventions, until they accomplish control of their diseases or the pharmacist decides that&#xD;
      the problem can't be resolved in primary health care. The frequency of appointments will be&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled Hypertension: interviews and interventions will be every 7-14 days until&#xD;
           achievement of blood pressure goal. This will require close work with physicians and&#xD;
           nurses. Once the goal has been reached, the patient will continue on the follow-up&#xD;
           stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: interviews and interventions will be every 7-14&#xD;
           days until achievement of the glycaemic target, controlled by fasting values and&#xD;
           capillary glycaemia in the following 7 days. After an initial achievement normal values,&#xD;
           the patient will have an appointment every 30 days. Only with confirmation of an HbA1c&#xD;
           value in the bellow the accepted limit, the patient will continue on the follow-up&#xD;
           stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled Dyslipidemias: interviews and interventions every 4-6 weeks, until&#xD;
           achievement of lipid goals. Once the goal has been reached, the patient will be derived&#xD;
           to the follow-up stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Special cases: patients in which a moderate or severe ADR is suspected, or those who&#xD;
           present a pharmacological interaction defined as relevant by the literature, will&#xD;
           receive interviews and interventions every 7-14 days until the issue has been tackled.&#xD;
           After that, the patient will be derived to the follow-up stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up stage&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that are controlled in the previously described health problems will be&#xD;
      classified in the follow-up stage, with interviews every four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can be moved between both stages when necessary and will be constantly evaluated in&#xD;
      their laboratory results, vitals and clinical signs and symptoms. Independently of the stage&#xD;
      of the patient, all surveys must be completed every two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study and evaluation phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase consists of a comprehensive analysis of the medications used by the patient,&#xD;
      reviewing aspects of necessity, efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the data of the pilot study, this phase should last about 30 minutes. After an&#xD;
      analysis of the pharmacotherapy of the patient, an action plan must be developed. If it&#xD;
      requires a prescription change it must be discussed with a physician. If an educational plan&#xD;
      is developed, it can be implemented directly. This process should last about 30 minutes, and&#xD;
      it could be developed through a designated physician of the health center or through&#xD;
      appointments with each physician in charge of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse drug reactions (ADR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A screening to identify ADR will be conducted in each interview by therapeutic group and&#xD;
      expected ADR in the patient. In this study, ADR will be classified by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type according to the World Health Organization (WHO):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A: Augmented, exaggerated effects from the pharmacological action of the drug (like&#xD;
           hypotension with anti-hypertensive medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B: Bizarre, ADR that can't be explained by the drugs mechanism of action (like allergic&#xD;
           reactions or Steven-Johnson syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C: Chronic, associated with a prolonged use of the drug (like benzodiazepine&#xD;
           dependence).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D: Delayed, like malignancy or teratogenic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E: End-use, associated with a residual effect after suspension of the drug (like rebound&#xD;
           effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Causality through Naranjo's Algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definite&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unlikely&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity classified by the WHO:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild: mild clinical manifestations that does not require a therapeutic intervention or&#xD;
           suspension of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate: significant clinical manifestations that do not put in risk the life of the&#xD;
           patient, but that require suspension of the drug or additional therapeutic&#xD;
           interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe: important clinical manifestations that threatens the life of the patient and&#xD;
           requires immediate suspension of the drug and urgent therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each suspected ADR must be reported to the Chilean pharmacovigilance online system (RED-RAM)&#xD;
      of the Public Health Institute of Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up interviews are defined as any interview after the first, and could be in&#xD;
      compensation or follow-up stage. With the data from the pilot study, follow-up interviews&#xD;
      should last about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry of phase times&#xD;
&#xD;
      All phases should be timed and must be registered by the pharmacist to determine the duration&#xD;
      of the process of MRF. The minimum timed activities should be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous review of the clinical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to register all data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time spent while studying the patient and elaborating the action plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of the meeting with the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory exams will be considered as valid if they are not older than six weeks -three&#xD;
      months to HbA1c-. Each pharmacist must manage the exams orders by their own primary care&#xD;
      center policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group will receive usual care, with clinical attention of health professionals like&#xD;
      nurses, physicians and dietitians, dispensation of medications from technicians in the&#xD;
      pharmacy unit, and consultation of the pharmacist if required by the patient. If there is a&#xD;
      detection of a medication issue with a patient, it will be reported to the health center&#xD;
      managers so it could receive usual care. Each patient must have interviews every two months,&#xD;
      with seven points of comparison with the intervention group. In each interview, pharmacist&#xD;
      will register the patient's vitals, medications and health problems; medication adherence&#xD;
      will be measured through the four questions Morisky-Green test and QoL by the EuroQoL 5D-3L&#xD;
      tests. Time spent in the interview must be registered. According to the pilot study it should&#xD;
      be about 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study perspective The study will be analyzed from the Chilean Ministry of Health (MINSAL)&#xD;
      perspective. We elected to use this, because CESFAM are public funded institutions and should&#xD;
      develop their services following the public policies of MINSAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, all the intervention related costs that will be included should be the ones&#xD;
      related to public budget, for example, cost of implementation of the service, cost of&#xD;
      development the intervention and any other cost related with public funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparators MRF will be compared with usual care as defined above. Time horizon The costs and&#xD;
      benefits will be evaluated for a year to avoid any season-related bias and to obtain&#xD;
      significant changes in QoL, number of medical appointments, emergency unit visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discount rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discount won't be applied because of the extension of the study (one year); therefore the&#xD;
      discount rate will be 0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of health outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits will be measured through QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year) . This analysis is&#xD;
      widely used because it reflects the personal perception of patient's QoL through survey&#xD;
      considering also the quantity of life gained with those values. For the calculation of QALYs&#xD;
      we will use the regression-adjusted area under curve (AUC) method to control for differences&#xD;
      in the initial mean values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach allows comparison with other health technologies that also use QALY as a&#xD;
      measure of benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of effectiveness is described above. Measurement and valuation of preference&#xD;
      based outcomes The QoL of the patients will be estimated using the survey EuroQoL 5D test.&#xD;
      Patients will determinate their own QoL perception, both in a descriptive and a general&#xD;
      system with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The descriptive system has five dimensions&#xD;
      (mobility, personal care, daily activities, pain and anxiety/depression); each one has three&#xD;
      levels of gravity. In this section of the survey, the patient must select the level of&#xD;
      gravity according to his/her perception in that day. In the VAS system, the patient must&#xD;
      define his/her personal health perception, ranging it in a scale between 0 and 100, being 0&#xD;
      death and 100 the best health status possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of resources and costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resources and cost will be evaluated along the year of study. In accordance with MINSAL&#xD;
      perspective approach, we will evaluate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial investment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Resource: pharmacists training time for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Costs: value by hour spent in the training program (determined by the academic&#xD;
                entity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacist´s working time (minutes), measured in Chilean pesos (CLP). • Resource: time&#xD;
           spent in the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time spent in each phase of the service:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study and evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention with the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anything else. o Cost: Pharmacist salary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacists are paid according to the Chilean law number 19.378, which refers and involves&#xD;
      primary health care professionals, and determines different categories and levels for a&#xD;
      full-time job (44 hours a week):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A: Physicians, Pharmacists, Biochemists and Dentists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B: Other professionals like Nurses, Dietitians, and Physiotherapists among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C: superior-level technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D: mid-level technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E: Administrative staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  F: cleaning staff and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each employee begins in level 15 with a fixed salary that can be increased by two&#xD;
           requirements: time (every two years) and training -by doing courses in a related area-.&#xD;
           When an employee meets these two requisites, advances to the upper level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Employees with diplomas get an increase on their wage. It varies depending on the&#xD;
           duration of the diploma (between 5 and 15%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chilean government fixes the minimum wage every year, but allows each municipality to&#xD;
      determinate their own salaries as long as they are higher than de minimum. Therefore, the&#xD;
      wage of each municipality will be used for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are bonifications given by the municipalities for different responsibilities. This&#xD;
      bonifications will not be considered because they don´t represent extra cost for the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resource: quantity of medications dispensed during the study time obtained from the&#xD;
           records from each primary care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost: prices of medications are determined according to the Chilean national supply&#xD;
           center (CENABAST in Spanish).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency visits: registered the year before the study and during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resource: Hospital urgency records, obtained from each hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital admissions: registered the year before the study and during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resource: number of hospital admissions, obtained from each hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Costs: MINSAL has fixed prices according to diagnosis called GRD (group-related&#xD;
           diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information will be used to determine if the patient was admitted by a drug-related&#xD;
      problem (DRP). The evaluation will be conducted by three physicians, specialists in internal&#xD;
      medicine according to Malet-Larrea et.al methods. The following information of the patient&#xD;
      will be provided to the evaluators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Status of the health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prescribed medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specialists in internal medicine will answer yes or no; if he/she considers that the&#xD;
      cause of the hospitalization was a DRP. Two yes answers are required to establish a positive&#xD;
      causality. Cohen´s kappa index will determine the inter-rater agreement and Fleiss´s kappa&#xD;
      index will be used for reliability of agreement between all raters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facilitator Pharmacist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resource: time spent in transport between visits, planning and intervening with each&#xD;
           pharmacist participant in the study and registration of the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost: FAPHA costs will be determined by their own salaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currency, price date, and conversion The costs and resources will be measured during 2017 and&#xD;
      2018. All the analysis will be conducted in CLP. Year 2019 will be used as baseline year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) will be determined for each scenario,&#xD;
      discounting the cost and benefits of usual care from the intervention group according to the&#xD;
      following formula: ICER = (Intervention Costs - Control Costs) / (QALY of intervention - QALY&#xD;
      of control) Uncertainty will be determined through bootstrapping to evaluate the variability&#xD;
      of the outcomes by conducting non-parametric estimations in 5000 different cases.&#xD;
      Bootstrapping results will be visualized in a cost-effectiveness plot, and an acceptability&#xD;
      curve for different QALY prices. All patients who complete the four interviews will be&#xD;
      considered in the analysis.&#xD;
