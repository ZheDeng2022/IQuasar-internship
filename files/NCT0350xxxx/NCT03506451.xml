  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single institution, pilot study is to explore the out of pocket&#xD;
      (OOP)costs and financial toxicity of cancer care for patients during definitive treatment of&#xD;
      head and neck cancer with radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy and surgical&#xD;
      resection. The study team will assess how the financial burden of cancer care impacts quality&#xD;
      of life as well as treatment-related decision-making from a patient perspective.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single institution, survey-based study to assess OOP costs, financial&#xD;
      toxicity and pateint reported outcomes (PROs') (including QOL, quality of care, and&#xD;
      attitudes/perspectives on the role of cost in treatment decisions). Potential participants&#xD;
      are new patient consults in Radiation Oncology Head and Neck Cancer Clinic. Patients with an&#xD;
      indication for definitive treatment involving radiation therapy will be approached by study&#xD;
      staff and, if amenable, enrolled in the study. After signing informed consent, they will&#xD;
      complete a baseline survey assessing socioeconomic household information, baseline&#xD;
      symptoms/QOL and baseline costs/financial toxicity. They will be followed prospectively and&#xD;
      re-surveyed at 3 and 6 months after completion of radiation therapy. Repeat assessments will&#xD;
      document treatment costs and PRO including QOL, financial toxicity, and self-reported quality&#xD;
      of care. Patients will be asked to collect all treatment-related bills in a provided binder,&#xD;
      which will be reviewed at each survey date. Basic demographic data (including age, sex, race,&#xD;
      marital status, zip code, and insurance coverage), comorbidities, smoking status, cancer&#xD;
      characteristics (stage, site, histology), treatments received, emergency department visits&#xD;
      and hospitalization rates at baseline, end of treatment, 3 months and 6 months after&#xD;
      radiation treatment will be collected as part of this study. Disease status and survival will&#xD;
      also be assessed from standard of care follow-up visits up to five years after completion of&#xD;
      radiation treatment.&#xD;
