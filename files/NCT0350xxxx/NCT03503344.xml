    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the how well apalutamide with or without stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy work in treating participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using apalutamide&#xD;
      may fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of testosterone by the tumor cells.&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver&#xD;
      radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses&#xD;
      over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is not yet known whether&#xD;
      giving apalutamide with or without stereotactic body radiation therapy works better in&#xD;
      treating participants with castration-resistant cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate whether the proportion of patients with an undetectable serum prostate&#xD;
      specific antigen (PSA) at 6 months following cessation of apalutamide is higher with addition&#xD;
      of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to prostate specific membrane antigen&#xD;
      (PSMA)-avid oligometastatic sites of disease compared to the group of patients receiving&#xD;
      apalutamide monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the time to PSA progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) criteria&#xD;
      between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of apalutamide in combination with SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the genomic factors associated with the presence of oligometastatic disease&#xD;
      via exome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the association between somatic and germline genomic alterations including&#xD;
      but not limited to androgen receptor (AR) amplification and point mutations and alterations&#xD;
      in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response pathway with outcomes on protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the metastatic pattern at baseline and at progression in these patients&#xD;
      and to determine whether features of the baseline PSMA-positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scan are associated with treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants receive apalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Beginning 60 days after first dose of apalutamide, participants also undergo&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy for 1-5 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants receive apalutamide PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed at for 30 days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Approximately 18 months from date of randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of patients with undetectable serum PSA (&lt; 0.2 ng/mL) at 6 months following completion of apalutamide therapy (18 months from date of randomization). Patients who discontinue apalutamide prior to completion of 12 months of therapy for reasons other than disease progression by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG) criteria, as well as patients who withdraw or are lost to follow up, will be considered unevaluable for this analysis. Patients who discontinue treatment for radiographic or clinical progression, even if occurring prior to receipt of SBRT in the experimental arm), would be evaluable for analysis of the primary endpoint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time to PSA Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to a diagnosis of PSA progression defined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) criteria will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods for each treatment arm. Cox proportional-hazard models, will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of treatment-related adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>For each treatment arm, adverse event incidence rates will be summarized with frequency and percentage, with all patients treated in that treatment arm as the denominator, unless otherwise specified. In addition, AE incidence rates will also be summarized by severity and relationship to study drug. Treatment-related AEs are those judged by the Investigator to be at least possibly related to the study treatment. Adverse events with missing severity or relationship to study drug will be classified as severe and treatment-related, respectively.</description>
