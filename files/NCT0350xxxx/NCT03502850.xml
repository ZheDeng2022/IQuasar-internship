  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASK120067 Tablets is a Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation selective Tyrosine&#xD;
      Kinase Inhibitor which can efficient suppress the EGFR T790M drug-resistant mutation tumor&#xD;
      cell in Xenograft mouse model. This study aims at local advanced or metastatic non-small cell&#xD;
