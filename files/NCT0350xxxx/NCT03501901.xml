      The aim of this study was to compare the etiologic agents, the antimicrobial resistance&#xD;
      rates, and the risk factors associated with a HA-UTI and CA-UTI among complicated and&#xD;
      uncomplicated UTI patients in a tertiary-care hospital in Mexico. This study was performed&#xD;
      according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki with the approval of the&#xD;
      Local Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León&#xD;
      (UR14-004). All patients with a UTI and a positive urine culture (&gt; 100,000 UFC/mL) from&#xD;
      March to October 2015 were included. The study was carried out at the Hospital Universitario&#xD;
      &quot;Dr. José Eleuterio González&quot; hospital, a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Monterrey,&#xD;
      Mexico. Identification and susceptibility antibiotic assays were performed to all isolates&#xD;
      from positive urine culture.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to compare the etiologic agents, the antimicrobial resistance&#xD;
      rates, and the risk factors associated with a HA-UTI and CA-UTI among complicated and&#xD;
      uncomplicated UTI patients in a tertiary-care hospital in Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was performed according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      with the approval of the Local Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Universidad&#xD;
      Autónoma de Nuevo León (UR14-004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with a UTI and a positive urine culture (&gt; 100,000 UFC/mL) from March to October&#xD;
      2015 were included. The study was carried out at the Hospital Universitario &quot;Dr. José&#xD;
      Eleuterio González&quot; hospital, a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Monterrey, Mexico. This&#xD;
      hospital has 500 beds, serves a population of approximately 5 million people, and has an&#xD;
      average of 250,000 medical consultations and 22,000 hospitalizations annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A UTI was defined as the presence of symptoms related to the urinary tract, pyuria (≥10&#xD;
      leucocytes per high-power field) and a positive urine culture (≥105 CFU/mL) of one&#xD;
      uropathogen according to the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)&#xD;
      and the European Association of Urology (EAU). Patients with urine cultures with&#xD;
      significative counts of two or more bacterial species were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' charts were reviewed for clinical and demographic characteristics. The&#xD;
      classification of UTIs as either complicated or uncomplicated, and hospital-acquired or&#xD;
      community-acquired, was based on the IDSA and EAU criteria. Cases which could not be&#xD;
      classified due to insufficient clinical information were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine cultures were performed according to standard protocols. Species identification of all&#xD;
      isolates was performed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Microflex, Bruker Daltonics,&#xD;
      Billerica, MA). The drug resistance profile of all E. coli isolates was determined using the&#xD;
      broth microdilution method for gentamicin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, aztreonam,&#xD;
      ceftriaxone, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin,&#xD;
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and colistin; except fosfomycin, in which the agar dilution&#xD;
      method was used. The results were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory&#xD;
      Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three&#xD;
      or more antimicrobial categories. All isolates with resistance to at least one&#xD;
      third-generation cephalosporin were evaluated for production of ESBL in E. coli using the&#xD;
      double-disc test according to the CLSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Numerical variables were&#xD;
      expressed as a mean and standard deviation. Clinical and demographic characteristics were&#xD;
      analyzed using the χ2 test for categorical variables and the t-test (or Mann-Whitney test in&#xD;
      the absence of normal distribution) for continuous variables. Statistical significance was&#xD;
      set at p &lt;0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS software version 20.0 (IBM&#xD;
      Corp, Armonk, NY).&#xD;
