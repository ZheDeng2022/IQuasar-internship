  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single institution study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination&#xD;
      treatment of nivolumab, ipilimumab, CMP-001 and radiosurgery in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer with liver metastases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with radiosurgery to liver metastases (completed by day 1), followed&#xD;
      by a priming dose of subcutaneous CMP-001 (day 1 Â± 4 days), intratumoral injections of&#xD;
      CMP-001 on days 13, 36 and 55, combined with nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks (start day 15)&#xD;
      and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (start day 15). From day 71 biweekly subcutaneous&#xD;
      injections of CMP-001 will commence. Nivolumab, ipilimumab and subcutaneous injections of&#xD;
      CMP-001 will be continued until disease progression or up to 24 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Two research biopsies will be taken from a&#xD;
      liver metastasis. The first biopsy will be taken during the screening period (pretreatment)&#xD;
      and the second one 5 weeks post-radiosurgery (which is 3 weeks post-initiation of nivolumab /&#xD;
      ipilimumab). As a safety run-in, the initial cohort of 3-6 patients will not receive&#xD;
      radiosurgery. The next cohort will not commence until the last patient from the initial&#xD;
      cohort has been followed up for at least 8 weeks post first intratumoral injection. Efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints will be based upon a non-irradiated lesion.&#xD;
