  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether light therapy can help improve plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis. This is a study based on a new medical device. The device produces its light from&#xD;
      light emitting diodes. This type of technology has been used for several years in the&#xD;
      treatment of other skin conditions. However, the investigators want to study the effect of a&#xD;
      combination of very specific wavelengths of light on reducing the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators are looking to recruit 25 volunteers from the general population between&#xD;
      the ages of 18 and 65 years old with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis and who are otherwise&#xD;
      healthy. The light treatments are 5 times a week for 12 weeks and the treatment is&#xD;
      self-administered at home. Each treatment is 15 minutes. The total duration of the study is&#xD;
      16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a controlled trial. This means that the volunteer will treat one plaque with the&#xD;
      light therapy device and the other plaque will remain untreated for the period of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, blinded, interindividual, study involving 25 healthy&#xD;
      subjects. After informed consent, confidentiality and photographic release forms, volunteers&#xD;
      who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria on page 4, will be entered&#xD;
      into the study. Subjects with a PASI of ≤10 will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Baseline, the Principle Investigator will identify comparable study plaques (where&#xD;
      possible the plaques should be of comparable size, duration and severity and where possible&#xD;
      on comparable body areas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plaques will be evaluated using the Localised Psoriasis Severity Index (LPSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point and thereafter, the Principle Investigator will be blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention/plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plaques will be numbered 1 and 2 by the study coordinator. The plaques will then be&#xD;
      randomised by the study coordinator to receive either the active treatment or act as the&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects test and control plaque will undergo a mechanical evaluation of hyperpigmentation&#xD;
      and erythema using a MC1000® (Courage and Khazaka).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) based on their psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization subjects will be instructed on how to use the Dermawrap device and the&#xD;
      treatment schedule (5 x weekly treatments for 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A topical emollient (Hydrogel) will be dispensed to the subject and the subject will be&#xD;
      instructed on its use and frequency (2 x weekly treatments for 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Subjects were then be asked to carry out a self-treatment in front of the study staff.&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed on potential side effects and severity and encouraged to contact&#xD;
      the research center in relation to any side effects or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a subject diary to complete daily to capture any adverse incidents and&#xD;
      record their treatment and treatment experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven (7) (+/- 7days) after Baseline, subjects will be contacted by study staff to check for&#xD;
      any adverse incidents or problems in using the device. Subjects will be asked if there has&#xD;
      been any change in their health or medication from their last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-eight (28) days (+/- 7days) after Baseline subjects will return to the study center.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked if there has been any change in their health or medication from their&#xD;
      last visit. The PI will be notified of any changes. Any changes will be evaluated by the PI&#xD;
      or SC against the exclusion criteria and recorded. Subjects diary will be collected and&#xD;
      reviewed by the study staff for any adverse incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects test and control plaque will undergo a mechanical evaluation of hyperpigmentation&#xD;
      and erythema using a MC1000® (Courage and Khazaka). Subjects test and control plaque will be&#xD;
      photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device will be checked, and usage data will be collected from the device. The topical&#xD;
      emollient (Hydrogel) will be dispensed to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-six (56) days (+/- 7days) after baseline subjects return to the study center for&#xD;
      assessment. Subjects will be asked if there has been any change in their health or medication&#xD;
      from their last visit. The PI will be notified of any changes. Any changes will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the PI or SC against the exclusion criteria and recorded. Subjects diary will be collected&#xD;
      and reviewed by the study staff for any adverse incidents The device will be checked, and&#xD;
      usage data will be collected from the device. Subjects test and control plaque will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the Localised Psoriasis Severity Index (LPSI) by the Blinded PI and will&#xD;
      undergo a mechanical evaluation of hyperpigmentation and erythema using a MC1000® (Courage&#xD;
      and Khazaka).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects test and control plaque will be photographed Subjects will complete a Dermatology&#xD;
      Life Quality Index (DLQI) based on their psoriasis. The topical emollient (Hydrogel) will be&#xD;
      dispensed to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty-four (84) days (+/- 7days) after baseline subjects return to the study center for&#xD;
      assessment. Subjects will be asked if there has been any change in their health or medication&#xD;
      from their last visit. The PI will be notified of any changes. Any changes will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the PI or SC against the exclusion criteria and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects diary will be collected and reviewed by the study staff for any adverse incidents&#xD;
      The device will be collected from the subject, will be checked, and usage data will be&#xD;
      collected from the device. The device will not be returned to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects test and control plaque will be evaluated using the Localised Psoriasis Severity&#xD;
      Index (LPSI) by the Blinded PI and will undergo a mechanical evaluation of hyperpigmentation&#xD;
      and erythema using a MC1000® (Courage and Khazaka).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects test and control plaque will be photographed Subjects will complete a Dermatology&#xD;
      Life Quality Index (DLQI) based on their psoriasis. In addition, the subject will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a standardized system usability scale (SUS). At day 84 (+/- 7 days) the subject will&#xD;
      stop treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and twelve (112) days (+/- 7days) the subject will return to the study center.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked by the Research assistant or Study coordinator if they have&#xD;
      experienced any changes in their health or taken new/adjusted current medications since the&#xD;
      last visit. The PI will be notified of any changes. Any changes will be evaluated by the PI&#xD;
      or SC against the exclusion criteria and recorded. Subjects diary will be collected and&#xD;
      reviewed by the study staff for any adverse incidents.&#xD;

      Standardised digital photography and Subject self-assessment of treatment response Including&#xD;
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) will be conducted. Unless any AE or SAE have been&#xD;
