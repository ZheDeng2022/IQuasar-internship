      This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a group telehealth model,&#xD;
      compared with a standard multi-disciplinary, individualized, in-clinic weight management&#xD;
      model, for treatment of adolescents with obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      As noted above, EMPOWER was a multi-disciplinary, team-based clinic model, involving&#xD;
      physicians, psychologists, registered dietitians (RDs), and physical therapists (PTs)&#xD;
      providing tertiary care management of obesity. Data from the first two years of EMPOWER&#xD;
      showed that patients with four or more visits (n=109) experienced a decrease in average BMI&#xD;
      z-score (-0.09SD). This, though modest, is promising; however, both cost and patient&#xD;
      retention present significant challenges to EMPOWER and other tertiary care pediatric obesity&#xD;
      programs, and may be barriers to further progress. Much administrative personnel time was&#xD;
      consumed in working with insurers in order to authorize visits, and nevertheless, this type&#xD;
      of hospital-based care was poorly reimbursed. Getting to Children's Hospital Los Angeles&#xD;
      (CHLA) is often a major challenge for our patients, due to the large urban sprawl of Los&#xD;
      Angeles, traffic, limited and expensive parking, and poor public transportation. Frequent&#xD;
      visits result in missed work and school days, a burden to families. Adolescent patients face&#xD;
      even greater challenges, as they learn to manage their own health and balance the emotional&#xD;
      and social changes required in the transition to adulthood, with family and parental&#xD;
      expectations and limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telehealth technology presents an innovative, cost-effective, and often highly-engaging&#xD;
      alternative to in-person visits, which bypasses many of the logistical difficulties of&#xD;
      getting to CHLA. Moreover, adolescents today are highly attuned to, and aligned with, digital&#xD;
      and mobile technologies, and are natural consumers of media in this format. There is strong&#xD;
      evidence from numerous published studies that telehealth can be an effective tool for chronic&#xD;
      disease management. Additionally, many youth with obesity are significantly socially&#xD;
      isolated, and our current individual patient-provider model does not effectively address this&#xD;
      isolation in the way we expect a group session will; various published studies of group&#xD;
      treatment have demonstrated inter-participant support and positive effects of social&#xD;
      interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While Empower's current model leads to successful weight management in many of its patients,&#xD;
      that success is often modest, as alluded to above; and for some of patients, it simply does&#xD;
      not work. With this study, the investigators intend to pilot a group telehealth model&#xD;
      targeted at adolescents with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pilot a new care delivery model for CHLA EMPOWER patients using group telehealth visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the feasibility of using telehealth with adolescent patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the efficacy of group health education sessions using video conference technology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of group health education sessions using video conference technology is a feasible,&#xD;
           cost-effective care delivery model for adolescents being treated for obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficacy of this model will be comparable to, or better than, standard&#xD;
           multi-disciplinary in-person visits. This will be measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Clinical and anthropomorphic data: i. Changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI&#xD;
           percentile, and BMI percent of the 95th percentile ii. Change in blood pressure&#xD;
           percentile iii. Change in hemoglobin A1C, ALT, triglycerides b. Quality of life c.&#xD;
           Self-efficacy d. Satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Attendance to telehealth visits will be better than attendance to standard in-person&#xD;
           visits, as measured by no-show rates and same-day reschedules&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth 14-18 years of age who meet EMPOWER clinic criteria and consent to the study will be&#xD;
      prospectively assigned to the intervention telehealth group (n=24); they will be compared to&#xD;
      a restrospective cohort of &quot;standard care&quot; EMPOWER patients (n=24). Since the investigators&#xD;
      do not expect a statistically significant difference in BMI change between the telehealth&#xD;
      intervention and standard EMPOWER, power calculations were conducted on change scores in&#xD;
      Quality of Life indicators. Using Optimal Design software v1.77 and specifying a = 0.05,&#xD;
      anticipated effect size Î´ = 0.40, between-group variance ranging around 0.05, and controlling&#xD;
      for effects of the covariates on various measures at 3 and 6 months, it is expected that 24&#xD;
      participants per condition will provide a moderate power to identify a treatment effect for&#xD;
      proof of concept purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group telehealth sessions twice per month for 6 months. The group sessions will be 60&#xD;
           minutes and involve delivery of a semi-structured curriculum including topics such as&#xD;
           nutrition education, reducing barriers to physical activity, and mindfulness techniques.&#xD;
           Sessions will be facilitated by EMPOWER providers (physicians, psychologists, RDs, and&#xD;
           PTs) who will use a combination of: 1) motivational interviewing techniques, modified&#xD;
           for the group setting, 2) supportive exploration of barriers to behavior change and 3)&#xD;
           setting SMART goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief individualized coaching by the program coordinator between sessions via telephone&#xD;
           or email. It will be comparable to the personalized feedback and motivation provided in&#xD;
           standard EMPOWER.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parent newsletters will be sent out monthly to inform parents of key messages; parents&#xD;
           will also be informed of their child's attendance to the session&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects received the standard EMPOWER model consisting of monthly in person clinic&#xD;
      visits where they met individually with a combination of providers (physician, RD, PT, and/or&#xD;
      psychologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group participants will have in-person visits at baseline, 3 and 6 months to&#xD;
      measure weight, vertical growth, and blood pressure, and complete questionnaires assessing&#xD;
      quality of life, self-efficacy and satisfaction. Anthropomorphic measures and attendance&#xD;
      rates will be compared to the retrospective control group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. class 2 or 3 obesity OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. class 1 obesity plus a significant comorbidity, such as impaired glucose tolerance or&#xD;
             type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
             disease (NAFLD), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), or obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. significant intellectual or neurodevelopmental disability&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. inability to stand on a scale independently without assistance or use of an assistive&#xD;
             device&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. non-English speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
        Given the shared nature of group appointments, participants should be at approximately the&#xD;
        same developmental stage as their peers. Discussion topics may include stigma, body image,&#xD;
        family dynamics, and school issues, and therefore a wide variance in age range or cognitive&#xD;
        status could potentially diminish the effectiveness of the group sessions. Non-English&#xD;
        speaking youth will be excluded due to limitations in translation services for such a small&#xD;
        pilot project. English speaking adolescents with non-English speaking parents will be&#xD;
        included.&#xD;
