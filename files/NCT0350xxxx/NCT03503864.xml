      This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-lable, multi-center clinical trial. Children≤&#xD;
      14 years old are eligible for this study if they were newly diagnosed with neuroblastoma and&#xD;
      assessed as stage 4 according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) or&#xD;
      stage M according to the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) respectively. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in this study will receive combined induction chemotherapy with arsenic trioxide&#xD;
      following an modifed protocol based on N7 and NB2004 protocols. Objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      at 4 weeks after completing induction chemotherapy was defined as the main outcome and&#xD;
      adverse events were monitored and graded in the meantime.&#xD;

    <description>Arsenic trioxide（ATO） is administered 0.16mg/kg per day over eight hours IV daily for ten days. Patients will receive ATO alone on days 1-2 and combined with conventional induction chemotherapy on days 3-10. Nine cycles at most of ATO-combined chemotherapy were applied in the whole scheme.</description>
