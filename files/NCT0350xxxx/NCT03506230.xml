  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with uncontrolled diabetes [glycated hemoglobin (Hba1c)&gt;8.5%] from low socioeconomic&#xD;
      status neighborhoods in Jerusalem will be recruited. They will be randomly assigned to an&#xD;
      intervention group and a control group. The intervention group will be offered a bonus to buy&#xD;
      their medications, 100 Israeli Shekels (ILS) (30$) each month for 3 months, if they reduce&#xD;
      their HBA1c by 0.7% or if their HbA1c level reaches 7.5%. After 6 months they will be&#xD;
      eligible for another bonus for one month if they improve their HbA1c by 0.3% from the&#xD;
      previous test. The control group will buy medications as usual. All participants will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone and will be encouraged to contact their doctor, to perform blood tests and&#xD;
      to maintain a healthy lifestyle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in primary care clinics in a big Health Funds in Jerusalem and&#xD;
      the area (Clalit Health Services). Guidance will be given to the professional staff in the&#xD;
      clinics and the pharmacists in the pharmacies of the Health Care Fund. Candidates will be&#xD;
      identified from lists of diabetic patients and will be invited to the clinic or will be&#xD;
      contacted upon arrival to the clinic. Candidates that will agree to participate in the study&#xD;
      will sign an informed consent and answer a small survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates that do not have a recent HbA1c result (from the last month) will be referred to&#xD;
      perform a blood test. Only patients with an updated result of 8.5% or higher, will be&#xD;
      included in the study. The participants will receive explanations from the research staff or&#xD;
      the medical professionals at the clinic. General recommendations for diabetes care will be&#xD;
      provided orally, and a written summary will be given. Contact details with the research staff&#xD;
      will be provided as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be contacted by phone to inform them of their group membership within&#xD;
      three days of the recruitment, or 3 days after receiving the result of the blood test. The&#xD;
      information will be delivered by a member of the research team that will not know the&#xD;
      participants. The result will be sent by mail as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incentives group participants will be told they will receive a bonus to buy their&#xD;
      medications at the designated pharmacies. After three months, if they reduce their HBA1c by&#xD;
      0.7% compared to the previous test, or if their HbA1c level is reduced to 7.5% or below, they&#xD;
      will get a bonus of up to 100 ILS (30$) every month, for the next three months depending on&#xD;
      the total amount of their purchased medicine that month. Six months after entering the trial&#xD;
      they will be entitled to a bonus for one additional month if they have reduced their HbA1c&#xD;
      level by 0.3% compared to the last test. The bonus can be used to pay for chronic&#xD;
      prescription drugs for diabetes, hypertension (HTN) or hyperlipidemia those who are included&#xD;
      in the Israeli &quot;health basket,&quot; or not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment group will buy medications as usual. All participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to get their treatment and prescriptions from their physician, and to take their&#xD;
      medication regularly. They will receive recommendations for a healthy lifestyle with&#xD;
      low-sugar diet and physical activity, be encouraged to perform routine blood and urine tests&#xD;
      and have an eye examination once a year. They will receive by mail a tracking page for&#xD;
      documentation of hypoglycemia events. They will be asked to document events of symptomatic&#xD;
      low blood sugar (55mg/dl or less) and to indicate whether they needed help to recover from&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. They will be told a research assistant will contact them during the follow- up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistant will call all participants at one, three, four and six months after&#xD;
      the entrance to the study. The patients will be reminded to perform blood tests after three&#xD;
      months and six months, to refer to their doctor to get their treatment and prescriptions, and&#xD;
      to comply with all other recommendations mentioned above. These frequent calls will be&#xD;
      performed to ensure patients safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked by phone about symptoms of hypoglycemia with sugar levels of 55&#xD;
      mg/dl or lower, loss of consciousness or need of intervention to increase their blood sugar,&#xD;
      what kind of help was needed, and if they went or were taken to the hospital. Severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemic events will be reported immediately to the research coordinator, to the&#xD;
      attending physician and the ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure of the medications bonuses will be arranged in advance with the health&#xD;
      maintenance organization (HMO) pharmacies. The patients will get vouchers for buying&#xD;
      medications from their doctor or the research staff. Patients from the incentive group will&#xD;
      be allowed to receive both bonuses (after three months and after six months) only if they&#xD;
      perform their blood tests as scheduled. A patient that will delay his test to four months or&#xD;
      more from entry will be entitled only to the first three months bonus. This result will count&#xD;
      as the final result for this patient. At six months, participants of all groups will be&#xD;
      encouraged to perform their blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the trial, data will be collected from the medical records, including HbA1c&#xD;
      result, performance of LDL-Cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), albumin-creatinine ratio during&#xD;
      the last year test and an eye examination during the last year, consultations with the&#xD;
      attending doctor or the diabetic specialist that included prescribing medications for&#xD;
      diabetes, name of the patient's clinic, co-morbidities (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal&#xD;
      and vascular), diabetes complications, number of medications for diabetes, and prescription&#xD;
      of newer medications for diabetes (Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide glycolipoprotein (GLP) 1 agonists, Sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLT) 2&#xD;
      inhibitors). Information about hypoglycemia events will be drawn from the medical files as&#xD;
      well: episodes of severe hypoglycemia, when the patient needed the help of another person, or&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose testing of 55 mg/dl or below accompanied with symptoms, visits to the&#xD;
      emergency room attributed to hypoglycemia, Finally, hospitalizations for a week or more, and&#xD;
      regular discount for medications due to low income.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitments stage will last one year. Each participant will take part in the study for 6&#xD;
      months, not more than 7 months, till they perform the last blood test. After the last&#xD;
      participant performs the final blood test, there will be an ending period for 6 months.&#xD;
      Altogether the study will be carried out for two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated for the primary outcome, of 0.55% difference in HbA1c levels&#xD;
      between the intervention and the control group, and a 1.2 standard deviation of HbA1c tests&#xD;
      of diabetic patients in Clalit Health Services in 2013. In this study, the effect is expected&#xD;
      to be higher as in low socioeconomic status patients. To ensure an 80% power to detect&#xD;
      differences between arms, and a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided), 76 participants will&#xD;
      be needed in each group. To account for dropouts 15% additional participants will be&#xD;
      recruited, or a total number of 180 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any information of severe hypoglycemia will be immediately reported to a research team member&#xD;
      to examine the event and to report to the attending physician and the chief investigator. In&#xD;
      this situation, the patient's participation in the research will be discontinued, and the&#xD;
      event will be reported to the Ethics Committee. In case of death for any reason, it will be&#xD;
      reported in detail to the Ethics Committee. An interim analysis will be conducted after half&#xD;
      of the study participants (84 people) will finish their study to test the safety of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will allow visitors on behalf of the ethics committee or regulators to have&#xD;
      direct access to information sources and other documents. Monitoring and auditing will take&#xD;
      place after half of the participants complete the study.&#xD;
