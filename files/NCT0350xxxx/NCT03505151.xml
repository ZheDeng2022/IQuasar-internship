    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the absolute bioavailability of BI&#xD;
      409306. The secondary objective is the evaluation and comparison of several pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters for the different treatments.&#xD;

             at least 30 days before the first administration of trial medication and until 30 days&#xD;
             after trial completion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of adequate contraception, e.g. non-hormonal intrauterine device plus condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually abstinent&#xD;

                  stimulating hormone) above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30 ng/L is confirmatory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from&#xD;
             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current smoker or ex-smoker who quit smoking less than 30 days prior to screening&#xD;
