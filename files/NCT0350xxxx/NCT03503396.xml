  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to set up a larger investigation examining predictors of the decision&#xD;
      to drive after consuming alcohol. All participants will carry a study provided smartphone and&#xD;
      breathalizer device for the 2 week period of the study. The intervention is that participants&#xD;
      are randomly assigned to one of 2 breathalizer feedback conditions - one where they receive a&#xD;
      warning that their results indicate they should not drive and one where they receive no&#xD;
      feedback. The study is designed to provide information needed for a larger version with a&#xD;
      similar protocol, but also to provide an initial test of project hypotheses as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite previous success in reducing alcohol impaired driving (AID) and fatal crashes, rates&#xD;
      have not decreased significantly since the 1990s. Developing novel approaches to&#xD;
      prevention/intervention are likely required to produce further progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is designed to evaluate a potential intervention for AID using mobile&#xD;
      technology. In addition, the project is designed to provide pilot data for a large scale&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent laboratory work by the PI has demonstrated the utility of assessing AID risk factors&#xD;
      when participants are intoxicated. We identified four risk factors that, measured under&#xD;
      intoxication, are cross-sectional predictors of AID: AID attitudes (Morris et al., 2014),&#xD;
      impulsivity (McCarthy et al., 2012), behavioral economic demand (Amlung et al., 2016) and&#xD;
      subjective intoxication (Amlung et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will evaluate these factors as prospective predictors of AID and extend&#xD;
      this work outside the laboratory and into participants' natural drinking environment using&#xD;
      Ambulatory Assessment (AA). AA is a set of techniques used to collect data from individuals&#xD;
      in the course of their daily life. AA methods provide increased ecological validity across&#xD;
      multiple modalities (e.g., self-report, physiological measures). No study to date has used AA&#xD;
      to examine AID. We will employ a combination of three AA methods: ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment, geospatial technology, and portable breath analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a form of AA that allows participants to self-report&#xD;
      on their current thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in their natural environment (Shiffman et&#xD;
      al., 2008). EMA avoids most pitfalls of retrospective reports, and is increasingly used to&#xD;
      study temporally proximal influences on substance use behaviors (Shiffman, 2009). Despite the&#xD;
      importance of such influences to AID decisions (Quinn &amp; Fromme, 2012), no study to date has&#xD;
      applied EMA methods to the study of AID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advancements in mobile technology, such as global position systems (GPS) and portable&#xD;
      breathalizers, allow for the collection of objective data on participant location and alcohol&#xD;
      use in real-time. We will combine location data (e.g., drinking venue, distance from home)&#xD;
      and in-the-moment breathalyzer data with self-report EMA data from each participant drinking&#xD;
      episode. This combination will allow for a more complete assessment of event-level factors&#xD;
      that contribute to AID decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot project will test the hypothesis that temporally proximal measures of AID risk&#xD;
      factors (subjective impairment, perceived risk) collected during a drinking episode will&#xD;
      improve prediction of AID, over and above trait measures of AID risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot project will also test the potential for AA to function as an intervention for AID.&#xD;
      In this pilot, participants will be randomly assigned to either receive some feedback from&#xD;
      their breathalyzer (a warning that they have consumed too much to drive safely) or not to&#xD;
      receive any feedback. Note that participants will not be told their BAC, due to potential&#xD;
      risks of specific feedback (increased consumption, titrating drinking to drive at slightly&#xD;
      below .08). Instead, feedback will be general (&quot;Your results indicate that you have drank too&#xD;
      much to drive safely&quot;), and participants will not be aware of what BAC triggers these&#xD;
      warnings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of all participants AID behavior at baseline (from a Timeline Follow-back&#xD;
      assessment) with their AID behavior during study participation will be used to test whether&#xD;
      the increased self-monitoring of AA can alter AID decisions. In addition, comparisons between&#xD;
      groups (feedback vs. none) will test for potential effects of BAC feedback on AID decisions.&#xD;
      Support for these hypotheses could lead to novel, cost-effective interventions to reduce AID&#xD;
      using mobile technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot will enroll 40 moderate-to-heavy drinking young adults. Participants will complete&#xD;
      a brief laboratory session of AID risk measures, followed by two weeks of AA. They will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions (BAC feedback vs. none). Interview assessments of&#xD;
      AID will be conducted at baseline and at the completion of AA assessments, with interviewers&#xD;
      blind to condition.&#xD;
