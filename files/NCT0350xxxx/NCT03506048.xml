  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenvatinib works when given together with standard of&#xD;
      care iodine I-131 in treating patients with radioactive iodine-sensitive differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid cancer. Lenvatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib pretreatment along with radioactive iodine (RAI) in&#xD;
      patients with previously treated RAI sensitive thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate the safety of the combination of lenvatinib and RAI in patients with Iodine&#xD;
      sensitive differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess dynamic changes in established serum based biomarkers of DTC (thyroglobulin&#xD;
      [Tg] and Tg antibody).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the utility of protein and genetic biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenvatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 8 weeks and up to 12 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Patients also receive iodine I-131 PO&#xD;
      daily as standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 6 weeks, every 3 months&#xD;
      for 1 year, and then periodically thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously untreated and or symptomatic brain metastases are excluded&#xD;
             from this clinical trial because of the risk of intracranial bleeding with angiogenic&#xD;
             agents and tumoral swelling from RAI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to lenvatinib&#xD;

             predisposes to risk of major hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenvatinib is a tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with lenvatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
