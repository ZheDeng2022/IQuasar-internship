        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC (IIIB/IV) and extensive disease SCLC with&#xD;

             inclusive) followed up outpatient in the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older at initial diagnosis of IIIB/IV NSCLC and extensive disease&#xD;
             SCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have participated in or are attending clinical trials receiving active LC&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unknown initial diagnosis time and initial treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For hospitals without outpatient chemo therapy center, patients who were prescribed&#xD;
             with chemo therapy but with no inpatient records will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received inpatient therapy for one time and were not routinely (more than&#xD;
             twice a year, inclusive) followed up outpatient will be excluded&#xD;
