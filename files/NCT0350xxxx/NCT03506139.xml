  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial increases radiation to areas of the brain considered to be at risk for&#xD;
      cancer. The at-risk areas are identified by a biological MRI scan. The study will look at&#xD;
      side effects of the radiation and overall survival.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if increasing radiation dose to at-risk areas impacts overall survival&#xD;
      without causing a decrease in quality of life or an increase in radiation side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard radiation dose for glioblastoma (GBM) is 60 Gray in 30 fractions, with patients&#xD;
      receiving 1 fraction per day, Monday through Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will use a total of 75 Gray in 30 fractions, with participants receiving 1&#xD;
      fraction per day, Monday through Friday. Participants will still receive the standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy (temozolomide) at the standard dose (75 mg/m2, once daily, 7 days a week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also uses a different imaging technique to identify the tumor target and the&#xD;
      tissues at risk. Normal imaging techniques will be used to define the standard target volume&#xD;
      and will receive the standard radiation dose (60 Gray). A special MRI sequence will identify&#xD;
      at risk areas based on diffusion and perfusion abnormalities. This area will receive the&#xD;
      higher radiation dose (75 Gray).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires and neurocognitive&#xD;
      evaluations at specific time points. This is to identify any side effects from the higher&#xD;
      radiation dose. Preliminary work done at University of Michigan suggests a lack of side&#xD;
      effects from the higher dose of radiation.&#xD;
