  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resting Energy Expenditure is the amount of energy, usually expressed in Kcal required for a&#xD;
      24 hour period by the body during resting conditions. It is closely related to, but not&#xD;
      identical to, basal metabolic rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the ESPGHAN committee guidelines on enteral nutrient supply for preterm infants,&#xD;
      which were published in 2010, the daily protein intake of extremely low birth weight infants&#xD;
      shall be 4.5 g/kg/day, and for those above 1000g, 4 g/kg/day. In order to meet these&#xD;
      recommendations, the human milk for all premature infants is enriched with human milk&#xD;
      fortifier, and supplemental liquid protein according to our NICU protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known on the effect of this enrichment on the basal metabolic rate of premature&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way of determining the basal metabolic rate is by measuring the resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure. In order to do that the investigators use an indirect calorimety by using the&#xD;
      Deltatrac II metabolic monitor (Datex-Ohmeda). This instrument uses the principle of the&#xD;
      open-circuit system that allows continuous measurements of oxygen consumption and carbon&#xD;
      dioxide production using a constant flow generator.&#xD;

      Infants will be enrolled when tolerating full feeds (150-160 ml/kg/d) of human breast milk&#xD;
      fortified with standard fortifier for 2 days and before protein supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic studies will be conducted while the infants are prone and asleep and at the same&#xD;
      time of the day (noon time) for all infants, starting 1 hour after the completion of the last&#xD;
      feed. Measurements will be stopped during body movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each measure, once a day, will last for 30 min. A total of 4 REE measurements will be&#xD;
      performed for all participants: before starting with protein supplementation, on day 0 (D0),&#xD;
      and at days 2, 3 and 4 of protein supplementation.&#xD;
