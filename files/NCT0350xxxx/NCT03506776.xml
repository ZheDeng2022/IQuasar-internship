      Foot self-management is important in preventing diabetic foot ulcers. However, even when&#xD;
      individuals care for their feet, the signs of inflammation are often missed. A tool that will&#xD;
      identify inflammation, a sign of initial tissue damage, may be needed. Previous research has&#xD;
      shown that foot temperature self-monitoring reduced ulcer incidence by providing a warning&#xD;
      sign of inflammation. However, these studies used an expensive medical thermometer. The&#xD;
      objectives for this mixed-methods study are: (1) to determine if a foot health intervention&#xD;
      that utilizes an inexpensive commercially-available infrared thermometer (CAIT) improves foot&#xD;
      outcomes for individuals with diabetes; (2) to identify factors impacting foot&#xD;
      self-management; (3) and to explore the participants', family and support persons', and&#xD;
      healthcare providers' experiences with foot self-management and the intervention. This study&#xD;
      will have three phases: Phase 1, patients, family and support person, and healthcare&#xD;
      providers will share their insights regarding foot self-management to inform the&#xD;
      intervention; Phase 2, a six-month RCT will assess the effectiveness of a CAIT; Phase 3,&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted with participants, family and support persons, and health&#xD;
      providers to explore their experiences with the intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a global health emergency, which is estimated to increase throughout the 21st&#xD;
      century (Guariguata et al., 2014). The prevalence of diabetes in Canada is increasing; in&#xD;
      2014, 6.7% of Canadians and 9% of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians had diabetes (Statistics&#xD;
      Canada, 2014). In 2020 the number of people in Canada with diabetes is expected to rise to&#xD;
      2.5 million people, or 9.9% of the population (Canadian Diabetes Association, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diabetes are at risk for poor foot health and the estimated lifetime incidence&#xD;
      of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) for this population is 25% (Singh, Armstrong, &amp; Lipsky, 2005).&#xD;
      In Canada in 2011 DFUs and related care cost the healthcare system 547 million dollars&#xD;
      (Hopkins, Burke, Harlock, Jegathisawaran, &amp; Goeree, 2015). Complicated DFUs that do not heal&#xD;
      can lead to amputation; an estimated 85% of amputations are the result of a DFU (Canadian&#xD;
      Association of Wound Care, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing number of people with diabetes will result in a rise in foot complications&#xD;
      such as DFUs (Canadian Diabetes Association, 2009). Therefore, it is important to develop&#xD;
      strategies for the prevention of DFUs. An important aspect of maintaining foot health is&#xD;
      self-management (Boulton et al., 2008; Chang, Peng, Chang, &amp; Chen, 2013). However, there is&#xD;
      limited literature related to the experiences of diabetic patients with foot management&#xD;
      (Delea et al., 2015). As a result, little is known of the factors that need to be addressed&#xD;
      to ensure successful uptake of a self-management strategy. Further exploration of the issue&#xD;
      of foot self-assessment and self-management with patients and health care providers is needed&#xD;
      in order to develop and implement effective and sustainable interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to prevent DFUs need to provide patients with strategies to prevent skin&#xD;
      breakdown. Due to neuropathy individuals with diabetes do not recognize the inflammation that&#xD;
      occurs prior to skin breakdown. In many instances, by the time individuals have identified a&#xD;
      problem the ulceration had already occurred (Lavery et al., 2004). For patients with diabetes&#xD;
      factors such as pressure can contribute to inflammation and increase plantar foot&#xD;
      temperature. Commercially available-infrared thermometers (CAITs) can be used to detect this&#xD;
      temperature increase before skin breakdown. Once the increase is identified, the individual&#xD;
      can relieve pressure, for example by resting, until the temperature normalizes and&#xD;
      inflammation decreases. If the temperature does not normalize in two days then a physician&#xD;
      should be consulted. Therefore, self-management strategies that focus on identifying and&#xD;
      addressing early signs of inflammation, such as a temperature increase, may be effective in&#xD;
      preventing skin breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various systematic reviews, which contained three randomized control trials (RCTs), have&#xD;
      indicated that the use of personal temperature monitoring with a medical grade thermometer&#xD;
      was an effective way to predict, and thus prevent DFUs (Arad, Fonseca, Peters, &amp; Vinik, 2011;&#xD;
      Houghton, Bower, &amp; Chant, 2013; van Netten et al., 2015). These thermometers cost&#xD;
      approximately $700, which can be prohibitively expensive. A recent study compared inexpensive&#xD;
      CAITs, that cost under $100, to medical infrared thermometers and found them to be a reliable&#xD;
      measure of skin temperature (Mufti, Coutts, &amp; Sibbald, 2015). However, this technology has&#xD;
      not been used as part of an intervention and it is unknown if the CAIT will result in the&#xD;
      same positive results as the medical grade thermometer. This study will fill this empirical&#xD;
      gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Canadian Diabetes Association's position statement on amputation prevention calls for&#xD;
      affordable and timely access to devices, education, and care (Canadian Diabetes Association.,&#xD;
      2015). Use of a CAIT may potentially meet this need and offers a low-cost self-management&#xD;
      tool to prevent skin breakdown. The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to determine if a&#xD;
      self-management strategy that utilizes a low-cost CAIT is effective to prevent DFUs. Through&#xD;
      engagement with patients and healthcare providers this research will also examine factors&#xD;
      impacting self-management not addressed in prior studies and utilize this information to&#xD;
      inform the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Qualitative) Purposive convenience sampling will be utilized in Phase 1 and&#xD;
      patients, support persons, and healthcare providers will be selected that will inform the&#xD;
      researcher about issues with foot self-management. To gain a comprehensive understanding of&#xD;
      foot self-management, participants will be selected who have a variety of experiences and&#xD;
      characteristics, such as patients with diabetes with various foot health challenges and&#xD;
      healthcare providers with different professional designations such as physicians and nurses.&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews lasting 20-30 minutes will be conducted at a mutually convenient&#xD;
      location over six-weeks. All interviews will be recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed&#xD;
      using content analysis to identify themes and recommendations for the intervention. For&#xD;
      example, a finding from Phase 1 may be that patients are not sure what information to&#xD;
      communicate to their healthcare provider about their feet. Such a finding would be addressed&#xD;
      by incorporating into the intervention further education about communication and potentially&#xD;
      a checklist that the patients can use to take with them for appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (RCT) Using a list of randomly generated numbers patients will be assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention or control group. The control group and intervention group will receive foot&#xD;
      self-management education. The content of the education will be finalized following&#xD;
      completion of Phase 1. The education will be provided in video format utilizing the Canadian&#xD;
      Association of Wound Care (CAWC) diabetic foot management YouTube video and one-on-one&#xD;
      teaching. Both groups will be provided with an inspection mirror with an extendable handle to&#xD;
      assist with visualizing the bottom of the feet and a pedometer to measure daily activity.&#xD;
      Additionally, the intervention group will receive a CAIT. Education on use of the CAIT will&#xD;
      be provided through demonstration using a foot model and CAIT. The foot model will be marked&#xD;
      with a zigzag pattern on the plantar surface to illustrate the path that should be used when&#xD;
      measuring temperature. The support person will be included in the teaching if he/she will be&#xD;
      assisting the participant to obtain temperature readings. The participant will also be&#xD;
      provided with a letter explaining the study to take to his/her healthcare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is the same for both groups with the addition of foot temperature measurement&#xD;
      for the intervention group. The initial one-hour intake session will take place in the&#xD;
      participant's home or at Memorial University School of Nursing and will include completing&#xD;
      baseline assessments and distributing requisitions for bloodwork and the orthotic assessment,&#xD;
      log books, and equipment. Use of one trained interviewer will minimize information bias&#xD;
      during data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the initial visit a second 15-minute visit will be booked with participants in&#xD;
      the intervention group for one week later. The purpose of the second visit will be to&#xD;
      determine if the thermometer is being used correctly and the documentation is being completed&#xD;
      as intended. This will also be an opportunity to answer any questions. Next, the RA or&#xD;
      researcher will contact the participant and support persons one week later (e.g.,, week 2)&#xD;
      via phone to check if there are any questions or concerns. If the participant's concerns&#xD;
      cannot be answered over the phone the RA or investigator will book a time to visit the&#xD;
      participant. The log books for participants in the control group and intervention group will&#xD;
      be picked up on a monthly basis either by the investigator or RA. A tracking form will be&#xD;
      used to organize the timeframe for the phone calls and visits. Participants in the control&#xD;
      group will be contacted via phone one week after the initial visit to address any questions&#xD;
      or concerns. At three months and six months another hour-long appointment will be made with&#xD;
      all participants to complete assessments and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant develops an ulcer during the RCT his/her participation in the study will end&#xD;
      but data collected will be included. A participant will be advised to immediately contact&#xD;
      his/her physician if an area of concern is identified. Also, a participant will be asked to&#xD;
      contact the investigator if he/she develops an ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is incidence of ulceration measured through physical assessment and&#xD;
      self-report utilizing a standard definition of DFU. Secondary outcomes include any other&#xD;
      foot-related changes, changes in satisfaction, quality of life, and self-efficacy.&#xD;
      Confounding variables include: pedometer readings, HbA1C, orthotic assessment, temperature,&#xD;
      depression symptoms, foot care behaviors, and information collected in the participant&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 (Qualitative) At the end of the data collection of Phase 2 participants will be&#xD;
      recruited for Phase 3. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 25 RCT participants&#xD;
      (15 participants from the intervention group, 5 participants and their support person who&#xD;
      assisted with measuring the foot temperature, 5 participants from the control group) and 10&#xD;
      healthcare providers who were consulted by participants during the intervention to obtain&#xD;
      information about the experiences with self-management and the intervention. The interview&#xD;
      with the participants and healthcare providers will be of 30-45 minutes duration and will&#xD;
      take place at a mutually convenient location. The interviews with the support person will be&#xD;
      conducted separately from the participant and will be of 20 minutes in duration. All&#xD;
      interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim. The details of the methods, including&#xD;
      the analysis that will be utilized in phase 3, will be developed after the completion of&#xD;
      phase 2.&#xD;
