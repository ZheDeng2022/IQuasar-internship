  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid weight gain during infancy is a powerful, and potentially malleable, risk factor for&#xD;
      later overweight and obesity, but limited research has examined the impact of promising&#xD;
      interventions when applied to the groups most at risk for rapid weight gain in infancy. The&#xD;
      present study examines whether providing mothers of newborns with responsive parenting&#xD;
      guidance during the first weeks of life to promote infant sleep and soothing can reduce rapid&#xD;
      weight gain for African American infants born in low SES contexts.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized controlled trial. This trial will deliver a responsive&#xD;
      parenting intervention (Sleep Soothe) to provide information on how to soothe, how to&#xD;
      distinguish hunger from other distress, how to promote self-soothing, and bedtime routines.&#xD;
      The responsive parenting intervention will be compared to a safety control group (Sleep&#xD;
      Safe). The programs will be delivered across 2 sessions at 3-weeks and 8-weeks postpartum.&#xD;
      Both interventions and all data collection will be delivered in participants' homes.&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted in participants' homes at 1-week postpartum, 3 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum, 8 weeks postpartum, and 16-weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hundred African American infants and their mothers will be recruited from the&#xD;
      mother/baby nursery at Augusta University Medical Center. A dedicated recruitment coordinator&#xD;
      will have access to electronic medical records systems in order to pre-screen mothers and&#xD;
      infants. The recruitment coordinator will approach those who match basic inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and will deliver an approved verbal script to pre-screened mothers to determine interest in&#xD;
      participation. Interested mothers will respond to remaining screening questions in order to&#xD;
      confirm eligibility. Once enrollment criteria are satisfied, informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the infant's mother during her hospital stay. Mothers will also complete&#xD;
      selected demographic information. Anthropometric measurements will be obtained on the infant,&#xD;
      mother, and father (optional). After enrollment, families will be scheduled for a research&#xD;
      visit at their home at 1 week postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At home visit 1 (7-10 days postpartum), mothers (and fathers, if interested) will complete&#xD;
      questionnaire measures using Qualtrics. There will also be measurements of infant weight and&#xD;
      length. Families will be randomized to condition following this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At home visit 2 (3 weeks postpartum), families will receive either the responsive parenting&#xD;
      intervention or the safety control intervention. They will complete brief questionnaires.&#xD;
      Measures of infant, maternal, and paternal (optional) weight will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At home visit 3 (8 weeks postpartum), families will receive either the second part of the&#xD;
      responsive parenting intervention or the second part of the safety control intervention. They&#xD;
      will complete brief questionnaires. Measures of infant, maternal, and (optional: paternal)&#xD;
      weight will be obtained. Mothers will be provided with activity monitors for themselves and&#xD;
      for their babies that will be picked up by study staff after 7 days' use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At home visit 4 (16 weeks postpartum), mothers will complete questionnaire measures (fathers'&#xD;
      participation is optional). Measures of maternal and paternal (optional) weight will be&#xD;
      obtained, as will measures of infant weight, length, and head circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We test the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the effects of responsive parenting, focused on infant sleep and&#xD;
      soothing, on reducing rapid weight gain from 3 to 16 weeks among African American infants. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that infants in the Sleep Soothe condition will gain weight more slowly compared&#xD;
      to infants in the Sleep Safe condition and have lower weight outcomes (i.e., BMI z scores,&#xD;
      weight-for-length z scores, weight-for-age z scores) at age 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess effects of responsive parenting on parental and infant behaviors.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that compared with parents in the Sleep Safe condition, parents in the Sleep&#xD;
      Soothe condition will show increases in responsive parenting, parenting self-efficacy, and&#xD;
      the use of alternatives to feeding to soothe (white noise, pacifier, etc.), and decreases in&#xD;
      feeding to soothe. Over time, infants in this condition will have longer sleep bouts and&#xD;
      fewer feedings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To examine moderation of intervention effects by individual and contextual&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
