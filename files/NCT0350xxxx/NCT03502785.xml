  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/IIA, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity&#xD;
      and preliminary clinical efficacy of INO-5401 + INO-9012 delivered by intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      injection followed by electroporation (EP), in combination with atezolizumab in participants&#xD;
      with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent Urothelial Carcinoma (UCa). The&#xD;
      trial population is divided into two cohorts: Cohort A: Participants with locally advanced&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic/recurrent UCa, who have confirmed disease progression during or&#xD;
      following treatment with anti-Programmed Death receptor-1/Programmed Death receptor Ligand-1&#xD;
      (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) therapy; Cohort B: Participants with locally advanced unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic/recurrent UCa, who are treatment naïve and ineligible for cisplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy. A safety run-in will be performed with up to six participants (safety analysis&#xD;
      participants) from cohort A.&#xD;
