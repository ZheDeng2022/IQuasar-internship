    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of copanlisib and nivolumab and&#xD;
      side effects of copanlisib given together with nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients&#xD;
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) or lymphoma.&#xD;
      Copanlisib stops tumors from growing by blocking proteins that are known to be important for&#xD;
      tumor cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving copanlisib together with nivolumab or with nivolumab&#xD;
      and ipilimumab may work better in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety, tolerability, and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      copanlisib and nivolumab combination in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of copanlisib combined with nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effect of the doublet and triplet combinations on markers of anti-tumor&#xD;
      immunity in circulating immune cells and pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the effect of the combination on biomarkers of AKT inhibition, deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) damage (gammaH2AX, pNbs1, Rad51), apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition&#xD;
      in CTCs and pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess preliminary antitumor activity of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOUBLET TREATMENT PLAN: Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1,&#xD;
      8, and 15 and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 or on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIPLET TREATMENT PLAN: Patients receive copanlisib IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15,&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 or on days 1 and 15. Beginning cycle 2, patients also&#xD;
      receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 for a total of 4 doses. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial, with the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease&#xD;
             status has remained stable for &gt;= 1 month after treatment of the brain metastases;&#xD;
             patients on anti-seizure medications may be enrolled at the discretion of the&#xD;
             principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with blood oxygen saturation &lt; 90% at rest; patients must not have&#xD;
             symptomatic interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, or known pulmonary fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled arterial hypertension are ineligible. Uncontrolled arterial&#xD;
             hypertension is defined as an average blood pressure of &gt; 140 mm Hg systolic and/or &gt;&#xD;
             90 mm Hg diastolic over 3 measurements, taken over the course of one clinic visit at&#xD;
             intervals of &gt;=30 minutes. Patients with well-controlled arterial hypertension are&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled Type I or II diabetes mellitus, defined as fasting blood&#xD;
             glucose of &gt;160 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin measurement (HgA1c) &gt;8.5%, are&#xD;
             ineligible. Patients with fasting blood glucose &gt;160 mg/dL may be eligible if the&#xD;
             HgA1c &lt; 8.5%, per principal investigator (PI) discretion. Patients with&#xD;
             well-controlled diabetes mellitus are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are not eligible if they have had or are planned for solid organ transplant&#xD;

             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; however,&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids may be indicated after starting the study drugs to treat&#xD;
             immune-related adverse reactions; inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement&#xD;
             doses &gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active&#xD;
             autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are not eligible if they have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1,&#xD;
             anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug&#xD;
             specifically targeting immune checkpoint pathways. Patients should therefore be&#xD;
             excluded if they have had prior treatment with the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and&#xD;
             a PD-1 inhibitor; however, prior treatment with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor (without the&#xD;
             addition of a checkpoint inhibitor) is allowed. Patients that have had prior CAR&#xD;
             T-cell therapy are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously received one line of immunotherapy (including checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitors) are eligible; however, patients previously receiving ipilimumab +&#xD;
             nivolumab combination therapy are excluded. Patients who received prior therapy with a&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitor and were taken off drug for serious adverse events are excluded.&#xD;
             Prior treatment with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor, or prior CAR T-cell therapy is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the concomitant use of&#xD;
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,&#xD;
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.&#xD;
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) is not permitted&#xD;
             from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study. Other medications that&#xD;
             are prohibited while on copanlisib treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Herbal medications/preparations (except for vitamins)&#xD;

               -  Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are eligible if on stable dose of&#xD;
             highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), no clinically significant drug-drug&#xD;
             interactions are anticipated with the current HAART regimen, and viral load is&#xD;
             undetectable. Patients on HAART regimens that include CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g.&#xD;
             ritonavir or cobicistat) are excluded. All patients must be screened for HIV up to 28&#xD;
             days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infection. All patients must be screened for&#xD;
             HBV and HCV up to 28 days prior to enrollment using the routine hepatitis virus lab&#xD;
             panel. Patients positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen measurement (HBsAg)&#xD;
             and/or hepatitis B virus core antibody measurement (HBcAb) will be eligible if they&#xD;
             are negative for HBV DNA; these patients should receive prophylactic antiviral&#xD;
             therapy. Patients positive for anti-HCV antibody will be eligible if they are negative&#xD;
             for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. All patients must be screened for CMV up to 28 days&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. Patients that are positive for CMV DNA by polymerase chain&#xD;
             reaction (PCR) are not eligible for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3&#xD;
             months, a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome&#xD;
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents are not eligible. Patients&#xD;
             with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule.&#xD;
             Patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections&#xD;
             will not be excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidism and stable on&#xD;
             hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women will be excluded from participation in this trial, as&#xD;
             there is no significant preclinical information regarding the effects of nivolumab,&#xD;
             copanlisib, and ipilimumab, on a fetus or newborn infant&#xD;
