  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether in healthy subjects listening to music&#xD;
      while running influences the ground pressure forces, the vertical loading and, overall, the&#xD;
      running biomechanics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The analysis of the effects that listening to music may exert during exercise has been the&#xD;
      topic of a number of scientific articles. Overall, these studies documented how music&#xD;
      influences performance and they generally observed positive effects. The majority of the&#xD;
      investigations were carried out in the aerobic/endurance domain where music was found to&#xD;
      enhance running performance and is also likely to accelerate heart rate recovery after&#xD;
      strenuous exercise, albeit not all the authors agree on this point. It has been also reported&#xD;
      that loud music not only enhances optimal exercising, but also interacts with music tempo to&#xD;
      yield significant additional performance benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite such interesting findings, the focus of these investigations was restricted to&#xD;
      characterize the physiological responses that individuals exhibit when listening to music&#xD;
      during physical activity, mainly running. Thus, the studies ended up with positive results,&#xD;
      that is, increased performance, or failed in showing any effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside the above reported positive effects of music some potentially negative effects should&#xD;
      be considered. First, regardless of whether running is included or not in the experimental&#xD;
      condition, exposure to high levels of noise/sound even for short periods of time can be&#xD;
      damaging for the auditory system, possibly resulting in hearing loss or impairment. This&#xD;
      topic has been scrutinized by a number of studies, with a specific attention to adolescent&#xD;
      populations who are exposed to high risk of hearing problems due to the massive usage of&#xD;
      listening devices. Although this is a crucial issue, such source of hazard can be adequately&#xD;
      controlled for by firmly sticking to the guidelines on the recommended exposure limits (REL),&#xD;
      which is recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).&#xD;
      The REL has been set at 85 decibels (dB) for a maximum of 8 hours. Increasing the volume by&#xD;
      rate of 3 dB increases the risk exponentially. For instance, a noise corresponding to an&#xD;
      intensity of 88 dB should not exceed an exposure of 4 hours, then 91 dB 2 hours, 94 dB 1&#xD;
      hour, 97 dB 30 minutes, 100 dB 15 minutes, 103 dB 7.5 minutes, 106 dB 3.7 minutes and so on,&#xD;
      up to 140 dB, which must not be provided at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surprisingly, to date and to our knowledge, the influence that listening to music with&#xD;
      portable devices and earphones may exert on the amount of vertical force upon impact loading&#xD;
      during running has not been investigated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike the considerable number of previous works which were focused on the physiological and&#xD;
      psychological responses to music during exercise, no references that attempted to address the&#xD;
      biomechanical consequences of music listening on impact loading and jogging/running mechanics&#xD;
      could be traced in the literature. Therefore, our main goal is to fill this gap in the&#xD;
      existing literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the universal widespread and popularity of running and that approximately 47&#xD;
      million Americans participated in running activities in the last decade, the findings&#xD;
      generated by this research would be highly relevant to the broad field of sports medicine and&#xD;
      exercise science.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The experimental conditions to be tested in each subject will be: 0, running with no music; 1, running and listening to audio track resembling normal outdoor noise (70 dB); 2, running with music at moderate volume (80 dB); 3, running with music at moderate to high volume (85 dB). The experimental conditions will be carried out in random order, with a wash-out period of 10 minutes, to ensure the return to the auditory and vestibular baseline.&#xD;
Depending on the random sequence generated, the subject will undergo the four conditions in the specified order. Each condition will be completed with the three steps lasting 2 mins each (A, running at 6 km/h; B, running at 8 km/h; C, running at 10 km/h) and carried out at 1-min time interval in between, before proceeding to the next one. A complete rest of 10 minutes will be allowed among the conditions to restore the physiological state of the auditory and vestibular systems and to recover from the submaximal running effort.</intervention_model_description>
