  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-rejection medicines, also known as immunosuppressive drugs, are prescribed to organ&#xD;
      transplant recipients to prevent rejection of the new organ. Long-term use of these medicines&#xD;
      places transplant recipients at higher risk of serious infections and certain types of&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it is safe to give mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to kidney transplant recipients, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the combination of the immunosuppressive (anti-rejection) study drugs plus the MSCs can&#xD;
           allow a kidney transplant recipient to slowly reduce and/or then completely stop all&#xD;
           anti-rejection drugs, without rejection of their kidney (renal) allograft, a process&#xD;
           called &quot;immunosuppression withdrawal&quot;.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:The most common problem following a kidney transplant is the development of acute&#xD;
      or chronic rejection. Rejection is the immunologic reaction in which the body refuses to&#xD;
      accept the transplanted organ. The body's immune system will make destructive antibodies that&#xD;
      will attempt to attack the transplanted organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prevent organ rejection, all patients receiving an allograft (a graft&#xD;
      transplanted between genetically non-identical individuals of the same species) must take&#xD;
      anti-rejection (immunosuppressive) therapy. These medications function by lowering the body's&#xD;
      natural immune system. Often these medications are associated with significant side effects&#xD;
      ranging from infections to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, open label, dose-escalation clinical trial in 6 adult recipients of&#xD;
      Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)- non-identical, living-donor renal allografts. All participants&#xD;
      will receive induction therapy with alemtuzumab followed by maintenance therapy with&#xD;
      sirolimus and belatacept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 3 dosing cohorts of 2 recipients each will receive 12 infusions of donor-derived&#xD;
      MSCs starting on Day 42 post-transplant and every 4 weeks starting on Day 56 post-transplant,&#xD;
      with a minimum of 7 days between the first and second MSC infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether immune reconstitution after lymphocyte&#xD;
      depletion in the setting of co-stimulatory blockade and systemic MSC-derived donor antigen&#xD;
      can promote operational tolerance in recipients of kidney allografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated for eligibility for sirolimus withdrawal any time between week&#xD;
      52 and week 104 post-transplant. Participants who successfully complete sirolimus withdrawal&#xD;
      will remain on belatacept monotherapy for at least 24 weeks before being assessed for&#xD;
      eligibility to discontinue belatacept. Participants who successfully complete&#xD;
      Immunosuppression Withdrawal (ISW) will then undergo 24 weeks of high frequency follow up&#xD;
      followed by 132 weeks of standard follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation may continue for up to seven (7) years after kidney transplant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the&#xD;
      Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
      for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed,&#xD;
      controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can&#xD;
      result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare&#xD;
      circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider.&#xD;
