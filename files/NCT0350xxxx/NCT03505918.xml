      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this thesis is to determine whether unsupervised home exercises are not&#xD;
      inferior to supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc&#xD;
      herniation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is a difference in improvement in outcomes, as measured by the change in Oswestry&#xD;
      Disability Index at six months post-operative compared to baseline, between patients&#xD;
      undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc&#xD;
      herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is no difference in improvement in outcomes, as measured by the change in Oswestry&#xD;
      Disability Index at six months post-operative compared to baseline, between patients&#xD;
      undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc&#xD;
      herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this study are to determine if there is a difference in cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      in patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for&#xD;
      lumbar disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises. Differences in effectiveness&#xD;
      will be determined using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) calculated from the EQ-5D and&#xD;
      the SF-6D. Both these health state utility values will be used, as studies in low back&#xD;
      patients have shown a marked difference in the calculation of QALYs when one or the other is&#xD;
      used (9-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is a difference in gain in health state utility, as measured by the EuroQOL-5D at&#xD;
      12 months post-operative compared to baseline, between patients undergoing supervised&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation compared to&#xD;
      unsupervised home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is no difference in gain in health state utility, as measured by the EuroQOL-5D at&#xD;
      12 months post-operative compared to baseline, between patients undergoing supervised&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation compared to&#xD;
      unsupervised home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is a difference in gain in health state utility, as measured by the SF-6D&#xD;
      (transformed from the SF-36) (12) at 12 months post-operative compared to baseline, between&#xD;
      patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar&#xD;
      disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is no difference in gain in health state utility, as measured by the SF-6D&#xD;
      (transformed from the SF-36)(12) at 12 months post-operative compared to baseline, between&#xD;
      patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar&#xD;
      disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to calculate costs, both direct (cost of rehabilitation) and indirect costs (lost&#xD;
      wages) need to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is a difference in number of days between surgery and return to work, between&#xD;
      patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar&#xD;
      disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is no difference in number of days between surgery and return to work, between&#xD;
      patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar&#xD;
      disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized clinical trial, 1:1 parallel group, non-inferiority, single blinded trial&#xD;
      comparing (Arm1) supervised physical rehabilitation (SPT) in patients after surgery for&#xD;
      lumbar disc herniation to (Arm 2) unsupervised home exercises (UHE). Performed in accordance&#xD;
      with the CONSORT guidelines (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer generated randomization random variable block of 4-6 at 1:1 allocation will be&#xD;
      created by a researcher that will not be involved in recruitment, screening or identification&#xD;
      of potential subjects (LYC). The assigned treatment arm will be kept in sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, which will be opened after the informed consent process&#xD;
      is complete. The randomization envelope and sheet will be kept with the subject's research&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification factors, such as age, gender, race and approach (microdiscectomy versus open)&#xD;
      are not included for balancing the randomization but will be included in the analyses. Since&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure is a difference within same subject (subject is their own&#xD;
      control), some variability due to these factors will be reduced. In additional, due to block&#xD;
      randomization and assuming random patient arrival (such as not all patients scheduled for&#xD;
      microdiscectomy will be coming to clinic in the beginning of the study and then followed by&#xD;
      patients scheduled for open discectomy), there will be enough representation based on these&#xD;
      factors. In addition, at the Center for Spine Surgery microdiscectomy can denote the use of a&#xD;
      microscope during an open discectomy or the use of tubular, limited dissection without a&#xD;
      microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be recruited from patients assessed and scheduled for primary discectomy&#xD;
      for a lumbar disc herniation from L1 to S1 at the Center for Spine Surgery and Research,&#xD;
      Sygehus Lilleb√¶lt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient course:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial consultation at Sector for Spine Surgery and Research, Middelfart, study&#xD;
      subjects will undergo a neurological exam including range of motion, sensibility, reflexes&#xD;
      and strength in the lower extremities and back. Patients are also asked to complete multiple&#xD;
      questionnaires (basic personal information, occupational status, DaneSpine questionnaire,&#xD;
      ODI, SF-36, and EQ-5D) as mentioned in section 5.1 Data collection. These procedures are all&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients identified by the attending surgeon as eligible for inclusion are invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study by the Principal Investigator (RTP). Patients who express an&#xD;
      interest in participating will be given written and oral information on the background,&#xD;
      purpose and method of the study. Information and inclusion of participants will be conducted&#xD;
      in accordance with the guidelines of The Health Research Ethics Committee System in Denmark,&#xD;
      from which approval will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery when a subject has been screened and included in the study, and the informed&#xD;
      consent process is completed and the informed consent document is signed, the randomization&#xD;
      envelope will be opened. The subject will be randomize to either the supervised physical&#xD;
      therapy or the unsupervised home exercise arm using a variable blocks of 4-6 with 1:1&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supervised physical therapy group will be rehabilitated 4 weeks postoperative at the&#xD;
      municipality rehabilitation unit with training sessions 2 times a week in 8 weeks. The home&#xD;
      exercise group will be discharged with an informational booklet and advice to begin normal&#xD;
      daily activities as soon as possible. All patients will be asked to keep a diary of contact&#xD;
      to external health care professionals, amount of trainings and painkillers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participating in the study will undergo standard operative treatment, either&#xD;
      open or microscopically, at Center for Spine Surgery and Research, Middelfart, and scheduled&#xD;
      for an outpatient clinical visits at 1 and 3 months post-operative. Control at 1 month is&#xD;
      conducted by a physiotherapist and as part of standard care. All patients must keep a diary&#xD;
      of trainings, external medical- and physiotherapist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be an intent-to-treat analysis with the change in ODI scores&#xD;
      between six months and baseline as the primary outcome measures. Repeated measures ANOVA with&#xD;
      the baseline ODI score as a covariate will be used to compare the two arms. In addition&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test will be used to determine differences in categorical variables will&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in two groups, supervised physical therapy (SPT) and unsupervised&#xD;
      home exercises (UHE). The main outcome variable is the Oswestry Disability Index, which is a&#xD;
      disease specific outcome measure, and will be used for sample size justification. Based on&#xD;
      the published literature, the baseline ODI for patients with disc herniation is 48 points&#xD;
      with a standard deviation of 19 units (15)This is similar to the data from N2QOD. Change in&#xD;
      ODI score from the baseline to one year was 24 points (95% CI: 21-27) with estimated standard&#xD;
      deviation of 16 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using two-sided, two-sample independent t-test, we can detect a mean difference of 0.50 SD&#xD;
      units at alpha=5% and power=80 with n1=64 and n2=64. This translates into the effect size of&#xD;
      10 points. Since final follow-up is at one year an interim analysis is not planned. We plan&#xD;
      to randomize subjects in 1:1 ratio in supervised physical therapy and unsupervised home&#xD;
      exercise arms in randomized block sizes of 4 and 6. Stratification factors, such as age,&#xD;
      gender and race are not included for balancing the randomization but will be included in the&#xD;
      analyses. As the primary outcome measure is a difference within same subject (subject is&#xD;
      their own control), some variability due to these factors may be reduced. In addition, due to&#xD;
      block randomization and assuming random patient arrival, there will be enough demographic&#xD;
      representation based on these factors. We will increase sample size by 15% to account for&#xD;
      drop out or death before the completion of the study. Thus we need to enroll 74 subjects in&#xD;
      each arm. Using the method of Diggle et al. for sample size calculation in longitudinal&#xD;
      studies and assuming a positive correlation around 0.4, we will have at least 85% to detect&#xD;
      the same effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control and quality assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be registered at the Ethical Committee of Southern Denmark and the Danish Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient data, including information on private matters or other confidential information,&#xD;
      will be strictly confidential and stored according to the Danish Open Administration Act, the&#xD;
      Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data and the Health Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in accordance with the guidelines recommended by STROBE&#xD;
      (STrenghtening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology).&#xD;
