      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnenolone administration will be associated with greater reduction in depressive symptom&#xD;
      severity than placebo in women with current mMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater reduction in depressive&#xD;
      symptom severity than placebo in women with mMDD, as measured by MADRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater reduction in anxiety symptom&#xD;
           severity than placebo in women with mMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater improvement in cognition than&#xD;
           placebo in women with mMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater improvement in quality of life than&#xD;
           placebo in women with mMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine if pregnenolone is associated with greater improvement in vasomotor symptoms&#xD;
           of menopause than placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistic Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether changes in neurosteroid levels with pregnenolone mediate clinical&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if baseline neurosteroid levels predict pregnenolone response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine whether depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep or vasomotor symptoms improve&#xD;
           first. A crossed-lagged panel model will explore serial correlations between changes in&#xD;
           outcome measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite the introduction of new antidepressants, major depressive disorder (MDD) remains&#xD;
      challenging to treat. Antidepressant effectiveness trials conducted suggest depression&#xD;
      remission rates of only 15%-35%. Therefore, new antidepressants with mechanisms that move&#xD;
      beyond norepinephrine and serotonin targets are greatly needed. Importantly, comorbid&#xD;
      symptoms including anxiety, cognitive complaints and somatic symptoms often co-occur with&#xD;
      depression and further impact functioning and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifetime prevalence of MDD in women at &gt; 20%, is approximately twice of that of men, with&#xD;
      increased risk during the menopausal transition (perimenopause and early postmenopause). Hot&#xD;
      flashes and other menopausal symptoms, such as cognitive symptoms and sleep dysregulation,&#xD;
      affect up to 80% of women after perimenopause onset. Two large NIH-funded prospective&#xD;
      epidemiological studies demonstrated an increased risk of onset of MDD during perimenopause&#xD;
      (mMDD), with hormonal variability serving as a biomarker of risk of MDD. Short-term studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated an augmentation benefit of estrogen and serotonin reuptake inhibitors can&#xD;
      be used to target both mMDD and hot flashes. However, limited data from controlled trials&#xD;
      suggest modest benefit for mMDD with standard antidepressants. Furthermore, due to safety&#xD;
      concerns, many women prefer options other than estrogen replacement. Therefore, new and more&#xD;
      effective treatments are needed for mMDD. Despite the fact that midlife women are the most&#xD;
      frequent consumers of complementary and alternative therapies, trials of these approaches for&#xD;
      mMDD are lacking. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring neurosteroid made from cholesterol in&#xD;
      the adrenal glands and brain, sold as an over-the-counter supplement, and the use of which at&#xD;
      this time is common, unregulated and unstudied in women around the menopausal transition.&#xD;
      Pregnenolone is a precursor of hormones known to fluctuate during the menopausal transition,&#xD;
      and may decrease this hormonal variability known to increase the risk of MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical research suggests that pregnenolone has antidepressant and neuroprotective&#xD;
      effects, and improves cognition. Lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of pregnenolone are&#xD;
      reported in people with bipolar disorder (BPD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) than&#xD;
      controls. The investigators conducted two pilot studies of pregnenolone in depressed&#xD;
      patients. The first study included patients with bipolar as well as unipolar depression (i.e.&#xD;
      MDD). Pregnenolone (100 mg/d) was superior to placebo in improving depressive symptom&#xD;
      severity. The second study found that 500 mg/d of pregnenolone was superior to placebo for&#xD;
      bipolar depression. Baseline anxiety, fatigue, anhedonia and physical symptoms predicted a&#xD;
      favorable depressive symptom response to pregnenolone compared to placebo. Improvement in&#xD;
      cognition (e.g. declarative and working memory) was also observed in women given&#xD;
      pregnenolone. Additionally, in women, changes in depressive symptoms showed strong inverse&#xD;
      correlations with changes in pregnenolone (r=-0.83), and other neurosteroid levels.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in both studies women responded better to pregnenolone relative to placebo for&#xD;
      depression than men. Therefore, pregnenolone appears to have sex-specific antidepressant&#xD;
      effects, or at least demonstrates a substantial sex difference in response. Women over age 40&#xD;
      showed a more robust response than younger women. Pregnenolone was very well tolerated in&#xD;
      both studies. Based on these data, a larger, longer and more definitive trial of pregnenolone&#xD;
      is now proposed. Unlike the prior pilot studies, this trial will be larger and focus on&#xD;
      unipolar rather than bipolar depression, and will be limited to women with mMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the widespread availability of pregnenolone, as well as promising preclinical and&#xD;
      clinical data, and the extensive use of integrative treatments among midlife women, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to examine its efficacy as an antidepressant in mMDD. Pregnenolone has&#xD;
      the potential to provide women with an efficacious and appealing treatment option. To achieve&#xD;
      this objective, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pregnenolone is proposed in 144&#xD;
      women with mMDD. A novel clinical trial design that enhances power to detect between-group&#xD;
      differences and that allows for a longer observation period (16 weeks) will be used.&#xD;
      Depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, cognition and vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot&#xD;
      flashes) will be assessed. Blood levels of pregnenolone, and other neurosteroids (e.g.&#xD;
      allopregnanolone, progesterone) will be obtained, and safety and tolerability data collected.&#xD;
      A multiple PI team with extensive experience in mood disorders clinical trials, women's&#xD;
      mental health and neurosteroids will conduct the study.&#xD;
