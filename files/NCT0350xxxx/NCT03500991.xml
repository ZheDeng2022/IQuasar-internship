  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of central nervous system (CNS) locoregional adoptive therapy with&#xD;
      autologous CD4 and CD8 T cells lentivirally transduced to express a HER2-specific chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (CAR) and EGFRt, delivered by an indwelling catheter in the tumor resection&#xD;
      cavity or ventricular system in children and young adults with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      HER2-positive CNS tumors. A child or young adult with a refractory or recurrent CNS tumor&#xD;
      will have their tumor tested for HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) at their home&#xD;
      institution or at Seattle Children's Hospital. If the tumor is HER2 positive and the patient&#xD;
      meets all other eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into the tumor&#xD;
      resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meets none of the exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      then they can be apheresed, meaning T cells will be collected. The T cells will then be&#xD;
      bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that targets HER2-expressing tumor cells.&#xD;
      The patient's newly engineered T cells will then be administered via the indwelling CNS&#xD;
      catheter for two courses. In the first course they will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells&#xD;
      for three weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of&#xD;
      weekly doses for three weeks. Following the two courses, patient's will undergo a series of&#xD;
      studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity&#xD;
      to continue receiving up to a total of six courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had&#xD;
      adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of HER2-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to&#xD;
      complete two courses of treatment with three doses given on a weekly schedule followed by one&#xD;
      week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that HER-specific CAR T cells safely can be&#xD;
      administered through an indwelling CNS catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact&#xD;
      with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled on the study safely can be delivered directly&#xD;
      into the brain via indwelling catheter. Secondary aims of the study will include to evaluate&#xD;
      CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells&#xD;
      egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples&#xD;
      from multiple time points are available, also evaluate the degree of HER2 expression at&#xD;
      diagnosis versus at recurrence.&#xD;
