    <textblock>
      Overaction of the inferior oblique (IO) muscle is a commonly observed component of childhood&#xD;
      strabismus, and is often seen combined with other ocular deviations. It manifests with&#xD;
      excessive elevation of the affected eye in adduction, and may cause a pattern strabismus and&#xD;
      vertical deviation of the affected eye. IO overaction (IOOA) may be primary or secondary to&#xD;
      superior oblique underaction, is often bilateral, and may be symmetrical or asymmetrical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical management of the overacting IO muscle is often required to achieve ocular&#xD;
      alignment. The most commonly performed IO muscle weakening procedures are IO myectomy and&#xD;
      graded IO recession. The surgical decision is primarily based on degree of overaction of the&#xD;
      IO muscle. Various studies have compared the two IO weakening procedures and have reported a&#xD;
      similar success rate for both procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of two IO weakening procedures (symmetrical vs&#xD;
      asymmetrical myectomy or graded recession) in normalizing the IOOA, obtaining vertical&#xD;
      alignment and collapse of pattern, when employed in the treatment of asymmetrical IOOA.&#xD;

      1. Background (Introduction):&#xD;
&#xD;
           An excessive elevation of the eyeball on adduction, both on horizontal movement and in&#xD;
           upgaze, is often due to inferior oblique over action (IOOA). It is a common disorder of&#xD;
           ocular motility, and is usually bilateral and asymmetrical. The asymmetry may be due to&#xD;
           difference in time of onset or difference in degree of severity of the IO overaction in&#xD;
           the two eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IOOA may be primary and of unknown etiology, or secondary to a congenital superior&#xD;
           oblique palsy. Primary IOOA is commonly associated with congenital esotropia, with the&#xD;
           oblique overaction usually presenting after one year of age. In addition to congenital&#xD;
           esotropia, primary IO overaction may be associated with exotropia or may occur as an&#xD;
           isolated IO overaction without other strabismus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IOOA can be isolated or combined with other types of deviations. Primary IOOA has been&#xD;
           reported to develop between one to six years of age in up to two-thirds of patients with&#xD;
           infantile esotropia, and is usually bilateral. The cause is unknown. IOOA may be seen in&#xD;
           70% of patients with esotropia and in 30% of patients with exotropia. Secondary IOOA is&#xD;
           often unilateral and is caused by paresis or paralysis of the superior oblique muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Depending on severity, IOOA is graded as: (+1) to (+4) overaction. A (+1) overaction&#xD;
           indicates slight over elevation in adduction, and (+4) overaction indicates severe over&#xD;
           elevation in adduction. It has been suggested that (+1), (+2), (+3) and (+4) overactions&#xD;
           roughly translate to 5, 10, 15 and 20 prism diopter (PD) of hypertropia on side gaze.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinically, in addition to the excessive elevation of the eye ball on adduction, IOOA&#xD;
           may be associated with &quot;V&quot; pattern of strabismus and vertical deviation in primary&#xD;
           position. A &quot;V&quot; pattern is relative divergence on the up gaze and convergence on down&#xD;
           gaze. When the eyes converge more than 15 PD from upgaze to downgaze, the &quot;V&quot; pattern is&#xD;
           said to be significant. With the eyes in the lateral gaze to the opposite side,&#xD;
           alternate cover testing shows that the higher eye refixates with a downward movement and&#xD;
           that the lower eye does so with an upward movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although patients with IOOA present with an excessively elevated eye in adduction, there&#xD;
           is little vertical deviation in the primary position, when the condition is bilateral&#xD;
           and symmetrical. In contrast, unilateral IOOA or bilateral and asymmetrical IOOA is&#xD;
           associated with a significant vertical deviation in the primary position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients with strabismus undergo full ocular and orthoptic examinations. The angle&#xD;
           of strabismus is measured by prisms and alternate cover test for distant and near in&#xD;
           primary position of gaze. In distance fixation, the strabismus angle is also measured in&#xD;
           secondary positions of gaze to detect presence of pattern deviation or incomitance.&#xD;
           Surgery to weaken the IO muscle is indicated when the muscle is overacting and is&#xD;
           associated with a significant &quot;V&quot; pattern or vertical deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are various surgical techniques for weakening an overacting IO muscle. Most&#xD;
           commonly used techniques these days are IO myectomy, graded recession and&#xD;
           anteriorization. Normalization of the IOOA, vertical ocular alignment within + 5 PD of&#xD;
           orthotropia and collapse of pattern are considered ideal outcomes for the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are many studies comparing IO myectomy and IO recession and all have concluded&#xD;
           that they have a similar success rate. However, no study has been conducted to evaluate&#xD;
           the effectivity of symmetrical weakening procedures (bilateral myectomy or bilateral&#xD;
           equal graded recession) vs asymmetrical procedures (myectomy - recession / bilateral&#xD;
           recession of different amounts) in achieving ocular alignment in patients with&#xD;
           asymmetrical IOOA. The effect of presence of superior oblique underaction preoperative&#xD;
           vertical deviation on the outcome of the surgery has also not been studied to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare the effect of symmetrical vs asymmetrical Inferior oblique (IO) weakening&#xD;
           procedures when employed in the treatment of asymmetrical Inferior oblique over action&#xD;
           (IOOA) in :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Normalizing IO action&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Correcting vertical deviation and &quot;V&quot; pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A randomized, interventional clinical trial. All Patients with asymmetrical IOOA,&#xD;
           requiring surgical correction (IO weakening procedure) from July 2017 to June 2020 will&#xD;
           be prospectively recruited. Prior to surgery all patients will undergo full&#xD;
           comprehensive ocular examination, standard orthoptic evaluation and cycloplegic&#xD;
           refraction. Minimum of two investigators will assess the preoperative angles of&#xD;
           strabismus in a standard manner for each patient. Standard 9-gaze photos will be taken&#xD;
           for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standardized surgical procedure will be followed in all patients according to the grade&#xD;
           of IOOA, extent of the &quot;V&quot; pattern and the degree of vertical deviation in primary&#xD;
           position. Only patients with a minimal period of 3 months of follow up will be selected&#xD;
           for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be randomly allocated to symmetrical or asymmetrical surgery using&#xD;
           permuted block randomization of sizes 2, 4 or 6 (SAS 9.1.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           If symmetrical surgery is planned, then surgical plan for more severe IOOA will be&#xD;
           considered for both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is designed to show that symmetrical surgery is non inferior to asymmetrical&#xD;
           surgery. Sample size was estimated considering a study power of 0.8 with an alpha error&#xD;
           of 0.05, aiming to detect a difference of 5 PD in the angle of strabismus between the&#xD;
           two groups and a postoperative standard deviation (SD) of 5.3. Based on this estimation,&#xD;
           a total of 14 patients was found to be adequate in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline quantitative variables will be expressed using mean with SD across the two&#xD;
      groups if the distribution of the variables are symmetric. If not, then median with&#xD;
      interquartile range will be presented across the groups. The baseline categorical variables&#xD;
      will be presented using frequencies and percentages across the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: The difference in pre- and post-operative measurements (mean and SD) will&#xD;
      be calculated for both the groups. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in&#xD;
      change will then be calculated. If there are any clinical differences in the baseline&#xD;
      parameters, then analysis of co-variance will be used to compare the change across the groups&#xD;
      adjusted for the baseline values. If the lower limit of the CI is within 5 units, then&#xD;
      symmetrical surgery will be concluded non-inferior to asymmetrical surgery. Intention to&#xD;
      Treat and per-protocol analysis will be done for the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcomes will be compared across the groups using&#xD;
      independent t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test depending on the distribution of the continuous&#xD;
      variables. Fisher's exact test will be used to compare categorical variables across the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
