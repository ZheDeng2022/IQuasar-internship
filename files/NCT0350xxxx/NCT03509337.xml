    <textblock>
      A single-center, observational, prospective, single cohort study with before-after design.&#xD;
      Evaluation by shear-wave elastography, measured in kilopascals (KPa), of the muscle, tendon&#xD;
      and cubital nerve, before and after the maneuver of putting in tension of the ulnar nerve.&#xD;

      Once each subject has signed the informed consent document and it has been verified that the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria are met, it will be assigned the same identification number (ID) that is&#xD;
      related to its Clinical History (CH) by simple coding; custody of the file with the&#xD;
      relationship of each ID with its CH will be the responsibility of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body placement: The participants will be placed in the supine position with the hips and&#xD;
      knees bent, in such a way that the soles of the feet rest on the plane of the stretcher. the&#xD;
      palm of the hand of the left extremity will rest on the abdomen and the head in a neutral&#xD;
      position, with the maximum relaxation of the sternocleidomastoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper limb placement: The right extremity will be placed in abduction of 90°, the elbow to&#xD;
      flexion of 10° and the forearm to 30° of supination. Wrist and joints metacarpophalangic&#xD;
      (mcf), proximal interphalangeal (ifp) and distal interphalangeal (ifp) of the first three&#xD;
      fingers in full extension. The articulations mcf, ifp, ifd of the fourth and fifth fingers in&#xD;
      a relaxed position. In this position, the first ultrasound measurement will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tension maneuver of the ulnar nerve: An expert researcher in mobilization of neural tissue&#xD;
      will perform an extension of fourth and fifth finger, respecting the initial parameters that&#xD;
      are maintained in position by the splint. To do this, he will use the index and middle of his&#xD;
      left hand and make a contact on the palmar side of the fingers and a back pressure with the&#xD;
      thumb on the back of the hand. Next, it will extend the fingers until the exponential&#xD;
      resistance following the path of elastic deformation (linear resistance) of the tensioned&#xD;
      tissues is perceived. At this time the new ultrasound record will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound records: A Toshiba ai800 ultrasound scanner (Toshiba Medical Corporation, Japan)&#xD;
      with a multifrequency linear probe plt-1005bt 14l5 (5-14 Mhz) will be used. The&#xD;
      identification number (ID) registered in the ultrasound will correspond to the participant&#xD;
      number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same researcher, with experience in the acquisition and management of medical images,&#xD;
      will perform the ultrasound and in-line measurements of the images obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound will be obtained in a pre and post-median situation after the neural tension&#xD;
      put on by the expert investigator in manual therapy and a label will be consigned in the&#xD;
      images indicating if the acquisition was &quot;pre&quot; or &quot;post&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform the acquisition of the images the probe wil be positioned on the skin of the&#xD;
      forearm with minimal pressure and with angulation such that there is no anisotropy. The&#xD;
      anatomical region where the myotendinous junction of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and the&#xD;
      ulnar nerve is observed will be searched transversally. the parameters of emission power,&#xD;
      general gain, depth of the image, position of the focus and frequency of emission will be&#xD;
      adapted to obtain a quality image. The protocol will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2d image in transverse plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2d image in longitudinal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shear-wave elastography in longitudinal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of the images: They will be carried out off-line using the elastography&#xD;
           software of the team itself once all the participants have been explored. three regions&#xD;
           of interest (ROIs) adjacent to each other will be established in the body of the ulnar&#xD;
           nerve, three in the distal area of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and three in the&#xD;
           tendinous body of the same muscle. The size of the ROI should include the entire body of&#xD;
           the mentioned structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The average value of the three ROIs will be written down in units of pressure (KPa).&#xD;
