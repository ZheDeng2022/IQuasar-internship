  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by&#xD;
      elevated plasma levels of LDL-C cholesterol. This early and significant elevation of LDL-C&#xD;
      triggers premature atherosclerosis, particularly coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiation and management of LDL-C therapies is based on cardiovascular risk assessment.&#xD;
      Although this is undoubtedly higher than in normocholesterolemic patients, a significant&#xD;
      heterogeneity in heFH patients still persists that is not completely explained. Moreover, the&#xD;
      evaluation of cardiovascular risk in patients with heFH is difficult for many reasons:&#xD;
      non-validity of risk scores, futility of a risk calculation limited to 10 years in a young&#xD;
      patient, late positivity of stress tests .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a clear need for new cardiovascular risk assessment tools to identify&#xD;
      higher risk heFH patients who could benefit from early and aggressive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score has been widely studied in the US and validated in&#xD;
      European recommendations, and has shown the best reclassification index for patients at&#xD;
      intermediate cardiovascular risk. A CAC score of zero is associated with a very low risk of&#xD;
      event irrespective of the number of risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-calcified plaques are by definition not detected by ACC and patients with CAC = 0 may&#xD;
      only have soft non-calcified plaques. The prevalence of these non-calcified plaques in very&#xD;
      high-risk patients with acute coronary syndrome is 5%. The prevalence in FH patients is&#xD;
      unknown. It has also been shown that the extent of the atherosclerotic burden is related to&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAC score has been poorly evaluated in heFH patients. However, hypercholesterolemia and&#xD;
      calcifications have been shown to be correlated: supra-aortic calcified masses in homozygous&#xD;
      FH patients, early calcifications associated with chronic exposure to high LDL-C (cholesterol&#xD;
      burden, equivalent to cigarettes) and finally, the calcifying role of statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early increase of LDL-C in patients with genetic forms of FH causes premature&#xD;
      cardiovascular damage. Investigators' hypothesis is that patients with FH have earlier&#xD;
      coronary atheroma (and thus calcifications and non-calcified plaques) due to exposure early&#xD;
      in life to high levels of LDL-cholesterol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CAC score has demonstrated very powerful predictive power, particularly in asymptomatic&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The CAC score can:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1- Identify subjects with high cardiovascular risk According to prospective studies,&#xD;
           it is estimated that a CAC score&gt; 400 is a CHD equivalent, with 10-year event rates&#xD;
           exceeding 20% in asymptomatic patients. Prospective studies in young patients with a&#xD;
           family history of cardiovascular disease or dyslipidaemia showed a higher risk of&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease in those with a CAC score of 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2- Identify subjects with low cardiovascular risk Regardless of the presence of risk&#xD;
           factors, meta-analyses have repeatedly shown the high negative predictive power&#xD;
           associated with a CAC = 0. The absence of calcified plaque presents an extraordinarily&#xD;
           low risk at 10 years (1.1% at 1.7%) regardless of the number of risk factors Regardless&#xD;
           of the presence of risk factors, meta-analyses have repeatedly shown the high negative&#xD;
           predictive power associated with a CAC = 0 with an annual mortality rate of 0.87&#xD;
           compared to 1.92 in those with CAC between 1 and 10. Finally, recent studies have&#xD;
           questioned the indication of a statin in non-HeFH patients with CAC = 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Non-calcified plaques are not, by definition, detected by CAC tests and patients with&#xD;
           CAC = 0 may only exhibit soft, non-calcified plaques. The prevalence of these&#xD;
           non-calcified plaques in high-risk patients with acute coronary syndrome is 5% . The&#xD;
           prevalence in heHF patients is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of the population to be studied and justification of their choice.&#xD;
           Recruitment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia will be carried out at the&#xD;
           Cardiovascular Prevention Unit of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital and in the Cardiology&#xD;
           Department of Saint-Antoine Hospital. Patients will be included in the study when they&#xD;
           come for their usual consultation or as part of their cardiovascular assessment in day&#xD;
           hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Brief description of the product (s) or experimental act (s)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The actions and blood tests added by the research are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Imaging: Coronary CT angiography with injection of iodinated contrast medium Biology:&#xD;
           Calculation of cholesterol burden Vitamin D and K, estradiol, Parathormone IL-1β, IL-6,&#xD;
           IL-11, IL-17 TGFβ1 TNFα,Genomic and proteomic analyses: Osteopontin (OPN), Osteocalcin,&#xD;
           Osteoprotegerin, Osteonectin Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, Bone&#xD;
           morphogenetic protein 2 4 and 7, Human Bone metabolism simplicat Matrix Gla Protein MGP&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Summary of foreseeable benefits and risks known to those who are suitable for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risks and physical constraints: patients will undergo a standard blood sampling for&#xD;
           lipid levels and other biochemistry dosages and the realization of an arterial carotid&#xD;
           and femoral ultrasound, as well as the coronary CT (with injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risks associated with the disease: there are no directly study-related risks of&#xD;
           worsening of any previous condition in relation to the current pathology in the&#xD;
           realization of this study. The increased cardiovascular risk associated with heFH is&#xD;
           represented mostly by coronary artery disease which is related to the increased lifelong&#xD;
           high cholesterol exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk of irradiation: study subjects wil lbe exposed to 2 - 5 mSv for the realization of&#xD;
           both CAC score and coronary CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk linked to the venous draining of 36 mL of blood all in all: pain, bruise, vagal&#xD;
           faintness(malaise)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risks associated to the injection of iodized contrast agent: allergic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will evaluate the prevalence of high CAC score in asymptomatic patients with&#xD;
      heHF. This will be a first step in improving knowledge and treatment of heHF since using the&#xD;
      CAC score, the investigators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would identify the patients with increased risk to whom premature / aggressive&#xD;
           interventions are recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would validate a new non-invasive marker of the coronary damage in this heterogeneous&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project enters the wider frame of the premature ageing of the cardiovascular system with&#xD;
      consequences on the development of cardiovascular complications such as the vascular&#xD;
      calcifications. It was designed to highlight subclinical changes of the vascular tree to&#xD;
      improve the treatment of the heHF and prevent the long-term complications of this disease.&#xD;
      This project could help to identify new markers of myocardial and arterial dysfunction to&#xD;
      propose an adapted prevention. The evaluation of the efficiency of medicine can be envisaged&#xD;
      at the end of this study and will be encouraged by the strictly non invasive nature of the&#xD;
      procedure as well as by its excellent reproducibility. It will also help to define strategies&#xD;
      of prevention to improve the management of heHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be broadcasted by means of scientific publications and of presentations in&#xD;
      conferences or congress.&#xD;
