    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the extent to which the SMART NICU2HOME&#xD;
      (including EMR interface) and the NICU2HOME apps, mobile applications designed for parents of&#xD;
      premature infants to receive daily, real-time information about their infants and&#xD;
      personalized education material based on parents' anticipated concerns and their infant's&#xD;
      clinical status, is effective in: 1) improving parents' competency in caring for their sick&#xD;
      infants, 2) reducing stress, 3) supporting parents' social supports and 3) improving NICU&#xD;
      outcomes (parent satisfaction, length of stay, readmission rates.)&#xD;
    </textblock>

      There will be four groups of participants based on when the infant is in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of infants born from April -Mid-August 2018 (Group 1) Group 1 participants will&#xD;
      receive usual care which includes 1) a welcome packet from the nursing staff, 2) access to&#xD;
      their infant's medical team including doctors and nurse, 3) opportunities to ask any&#xD;
      questions and understand the care their baby is receiving through participation in daily work&#xD;
      rounds or through setting up family meetings with the medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At NICU admission, parents in Group 1 will be asked to complete a brief demographics form and&#xD;
      several standardized surveys that measure stress and life experiences. Surveys will again be&#xD;
      administered 7-10 days later, the day before discharge, two weeks after discharge and 30 days&#xD;
      after discharge. These surveys will be available both via on paper or an email link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of infants born from Mid-August - January 2019 (Group 2) At NICU admission, parents&#xD;
      in Group 2 will be asked to complete a brief demographics form and several standardized&#xD;
      surveys that measure stress and life experiences. Surveys will again be administered 7-10&#xD;
      days later, the day before discharge, two weeks after discharge and 30 days after discharge.&#xD;
      These surveys will be available both via on paper or an email link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the usual care made available to Group 1 and described above, Group 2 parents&#xD;
      will also be asked to download the NICU2HOME app from a given website where they will enter&#xD;
      MRN, DOB, name, gender, and due date of their infant into the smartphone app. In case there&#xD;
      are difficulties downloading or using the app, the research team will be available to assist&#xD;
      parents with any questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent of infants born from February 2019- June 2019 (Group 3) At NICU admission, parents in&#xD;
      Group 3 will be asked to complete a brief demographics form and several standardized surveys&#xD;
      that measure stress and life experiences. Surveys will again be administered 7-10 days later,&#xD;
      the day before discharge, two weeks after discharge and 30 days after discharge. These&#xD;
      surveys will be available both via on paper or an email link. In addition to the usual care&#xD;
      made available to Group 1, Group 3 parents will also be asked to download the SMART NICU2HOME&#xD;
      app from a given website where they will enter MRN, DOB, name, gender, and due date of their&#xD;
      infant into the smartphone app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent of infants born from November 2019- December 2020 (Group 4) At NICU admission, parents&#xD;
      in Group 4 will be asked to complete a brief demographics form and several standardized&#xD;
      surveys that measure stress and life experiences as well as parental efficacy. Surveys will&#xD;
      again be administered 30 and 60 days later depending on the gestational age of the baby, the&#xD;
      day of discharge, two weeks after discharge and 30 days after discharge. These surveys will&#xD;
      be available through an email link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the usual care made available to Group 1 and described above, Group 4 parents&#xD;
      will also be asked to download the NICU2HOME app from a given website where they will enter&#xD;
      MRN, DOB, name, gender, and due date of their infant into the smartphone app. In case there&#xD;
      are difficulties downloading or using the app, the research team will be available to assist&#xD;
      parents with any questions or concerns. Participants in Group 4 will not be paid for their&#xD;
      contribution to the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant (in both groups) will be asked to complete the surveys independently without&#xD;
      sharing responses. If completed on paper, the research team will arrange either to pick the&#xD;
      survey up at the NICU if the baby is still in the hospital, via a pre-paid stamped envelope&#xD;
      provided, or over the phone. Online surveys will be automatically returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the intervention study, an optional qualitative interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with 30 families from group 2 and group 3 for about 30-45 minutes. Patients will have the&#xD;
      option to opt to participate in the interviews when consenting to the main study by signing&#xD;
      their initials on the &quot;Optional Elements&quot; to be interviewed. Consenting to be interviewed&#xD;
      also means that they have agreed to let us audio record the interview for research purposes.&#xD;
      Of those who opted to be interviewed, only 30 families will be randomly selected to partake&#xD;
      in the interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using maximum variation sampling method, the interview will occur around 1-2 days prior to&#xD;
      discharge (final thoughts, use patterns) with approximately 5 families per gestational age&#xD;
      bracket: &lt;28 weeks; 28-&lt;30 weeks; 30-&lt;32 weeks; 32-&lt;34 weeks; 34-&lt;37 weeks. The interviews&#xD;
      will be semi-structured, one-on-one phone on in-person interviews (option is the family's)&#xD;
      designed to elicit feature feedback reasons for their level of usage. With consent, all&#xD;
      interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes to improve&#xD;
      further iterations. These audio recordings (either in voice or transcription) may be used in&#xD;
      scholarly presentations or publications serve to help other professionals understand the&#xD;
      research. No identifiers will be present when sharing the recordings to maintain anonymity,&#xD;
      and recordings will be saved with a study ID number rather than name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NICU2HOME app was created for parents of premature infants to meet their demands. The app&#xD;
      will teach parents about their baby and the NICU. It will allow them to receive educational&#xD;
      material every day that is specifically geared towards their baby's journey in the NICU. The&#xD;
      app will also all parents to connect with their friends and family allowing them to privately&#xD;
      and safely share and post among themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMART NICU2HOME app includes the same features and functions as the NICU2HOME app stated&#xD;
      above; however, it also allows parents to receive a daily update of the clinically benign&#xD;
      information of their infant directly from the EPIC EMR, such as, days of life, adjusted&#xD;
      gestational age, weight, length, etc.&#xD;
