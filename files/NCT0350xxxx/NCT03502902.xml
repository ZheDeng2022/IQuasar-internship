      A Phase I, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Single Oral Dose, Safety, Tolerability, and&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Study, Incorporating an Evaluation of the Effect of Food on the&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of HEC68498 in Healthy Male and Female Subjects&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-dose, sequential-group design incorporating a food-effect evaluation. Each subject&#xD;
      will participate in 1 treatment period, except for Group 5, where each subject will&#xD;
      participate in 2 treatment periods. In each group, 6 subjects will receive HEC68498 and 2&#xD;
      subjects will receive placebo. Subjects in Group 5 will receive the same dose level of&#xD;
      HEC68498 (or placebo) in both treatment periods. All doses will be administered either after&#xD;
      an overnight fast of at least 8 hours or, for subjects in the food-effect evaluation,&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes after starting a standard high-fat breakfast. The first 2 subjects&#xD;
      in each group will be dosed (1 subject receiving HEC68498 and 1 subject receiving placebo) 48&#xD;
      hours prior to the remainder of the subjects. There will be a minimum of 7 days between dose&#xD;
      escalations. The washout period for subjects in Group 5 will be determined following review&#xD;
      of available PK data.&#xD;

    <description>HEC68498 is a potent,highly selective inhibitor of class 1 isozymes of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian(PI3K) and of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). It has shown good activity against fibrosis and inflammation in vitro and in vivo, with a lower effective dose and better efficacy than pirfenidone and nintedanib.</description>

&#xD;
          3. In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical&#xD;
             history,physical examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs measurements, and clinical&#xD;
             laboratory evaluations (congenital nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia [eg, Gilbert's&#xD;
             syndrome] is not acceptable) at Screening or Check-in as assessed by the Investigator&#xD;
