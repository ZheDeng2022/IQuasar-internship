    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works when given together with ixazomib&#xD;
      citrate and dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with&#xD;
      ixazomib citrate and dexamethasone may work better in treating patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (&gt;= partial response [PR]) of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with standard doses of ixazomib citrate (ixazomib) and dexamethasone, in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the &gt;= very good partial response (VGPR) and complete response (CR) rate of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab added to standard doses of ixazomib and dexamethasone in relapsed myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression free survival and overall survival among patients with&#xD;
      relapsed MM following treatment with the combination of pembrolizumab, ixazomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the toxicities associated with pembrolizumab added to standard doses of&#xD;
      ixazomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. PDL-1 expression on myeloma cells and non-tumor cell compartments from the bone marrow&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Measures of T-cell activation/exhaustion will be assessed at baseline and after cycle 1&#xD;
      and cycle 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Natural killer (NK) cell function and numbers will be evaluated at baseline and after&#xD;
      cycle 1 and cycle 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 57, 64, and 71&#xD;
      and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, 43, 64. Patients also&#xD;
      receive dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 57, 64, and 71. Cycles with&#xD;
      dexamethasone repeat every 84 days for up to 1 year and cycles with ixazomib citrate and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab repeat every 84 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until&#xD;
      progressive disease, and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
