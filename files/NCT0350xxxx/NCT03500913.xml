  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine adipose tissue inflammation and adipokine expression and serum&#xD;
      markers of inflammation and adipokine levels in patients with growth hormone (GH) deficiency&#xD;
      before and after treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GH axis has important influences on adipose tissue. Preliminary data from the&#xD;
      investigators' study in acromegaly, a state of GH excess, suggests that GH reduces adipose&#xD;
      tissue (AT) mass and serum inflammation. However, GH seems to reduce macrophage markers in&#xD;
      adipose tissue yet increase adipocyte inflammation. This novel dissociation of macrophage and&#xD;
      adipocyte inflammation is hypothesized to be due to GH. In order to examine this hypothesis&#xD;
      further this study will examine adipose tissue and serum inflammation in patients with GH&#xD;
      deficiency before and after GH therapy. The investigators will obtain subcutaneous adipose&#xD;
      tissue by biopsy in patients with active GH deficiency planning to undergo therapy for GH&#xD;
      deficiency. Concurrently serum samples will be taken for analysis of levels of inflammatory&#xD;
      markers and adipokines. After treatment for 12 months with a normal levels of Insulin-like&#xD;
      growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a marker of GH deficiency, patients will have a repeat adipose&#xD;
      tissue biopsy. Adipose tissue parameters will be analyzed in each specimen and then compared&#xD;
      to each patient over time as well as to body mass index (BMI)-matched control subjects.&#xD;
