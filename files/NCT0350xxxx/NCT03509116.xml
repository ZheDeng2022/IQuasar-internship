  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand the experience of the dietetic consultation from the&#xD;
      perspective of nutritionally vulnerable older patients receiving oral nutrition support and&#xD;
      dietitians, as well as other key stakeholders involved in the process of such a consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition is prevalent and increases the risk of health complications and socioeconomic&#xD;
      burden. Patients with malnutrition are often older patients with complex needs and therefore&#xD;
      may require specialist knowledge and skills to provide nutritional support. Dietitians are&#xD;
      uniquely skilled to assess the multiple factors that underpin diet and to tailor nutritional&#xD;
      support, which could help improve outcomes. Although the causes of malnutrition are&#xD;
      complicated, its treatment typically involves oral nutritional supplements, dietary advice or&#xD;
      food-based interventions, either separately or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of the various oral nutritional support interventions has been studied, with&#xD;
      the findings on food-based interventions suggesting more research is needed and the&#xD;
      widespread research on ONS suggesting contradictory results and interpretations. Despite&#xD;
      this, the factors responsible for these inconsistencies have not been identified. There are&#xD;
      no studies so far that have examined the patient experience of the consultation with the&#xD;
      dietitian in the context of nutritional support. Although the patient experience of&#xD;
      consultations is increasingly being recognised as an important part of investigating their&#xD;
      effectiveness in healthcare, to date, there are a number of limitations in this literature,&#xD;
      leaving the role of the patient experience in dietetic consultations for the management of&#xD;
      malnutrition, poorly understood. It's probable that this is one contributing factor to the&#xD;
      variation observed in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the literature indicates a need for exploration of the patient experience and its&#xD;
      possible impact on the success or failure of the dietetic encounter. This study aims to&#xD;
      address some of the knowledge gaps. The use of qualitative interviews will allow an in-depth&#xD;
      understanding of the experience of the dietetic consultation for the provision of nutrition&#xD;
      support and will utilise an overall illuminative evaluation approach to broaden that&#xD;
      understanding by considering data from various sources. Participants will include older&#xD;
      patients who are considered nutritionally vulnerable, their consulting dietitians and&#xD;
      patient-nominated key stakeholders. Four clinical settings within the Trust where dietitians&#xD;
      would often see patients for nutritional support will be included.&#xD;
