  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of multiple gestations has increased over the past years, mostly because of&#xD;
      increased use of assisted reproductive technologies. Triplet pregnancies are at increased&#xD;
      risk of preterm birth (PTB), which is the primary reason for their increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality compared to singletons. Multiple gestations, including triplets, account for about&#xD;
      3% of all pregnancies in the US but constitute at least 10% of cases of PTB, over 30% of very&#xD;
      low birth weight infants, and nearly 20% of infant mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A short cervical length (CL) on transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) has been shown to be a good&#xD;
      predictor of PTB, including in multiple gestations. In singletons with a prior PTB and a&#xD;
      short CL &lt;25mm before 24weeks, cerclage is associated with significant decreases in PTB and&#xD;
      perinatal morbidity and mortality in the meta-analysis of randomized trials (RCTs). On the&#xD;
      contrary, the effect of cerclage in multiple gesttations has been insufficiently studied,&#xD;
      with meta-analysis data showing a possible harm from cerclage compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this RCT is to evaluate the efficacy of cervical pessary in prevention of PTB in&#xD;
      unselected triplet gestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We planned to assess outcomes in subgroup analysis of women with short cervical length (TVU&#xD;
      CL &lt;30 mm)&#xD;

    <description>Cervical pessary is a medical device used to treat an incompetent (or insufficient) cervix (cervix starts to shorten and open too early). Early in the pregnancy a round silicone pessary is placed at the opening to the cervix to close it, and then remove late in the pregnancy when the risk of a preterm birth has passed.&#xD;
Cervical pessary has been tried as a simple, non-invasive alternative that might replace the above invasive cervical stitch operation to prevent preterm birth.</description>
