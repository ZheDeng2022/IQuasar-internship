    <textblock>
      In a wide range of auto-inflammatory and infectious diseases attenuation of the immune&#xD;
      response could be beneficial. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been identified as a&#xD;
      means of protecting patients undergoing cardiac surgery from perioperative myocardial&#xD;
      ischemic damage. This protection can be divided in a 'first window of protection' directly&#xD;
      after preconditioning and a 'second window' that protects patients 12-48 hour after&#xD;
      preconditioning. Repeated RIPC might have additional value, possibly by combining beneficial&#xD;
      effects of the first and second windows of protection. The mechanisms behind these effects&#xD;
      are under investigation, but attenuation of the inflammatory response is a major candidate.&#xD;
      However, this has not yet been demonstrated in the setting of systemic inflammation in humans&#xD;
      in vivo. This study aims to investigate the effects of (repeated) ischemic preconditioning on&#xD;
      inflammation during human endotoxemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the immune system is essential to survival, a variety of diseases originate from&#xD;
      inappropriate or excessive activation of the immune response. Examples include a wide range&#xD;
      of auto-inflammatory disease, infectious diseases such as sepsis, but also after major&#xD;
      surgery like cardiac artery bypass grafting, after radiation therapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      cancer, or following organ transplantation. In these instances, attenuation of the immune&#xD;
      response could be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) was first described in the 1980's. Murry and&#xD;
      colleagues showed a protective effect of preconditioning the heart with 4 cycles of 5-minute&#xD;
      long ischemia on the extent of myocardial infarction in dog hearts. Follow-up animal studies&#xD;
      showed the same protective effects on the heart by introducing the cycles of ischemia to&#xD;
      distant, or 'remote', organs like the kidney or the gut. Furthermore, this principle of&#xD;
      'remote ischemic preconditioning' (RIPC) was also shown to be effective in humans when using&#xD;
      a tourniquet to temporary cut off blood supply to one of the limbs, either an arm or a leg.&#xD;
      As such, RIPC has been identified as a cheap and easy method of protecting patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective CABG surgery from perioperative myocardial ischemic damage. In recent&#xD;
      studies, two different timeframes in which RIPC exerts its protective effects have been&#xD;
      identified. The classical or 'early window of protection' protects in the 1-2 hour after the&#xD;
      RIPC stimulus while a 'second window of protection' is evident 12-24 hours after RIPC and&#xD;
      lasts for 48-72 hours. Multiple-dose RIPC may be of additional value, as 7 daily doses of&#xD;
      RIPC in humans resulted in protection of endothelial dysfunction, with both the local and&#xD;
      remote beneficial effects lasting for up to 8 days after the last RIPC dose. This could be&#xD;
      due to additive or synergistic effects of combining the first and second windows of&#xD;
      protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms behind the observed protective effects are however still subject of&#xD;
      investigation. Several have been put forward, of which attenuation of the inflammatory&#xD;
      response is a major candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For instance, recent animal work has shown that RIPC results in downregulation of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 and upregulation of anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines such as IL-10. In support of the latter, the cardioprotective effects of RIPC were&#xD;
      absent in IL-10 knockout mice or in wild-type mice treated with a monoclonal antibody against&#xD;
      the IL-10 receptor. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) has been shown to be a major contributor&#xD;
      to this RIPC-induced IL-10 response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenosine appears to be a major determinant of the anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective&#xD;
      effects of RIPC. In a in vivo forearm model, adenosine and ischemic preconditioning both&#xD;
      resulted in the same reduction in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Also, administration of&#xD;
      exogenous adenosine can mimic the protective effects of IPC, and antagonizing the adenosine&#xD;
      receptor with caffeine blocks the protective effects of RIPC and augments the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory IL-10 response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Interestingly, one of the&#xD;
      pathways in which ischemia-reperfusion can increase adenosine levels is through upregulation&#xD;
      of CD73, which is dependent on the aforementioned HIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another possible mechanism behind the anti-inflammatory effects of RIPC is release of&#xD;
      Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, which in turn induce an endotoxin tolerance-like state.&#xD;
      Endotoxin tolerance is a refractory state of the immune system after challenge with the TLR4&#xD;
      ligand LPS, characterized by diminished cytokine production upon a subsequent LPS challenge.&#xD;
      However, induction of endotoxin tolerance was found to occur not only after LPS challenge but&#xD;
      also using other TLR(4)-ligands, so-called 'cross-tolerance'. A possible candidate to induce&#xD;
      tolerance in RIPC is heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), as extracellular HSP70 has been shown to&#xD;
      induce tolerance to LPS in monocytes in vitro. Furthermore, in rats receiving ischemic&#xD;
      preconditioning of the lower extremity, HSP70 expression was increased in the spinal cord and&#xD;
      myocardium, and HSP70 upregulation was found in cardiomyocytes after RIPC in infants&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery. However, other, yet unidentified TLR ligands could also be&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the abovementioned studies, it appears that RIPC exerts significant effects on the&#xD;
      immune response. However, this has not yet been demonstrated in the setting of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation in humans in vivo. Furthermore, the mechanisms behind the putative&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects and possible additive or synergistic effects of repeated RIPC&#xD;
      (thereby combining both the first and second windows of protection) are unknown as well. This&#xD;
      study aims to investigate the effects of (repeated) ischemic preconditioning during human&#xD;
      endotoxemia, a standardized controlled model of inflammation.&#xD;
