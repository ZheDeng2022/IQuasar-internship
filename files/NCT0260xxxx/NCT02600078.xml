    <textblock>
      With exposure to high altitude some individuals will develop acute mountain sickness (AMS).&#xD;
      Current evaluation of AMS can make it difficult to rule out other possible conditions.&#xD;
      Evaluation of ataxia, as measured by the performance of a coordinated task, can aide in the&#xD;
      correct diagnosis of AMS. The investigators have developed novel finger-tapping tasks on a&#xD;
      mobile device to assess both reaction time and accuracy. The proposed research will evaluate&#xD;
      the utility of this tool in assessing human acclimatization to hypoxia.&#xD;

      Introduction: Hypoxia is the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen that occurs with&#xD;
      exposure to altitude. Individuals acclimatize at different rates and to different degrees&#xD;
      meaning that those who are slow to make the necessary physiological adjustments will develop&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS). AMS is marked by headache,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disturbances, insomnia, fatigue and ataxia, which can be evaluated using&#xD;
      subjective questionnaires such as the Lake Louise Score (LLS). Evaluation of AMS by solely&#xD;
      using subjective questionnaires can make differential diagnosis of other possible pathologies&#xD;
      difficult. Ataxia is characterized by poor coordination in the absence of significant&#xD;
      weakness. Ataxia can be assessed with the performance of a coordinated task. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed a novel finger-tapping task on a mobile device to assess both&#xD;
      reaction time and accuracy. The proposed research will evaluate the utility of this tool in&#xD;
      assessing human acclimatization to hypoxia, which could ultimately serve as a novel,&#xD;
      objective methodology in the diagnosis of AMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: (1) When exposed to simulated altitude (equivalent to 4200m above sea level),&#xD;
      subjects will exhibit diminished coordination relative to a sham exposure. (2) Reaction time&#xD;
      of novel coordination tasks will positively correlate with heart rate, balance, and LLS. (3)&#xD;
      Accuracy of novel coordination tasks will negatively correlate with heart rate, balance, and&#xD;
      LLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A repeated-measures design with a familiarization trial, a hypoxic trial, and a sham&#xD;
      trial will be used. Sixteen healthy adults will be exposed to normobaric hypoxia in the&#xD;
      investigator's chamber, simulating an elevation of 4200m above sea level. Subjects will be&#xD;
      measured for pulse oxygen saturation, heart rate, and will complete the LLS, the Balance&#xD;
      Error Scoring System (BESS), as well as two electronic finger tap coordination tasks prior&#xD;
      to, and at 5 minutes, 4, and 12 hours into the altitude chamber exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: This research will enhance the investigators understanding of the relationship&#xD;
      between coordination, balance, and acclimatization to hypoxia. It will allow us to validate a&#xD;
      new objective tool in the measurement of acclimatization with exposure to hypoxia.&#xD;
