  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Universal coverage of good quality facility based care globally could prevent nearly 113,000&#xD;
      maternal deaths, 531,000 stillbirths and 1.3 million neonatal deaths annually by 2020. Yet,&#xD;
      only 57% of pregnant Ugandan women choose to deliver at health facilities. This unacceptably&#xD;
      low coverage of facility based births could explain, in part, the high maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      mortality estimates in Uganda. While multiple studies have examined factors associated with&#xD;
      this low utilization of health services around the time of birth, there is inadequate&#xD;
      implementation research exploring the best systematic methods that could promote uptake and&#xD;
      scale up of facility based births. This study will therefore examine the effect of an&#xD;
      intervention package (peer counselling by pregnancy buddies on facility based births, mobile&#xD;
      phone messaging promoting facility based births and provision of mama-kits) on the frequency&#xD;
      of facility based births and perinatal mortality. The study, a cluster randomized community&#xD;
      based intervention trial in post-conflict Northern Uganda, will provide data crucial in&#xD;
      framing national policy regarding measures to promote the use of health facilities.&#xD;
