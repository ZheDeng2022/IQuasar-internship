  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current method of incision localization in many surgical procedures requires a doctor to&#xD;
      reference a medical image, such as an X-ray, to judge where on the body an incision should be&#xD;
      made. However, the precise information of the scan is not shown on the patient's skin.&#xD;
      Surgeons commonly use palpation to locate the point of incision. They may feel for the area&#xD;
      directly or find landmarks under the skin and estimate the location from there. This can be&#xD;
      challenging due to the difficulty of feeling and distinguishing each vertebra, especially for&#xD;
      new surgeons, since palpation is a skill derived through experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If palpation proves ineffective, they may be forced to use fluoroscopy. By referencing the&#xD;
      fluoroscopy image the surgeon moves a radiopaque marker, such as their surgical tool, closer&#xD;
      to the area of interest. Fluoroscopy is time-consuming, and exposes medical personnel and the&#xD;
      patient to radiation. Many fluoroscopic images may be required in a single procedure. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and benefits of a new medical device that will&#xD;
      aid in radiological localization. The hypothesized outcome would be smaller incisions, faster&#xD;
      localization and a reduction in fluoroscopy use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By identifying the efficacy of this new medical device, &quot;Target Tape&quot;, there is the potential&#xD;
      outcome of making smaller incisions, faster localization, a reduction in fluoroscopy use and&#xD;
      a reduced chance in surgical error and the associated costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Tape is a non invasive device that is in a grid format that is placed against the&#xD;
      subject's skin. The grid pattern will then appear on the medical imaging scan. The medical&#xD;
      practitioner can correlate device grid on the body to the medical scan image to make their&#xD;
      incisions in more accurate locations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consent must first be obtained from the prospective patient before Target Tape can be&#xD;
      incorporated into the procedure. When a target procedure is scheduled to occur, the surgeon&#xD;
      will first determine if Target Tape would be appropriate to use. The procedure will need to&#xD;
      be able to integrate Target Tape into it using the Method of Use described above. The&#xD;
      decision to then pursue the procedure will be under the discretion of the medical&#xD;
      practitioner and consent from the patient. Depending on the procedure, the medical&#xD;
      practitioner may need to communicate to the OR or the radiology department to integrate&#xD;
      Target Tape into their protocol, since the practitioner making the incisions(s) may not&#xD;
      always be the one applying it. Examples of spine procedures that may utilize Target Tape may&#xD;
      be stabilization of fractures, tumor removals, fusions, discectomies and kyphoplasties. .&#xD;
      Once the procedure is determined to be appropriate to accommodate Target Tape, the medical&#xD;
      practitioner will approach the prospective patient and explain how the device will be&#xD;
      utilized, the benefits and potential risks associated with it, and answer any questions the&#xD;
      patient may have. A representative from Target Tape Inc may be on hand to aid with this&#xD;
      process and may also observe said procedure to record the necessary information. The consent&#xD;
      form will then be signed and Target Tape will then be utilized during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology of creating an outcome measure will occur over 2 stages with multiple steps&#xD;
      in each stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: Proof of Concept&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specify measurement goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proof of Concept Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Item generation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Item reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Verification 5. Verification Testing 6. Reliability 7. Validity 8. Interpretability&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Subjects (ii) Involved Groups (iii) Data Collection (iv) Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Proof of Concept&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measurement goals&#xD;
&#xD;
           The specific measurement goals are to verify specific procedures that benefit from&#xD;
           Target Tape. This serves as primary evidence, beyond the initial feedback and opinions&#xD;
           of medical professionals. Based on the benefits to the procedures, significant&#xD;
           performance variables will be determined that can be measured in Stage 2 testing. The&#xD;
           significant performance variables may be either qualitative or quantitative:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ease of use (surgeon opinion)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Usefulness (surgeon opinion)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incision length&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fluoroscopy use&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other variables that may need to be collected are certain subject characteristics (ie.&#xD;
           age, gender, height, weight and skin pigmentation). These variables help control for the&#xD;
           effects of variable skin characteristics that may affect the performance of Target Tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based upon interviews with medical professions such as surgeon and radiologists, initial&#xD;
           target procedures include stabilization of fractures, tumor removals, fusions,&#xD;
           discectomies and kyphoplasties.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This research is intended to be a multi participant study and may include a variety of&#xD;
           different spine physicians who are interested in utilizing the device in their&#xD;
           procedures. The overall method of use and testing remains consistent between the various&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proof of Concept Testing When a target procedure is scheduled to occur, the surgeon will&#xD;
           first determine if Target Tape would be appropriate to use. The procedure will need to&#xD;
           be able to integrate Target Tape into it using the Method of Use described above. The&#xD;
           decision to then pursue the procedure will be under the discretion of the medical&#xD;
           practitioner and consent from the patient. Depending on the procedure, the medical&#xD;
           practitioner may need to communicate to the OR or the radiology department to integrate&#xD;
           Target Tape into their protocol, since the practitioner making the incisions(s) may not&#xD;
           always be the one applying it. Once the procedure is determined to be appropriate to&#xD;
           accommodate Target Tape, the medical practitioner will approach the prospective patient&#xD;
           and explain how the device will be utilized, the benefits and potential risks associated&#xD;
           with it, and answer any questions the patient may have. The consent form will then be&#xD;
           signed and Target Tape will then be utilized during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Variable generation Item generation will be conducted in two stages. First, a list of&#xD;
           items will be created from the current outcome. The items will be grouped according to&#xD;
           the domains of: ease of use, device limitations, patient characteristics, time analysis,&#xD;
           incision length and fluoroscopy use. Second, this list will be distributed to the&#xD;
           surgeons/medical practitioners who have used the device and any missing items will be&#xD;
           included. It is anticipated that up to 10 procedures would have used the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Variable reduction The list of items generated in the step above will be administered to&#xD;
           doctors who will be asked to rate the items according to importance. Any items that are&#xD;
           deemed insignificant will be removed from the list. The objective of the item reduction&#xD;
           step is to find variables that are important to patients, doctors, and the hospital.&#xD;
           Furthermore, a definitive list of target procedures will be chosen, with procedures of&#xD;
           no observed benefits taken off the list.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage 2: Verification&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Verification Testing Subject to the testing results of Stage 1, there will be a set of&#xD;
           significant performance variables determined for each respective target procedure. The&#xD;
           significant variables may include time in the OR, incision length and fluoroscopy&#xD;
           exposure. The purpose of Stage 2 would be to verify the significant variables for each&#xD;
           procedure. Exclusion criteria would be created based upon the outcome of Stage 1. Target&#xD;
           Tape would then be randomly utilized in the procedures, with controls for who is&#xD;
           performing the procedure and patient characteristics (such as gender, age, weight,&#xD;
           height and skin pigmentation). Observation of the significant performance variable&#xD;
           occurs for all the procedures. The significant variables may be highly dependent upon&#xD;
           the medical practitioner; therefore, the sample size will be related to the number of&#xD;
           procedures the respective practitioner performs in a given amount of time. Stage 2 may&#xD;
           not be a necessary step for the initial development of Target Tape; due to the&#xD;
           simplicity of the device as well as qualitative factors, the cost-benefit analysis may&#xD;
           not necessarily require a lengthy statistical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Reliability Reliability refers to the consistency of the tool; the tool being the&#xD;
           criteria and testing to measure the significant performance variables. The device that&#xD;
           will be used will be the same design throughout Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Validity Validity refers to how well an instrument (i.e. criteria and testing) measures&#xD;
           what it claims to measure. The different types of validity are: face, content, construct&#xD;
           and criterion validity. Face validity ensures that the significant performance variables&#xD;
           make sense and will be ensured throughout the creation of the criteria by involving&#xD;
           surgeons, radiologists and patients. Content validity is the extent to which an&#xD;
           instrument covers a representative sample of the domain in question. Again this will be&#xD;
           ensured during the creation of the tool by involving surgeons, radiologists and&#xD;
           patients. Construct validity assesses the factors that can affect ratings. Construct&#xD;
           validity will also be assessed by looking for floor and ceiling effects. Criterion&#xD;
           validity may be assessed, and is the extent to which the utilization of Target Tape is&#xD;
           predictive of surgical outcomes (i.e. incision lengths, radiation exposure, and&#xD;
           procedure times).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Interpretation Quantitative measurements are measured on an absolute scale: incision&#xD;
           lengths measured in millimeters, procedure times in seconds, and fluoroscopy exposure in&#xD;
           the number of 'shots' as well as the time of live exposure in seconds (if possible).&#xD;
           Controls for patient characteristics will be recorded in absolute values, i.e. 37 years,&#xD;
           5'8&quot; 160 lbs. In the interpretation and analysis, these controls may be grouped. There&#xD;
           are also measures of the surgeon's opinion on the qualitative 'ease of use' and&#xD;
           qualitative 'usefulness'. This would be a of 10, with the 10 mark representing the best&#xD;
           possible score. In this case, zero would be difficult to use or can see no usefulness,&#xD;
           respectively. These scores would be converted into percentages. They can be interpreted&#xD;
           to find relative usefulness across various surgical procedures, as well as the effects&#xD;
           of independent variables (i.e. physical controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) Subjects The population for which Target Tape is designed for is an individual&#xD;
           undergoing a medical procedure in which a medical imaging scan is utilized to assist&#xD;
           with incision localization. These medical imaging scans may include X-ray, fluoroscopy,&#xD;
           CT or MRI. Depending on the nature of the procedure, the scan(s) may be done&#xD;
           preoperative or intraoperative. The surgeon may use the scan image in conjunction with&#xD;
           palpation to determine the incision site. Examples of possible procedures include&#xD;
           stabilization of fractures, tumor removals, fusions, discectomies and kyphoplasties.&#xD;
           Although the above conditions represent procedures that can occur in patients of any&#xD;
           age, the population to which this study will be directed is those who would not be&#xD;
           allergic to any medical adhesives, medical skin inks, and/or copper metal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The designated surgeon or medical practitioner will carry out subject recruitment at an&#xD;
           appropriate time before preoperative imaging or before the operation. Those who agree&#xD;
           may be asked to complete the consent form at that same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1-2 Spinal surgeons up to 10 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           The number of medical practitioners in each type of procedure may fluctuate. The number&#xD;
           of patients may vary depending on the relative magnitude of the observations and&#xD;
           feedback from the medical practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample sizes for each segment of this stage corresponds to sample sizes used to&#xD;
           create outcome measures in the different populations. After Stage 1 has been completed,&#xD;
           the sample sizes for Stage 2 will be assessed and a statistical model will be created at&#xD;
           that time. A preliminary estimate would require 5 times the sample size of per procedure&#xD;
           of Stage 1 to be a sufficient.&#xD;
