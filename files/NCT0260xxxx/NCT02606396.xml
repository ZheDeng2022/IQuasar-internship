  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is one of the few cancers with a rising incidence in the&#xD;
      United States, with an estimated 17,000 new cases diagnosed in 2012. Most patients with&#xD;
      esophageal cancer present with tumors which are not amenable to surgery and are treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation. The most common and bothersome symptoms from esophageal cancer is&#xD;
      dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Chemotherapy and radiation are effective in shrinking&#xD;
      tumors and allowing patients with EAC to swallow more easily; however it usually takes 1-2&#xD;
      months for swallowing to improve with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another method of shrinking esophageal tumors and allowing for better swallowing is&#xD;
      endoscopic spray cryotherapy (freezing the tumor from inside the esophagus with the aid of an&#xD;
      endoscope); cryotherapy is a well established method for treating cancerous and pre-cancerous&#xD;
      esophageal disease. This is a particularly attractive treatment option, as patients with&#xD;
      esophageal cancer usually undergo endoscopy on several occasions before starting treatment in&#xD;
      order to biopsy and evaluate the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cryotherapy in treating EAC&#xD;
      related dysphagia in patients who are getting ready to start chemotherapy and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to do this the investigators are planning to invite patients who are already&#xD;
      undergoing endoscopy for pre-chemotherapy evaluation of known EAC. Patients would undergo&#xD;
      cryotherapy after the diagnostic portion of the endoscopy has been completed. After the&#xD;
      cryotherapy patients will be contacted by phone in order to evaluate change in symptoms, 2&#xD;
      and 4 weeks after cryotherapy.&#xD;

      Endoscopic spray cryotherapy (EC) is a novel modality for destruction of tissue in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. EC involves the endoscopic application of cryogen [liquid nitrogen&#xD;
      (LN)], which destroys tissue by rapid freezing and slow thawing. Immediate effects from&#xD;
      tissue freezing include failure of cellular metabolism, membrane damage and local ischemia.&#xD;
      Delayed effects may include apoptosis of cancer cells and immune mediated tumor destruction.&#xD;
      EC has been used for the treatment of mucosal EAC and palliation of malignant dysphagia since&#xD;
      2007 in multiple tertiary centers, including Washington University in St Louis, with positive&#xD;
      results. EC is an attractive modality for the palliation of malignant dysphagia in EAC due to&#xD;
      the fact that newly diagnosed patients undergo upper endoscopy (EGD) and endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS) as part of initial staging; thus EC could be delivered at the time of the&#xD;
      staging endoscopy, without burdening the patient with an additional procedure. However,&#xD;
      prospective studies on the efficacy of EC in the short term palliation of malignant dysphagia&#xD;
      in EAC have not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of EC in the short term&#xD;
      palliation of malignant dysphagia in patients with unresectable EAC.&#xD;
