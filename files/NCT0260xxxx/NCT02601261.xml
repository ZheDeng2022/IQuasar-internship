      Investigating the influence of Internet use to the level of state anxiety in hospitalized&#xD;
      women with pathological pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent research shown that the prevalence of antenatal anxiety changes during pregnancy at&#xD;
      first trimester is 36.3%; the rate dropped to 32.3% at second trimester but increased again&#xD;
      to 35.8% at third trimester (art. 29).According to the World Health Organization, mental&#xD;
      health disorders are the leading cause of disease burden in woman from 15 to 44 years&#xD;
      (art.6). A Swedish study indicated that the incidence of moderate or extreme symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression of pregnant woman during the first trimester is 15,6% (art. 3).&#xD;

      WHAT CAUSES ANXIETY IN PREGNANT WOMEN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety during pregnancy may expose the woman to a higher risk of a negative outcome in four&#xD;
      different fields:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Fetal obstetric outcomes; 2. Neonatal outcomes; 3. Child development; 4. Risk to the&#xD;
      woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The anxiety in pregnant woman may expose the fetus to a higher risk of spontaneous early&#xD;
           labor, preterm delivery, lower birth weight, fetal distress, fetal growth restriction,&#xD;
           risk for spontaneous abortion, risk of pre-eclampsia and for operative/instrumental&#xD;
           deliveries. Furthermore could be a major risk for the uterine artery to have high&#xD;
           resistance that could reduce blood flow to the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The neonates that had a mother with anxiety issues during pregnancy may have an higher&#xD;
           risk of admission to neonatal ICU, have a lower Apgar score and small head&#xD;
           circumference, growth retardation, slowed mental development and excessive crying,&#xD;
           irritability, hostility and erratic sleep. The mother anxiety could also increase the&#xD;
           possibility to have colic in the neonatal age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. On the other hand the maternity anxiety could have long-term negative effects on the&#xD;
           child development. There are risks of negative effect on maternal-infant bonding,&#xD;
           difficult with affect regulations, cognitive delays, behavioral and emotional&#xD;
           difficulties, maladaptive and social interactions, cognitive delays, behavioral and&#xD;
           emotional difficulties and maladaptive social interactions. Furthermore, the child could&#xD;
           develop a major level of fear and anxiety during life, an insecure and disorganized&#xD;
           attachment and lower IQ at age 15-15 years. Anxiety of the mothers during pregnancy&#xD;
           could cause a non-optimal neuromotorial development of the child, a research&#xD;
           demonstrated an association between the anxiety of the mother in late pregnancy and the&#xD;
           infant behavior, his emotional problems and his difficult temperament during later&#xD;
           infancy. To demonstrated the correlation between anxiety and negative outcomes during&#xD;
           childhood a Belgian/Dutch study showed that the 14-15 years old person that had a mother&#xD;
           with anxiety disorders reveals a major risk of impulsivity and cognitive disorders.&#xD;
           Another study demonstrated the connection between antenatal anxiety and&#xD;
           behavioral/emotional problems of a four years old child. Another probable negative&#xD;
           outcome of the pregnant anxiety is the asthma during childhood. A study demonstrated&#xD;
           that the baby with a anxious mother has an higher risk to the use of antibiotic, to have&#xD;
           respiratory and skin illnesses in the first year of the life than the child born from a&#xD;
           mother without anxiety disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. It is very important underline to that anxiety during pregnancy has a negative effect&#xD;
           not only on the fetus and child but also on the mother as well. Many researches&#xD;
           demonstrated a link between prenatal anxiety and postpartum depression, psychiatric&#xD;
           complications, and a higher risk of preeclampsia. In addition, the mother suffering of&#xD;
           anxiety requires more examination from an obstetrician and most of all require an&#xD;
           elective caesarean section. Other negative outcomes are poor nutrition, impaired&#xD;
           self-care of the mother, failure to follow medical and prenatal guidelines, and major&#xD;
           exposure to use alcohol, drugs and tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERNET INFORMATION In 2004 the 4,5% of the researches of internet were about medical&#xD;
      information and, in 2009, the 61% of adult Internet users in the United States searched for&#xD;
      health-related information. The Internet allows people to have an immediately health&#xD;
      information and also pregnant woman search information about pregnancy and connected&#xD;
      problems. For example women affected with nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy search&#xD;
      online how this problem could be treated. On the other hand, not all information available on&#xD;
      the Internet are regulated, nor are always reliable or current.&#xD;

The STAI questionnaire that evaluate the level of anxiety, is divided in to parts: the first part aims to determinate the state anxiety and it will be administered every other day, while the second part will discuss the anxiety itself, and has to completed only once.</description>

The Internet questionnaire is divided in two parts.

        The study has been powered to detect a difference on the average STAI state score (range&#xD;
        20-80) of 6 points between women with some access to internet during stay (at least 10&#xD;
        minutes/days of web browsing, besides e-mails) and those no accessing internet during stay.&#xD;
        Assuming a Standard Deviation of the difference in STAI scores of about 8 points (art.&#xD;
        30-art. 33), and assuming that the ratio between the rate of women not using internet and&#xD;
        that of women using internet is 0,42 (art. 31-art. 32) for specified alpha = 0.025 and&#xD;
        power (1 - beta) of 90.0% a total of 109 women must be recruited (using a two-sample t-test&#xD;
        with unknown variance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Data entry will be based on e-CRF running on the REDCAP Clinical Data Management System of&#xD;
