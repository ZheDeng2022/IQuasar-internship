  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is a randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, efficacy,&#xD;
      and mechanisms of action of hyperthermic yoga versus a waitlist control for 80 medically&#xD;
      healthy adults with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. The primary aim is to test the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of hyperthermic yoga as a treatment for depression. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to examine the effect size/efficacy of hyperthermic yoga for depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. The tertiary aim is to explore physiological and psychological mechanisms of&#xD;
      action.&#xD;
