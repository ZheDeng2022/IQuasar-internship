  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol represents an open-label pilot study to assess whether oral administration of&#xD;
      SBI in subjects with decompensated cirrhosis with ascites can lead improvements in the&#xD;
      management of the disease. The impact of SBI therapy will be based on changes to markers of&#xD;
      bacterial translocation, gut barrier damage, and inflammation as well as the impact on rates&#xD;
      of SIBO. Study subjects will be given one packet of EnteraGam, each packet containing 5.0 g&#xD;
      SBI, twice daily for 8 weeks.&#xD;

      The Gut Barrier and Pathological Bacterial Translocation: The &quot;Achilles Heel&quot; of Hepatology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intestinal wall is a complex barrier that exists between humans and their environment.&#xD;
      Inside the intestinal lumen, the commensal flora exposes the epithelium to nearly 100&#xD;
      trillion bacteria.1 This epithelial layer provides a surface area of 400 square meters, lined&#xD;
      with tight junctions that prevent the translocation and paracellular transport of luminal&#xD;
      antigens including bacteria.2 In addition to this mechanical barrier, the wall of the&#xD;
      intestine is lined with mucosal immune defenses, notably gut-associated lymphoid tissue&#xD;
      (GALT), the largest immunologic organ in the body.1 Under normal circumstances, this&#xD;
      functional and efficient barrier prevents entry of bacteria from the outside world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of this intestinal barrier, along with an increased rate of pathological bacterial&#xD;
      translocation, has been shown to be associated with increasing severity of liver disease and&#xD;
      the development of decompensated cirrhosis.3 Factors thought to contribute to bacterial&#xD;
      translocation in subjects with cirrhosis include small intestinal bacterial overgrowth&#xD;
      (SIBO), which is known to have an increased prevalence in subjects with cirrhosis compared to&#xD;
      those without4, hyperdynamic portal status, alterations in the GALT tissue altering the&#xD;
      immune response, and impaired intestinal permeability seen in subjects with ascites.3 This&#xD;
      increased permeability is believed to result from structural abnormalities in the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa, including widening of intercellular spaces, edema, inflammation, and vascular&#xD;
      congestion.5-7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of the intestinal barrier is routinely thought to play an important role in the&#xD;
      natural course of cirrhosis, so much so that this has been referred to as hepatology's&#xD;
      &quot;Achilles heel.&quot;8 Pathologic bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium is&#xD;
      suspected to impact the clinical course of liver cirrhosis by triggering encephalopathy,&#xD;
      hepatic failure, and hepatorenal syndrome, in addition to having a long known role as an&#xD;
      underlying mechanism of the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and other&#xD;
      bacterial infections in this population.9 Given that SBP is associated with high mortality&#xD;
      rates ranging from 10-42%,10 and that subjects with cirrhosis have increased susceptibility&#xD;
      to infections, antibiotic prophylaxis has emerged as a widely accepted strategy in subjects&#xD;
      at increased risk for bacterial translocation, such as those with active gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding and low protein content ascites. However, this therapeutic strategy has the&#xD;
      potential of selecting resistant bacterial strains and increasing the risk of subjects&#xD;
      developing Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative methods for the prevention of SBP and bacterial infections in subjects with&#xD;
      cirrhosis could prove to be very beneficial in reducing mortality and preventing the&#xD;
      development of antibiotic resistance. In particular, preventing pathological bacterial&#xD;
      translocation at the intestinal barrier could be highly effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum-Derived Bovine Immunoglobulin: a Logical Therapy to Improve Gut Barrier Function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoglobulins taken orally are known to play a prominent role in health and development&#xD;
      given the known benefits of human milk and colostrum, a form of milk produced by mammals&#xD;
      which contains significant amounts of antibodies.11 Recognition of the essential nature of&#xD;
      these antibodies led to the development of commercial plasma-derived protein concentrates&#xD;
      containing immunoglobulins, which have been used for decades in animal husbandry to promote&#xD;
      growth and manage intestinal inflammation in immune-compromised young animals.12-14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin / protein isolate (SBI) is a novel medical food marketed&#xD;
      under the brand name, EnteraGamÂ®. This product is currently indicated (see EnteraGam package&#xD;
      insert for details) for the clinical dietary management of several forms of enteropathy,&#xD;
      including diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and intestinal bowel disease&#xD;
      (IBD). While the term, enteropathy, refers to any pathology or disease of the intestines,&#xD;
      known histological features can include blunting of intestinal villi, increased&#xD;
      intra-epithelial lymphocytes causing reduced absorptive capacity, and increased gut&#xD;
      permeability.12 In cases of enteropathy, a combination of factors including altered gut&#xD;
      microbiota, increased intestinal inflammation, and worsening gut barrier dysfunction are&#xD;
      known to increase the risk of bacterial translocation.12 Each of these factors is a potential&#xD;
      target for SBI. In terms of altered gut microbiota, extensive literature has demonstrated&#xD;
      broad bacterial antigen neutralizing capacity of ingested immunoglobulins.15-17 Likewise,&#xD;
      many non-clinical studies have shown that SBI can reduce intestinal inflammation by&#xD;
      decreasing mucosal cytokines and dampening immune activation.18-19 Furthermore, the available&#xD;
      data suggest that oral immunoglobulin therapy benefits tight-junction integrity in epithelial&#xD;
      barriers, as evidenced through increased transepithelial electrical resistance and reduction&#xD;
      in radiolabeled 14C-inulin permeability across the intestine.19&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is a large body of evidence showing that serum- or plasma-derived bovine&#xD;
      immunoglobulin preparations can effectively manage the symptoms and harmful effects of&#xD;
      enteropathy in both animals and humans. Animal studies include data regarding barrier&#xD;
      function and nutrient absorption in animals including mice, rats, and pigs.12 Studies&#xD;
      performed in children show promising results in terms of weight gain and the underlying&#xD;
      problem of malabsorption.22-23 Among adults, preliminary studies show promising results of&#xD;
      SBI in the management of HIV enteropathy in addition to diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel&#xD;
      Syndrome.24,25 Collectively, there is strong evidence to support the theory that ingestion of&#xD;
      oral immunoglobulins such as SBI could reduce the risk of bacterial translocation in patients&#xD;
      with cirrhosis, namely by neutralizing bacterial antigen in the intestine, reducing&#xD;
      intestinal inflammation, and decreasing permeability of the gut barrier.&#xD;
