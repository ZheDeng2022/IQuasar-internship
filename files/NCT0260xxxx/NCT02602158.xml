      13C breath tests represent an attractive alternative in the measurement of gastric emptying&#xD;
      (GE). Therefore these tests have been used in a variety of clinical settings such as in the&#xD;
      assessment of gastroparesis, delayed GE in diabetic patients or in the assessment of GE with&#xD;
      fat containing enteral formulas in critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously demonstrated that the 13C sodium octanoate breath test&#xD;
      (OBT) is an inappropriate measurement method for the GE of fat. The OBT appears to be&#xD;
      affected by 1) post gastric processing of the OCC marker and 2) its interaction with the&#xD;
      physical form and concentration of the fat present in the stomach and duodenum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The13C trioctanoate breath test (TriOBT) represents an attractive alternative to the OBT.&#xD;
      Compared to OCC which is a medium chain fatty acid the 13C trioctanoate (TriOCC) is a&#xD;
      triglyceride. TriOCC has similar physio chemical properties as the nutritional lipid e.g.&#xD;
      rapeseed oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of the TriOBT as a GE measurement method of fat in an&#xD;
      acid stable lipid emulsion (LE1). The breath test results from the TriOBT will be compared&#xD;
      with the OBT and further validated against gastric fat volume emptying data observed from&#xD;
      MRI. The interim analysis will determine whether the study will proceed to stage 2 which will&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of the TriOBT in an acid unstable lipid emulsion (LE4).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      13C breath tests for the measurement of gastric emptying (GE) were first developed in the&#xD;
      early 1990s. These tests have clear advantages over many other GE imaging techniques as they&#xD;
      are relatively inexpensive, simple to use, can be carried out in children and pregnant women&#xD;
      or those who have contraindications to MRI. Therefore these tests have been used in a variety&#xD;
      of clinical settings such as in the assessment of gastroparesis or delayed GE in diabetic&#xD;
      patients or the assessment of GE with fat containing enteral formulas in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. Breath tests rely upon the ingestion of a 13C stable isotope markers such as the&#xD;
      medium chain fatty acid 13C octanoic acid (OCC) and the tryglyceride13C trioctanoate&#xD;
      (TriOCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, 13C breath tests are an indirect measure of GE. Thus, GE data acquired from breath&#xD;
      tests are a result of numerous complex interactions which include: 1) the chemical properties&#xD;
      of markers and their interactions with test meals during gastric processing 2) absorption&#xD;
      from the duodenum, 3) metabolism by the liver (oxidation of fatty acids) and 4) final&#xD;
      excretion as 13CO2 by the lungs. All of these complex interactions can become compounded when&#xD;
      the gastric processing of lipid emulsions (LEs) are investigated and thus careful&#xD;
      consideration and selection of breath test markers is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed isocaloric and isovolume LEs with different GE properties as&#xD;
      shown previously with MRI. The acid stable (LE1) and acid unstable lipid emulsion (LE4)&#xD;
      responds differently to the conditions within the stomach. LE1 empties relatively uniformly&#xD;
      from the stomach. However, the LE4 separates into water and high fat phases after 15-30 min&#xD;
      of being in the stomach. In the late phase of GE the emulsion is re-emulsified and thus there&#xD;
      are three distinct GE phases in LE4. Once separation of LE4 occurs the aqueous and low fat&#xD;
      phase empties fairly rapidly from the stomach whereas the second fat phase empties more&#xD;
      slowly. The differing GE pattern of acid unstable LEs has a profound effect on GE breath test&#xD;
      data dependent upon the selection of the breath test marker used.The investigators have&#xD;
      previously demonstrated that the OCC breath test (OBT) is an inappropriate measure of the&#xD;
      gastric emptying of fat as the OBT is influenced by 1) Post gastric processing of the OCC&#xD;
      marker and 2) its interaction with the physical form and concentration of the fat present in&#xD;
      the stomach and duodenum. These effects were highlighted by only a marginal concordance&#xD;
      agreement with the OBT half emptying (T50) of 13CO2 recovery and fat volume T50 (MRI T50)&#xD;
      with LE1 and no agreement with LE4 (rc=0.7 and rc=0.4 respectively)..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to investigate whether TriOCC is a more appropriate breath test&#xD;
      marker to use in the measurement of the GE of fat. As the TriOCC is a triglyceride it has&#xD;
      similar physiochemical properties to nutritional lipids. Therefore, it is more likely to&#xD;
      behave similarly in the gastric and duodenal environment to ingested lipids in emulsions such&#xD;
      as rapeseed oil. In study 1 the investigators will compare the breath test markers TriOCC and&#xD;
      OCC in LE1. In a sub set of participants a validated MRI quantitative fat fraction method&#xD;
      will be used to determine reference values for the half gastric emptying time of fat (MRI&#xD;
      T50). This will be correlated to half emptying (T50) of 13CO2 recovery generated from&#xD;
      percentage dose recovery per hour (PDR/h) curves. The interim analysis will assess whether&#xD;
      the TriOCC is more related to gastric fat volume emptying than the OCC marker in LE1. Should&#xD;
      TriOCC be representative of gastric fat volume emptying study 2 will then proceed. Study 2&#xD;
      will then assess the gastric emptying of fat as above but with LE4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to develop an algorithm to quantify the heterogeneity of fat distribution&#xD;
      within gastric content for MRI data. The gastric processing of lipid emulsions as visualized&#xD;
      by MRI has been shown to result in a large inter individual variation of fat distribution. By&#xD;
      quantifying this heterogeneity we aim to determine the degree of flocculation and creaming of&#xD;
      the emulsions across the length of the stomach.&#xD;
