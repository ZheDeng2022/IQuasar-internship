  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is safe and effective&#xD;
      for the prevention of future onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in individuals who have&#xD;
      elevations of an autoantibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following recruitment strategies will be employed towards identifying healthy subjects&#xD;
      with elevated anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP3) levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Pre-screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  first degree relatives of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  subjects at health-fairs; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identification of subjects with elevated anti-CCP3 levels in the absence of inflammatory&#xD;
           arthritis in rheumatology clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects an estimated 1% of the population. RA is a disease where&#xD;
      the immune system attacks the joints, leading to joint inflammation and damage that is felt&#xD;
      by someone with RA as joint pain, stiffness and swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that there are markers in the blood called 'autoantibodies' that&#xD;
      precede the onset of joint symptoms of RA. Antibodies are commonly made in the blood to fight&#xD;
      infections. Sometimes, these antibodies attack one's own body. These are called&#xD;
      autoantibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain autoantibodies are specific for certain diseases. The autoantibody known as anti-CCP3&#xD;
      is specific for RA and can predict the development of RA in the future, especially if the&#xD;
      level of anti-CCP3 is high. The investigators of this study believe that individuals with&#xD;
      elevations of anti-CCP3 ≥2 times the normal value have approximately a 50% chance of&#xD;
      developing RA within 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is already used successfully and safely in the treatment of malaria,&#xD;
      lupus and RA. The objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with HCQ in&#xD;
      individuals with elevations of anti-CCP3 without joint inflammation may help prevent the&#xD;
      future onset of RA. This will involve a 12-month course of HCQ in the prevention of the&#xD;
      development of clinically apparent RA at 36 months in individuals at high-risk for future RA&#xD;
      due to high titer elevations of anti-CCP3. This study will recruit for individuals without a&#xD;
      history or clinical findings of inflammatory arthritis. Eligible subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio to HCQ versus HCQ placebo.&#xD;
