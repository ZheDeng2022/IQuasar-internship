      This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, single arm, 2-stage study of tazemetostat 800 mg&#xD;
      BID (twice daily) and 1600 mg QD (once daily). Subjects will be screened for eligibility&#xD;
      within 21 days of the planned date of the first dose of tazemetostat and enrolled into one of&#xD;
      8 cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort using tazemetostat 800 mg BID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (Closed for enrollment): MRT, RTK, ATRT, and selected tumors with rhabdoid&#xD;
           features, including small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type [SCCOHT], also&#xD;
           known as malignant rhaboid tumor of the ovary [MRTO]&#xD;

           EZH2 gain of function (GOF) mutation, including: epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve&#xD;
           sheath tumor (EMPNST), extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC), myoepithelial&#xD;
           carcinoma, other INI1-negative malignant tumors with Sponsor approval (e.g.,&#xD;
           dedifferentiated chordoma) any solid tumor with an EZH2 GOF mutation including but not&#xD;
           limited to Ewing's sarcoma and melanoma&#xD;

           biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;

           Sponsor approval)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort using tazemetostat 1600 mg QD&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Cohort 8 (Closed for enrollment): Epitheliod sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be dosed in continuous 28-day cycles. (Note: if treatment with study drug is&#xD;
      discontinued prior to completing 2 years, subjects will be followed for a maximum duration of&#xD;
      2 years from start of study drug dosing.) Response assessment will be performed every 8 weeks&#xD;
      while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with tazemetostat will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study.&#xD;
