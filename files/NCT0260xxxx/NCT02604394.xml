      Coronary obstruction by an occlusive thrombus complicating a ruptured or eroded&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque is the most frequent pathologic substrate of acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (AMI) , , . Timely restoration of perfusion and thereby myocardial salvage is the&#xD;
      single most important objective in the management of patients with ST segment-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is now the preferred treatment for STEMI&#xD;
      patients and is effective in opening the infarct-related artery (IRA) and restoring&#xD;
      Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) III flow in more than 95% of patients , , .&#xD;
      However the presence of a large thrombus burden increase the incidence of adverse outcomes&#xD;
      including persistent or transient no-reflow and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events&#xD;
      (MACEs), possibly due to distal atherothrombotic embolization, with ensuing disruption of the&#xD;
      microvascular network and failure of myocardial reperfusion . The microvascular obstruction&#xD;
      occurs in 10% of STEMI patients with a patent epicardial vessel after primary PCI , , . It is&#xD;
      associated with an increased infarct size, reduced recovery of ventricular function, and&#xD;
      increased mortality , , , , , , .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of thrombi from the IRA during primary PCI may prevent distal embolization and&#xD;
      improve myocardial perfusion and thus long term clinical outcomes. However studies conducted&#xD;
      to date provide mixed results , , , , , .The two largest randomized trials to date comparing&#xD;
      manual thrombus aspiration (MTA) followed by PCI to PCI only are the Thrombus Aspiration&#xD;
      during PCI in Acute Myocardial Infarction (TASTE) study , and Thrombus Aspiration during&#xD;
      Percutaneous coronary intervention in Acute myocardial infarction (TAPAS) study , . They&#xD;
      further illustrate the existing uncertainties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAPAS study showed improvement of the myocardial blush grade (primary endpoint) and reduction&#xD;
      of cardiac mortality at one year follow up in patients of the MTA group compared to those in&#xD;
      the conventional-PCI group. However, it is important to note that TAPAS was not powered to&#xD;
      detect differences in clinical outcome. TASTE study showed no mortality benefit of MTA at one&#xD;
      year follow up. These results concluded that routine use of thrombus aspiration is not&#xD;
      supported by current evidence however, selective use may improve tissue perfusion in some&#xD;
      patients .Accordingly MTA is currently a class IIb recommendation in the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for myocardial revascularization in STEMI patients , and a class&#xD;
      IIa recommendation in the 2013 ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines . The latter was released before the&#xD;
      results of TASTE were published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTA is ineffective in â‰ˆ30% of patients. Furthermore, residual thrombi after MTA are present&#xD;
      in virtually all patients when studied by optical coherence tomography (OCT).27, . The&#xD;
      currently existing alternative technique for removal of intracoronary thrombi is the&#xD;
      Rheolytic Thrombectomy (RT) by Angiojet device. RT is a catheter-based system that utilizes&#xD;
      multiple high-velocity, high-pressure saline jets introduced through orifices in the distal&#xD;
      tip of the catheter to create a localized low-pressure zone (Venturi-Bernoulli effect),&#xD;
      resulting in a vacuum effect with the entrainment and dissociation of bulky thrombi. The jets&#xD;
      break down thrombi into small particles and propel them proximally through the exhaust lumen,&#xD;
      leading to the aspiration and removal of thrombotic debris without embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two largest randomized trials to date studying the benefits of RT in patients presenting&#xD;
      with acute STEMI are (JETSTENT) Study and (AIMI) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the JETSTENT study8, ST-segment resolution was more frequently achieved in the RT arm.&#xD;
      There were fewer MACEs (death, MI, target vessel revascularization, and stroke) in the RT arm&#xD;
      at 12 months (p=0.036). Infarct size at one month did not differ between both arms. However,&#xD;
      results of JETSTENT need to be interpreted with caution; in the strict statistical sense, it&#xD;
      was a negative trial. Studies with a co-primary endpoint require a p value of 0.05 for both&#xD;
      endpoints or 0.025 for a single endpoint. This was not achieved in JETSTENT. However,&#xD;
      multivariable analysis showed that the use of rheolytic thrombectomy was independently&#xD;
      associated with improved clinical outcomes at one year - acknowledging that that latter was&#xD;
      not one of the primary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, in the AIMI 24 , the final infarct size was higher in the adjunct RT group&#xD;
      compared to PCI only group. Final TIMI III flow was lower in the adjunct RT group. Thirty-day&#xD;
      MACEs were higher in the adjunct RT group, a difference primarily driven by very low&#xD;
      mortality rates in patients treated with PCI only. There were no significant differences in&#xD;
      TIMI blush grade or ST-segment resolution between both groups. However, there are several&#xD;
      limitations to AIMI; a) the study did not require angiographic evidence of thrombus, and in&#xD;
      fact, excluded patients with very large thrombus burden, b) a retrograde technique - which&#xD;
      involves crossing the lesion before activation of the device - was used in the majority of&#xD;
      patients in the RT group, c) the time delay between admission and use of RT (door-to-device)&#xD;
      was very long, d) compared to the RT group, more patients in the PCI-only group had baseline&#xD;
      TIMI III flow (44% vs. 63%, p= 0.05). Collectively, these factors might have overshadowed any&#xD;
      potential benefit of RT in AIMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study, Parodi et al 31, compared MTA to RT in patients with acute STEMI using&#xD;
      residual thrombus burden (assessed by OCT) as the primary endpoint. The study did not meet&#xD;
      the primary end point; the number of OCT quadrants containing residual thrombus .However,&#xD;
      angiographic thrombus grade decreased significantly after RT, and all markers of reperfusion&#xD;
      (secondary endpoints) were better in the RT arm. There was a trend toward higher rate of&#xD;
      early ST-segment elevation resolution in the RT arm as compared with the MTA arm. These&#xD;
      findings suggest that RT may be more effective than MTA but to a lesser degree than&#xD;
      hypothesized by the investigators. Furthermore, calculation of thrombus volume by OCT is&#xD;
      extremely challenging given the inability to accurately define the border between disrupted&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques and superimposed thrombi, which is further blurred by the optical&#xD;
      shadowing of red thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these uncertainties, our study aims to evaluate the role of RT in patients who are&#xD;
      most likely to benefit from it (thrombus grade 4 and 5) using a sensitive, quantitative, and&#xD;
      reproducible parameter; CMR-derived myocardial salvage. CMR Cardiac MRI can provide a wide&#xD;
      range of information such as myocardial edema (myocardium at risk), microvascular obstruction&#xD;
      (MVO), location and &quot;transmurality&quot; of necrosis, as well as quantification of infarct size .&#xD;
      Moreover, CMR provides accurate and reproducible measurements of ventricular volumes and&#xD;
      function. For these reasons, cardiac MRI is currently perceived as the ideal tool for&#xD;
      evaluation of global post-infarction remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial edema in the acute phase of myocardial infarction can be visualized as a bright&#xD;
      signal on T2-weighted images, defining 'myocardium at risk .The major advantages of this&#xD;
      technique are distinguishing chronic from acute infarction, and quantifying the proportion of&#xD;
      myocardial salvage assessed retrospectively by comparing T2-weighted edematous (at risk) size&#xD;
      and late gadolimium enhancement (LGE) images (scar). LGE images are T1-weighted inversion&#xD;
      recovery sequences acquired about 10 min after intravenous administration of gadolinium and&#xD;
      the inversion time is chosen to null myocardial signal using 'inversion time scout' or 'look&#xD;
      locker' sequences .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed post-contrast sequences are currently used also to evaluate persistent microvascular&#xD;
      dysfunction/damage: in the context of white LGE regions (infarcted myocardium) dark&#xD;
      hypoenhanced areas may coexist, traditionally referred to as microvascular obstruction.&#xD;
      Microvascular obstruction has been initially defined as hypo enhancement at 1-2 min after&#xD;
      gadolinium injection; the final infarct size depends mainly on the extent of the so-called&#xD;
      'risk area', defined as the myocardial area related to an occluded coronary artery with&#xD;
      complete absence of blood flow, either antegrade or collateral .&#xD;
&#xD;
      These novel CMR-derived parameters have emerged as potential indices of adverse remodeling,&#xD;
      with the most attractive being myocardial salvage. Myocardial salvage is a prognostically&#xD;
      validated therapeutic target in primary PCI , , , , with myocardial salvage index being a&#xD;
      strong predictor of major cardiac events and mortality at 6-month . Myocardial salvage is&#xD;
      defined as the difference between the initial jeopardized area at risk (determined by&#xD;
      T2-weighted MRI) at baseline and final infarct size (determined by contrast-enhanced MRI).&#xD;
      The myocardial salvage index is defined as final infarct size indexed to the initial area at&#xD;
      risk , , .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether Rheolytic Thrombectomy (RT) before conventional PCI to the culprit&#xD;
           vessel as compared to conventional PCI (with or without MTA) results in improved&#xD;
           myocardial salvage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify clinical and angiographic determinants of any difference observed between&#xD;
           both treatment groups.&#xD;
