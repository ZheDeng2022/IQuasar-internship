  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality in the major thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), TTP and aHUS, exceeds 90% unless&#xD;
      rapidly diagnosed and appropriately treated. TMAs complicate 10-20% of allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplants (alloHSCT), conveying inferior survival. Multiple&#xD;
      etiologies have been proposed for these transplant-associated TMAs (TA-TMAs), but once&#xD;
      infection, graft vs. host disease (GvHD), and drug effects have been ruled out, most are&#xD;
      treated as TTP-like disorders using plasma exchange (PEx). But PEx has no impact on mortality&#xD;
      in this setting. Clear definition of the pathophysiology of the TA-TMAs is required to guide&#xD;
      effective treatment. Investigators hypothesize that an aHUS-type TMA, related to&#xD;
      dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway, is involved and will be characterized by&#xD;
      elevated plasma levels of C5b-9 and detectable C5b-9 deposition in bone marrow sinusoidal&#xD;
      vessels. Investigators further hypothesize that treatment with inhibitors of terminal&#xD;
      complement components will reverse the TMA in vivo, and block endothelial cell damage in our&#xD;
      in vitro model systems. The data investigators generate from this observational study of&#xD;
      TA-TMAs should enable prediction of their development prior to overt clinical manifestations,&#xD;
      and guide appropriate therapy.&#xD;

      Investigators plan to enroll 120 adult patients who are undergoing an allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant and follow them serially for one year. Investigators will&#xD;
      harvest and store at -80oC plasma and PBMCs, and collect bone marrow core biopsy specimens on&#xD;
      all individuals at baseline, days 28, 100, 190, 365 post-transplant, and at time of relapse&#xD;
      of primary disease relapse or TMA development. These time points, bone marrow procedures, and&#xD;
      blood draws are part of the ordinary and customary followup of any allogeneic HSCT patient at&#xD;
      our institution. With these patient samples investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the incidence of all TMAs fitting the criteria of a Coombs negative hemolytic&#xD;
           anemia, thrombocytopenia (25% decrease from baseline) and elevated (2x baseline) LDH,&#xD;
           with schistocytes and organ system involvement (typically increased creatinine or new&#xD;
           microscopic hematuria or proteinuria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the incidence of an aHUS-like TMA, i.e., a TMA characterized by ADAMTS13&#xD;
           activity in plasma &gt;5% with clinical and laboratory findings which persists after&#xD;
           stopping their calcineurin or mTOR inhibitor for one half life (3-7 days, depending on&#xD;
           the drug), and ruling out or treating an underlying systemic infection or GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine complement component activation, proinflammatory cytokine profile, and&#xD;
           baseline complement mutations. This will include ELISA-based measures of plasma C5a,&#xD;
           C5b-9, MASP-1-3, tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α, and interferon-γ, and pre-transplant&#xD;
           complement mutational analysis .&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assay participants plasma for the ability to induce injury in primary human&#xD;
           microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC), and the ability of an anti-C5 monoclonal&#xD;
           antibody (mAb) (Alexion, eculizumab (Soliris)) and anti-MASP2 (Omeros, OMS721) mAb, to&#xD;
           block these changes in the investigators' established model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Define the degree of C5b-9 deposition in sinusoidal CD34+ endothelial cells by&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry, (IHC) examining marrow core biopsies collected at each patient&#xD;
           visit and at time of TMA development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Correlate changes in plasma biomarkers, marrow sinusoidal C5b-9 deposition, and the in&#xD;
           vitro plasma-MVEC injury model with treatment interventions and treatment outcomes,&#xD;
           chosen by the transplant attending of record in this observational cohort.&#xD;

    <description>Adult patients who undergo an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and meet the criteria for a thrombotic microangiopathy in the one year follow up period. Possible interventions include observation, treatment of an underlying infection or GvHD, use of plasma exchange, or use of anti-complement therapy (eculizumab or other anti-complement drug). Eculizumab is used as a 900mg intravenous infusion over 35 minutes, given weekly for 4 weeks, then 1200mg every other week. Patients must be vaccinated against meningococcus 2 weeks before starting drug or, if that is not feasible because of the physician's assessment of the severity of the TMA, given prophylactic antibiotics for the 2 week period before immunization has taken hold.</description>
