    <textblock>
      -  The purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of bazedoxifene in preventing&#xD;
           loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS), and any fractures in&#xD;
           postmenopausal rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving long-term GCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a randomized, controlled, open-label extension study for 48 or 56 weeks. At&#xD;
           study entry, all patients will receive elemental calcium (1200 mg daily) and vitamin D&#xD;
           (800 IU daily) and will be randomized by blocks of two to receive either bazedoxifene&#xD;
           (20 mg/day) or none.&#xD;

      -  The purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of bazedoxifene in preventing&#xD;
           loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS), and any fractures in&#xD;
           postmenopausal rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving long-term GCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This was a randomized, controlled, open-label study conducted for 56 weeks. Four trial&#xD;
           visits occurred over the course of the 56 weeks. At study entry, all patients who took&#xD;
           elemental calcium (1200 mg daily) and vitamin D (800 IU daily) were assigned by blocks&#xD;
           of two to receive either bazedoxifene (20 mg/day) (bazedoxifene group) or not (control&#xD;
           group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization was performed by an independent coordinator. Participants were followed-up&#xD;
           at 24 weeks and 48 weeks with special attention to RA flares and occurrence of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and medications related to RA, as well as&#xD;
           laboratory result such as complete blood count (CBC), chemistry, and levels of&#xD;
           inflammatory markers were collected at enrollment. BMD and trabecular bone score (TBS)&#xD;
           were assessed at 0 and 48 weeks, and levels of bone turnover markers were assessed at 0,&#xD;
           24, and 48 weeks. At 56 weeks, the occurrence of AEs was assessed.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Bone Mineral Density (BMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BMD of the L-spine (L1-4) and femur neck was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic®, Discovery W, Hologic APEX software version 2.3.1; Bedford, MA, USA). BMD in the L-spine was estimated as the mean of individual measurements for L1-L4 excluding any fractured or otherwise deformed vertebrae. The technician who was responsible for measuring BMD was blinded to the details of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Trabecular Bone Score (TBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lumbar spine TBS is obtained using the spine DXA scan archived from the baseline and 48 weeks tests. It is calculated after reanalysis of the DXA scan of the L-spine using TBS iNsight® software (Version 2.0.0.1, Med-Imaps, Bordeaux, France). Vertebrae excluded in the calculation of BMD are also excluded in the TBS calculation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Development of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae for deformities by visual inspection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline vertebral fracture is defined as a loss of at least 25% of vertebral height through the thoracic spine X-ray and the lumbar spine X-ray. Incident vertebral fractures at 48 weeks is diagnosed when there were distinct alterations in the morphology of the vertebral bodies that resulted in the loss of at least 25% of vertebral height of previously normal vertebrae.&#xD;
The location, the date of occurrence and the severity of fracture (mild, moderate, severe, etc.) are described.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Development of any fractures including nonvertebral fractures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the questionnaire for fracture. Check item: the location and the date of occurrence of fracture.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTX)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Serum C-telopeptide levels (ng/ml) are assayed by electrochemiluminescence (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Blood samples are collected after at least an 8-hour fast.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in urine N-telopeptide (NTX)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Urine N-telopeptide levels (ng/ml) are measured by chemiluminescence (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, New York, USA) using commercially available kits. Urine samples are collected after at least an 8-hour fast.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (µg/L) are also determined by electrochemiluminescence using commercial kits (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, USA). Blood samples are collected after at least an 8-hour fast.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in serum osteocalcin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Serum osteocalcin levels (ng/mL) are also determined by electrochemiluminescence using commercial kits (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, USA). Blood samples are collected after at least an 8-hour fast.</description>
