  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I to determine safety of combining stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will determine safe doses of&#xD;
      radiation by organ site when used together with pembrolizumab. The study will also provide&#xD;
      the opportunity to evaluate changes in the tumor caused by SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 2 expansion cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partially Irradiated Large Volume Tumors Cohort: Patients with at least one lesion&#xD;
           greater than 65cc amenable to SBRT followed by pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oligometastatic Cohort: Patients with limited metastatic disease (4 or fewer lesions)&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the recommended SBRT dose to various metastatic locations in patients with advanced solid tumors, and specifically in the lung in patients with NSCLC, in conjunction with pembrolizumab treatment.&#xD;
Each metastasis targeted with SBRT will be assigned to one of the seven &quot;Metastasis Locations&quot;. Patients will receive 3 or 5 fractions of radiation as determined by the location of the metastases to be irradiated.&#xD;
Exact logistic regression 13 analyses will be conducted to model the probability of DLT as a function of site dose, number of metastatic sites, and cumulative body radiation. These analyses will be conducted separately for each site using all patients with lesions at that site. If these analyses suggest a high (&gt;=33%) probability of toxicity for a particular combination of predictors, dose recommendations may be modified</description>
