  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if corticosteroid injection modifies the natural&#xD;
      course of de Quervain tendinopathy compared to a toradol injection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If steroids are effective for Dequervain tenosynovitis because of their anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties, then there is a reasonable and rational argument to be made for the local&#xD;
      injection of NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) into the first dorsal extensor&#xD;
      compartment. Ketorolac is an NSAID that has been proven efficacious in the treatment of&#xD;
      another musculoskeletal condition. Moreover, compared to betamethasone (or other injectable&#xD;
      corticosteroids), injection of ketorolac decreases the patient exposure to the potential&#xD;
      side-effects of corticosteroids, especially that of elevation of blood sugar levels in&#xD;
      diabetics.&#xD;
