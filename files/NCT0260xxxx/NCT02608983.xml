  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seaweeds are a natural source of nutrients, and dependent on the variety, are rich in dietary&#xD;
      fibre, proteins, essential vitamins and minerals. However this resource is highly&#xD;
      underexploited. Countries such as Japan, China, North and South Korea are large consumers of&#xD;
      edible seaweed while exposure in Western countries is much lower and mainly as industrially&#xD;
      extracted seaweed derivatives, a common additive in many food and healthcare products.&#xD;
      Seaweeds have been associated with a number of human gut promoting health benefits such as&#xD;
      decreasing faecal transit time through the gastrointestinal tract thus preventing&#xD;
      constipation and resulting in a reduced exposure to harmful substances (decreasing colon&#xD;
      cancer risk). These health benefits can be attributed to seaweeds high dietary fibre content.&#xD;
      Interestingly, the food and healthcare industry already utilize seaweed-extracted fibre in&#xD;
      the manufacturing process thus steering the way forward towards the development of novel&#xD;
      functional food products. These seaweed-extracted fibres are high molecular weight&#xD;
      polysaccharides known as hydrocolloids and are non-digestible by humans, hence classified as&#xD;
      dietary fibre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, seaweed derived polysaccharides (hydrocolloids) have been used to provide&#xD;
      thickening and gelling functionality to food stuffs and other industrial applications however&#xD;
      there is emerging evidence to show that lower molecular weight polysaccharides and&#xD;
      oligosaccharides derived from these hydrocolloids can also act as a source of soluble fibre&#xD;
      and may have prebiotic activity. Recent developments in Japan and Korea have lead to the&#xD;
      commercial availability of products containing low molecular weight seaweed derived fibre.&#xD;
      There is also some evidence for the beneficial effects of seaweed derived fibre in other key&#xD;
      health areas such as cardiovascular health, cancer, diabetes and obesity. However, relatively&#xD;
      little is known about the chemical, physio-chemical and fermentation characteristics of&#xD;
      seaweed fibre in the human gut. Some hydrocolloids, notably guar gum (plant source), have&#xD;
      also been employed for their health promoting properties in the areas of glucose tolerance&#xD;
      and cholesterol lowering. However the use of hydrocolloids as functional food ingredients&#xD;
      with health benefits for consumers has been rather limited and has focused more on uses in&#xD;
      products for diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is particularly in the area of gut health that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)&#xD;
      involved in hydrocolloid production and processing, can enter the functional food ingredients&#xD;
      market by using innovative processing technology. The total dietary fibre content of seaweed&#xD;
      can be as high as 75% of the total dry weight and a high proportion of this is soluble. The&#xD;
      fibre component essentially comprises the structural polysaccharides i.e. alginate and&#xD;
      fucoidan in brown seaweeds, carrageenan, agar and porphyran in red seaweeds and ulvan in&#xD;
      green seaweeds. As these fibres are primarily soluble, they form viscous gels as they pass&#xD;
      through the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the fibre is fermented in the lower intestine but&#xD;
      in general, soluble and insoluble seaweed fibre tends to pass through the gut without being&#xD;
      digested. In its natural form as part of the seaweed plant, this fibre is typically high in&#xD;
      molecular weight and passes through the gut too rapidly for the gut microflora to utilize it&#xD;
      to any great extent. There is therefore a necessity to develop lower molecular weight forms&#xD;
      that are more soluble and can be added at higher concentrations to food products without&#xD;
      affecting the sensory properties of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the project is to realize an opportunity to produce low molecular weight&#xD;
      polysaccharides (LMWP) from alginate- and agar-bearing seaweeds for applications in food &amp;&#xD;
      health. The two effective agar and alginate LMWPs, identified by in vitro studies, will be&#xD;
      selected for assessment of prebiotic activity in a feeding trial in human volunteers (Ulster&#xD;
      University) as part of an European Union (EU) study. The end points to be assessed will be&#xD;
      stimulation of beneficial bacteria (bifidogenic effects), increased short chain fatty acid&#xD;
      production, beneficial effects on stool formation, and improvements in gut barrier function.&#xD;
      Additionally, benefits of the LMWPs towards blood glucose levels (short term and acute) will&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;
