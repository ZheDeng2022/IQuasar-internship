    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study with BID (suspension)&#xD;
      and TID (tablet) oral dose of tazemetostat. Subjects will be screened for eligibility within&#xD;
      14 days of the planned first dose of tazemetostat. A treatment cycle will be 28 days.&#xD;
      Response assessment will be evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment and subsequently every 8&#xD;
      weeks while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
