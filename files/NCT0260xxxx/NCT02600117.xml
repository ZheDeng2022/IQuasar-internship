  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that patients with inactive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) may develop&#xD;
      the same types of liver complications that patients in the active state of hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV) infection experience. Treatment guidelines for patients in the active state of HBV&#xD;
      infection indicate that HBsAg clearance is associated with definitive remission of the&#xD;
      activity of chronic HBV &amp; improved long-term outcome. Clinical data showed that HBsAg&#xD;
      clearance is achievable, in a small population of patients on continuous treatment with&#xD;
      potent oral antivirals (OAVs), such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). It is possible&#xD;
      the same OAVs can have the same effect in patients with inactive CHB, but in a shorter&#xD;
      treatment duration. The purpose of this study is to find out if TDF is effective in&#xD;
      controlling HBV DNA &amp; promoting seroconversion from HBsAg-positive to HBsAb-positive in&#xD;
      patients with inactive CHB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major worldwide health problem. The course of the&#xD;
      majority of patients with inactive chronic hepatitis B is usually benign; therefore, the&#xD;
      current treatment guidelines recommend not treating these patients. However, recent evidence&#xD;
      suggests that the prognosis of these inactive carrier is not exactly benign. For instance,&#xD;
      patients may develop liver cancer despite their inactive carrier state. Also, approximately&#xD;
      20-30% of patients with inactive chronic hepatitis B may undergo spontaneous reactivation of&#xD;
      hepatitis over time. Multiple episodes of reactivation or sustained reactivation can cause&#xD;
      progressive liver damage and even liver decompensation. However, until there are data to&#xD;
      support that treatment with oral antivirals can alter the outcome of these patients, they&#xD;
      will remain untreated. Potent oral antivirals have been shown to suppress HBV DNA and&#xD;
      normalize liver enzymes in patients with active chronic hepatitis B infection. With continued&#xD;
      long-term treatment, some of these patients have gone on to clear hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
      and develop hepatitis B surface antibody. Therefore, it is possible that the same oral&#xD;
      antivirals can have the same effect in patients with inactive chronic hepatitis B, but in a&#xD;
      shorter duration of treatment. This study will explore the possible use of tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate in controlling HBV DNA and promoting hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
      seroconversion in patients with inactive chronic hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of all initial investigations, patients will be started on TDF 300mg daily.&#xD;
      Patients will be reviewed at 6 monthly intervals as per standard of care. At each clinic&#xD;
      visit, patients will have blood tests including complete blood count, renal function,&#xD;
      electrolytes, liver enzyme and liver function tests, as well as HBV serology including&#xD;
      quantitative HBsAg and HBV DNA. Patients will also receive an abdominal ultrasound, fibroscan&#xD;
      and fibrotest on an annual basis. Treatment will be stopped when sAg+ve seroconverts to&#xD;
      sAb+ve or at the end of 3 years whichever comes earlier.&#xD;
