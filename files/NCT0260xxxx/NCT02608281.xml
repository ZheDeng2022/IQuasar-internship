      Clinical study to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of low dose contrast enhanced dual energy&#xD;
      mammography imaging (CEDEM+PRIME) in comparison with CE-MRI The primary objective of this&#xD;
      clinical study is to assess diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer detection in Contrast&#xD;
      Enhanced Dual Energy Mammography compared to CEMRI. Sensitivity and specificity will be&#xD;
      compared for both modalities.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this clinical study is to assess the value of&#xD;
      low-dose CEDEM in comparison with CE-MRI. The diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer detection&#xD;
      of low dose CEDEM will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator plans to explore the diagnostic quality of 4 standard view bilateral dual energy&#xD;
      subtracted images compared to CE-MRI in a blinded reader study. A goal is to evaluate,&#xD;
      whether sensitivity and specificity of low-dose CEDEM are comparable with breast MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked before diagnostic workup to participate in this clinical study.&#xD;
      Approximately 80 subjects scheduled for a diagnostic CE-MRI (i.e., based on screening&#xD;
      mammography classified as BI-RADS® 0, 4 or 5), will be eligible to participate in this study&#xD;
      and will undergo a follow up 4 view bilateral low dose contrast enhanced mammography&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiologically, subjects included in the study population will have even distribution of&#xD;
      masses, clusters of microcalcifications, and architectural distortions as given by the nature&#xD;
      of breast cancer development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include all breast compositions. Diagnostic CE-MRI Examination If&#xD;
      eligible, subjects with a positive or incomplete screening mammogram (BI-RADS 0, 4 or 5) will&#xD;
      undergo a CE-MRI of the breast. MRI examinations will be performed on a 3 Tesla scanner (Tim&#xD;
      trio, Siemens) with a dedicated 16 channel breast coil. A combination of high temporal and&#xD;
      high spatial resolution imaging protocol will be used. All patients will be examined in the&#xD;
      prone position and contrast agent (0.2mmol / body weight, GD-DOTA) will be administered i.v.&#xD;
      as a bolus followed by a 20 ml saline flush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both exams (CEDEM and CE-MRI) will be scheduled in the second week of the menstrual cycle in&#xD;
      premenopausal women. Each suspicious lesion will undergo needle or surgical biopsy (after&#xD;
      completion of the CEDEM+PRIME procedure). Imaging findings will be compared with findings of&#xD;
      histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic CEDEM+PRIME If eligible, subjects with a completed MRI procedure will undergo a 4&#xD;
      standard view (CC, MLO) bilateral CEDEM examination. Due to use of the grid-less PRIME&#xD;
      acquisition technology the AGD is limited and lies in the range of a standard mammogram. The&#xD;
      high energy images will be acquired with the titanium filter. All acquired images - including&#xD;
      the unprocessed images - will be collected. Recombined CEDEM images will be created offline.&#xD;
      Contrast agent is injected as a bolus of 2 ml/kg body weight of non-ionic iodine contrast&#xD;
      media with a power injector at a rate of 3.5ml/s followed by a 25ml saline flush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CEDEM diagnostic procedure will be performed not later than 7 days and at least 24 hours&#xD;
      after the CE-MRI procedure.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ROC area will be estimated from the BI-RADSS scores assigned by the readers to each suspicious lesion. The BI-RADS scores assigned by the readers in the interpretation of a CEDEM lesion will be used for the CEDEM+PRIME ROC area; the BI-RADS scores assigned by the readers in the interpretation of a CE-MRI case per lesion will be used for the CE-MRI ROC area. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC), or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings</description>
