  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2012, the Institute of Tropical Medicine in collaboration with National&#xD;
      Institute of Malariology Parasitology and Entomology (NIMPE) conducted a study in Quang Nam&#xD;
      province, central Vietnam, to assess the efficacy of the national DHA-PPQ regimen for the&#xD;
      treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections, both in adults and in children.&#xD;
      Results showed that about 30% of the study participants were parasitaemic at day 3. Parasite&#xD;
      clearance rate was estimated at 6.2h, which was comparable to figures from Pailin, Cambodia,&#xD;
      where artemisinin resistance were previously reported . However, results from this study have&#xD;
      to be interpreted bearing in mind that: (i) the age-based drug dosing scheme used has been&#xD;
      criticized as insufficient to clear parasites and (ii) DHA-PPQ drugs used (Artecan™),&#xD;
      Vietnam, are not produced under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). However, those results&#xD;
      prompted the NMCP and WHO to declare Quang Nam, Binh Phuoc, Dak Nong, and Gia Lai provinces&#xD;
      as a &quot;Tier I area&quot; (credible evidence of artemisinin resistance) in May 2013. By end of 2014&#xD;
      a fifth province, Khanh Hoa, was declared Tier I (Dr Hong, Personal Communication). Except&#xD;
      for the south-eastern province of Binh Phuoc, artemisinin resistance has never been confirmed&#xD;
      with an artemisinin based monotherapy in Central Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in order to confirm artemisinin resistance in Central Vietnam , a study with oral&#xD;
      artemisinin-based monotherapy, using WHO prequalified AS and DHA-PPQ and recommended dosing&#xD;
      scheme of 4mg/kg/day for AS and DHA, is needed. In the arm where study participants are&#xD;
      treated with 3 days of AS monotherapy, treatment will be followed by an additional 3-day&#xD;
      course of DHA-PPQ to effectively clear all parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to confirm artemisinin resistance in Central Vietnam by&#xD;
      assessing P. falciparum clearance time and rate after AS monotherapy (WHO recommended&#xD;
      dosage). The investigators will conduct a two-arm open label, randomized study, with one arm&#xD;
      receiving AS monotherapy for 3 days + 3-day of DHA-PPQ, and a second arm receiving 3 days of&#xD;
      DHA-PPQ.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      3.1 Study Design This study is designed as a randomized open label 42-day follow-up study to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical and parasitological responses after treatment of uncomplicated&#xD;
      P.falciparum infections with either AS or DHA-PPQ. Symptomatic patients with P.falciparum&#xD;
      mono-infections, fulfilling the study criteria, will be enrolled into the study, randomized&#xD;
      to one of the treatment arms and followed up for 42 days. All drug administration will be&#xD;
      directly observed and the patients will be actively followed-up for 42 days according to an&#xD;
      extended WHO protocol. At the end of the follow-up time, all patients carrying gametocytes&#xD;
      will be treated with a single dose of Primaquine (0.75mg/kg) following national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Study site and population The study will be carried out in Krong Pa district, Gia Lai&#xD;
      province where both P.falciparum and P.vivax malaria incidences are the highest in the&#xD;
      country. The study will be located in Chu R'Cam commune where the study team will be working&#xD;
      together with the local health staff and all surrounding communes health centers with malaria&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local population is mainly composed by the Gia Rai ethnic minority whose main occupations&#xD;
      consist of slash and burn agriculture (mainly maize, manioc and rice) in forest fields,&#xD;
      together with seasonal work in rubber plantations, and small-scale production of goods for&#xD;
      daily subsistence or trade e.g. coffee and cashew nuts. The climate is tropical with an the&#xD;
      dry season from November to April and the rainy season from May to October. The area is hilly&#xD;
      and forested (secondary forest) and the main malaria vector is Anopheles dirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Trial Population The target population includes all P. falciparum infected patients&#xD;
      either presenting spontaneously to the CHC or being referred by the health staff of the&#xD;
      surrounding CHCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5. Trial procedures 3.5.1 Screening. All consulting patients who meet the basic enrolment&#xD;
      criteria during screening will be assigned a consecutive screening number and evaluated in&#xD;
      greater depth by the medical doctor. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria, he or&#xD;
      she (or a parent or guardian in case of children) will be asked for consent to participate in&#xD;
      the study and will be allocated a study number (ID=sequential numbering). Any person who&#xD;
      decides not to participate in the study will be examined, treated and followed-up by the&#xD;
      health facility staff according to the standard of care established by the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.2. Randomisation and Treatment Allocation Randomization will be carried out in blocks of&#xD;
      10 with an allocation ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrolment, the patient will be interviewed and examined physically and a standardized&#xD;
      pre-coded questionnaire will be filled in. A venous blood sample will be collected into&#xD;
      sterile vacutainer tubes containing EDTA or acid-citrate-dextrose (EDTA/ACD) from all&#xD;
      patients at enrolment. A minimum of 5ml of blood -and maximum of 8 ml- will be collected from&#xD;
      adults, and 1ml/kg up to 5ml will be collected from children. Two blood drops will be added&#xD;
      into a 1.5 ml tube containing 500 µL of RNAprotect reagent (Qiagen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.3 Treatment All patients will receive a full treatment of either AS alone (4mg/kg/day) or&#xD;
      DHA-PPQ (target dose DHA=4mg/kg/day) for 3 days in order to evaluate early parasite&#xD;
      clearance. Since a 3-day course of AS is insufficient to treat P.falciparum, it will be&#xD;
      completed by an additional 3-day DHA-PPQ regimen according to WHO recommendations. Patients&#xD;
      will be observed for 60 minutes after treatment for adverse reactions or vomiting. Those&#xD;
      patients vomiting their medication within the first 30 minutes will receive a repeat full&#xD;
      dose; those vomiting from 30-60 minutes will receive half dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue medications will be given following national guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue oral drug: Quinine (30mg/kg/day) and clindamycine (15mg/kg/day) for 7days; Rescue IV&#xD;
      drug: Quinine (30mg/kg/day) and doxycycline (3mg/kg/day) for 7days 3.5.4. Follow up From Day&#xD;
      0 until parasite clearance: after the first dose of antimalaria drug has been administered&#xD;
      and observed for one hour, patients will be monitored every 12 hours by blood microscopy at&#xD;
      least until day 3 and longer if necessary until parasite clearance defined as two consecutive&#xD;
      negative slides. At each visit, the patient will be interviewed and examined physically, the&#xD;
      follow-up form completed and any adverse event documented. A finger prick blood sample will&#xD;
      be collected for the following outcomes: two blood slides for LM observation (thick and thin&#xD;
      film), 200 µl of blood into an EDTA/ACD microtainer tube for later DNA extraction, and 2&#xD;
      drops of blood into another microtainer tube containing RNAprotect for later RNA extraction.&#xD;
      An additional drop of blood will be taken at Day 3 to measure Hb concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 Patients will then be asked to attend the clinic (or be visited at&#xD;
      home) for each follow-up visit, during which they will be interviewed and examined, the&#xD;
      follow-up form will be completed, and any adverse event documented. A finger prick blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected for the following outcomes: two blood slides for LM observation&#xD;
      (thick and thin film), 200μl of blood in an EDTA/ACD microtainer tube for DNA extraction, and&#xD;
      2 drops of blood in RNAprotect containing microtainer tube. At Day 7, 14, 28 and 42, one drop&#xD;
      of blood will be taken for Hb concentration (Hemocue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of P. falciparum recurrence Recurrence is defined as any P.falciparum parasitaemia&#xD;
      detected by LM examination during the patient's follow-up period and after initial parasite&#xD;
      clearance. If recurrence is confirmed a further venous blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      (minimum 5ml/maximum 8ml) prior to rescue treatment administration: ex-vivo assays will be&#xD;
      done with one part of the blood while the remaining will be cryopreserved for future&#xD;
      investigations on drug resistance mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.5. Loss to follow-up &amp; protocol violations Loss to follow-up occurs when, despite all&#xD;
      reasonable efforts, an enrolled patient does not attend the scheduled visits and cannot be&#xD;
      found. No treatment outcome will be assigned to these patients. These patients will be&#xD;
      classified as lost to follow-up and censored or excluded from the analysis. Study patients&#xD;
      who meet any of the following criteria will be classified as withdrawn: i) withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent; ii) failure to complete treatment; iii) enrolment violation; iv) voluntary protocol&#xD;
      violation; v) involuntary protocol violation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.6 Laboratory procedures and evaluation Microscopy: three slides (thin &amp; thick and thin&#xD;
      films) should be obtained at screening. One slide will be stained rapidly (10% Giemsa for&#xD;
      15min) for initial screening. Once the patient is enrolled, the other two slides will be&#xD;
      stained more carefully (3% Giemsa for 45min). Parasite density will be determined by counting&#xD;
      the number of asexual parasites per 200 white blood cells (WBCs) with a hand tally counter.&#xD;
      If more than 500 parasites have been counted before reaching 200 WBCs, the count will be&#xD;
      stopped after completion of the field. Density, will be expressed as the number of asexual&#xD;
      parasites per µl of blood, will be calculated dividing the number of asexual parasites by the&#xD;
      number of WBCs counted and corrected by the estimated WBCs density (typically 8000 per µl).&#xD;
      When the number of asexual parasites is less than 10 per 200 white blood cells in follow-up&#xD;
      smears, counting will be done against at least 500 white blood cells. A blood slide will be&#xD;
      considered negative when examination of 1000 white blood cells reveals no asexual parasites.&#xD;
      Gametocyte density will be computed by counting the number of gametocytes per 500 WBCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemoglobin (Hb) concentration will be measured on whole blood collected into micro-cuvette&#xD;
      using Hemocue following manufacturer instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P. falciparum molecular detection: DNA will be extracted from finger-prick blood samples&#xD;
      collected in microtainers. Molecular confirmation of Plasmodium species (P.vivax,&#xD;
      P.falciparum, P.ovale and P.malariae) at Day 0 will be performed by qPCR targeting 18S&#xD;
      ribosomal gene. The same qPCR method will be used to identify and quantify P. falciparum&#xD;
      infections at Day 0 and follow up samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P. falciparum genotyping for recrudescence/new infection: genotyping of the recurrent&#xD;
      infections will be done by characterizing MSP1, MSP2 and GLURP, single-copy genes in the&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum genome as described elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA extraction and RT-qPCR for gametocytes: RNA will be extracted from RNAprotect samples&#xD;
      using affinity columns and DNAse digestion of genomic DNA. To detect and quantify P.&#xD;
      falciparum gametocyte stages a reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) targeting Pfs25 gene&#xD;
      transcripts will be done on Day 0 and in all follow-up samples, following previously&#xD;
      described protocols with modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ex vivo drug sensitivity assays: venous blood collected in EDTA/ACD tubes (at Day 0 and Day&#xD;
      of recurrence) will be processed within 6 hours after collection. Blood will be centrifuged&#xD;
      and plasma and buffy coat removed and stored at -20ºC. Red blood cells will be washed twice&#xD;
      in RPMI and resuspended in culture medium (RPMI 1640 LPLF liquid medium) to a 50% hematocrite&#xD;
      blood medium mixture (BMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard ex vivo drug sensitivity assay: the assessment will follow the WHO guidelines &quot;Field&#xD;
      application of in vitro assay for the sensitivity of human malaria parasites to antimalarial&#xD;
      drugs&quot; for the assessment of the response of P. falciparum to artemisinins&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ex vivo ring stage survival assays (RSA) In addition to standard ex vivo assays, the&#xD;
      performance of ring stage survival assays (RSA) will be explored following a published&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular markers of artemisinin resistance: extracted DNA will be used to genotype point&#xD;
      mutations in P. falciparum Kelch propeller domain (K13), which have been recently identified&#xD;
      as candidate resistance molecular markers for artemisinin resistance. Briefly, K13 will be&#xD;
      amplified in a nested PCR using primers described in WWARN procedure INV11&#xD;
      [http://www.wwarn.org/toolkit/procedures]. After agarose gel electrophoresis confirmation,&#xD;
      products will be sequenced and analysed to identify polymorphisms. Alternative upcoming&#xD;
      candidates for artemisinin resistance may also be explored 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE Site&#xD;
      monitoring visits will be scheduled on a regular basis. During these visits, information&#xD;
      recorded on the case report forms (CRFs) will be verified against source documents (eg&#xD;
      laboratory records and clinic registers). After the CRFs forms are collated at the end of the&#xD;
      trial, they will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy. The data will be double entered&#xD;
      on site into an electronic database (Epi Info), where specially designed computer checks are&#xD;
      used to identify data entry discrepancies, invalid data ranges and overall consistency. All&#xD;
      discrepancies will be resolved by reference to the original checked data collection forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood films on admission will be read at the study site as well as by a senior&#xD;
      microscopist at a coordinating centre. In addition, an external quality control will be done&#xD;
      at ITM on 10% of randomly selected slides. For each of the molecular assays (qPCR, RT-qPCR&#xD;
      and parasite genotyping) 10% of the samples processed at NIMPE will be randomly chosen to be&#xD;
      re-analysed at ITM. External quality control of ex vivo drug assay results will be done at&#xD;
      ITM where the slides will be re-examined for 10% of randomly chosen isolates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Statistical Analysis Plan The parasite clearance time is defined as the elapsed time (in&#xD;
      hours) from the patient's treatment (first dose) time to the first of two consecutive&#xD;
      negative blood slides. Parasite clearance time and rate as well as lag phase will be fitted&#xD;
      using the PCE online tool developed by the WWARN. The analysis of the 42 day cure rate will&#xD;
      be performed both for the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) patient population (all&#xD;
      randomised patients) and the evaluable patient population (Per Protocol). Patients are&#xD;
      evaluable for the analysis of the 28/42 day cure rate if parasite counts are recorded up to&#xD;
      Day 26/40 or the patient discontinues due to &quot;Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect&quot; because of&#xD;
      reappearance of parasites. The mITT analysis also includes patients who discontinue before&#xD;
      Day 28/42 due to reasons other than &quot;Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect&quot; (e.g. this could&#xD;
      include &quot;Adverse experience(s)&quot; because of repeated vomiting). These patients will be counted&#xD;
      in the mITT analysis as treatment failures regardless of their reason for discontinuation.&#xD;
      Patients who had concomitant treatment with antibiotics which have an anti malarial effect&#xD;
      will be excluded from the evaluable patients and included in the mITT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For categorical variables percentages and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      calculated using Wilson's method. Proportions will be compared by calculating the *2 with&#xD;
      Yates' correction or by Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Normally distributed&#xD;
      continuous data will be summarized as means and standard deviations, and compared by&#xD;
      Student's t test and analysis of variance. Data not conforming to a normal distribution will&#xD;
      be summarized as medians (IQR) or geometric means and compared by the Mann-Whitney U test or&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. The association between 2 continuous variables will be&#xD;
      assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of treatment failure by day28 and 42 will all be evaluated by survival analysis with&#xD;
      cumulative incidences calculated by Kaplan Meier method and compared by the Mantel-Haenszel&#xD;
      log rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasite, fever and gametocyte clearance times will also be evaluated by Kaplan Meier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological changes during the first week of treatment as well as recovery during weekly&#xD;
      follow-up will be evaluated by measuring the changes in Hb concentration between day0, 3, 7,&#xD;
      and day14, 28 and 42, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. ETHICAL ISSUES Ethical clearances Ethical clearance to conduct the study will have been&#xD;
      obtained from the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and&#xD;
      Entomology, Hanoi and of the University of Antwerp, as well as from the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board at the ITM, Antwerp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent Patients will be included in the study only if they (or parents or guardians&#xD;
      of children) give informed consent. The consent request is available in English and&#xD;
      translated into Vietnamese language will be read entirely to the patient, parent or guardian.&#xD;
      Details about the trial and its benefits and potential risks will be explained. Once any&#xD;
      questions have been answered, a signature will be requested on the document. If the patient&#xD;
      is illiterate, a literate witness must sign; if possible, the signatory will be selected by&#xD;
      the participant and will have no connection to the research team.&#xD;
