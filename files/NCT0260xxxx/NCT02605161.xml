      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the blood brain barrier in the striatum of patients&#xD;
      that have other types of movement disorders compared to patients with Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
      that are receiving similar treatment, to determine if a there is a disruption of the blood&#xD;
      brain barrier in patients with Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder of aging. Its&#xD;
      cause is unknown. Current evidence supports a stress-diathesis model of pathogenesis whereby&#xD;
      some yet-to-be identified environmental trigger conspires with a permissive genetic&#xD;
      background to initiate the disease process. Based on neuropathological observations in other&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy where pathological&#xD;
      protein aggregates form in close association with damaged blood vessels, investigators have&#xD;
      hypothesized that the environmental trigger resides in the bloodstream. As a corollary of&#xD;
      this hypothesis, investigators propose that the PD pathological process begins in the brain&#xD;
      of affected individuals only after disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB), thereby&#xD;
      allowing access of the inciting agent to nigrostriatal axon terminals in the neostriatum.&#xD;
      This forms the foundation for the investigators' hypothesis that the BBB in the neostriatum&#xD;
      of PD patients is disrupted. Indeed, in a post-mortem study, investigators demonstrated&#xD;
      histopathological evidence for significant striatal BBB disruption in sections of striatum&#xD;
      from PD subjects relative to age-matched controls. Critics of this study indicate that&#xD;
      post-mortem effects may result in artefactual disruption of the BBB, calling into question&#xD;
      the validity and relevance of this potentially important finding to PD pathogenesis and&#xD;
      progression. Therefore, investigators are performing this imaging study of live PD patients&#xD;
      as a follow-up of their convincing post-mortem study to definitively establish whether BBB&#xD;
      dysfunction is a feature of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neostriatal BBB is dysfunctional in PD patients relative to controls and this can be&#xD;
      demonstrated by significantly increased parenchymal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of these studies could have important implications for the understanding of PD&#xD;
      pathogenesis. There is emerging evidence that the key pathogenetic event in PD pathogenesis,&#xD;
      aggregation of alpha-synuclein, begins within the axon terminals of neurons. The neurons most&#xD;
      severely affected in PD reside in the substantia nigra and project to the neostriatum.&#xD;
      Demonstrating disruption of the BBB in the PD striatum would render nigrostriatal axon&#xD;
      terminals susceptible to a blood-borne disease trigger and allow researchers to generate&#xD;
      hypotheses regarding the identity of this trigger. Immune/inflammatory candidates are&#xD;
      particularly attractive in this regard. The results this study may also have therapeutic&#xD;
      implications. For example, if alpha-synuclein disaggregating agents achieve therapeutic&#xD;
      utility in the coming years, our studies may indicate that such agents may be capable of&#xD;
      accessing nigrostriatal axon terminals without requiring pharmaceutical or mechanical&#xD;
      disruption of the BBB.&#xD;

        Patients having movement disorders undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal&#xD;
        segment of the globus pallidus for treatment of motor symptoms refractory to medical&#xD;
        therapy at the Ottawa Hospital, Civic Campus, will be recruited to participate in this&#xD;
        pilot study. The cohort will include 10 PD patients and 10 control subjects. The PD&#xD;
        subjects will have received a diagnosis of PD using established clinical criteria following&#xD;
        clinical assessment at the Movement Disorders Clinic of The Ottawa Hospital. The 10 control&#xD;
        subjects will consist of those undergoing DBS and assessed in the same clinic with a&#xD;
        clinical diagnosis of either essential tremor or cervical dystonia.&#xD;
