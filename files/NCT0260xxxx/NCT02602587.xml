  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dendrogenin A is present in mammals normal tissues and fluids, notably blood. It is&#xD;
      down-represented or absent in cancer cell lines and tumors. In the opposite, OCDO is&#xD;
      accumulated in cancerous conditions and virtually absent of normal tissues. This study will&#xD;
      try to determine modulations of these oxysterols and protein involved in their metabolism&#xD;
      between Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples and normal blood or marrow, for&#xD;
      evaluation of these markers as companion biomarkers for Dendrogenin A treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background : Acute myeloid leukemia is an unmet medical need since 5-year overall survival is&#xD;
      40-50% in younger adults and 10-15% in elderly. Dendrogenin A is a natural novel anticancer&#xD;
      agent showing potent antileukemic activity which is under-represented in tumors. Dendrogenin&#xD;
      A inhibits Cholesterol epoxide hydrolase and so modulates levels of substrates and products&#xD;
      of this enzymatic complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose : This is a biomedical study of interventional type which includes 30 patients and 30&#xD;
      blood samples as well as 5 marrow samples from healthy donors. It will last 24 month, 8&#xD;
      months recruiting and 16 months follow-up. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia for which an&#xD;
      indication of chemotherapy treatment is retained will be enrolled in this study. This study&#xD;
      will compare oxysterols (Dendrogenin A, 6-oxo-cholestane-3beta,5alpha-diol - OCDO) and&#xD;
      related proteins as biomarkers of the disease between the two populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions : The patients included in this study will be processed according to the&#xD;
      standard treatment in force for their disease. This study does not in any way interfere with&#xD;
      this treatment regimen, and is only based on additional samples of blood and bone marrow in&#xD;
      acts planned in the prognostic or follow-up protocols. Treatment shall start within the 15&#xD;
      days following inclusion and first sampling.&#xD;
