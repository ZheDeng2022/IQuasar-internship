    <textblock>
      Shift work with circadian disruption has been linked with increased breast cancer incidence.&#xD;
      The mechanisms for this effect are not yet completely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the impact of a previously developed sleep intervention in shift workers&#xD;
      at risk of breast cancer; and assesses mediating variables that may explain the relationship&#xD;
      between shift work and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of women night shift workers were provided with a sleep intervention. The&#xD;
      intervention is a standard approach used in a sleep clinic and is delivered by telephone by a&#xD;
      trained intervener.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The intervention will improve sleep in women night shift workers, which will in&#xD;
      turn have a positive impact on biological and behavioural risk factors associated with breast&#xD;
      cancer and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      47 female night shift workers completed a sleep intervention. The intervention follows an&#xD;
      established sleep therapy protocol. Assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months include&#xD;
      mammographic density and possible mediating variables known to be linked to breast cancer&#xD;
      risk including behavioural, biometric, and biological measures. Behavioural and self-report&#xD;
      measures of sleep quality and physical activity are assessed as well as self-reported&#xD;
      chronotype and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is a multi-session intervention using cognitive behavioural principles to&#xD;
      increase healthy sleep by addressing a variety of behaviours that may influence sleep quality&#xD;
      and quantity, based an established telephone-based protocol used at the UBC Hospital Sleep&#xD;
      Disorders Clinic. It includes 10 telephone sessions spaced over a 6-month period, and 2&#xD;
      additional booster sessions at 8 and 10 months. Participants are given a sleep diary at&#xD;
      baseline to complete for 2 weeks before the sleep hygiene telephone counseling session&#xD;
      begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention protocol incorporates sleep assessment, maintaining a sleep diary and use of&#xD;
      an actiwatch (to measure sleep and physical activity), sleep hygiene (i.e., controlling&#xD;
      behavioural and environmental factors that affect sleep), stimulus control therapy (i.e.,&#xD;
      teaching individuals how to eliminate behaviours that are incompatible with sleep), sleep&#xD;
      restriction therapy (i.e., teaching how to limit time in bed to time asleep), cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring (i.e., modifying non-adaptive thoughts and triggers for insomnia), and relapse&#xD;
      prevention. The structured counseling protocol includes concrete exercises and activities,&#xD;
      questions and answers, and problem solving strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication use is not part of this protocol; if participants wish to explore pharmacologic&#xD;
      approaches, they are advised to consult with their physicians. Although some shift workers&#xD;
      have received care from the Sleep Clinic in the past, there has not been a systematic focus&#xD;
      on this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project manager conducts a telephone-based evaluation of the intervention 6 months&#xD;
      post-sleep intervention. Blood and salivary samples are collected using standardized data&#xD;
      collection methods at baseline, 6, and 12 months, and mammographic films are collected at&#xD;
      baseline and 12 months.&#xD;

Session 2: Review sleep diary; calculate sleep efficiency; identify adjustments needed.&#xD;
Session 3: Review sleep-related vs. stress-related symptoms. Develop plan for sleep-related symptoms and discuss &quot;Sleep Restriction with Relaxation Exercises.&quot; Session 4: Reinforce progress and make corrections as required. If Sleep Restriction is not working, Stimulus Control is introduced.&#xD;
