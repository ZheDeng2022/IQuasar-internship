  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ActiPatch is a cutaneous device which is CE marked approved for relief of pain. It is&#xD;
      taped over the affected area and stimulation at a high frequency is reported to alleviate&#xD;
      pain with no sensation. However there is no class 1 evidence for this on back pain. By&#xD;
      randomising patients between application of an active device or a dummy device and assessment&#xD;
      of disability and pain scores at two weeks, the efficacy or otherwise can be established. Low&#xD;
      back pain is a major health problem and if effective this has major economic implications as&#xD;
      the device is cheap and safe.&#xD;
