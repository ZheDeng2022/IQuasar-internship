  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the process of fibrosis is essential for normal wound healing, an excessive and&#xD;
      uncontrolled 'fibrotic' response can result in impaired tissue structure and function. In&#xD;
      other words, affected 'fibrotic' tissues are unable to heal back to normal and therefore&#xD;
      don't work as effectively as they normally would.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of the lung, fibrosis can occur across large parts of the lung such as in&#xD;
      conditions like Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis or it can occur in much&#xD;
      smaller patches such as around the borders of some lung tumours. At the moment the&#xD;
      investigators don't fully understand the mechanisms of fibrosis and so therefore cannot&#xD;
      monitor or treat these conditions as effectively as the investigators could. Despite the&#xD;
      significant global financial burden of these diseases, treatment options are very limited and&#xD;
      monitoring of disease progression remains a real challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to address this problem, the research group are currently developing a library&#xD;
      of novel optical molecular imaging SmartProbes that are targeted against key pathological&#xD;
      processes in the human lung. The functional profile for this portfolio of probes is that they&#xD;
      exhibit high stability and specificity in vivo and have a short activation time permitting&#xD;
      rapid point-of-care in situ molecular profiling enabling in the future, improved diagnostic&#xD;
      certainty and stratification for targeted pharmacological intervention. This clinical&#xD;
      microdosing study protocol focuses around the intrapulmonary delivery of microdoses (&lt;100µg)&#xD;
      of the Smartprobe Fibroproliferation (FIB ONE) to disparate regions of the human lung to&#xD;
      highlight MMP activity combined with an active MMP inhibitor (AZD1236) to the distal lung.&#xD;
      This approach will enable the research team to directly demonstrate the utility of this&#xD;
      SmartProbe-based platform in the validation of drug target engagement in areas of suspected&#xD;
      fibroproliferation (characterised by increased MMP activity).&#xD;

      The primary endpoint is to visualise the delivery of a microdose of FIB ONE and assess&#xD;
      imaging parameters in patients with lung conditions using two microendoscopy systems (Part&#xD;
      A). A secondary objective is to quantify the change in mean FIB ONE fluorescence&#xD;
      amplification gradient in the presence of AZD1236 in the fibroproliferative lung (Part B).&#xD;
      Imaging will be performed using a novel multi-colour widefield fluorescence microendoscopy&#xD;
      platform and a commercially available imaging platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will consist of 20 patients scheduled for routine elective diagnostic or&#xD;
      surveillance bronchoscopy with a fibroproliferative lung condition and Cohort 2 will consist&#xD;
      of 6 patients undergoing planned cardiothoracic surgery for biopsy/resection of lung&#xD;
      conditions characterised by excessive activity of the fibroproliferative pathway. For both&#xD;
      cohorts, eligibility will be verified by a clinical trial physician after written informed&#xD;
      consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cohort 1, a bronchoscopy with lavage will be performed to harvest broncho-alveolar lavage&#xD;
      fluid (BALF). For cohort 2, a sample of resected lung tissue will be analysed. Fibre-based&#xD;
      endomicroscopy (FE) will be performed and up to 100μg of FIB ONE and PBS/AZD1236 will be&#xD;
      instilled. CT identified regions of architecturally normal lung in all participants will act&#xD;
      as internal controls and will be used to compare MMP activity in normal and diseased lung&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide routine blood samples before and after FIB ONE and&#xD;
      AZD1236 administration. A cardiorespiratory exam and routine observations will be performed&#xD;
      4-6 hours following administration and all participants will be assessed for discharge. All&#xD;
      participants will either be contacted by a member of the research team via telephone or ward&#xD;
      visit 24 hours (± 4 hours) after dosing to ensure no AEs/SAEs were experienced. The&#xD;
      participant's involvement in the study is concluded when the 24 hour assessment has been&#xD;
      successfully completed and all AEs/SAEs have been resolved.&#xD;
