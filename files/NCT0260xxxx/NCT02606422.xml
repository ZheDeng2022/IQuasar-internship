  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects first and&#xD;
      foremost language abilities. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is slowly progressive decline in&#xD;
      a single domain of cognition (e.g. language) not attributable to motor or sensory loss,&#xD;
      without impediment of social or occupational function. MCI can be an early sign of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease, or can be due to normal aging. When language is the prominent&#xD;
      affected domain in MCI, the person may later meet criteria for PPA or may progress to the&#xD;
      clinical syndrome of Alzheimer's dementia. Spelling, naming, and working memory (e.g.&#xD;
      repetition) are among the language abilities affected early in the course of PPA or&#xD;
      language-centered MCI, and different variants have distinct deficits in these domains. This&#xD;
      research project investigates the behavioral and neuromodulatory effects of high definition&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) during language therapy in PPA participants&#xD;
      over time. Anodal HD-tDCS targeting the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) administered in&#xD;
      combination with language therapy is expected to be more beneficial when compared to language&#xD;
      therapy alone. It will 1) improve language performance or decrease rate of decline, 2) have&#xD;
      better-sustained effects at 2 weeks and 2 months post-treatment, and 3) produce&#xD;
      generalization to untrained language items and some other cognitive functions. Resting-state&#xD;
      fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and volumetric data are also collected to investigate&#xD;
      changes in functional brain connectivity associated with HD-tDCS in individuals with PPA. A&#xD;
      better understanding of the therapeutic and neuromodulatory mechanisms of HD-tDCS as an&#xD;
      adjunct to language therapy in PPA may have a significant impact on the development of&#xD;
      effective therapies for PPA and MCI, and may offer insight into ways of impeding&#xD;
      neurodegeneration that may improve patients' quality of life, as well as extend their ability&#xD;
      to work and manage their affairs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A. Evaluation Tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Language Tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be administered baseline language and cognitive tasks, including 1 or more&#xD;
      of the following, depending on their residual language and cognitive skills:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) writing to dictation b) oral spelling c) oral and written naming of pictures d)&#xD;
      word-picture matching f) written and oral picture description g) digit span h) spatial span&#xD;
      i) verbal learning j) grammatical sentence production k) oral word repetition l) sentence&#xD;
      comprehension&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be administered standardized and non-standardized quality-of-life&#xD;
      questionnaires before, after, and at follow-up intervals of each experimental period. The&#xD;
      purpose of these questionnaires is to assess whether the proposed interventions have affected&#xD;
      participants' well-being and the general quality of their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Spoken and Written Word Production Therapy Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with PPA will receive spoken and written word production intervention tailored to&#xD;
      their degree of deficit. Two interventions (basic and advanced) will be implemented, treating&#xD;
      the main lexical retrieval deficits in PPA, in oral and written modalities. The goal of the&#xD;
      combined interventions is to promote interaction between phonological and orthographic&#xD;
      representations and processes in the remediation of lexical retrieval deficits that are&#xD;
      prominent in all PPA subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Assessment of Language Therapy Tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessment will probe all sets of trained phoneme-grapheme correspondences, words,&#xD;
      or other stimuli (e.g. sentences) to identify whether or not the patient has retained&#xD;
      knowledge of the trained items. Differences in baseline measures in pre- and post-therapy&#xD;
      accuracy for phoneme-grapheme correspondences for each patient will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      following: percentages of total number of points correct, arithmetic differences between&#xD;
      percentage scores, and permutation tests (Pearson's chi-square test; Fisher's exact test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. HD-tDCS Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in 10-15 consecutive training sessions (3-5 per week), separated&#xD;
      by 2 months. Anodal HD-tDCS has typically been shown to up-regulate neuronal excitability and&#xD;
      produce enhancement of behavioral performance. A Soterix-CT device will be delivering current&#xD;
      at an intensity of 1-2mA (estimated current density 0.04 mA/cm2; estimated total charge&#xD;
      0.048C/cm2) for a maximum of 20 minutes in the HD-tDCS groups and for a maximum of 30 seconds&#xD;
      in the Sham group. For both interventions (HD-tDCS and Sham) the electrical current will be&#xD;
      increased in a ramp-like fashion at the onset of the stimulation eliciting a transient&#xD;
      tingling sensation on the scalp that usually disappears over seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Imaging Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging will be performed at the beginning of enrollment, before and after each 12-to-15-day&#xD;
      HD-tDCS treatment, and at follow-up intervals for up to 8 time points per individual on a 3T&#xD;
      Philips system, and will consist of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), MPRAGE, and diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging (DTI). Each scanning session will last approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the within-subject crossover protocol, each participant will be administered three&#xD;
      experimental conditions: Control (natural progression), IFG HD-tDCS+language (henceforth&#xD;
      abbr. HD-tDCS treatment (word production) and sham HD-tDCS+language (henceforth abbr. sham&#xD;
      treatment). To achieve an accurate estimate of degeneration and rate of decline in each&#xD;
      participant at their particular stage of the disease progression, each participant will first&#xD;
      be enrolled in the control condition (natural progression), such that for the first 12 weeks&#xD;
      they will not receive any therapy. Then the participant will receive either the HD-tDCS&#xD;
      treatment followed by sham, or vice versa. All analyses, behavioral and imaging, will be&#xD;
      under the oversight of the study statisticians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before any intervention, participants will be enrolled in a control condition for 12 weeks&#xD;
      during which no therapy will be provided to enable us to assess their personal decline rate.&#xD;
      After this period they will be randomly assigned to either sham or HD-tDCS experimental&#xD;
      conditions. After 1-3 weeks of HD-tDCS application (3-5 sessions in a week, 10-15 sessions&#xD;
      per stimulation site) there will be an interval of approximately 2 months and then we will&#xD;
      implement the other two HD-tDCS conditions in a within-subject cross-over design.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed-up at 2-week and 2-month follow-up intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be blinded to the application of anodal or sham HD-tDCS. To achieve&#xD;
      blinding, all participants will be fitted with the HD-tDCS electrodes placed over the left&#xD;
      inferior frontal gyrus. The Soterix-CT device will be used for double-blinding purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Justification of why participants will not receive routine care or will have current&#xD;
      therapy stopped&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will not disrupt any current care or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non-treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo active and sham conditions, thus serving as their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      J. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be removed from the study if they are unable to comply with task&#xD;
      instructions or tolerate the HD-tDCS procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K. Description of what happens to participants receiving therapy when study ends or if a&#xD;
      participant's participation in the study ends prematurely&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study ends participants will continue to receive management with their neurologist&#xD;
      as usual. If a patient's participation in the study ends prematurely s/he will still receive&#xD;
      care as before. In sum, termination of the study or termination of participation in it will&#xD;
      not affect regular therapy he or she may be receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L. Qualification of investigators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI and co-investigators have extensive research and clinical experience with all study&#xD;
      tasks: behavioral language therapy (including spelling, naming, and repetition therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators have arelady published a tDCS study on the behavioral results for the&#xD;
      improvement of spelling abilities.&#xD;
