  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant rejection is one of the most important complications of heart transplantation and&#xD;
      requires a specific monitoring, including regular and invasive endomyocardial biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average hospital cost of a biopsy has been estimated at 3 297 dollars in United States.&#xD;
      In France, the reimbursement rates by the Health Insurance for the corresponding stays vary&#xD;
      from 682 to 25 865 euros, according to the finding of a rejection and its severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AlloMap® is a non-invasive blood test that can identify patients with low probability of&#xD;
      moderate to severe acute cell transplant rejection. The non-inferiority of the use of the&#xD;
      AlloMap® test has been demonstrated in comparison of the usual care in terms of diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute cellular rejection in a randomized study conducted in the United States. Following this&#xD;
      study, the ISHLT (International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation) made&#xD;
      recommendations advocating its use for these patients between 6 months and 5 years after&#xD;
      heart transplantation. This new test could be an alternative to systematic biopsies usually&#xD;
      performed to patients whose allograft function is stable, but it is very expensive since the&#xD;
      analysis of a blood sample cost 2 000 euros pre-tax in France. This cost has to be compared&#xD;
      with the current patient care. By replacing biopsies performed systematically, the test&#xD;
      should reduce the costs of full and day hospitalizations for the realization of biopsies but&#xD;
      also the costs associated with their possible complications. In addition, it can be expected&#xD;
      that its use provides a benefit to the patient in terms of quality of life. Indeed, the&#xD;
      achievement of a biopsy may cause significant stress and anxiety for the patient, due to&#xD;
      discomfort, pain and potential complications that may be severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this day, no medico-economic assessment has been conducted to prove the interest of the&#xD;
      use of AlloMap® compared to systematic realization of endomyocardial biopsies. The purpose of&#xD;
      the CUPIDON study is to assess the effectiveness of the use of the AlloMap® test for&#xD;
      monitoring heart transplant patients in the context of usual care and in accordance with&#xD;
      international recommendations. AlloMap® will be used and compared to the current surveillance&#xD;
      strategy by endomyocardial biopsies from 6 months to 36 months after heart transplantation.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of this test for the diagnosis of acute cellular&#xD;
      transplant rejection would avoid the costs of a large number of biopsies, while increasing&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients related to their health.&#xD;
