      CCM lesional iron deposition assessed by validated quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)&#xD;
      MRI studies in patients who suffered a symptomatic bleed within the preceding one year.&#xD;
      Subjects will also be assessed by lesional and brain vascular permeability MRI using dynamic&#xD;
      contrast enhanced quantitative perfusion (DCEQP) and a number of clinical evaluation tools.&#xD;
      Subjects shall be followed for 2 years from randomization, the period of highest likelihood&#xD;
      of rebleed after a recent CCM hemorrhage. Subjects will undergo clinical and MRI evaluations&#xD;
      at baseline, and at 12 and 24 months during the study period. Enrolled subjects and the&#xD;
      treating team will be blinded to treatment group allocation.&#xD;

    <description>Each patient contributes two outcome measurements (at year 1 and year 2) based on intention-to-treat. Evaluation of the intervention on this outcome will be performed as a time-averaged difference between two arms using a repeated measures analysis implemented as an unadjusted linear mixed model. Patients with outcome measurements in both periods will be included in the initial intention-to-treat analysis. In cases with multiple lesions, only QSM measurements in the lesion with initial hemorrhage (index lesion) shall be considered for the primary outcome assessment.</description>

          6. Statin therapy, for any indication, for more than 7 continuous days or greater than 14&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Known allergy or intolerance to statins&#xD;
&#xD;

             as baseline serum transaminases levels twice the upper range of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Previous diagnosis of skeletal muscle disorders of any cause (myopathy), or baseline&#xD;
             creatine kinase level five times the upper range of normal.&#xD;

             medications listed in the protocol.&#xD;

             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization) until subject&#xD;
             either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             site investigator, for at least 30 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to&#xD;
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated, including conditions&#xD;
             resulting in or precipitating myopathy (e.g. HIV, uncontrolled hypothyroidism).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. In the investigator's opinion, the patient is unstable, and would benefit from a&#xD;
             specific intervention rather than treatment with atorvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give written&#xD;
