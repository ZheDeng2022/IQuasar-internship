    <textblock>
      Given that LEO 80185 gel takes effect in the upper layer of the skin, it is important to&#xD;
      compare and examine the amount of the drug in the upper layer of the skin with that of&#xD;
      Dovobet® Ointment. Therefore, a dermatopharmacokinetic study will be conducted in healty&#xD;
      adult male volunteers to evaluate pharmacokinetics of LEO 80185 gel and Dovobet® Ointment in&#xD;
      the stratum corneum. In this trial, a single application of LEO 80185 gel and Dovobet®&#xD;
      ointment will be applied to multiple test sites on the back of healthy Japanese male adults&#xD;
      and the trial is designed to compare the amount of each of the active ingredients at steady&#xD;
      state or close-to-steady state between LEO 80185 gel and Dovobet® Ointment. The amount of&#xD;
      calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate in the stratum corneum will be assessed by use of&#xD;
      tape stripping.&#xD;

      The study consists of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot: The first part, known as the pilot study, will include 8 subjects and will&#xD;
      evaluate pharmacokinetic profile of LEO 80185 gel and Dovobet® Ointment by measuring the&#xD;
      amount of each of the active ingredients in the stratum corneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pivotal: The second part, known as the pivotal study, is designed to compare the amount of&#xD;
      each of the active ingredients at steady state or close-to-steady state between LEO 80185 gel&#xD;
      and Dovobet® Ointment. The number of subjects in the pivotal study and the number of&#xD;
      application sites for study medications will be based on the results of the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects included in the trial and design of trial is in line with previous&#xD;
      type of DPK trials in Japan and the Japanese guideline&#xD;
