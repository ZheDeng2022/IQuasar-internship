      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a single bolus dose of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      administered during bariatric surgery has any effect on the amount of narcotic pain&#xD;
      medications required by an individual after surgery. Patients who undergo weight loss surgery&#xD;
      will be randomized into two groups - group one -dexmedetomidine group and group two- control&#xD;
      group. Both groups will receive a standard anesthetic. Control group will receive weight&#xD;
      based dose of fentanyl (standard narcotic pain reliever), intravenous acetaminophen&#xD;
      (non-narcotic pain reliever), and 60ml saline. Experimental group will receive weight based&#xD;
      dose of fentanyl (standard narcotic pain reliever), intravenous acetaminophen (non-narcotic&#xD;
      pain reliever), and dexmedetomidine (given as 1mcg/kg over 10 minutes Intravenous). The&#xD;
      Patient will then awaken after surgery in post anesthetic recovery unit and be given a&#xD;
      patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with hydromorphone (long acting narcotic pain&#xD;
      reliever). The amount of hydromorphone used will be recorded by the PACU nurse to the&#xD;
      electronic health record ( routine practice) in the two groups and compared for pain medicine&#xD;
      requirements. Secondary endpoints will be Visual Analog Score (VAS) pain score, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, heart rate, blood pressure oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. All will be recorded&#xD;
      at 30,60,90,120 and 240 minutes in the electronic medical record in PACU and compared between&#xD;
      the two groups . All the data - Intra operative and Post -operative - Post Anesthesia Care&#xD;
      Unit ( PACU) data will be retrieved from the electronic Medical record (EMR). All&#xD;
      intra-operative data is automatically computed into the patients EMR. All PACU data is&#xD;
      routinely entered into the EMR by the PACU nurse including the PCA data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the postoperative opioid sparing effects of dexmedetomidine given as&#xD;
      single bolus dose intraoperatively. Dexmedetomidine is an agonist of Î±2-adrenergic receptors&#xD;
      sedative medication used by intensive care units and anesthesiologists and is unique in its&#xD;
      ability to provide sedation without causing respiratory depression. Recently, it has received&#xD;
      attention for its potential for additive analgesia. The study population will be patients&#xD;
      undergoing gastric bypass surgery. The study population of bariatric surgery patients was&#xD;
      chosen due to high prevalence of sleep apnea and Pickwickian component that can be worsened&#xD;
      with opioid analgesia in the postoperative period. The purpose of the study is to test&#xD;
      whether the use of a single bolus dose dexmedetomidine in addition to standard dose pain&#xD;
      regimen decreases postoperative narcotic requirements when compared to standard dose pain&#xD;
      regimen alone. The secondary purpose is to study whether single bolus dose dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      reduces respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic and mean blood pressure, patient PCA demand&#xD;
      bolus requests and VAS pain scores in the postoperative period. The overall goal of the study&#xD;
      is to establish evidence of dexmedetomidine's role in multimodal pain relief in the bariatric&#xD;
      surgery population with the possibility of other patient subgroups to follow&#xD;
