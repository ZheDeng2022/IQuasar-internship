  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 4,000 women undergo a mastectomy for breast cancer each year in the UK and&#xD;
      around 1,500 will have an immediate breast reconstruction. Approximately half of these ladies&#xD;
      will have an implant-based breast reconstruction, of which many have an &quot;implant-assisted&quot;&#xD;
      breast reconstruction with an Acellular Dermal Matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strattice™ is an Acellular Dermal Matrix (a pig skin product) made by Acelity. It is used to&#xD;
      cover and disguise the lower part of the breast implant. Acellular Dermal Matrices have only&#xD;
      been widely used for the last eight years and long-term outcomes for women who have had this&#xD;
      form of reconstruction are lacking. Despite this, it is one of the most commonly offered&#xD;
      methods of breast reconstruction in the UK for both ladies with a diagnosis of breast cancer&#xD;
      and in the risk-reduction setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess long-term outcomes of Strattice™-based breast&#xD;
      reconstructions in multiple Breast Surgery Centres across the UK. This will be a case-control&#xD;
      study comparing women who have had an immediate implant-based breast reconstruction with&#xD;
      Strattice™ (case) or without (control). This will be achieved by review and analysis of&#xD;
      retrospective data from patients who have undergone immediate breast reconstruction using&#xD;
      implants with or without Strattice™ following either a diagnosis breast cancer or for&#xD;
      risk-reduction. In addition there will be a prospective clinical assessment of the&#xD;
      reconstruction outcomes. Outcomes assessed will include complications, surgical&#xD;
      re-interventions and aesthetic results. These will be related to co-morbid conditions and&#xD;
      other risk factors. Data will also be collected on unplanned interventions associated with a&#xD;
      cost, if available.&#xD;

      Primary Outcome The primary outcome measure will be unexpected loss of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate short and long-term outcomes with Strattice™ including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-patient treatment costs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipsilateral Revision rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aesthetic outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast reconstruction softness (Tonometry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regional pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loco-regional recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect of radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications - (seroma drainage, skin necrosis/ wound breakdown)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients who have had an immediate implant-based breast reconstruction will be&#xD;
           identified from prospective databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be invited to enter the research study by post. The invitation letter will&#xD;
           include: an offer to take part in the study, a Patient Information Leaflet, a Stamped&#xD;
           addressed envelope and an Accept/Decline outcome form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If they fail to respond, patients will be re-contacted on one further occasion, in the&#xD;
           same manner, after approximately two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be invited to attend a clinical appointment at the Breast Surgery Centre&#xD;
           where their reconstruction was performed. Here they will see a clinical researcher in&#xD;
           the presence of a clinic nurse and consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked to undergo a clinical assessment, Tonometry (measurement of&#xD;
           breast reconstruction softness) and medical photography. The data obtained from this&#xD;
           will be anonymised and inputted into a database for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a postal questionnaire following the clinic visit asking them&#xD;
           about the &quot;Patient Reported Outcomes&quot; of their reconstruction. (This will not be&#xD;
           performed at the clinic visit in an attempt to avoid bias). They will receive a further&#xD;
           follow-up questionnaire 12 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The medical records of patients will be reviewed to assess outcomes including&#xD;
           complications from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a patient does not consent for the prospective part of the study, a retrospective&#xD;
           audit of their notes for implant loss, revisions and complications will be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All data will be collected on Case Report Forms. Study numbers will be allocated, and&#xD;
           linked-anonymised data inputted into a database on a NHS computer for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical records, including clinic letters, nursing records and anaesthetic charts will&#xD;
           be reviewed to collect data on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient demographics (age, BMI, comorbidities and smoking history at time of&#xD;
                surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical details (operation type, operation time, mastectomy weight, implant&#xD;
                size/type)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Details on cancer outcome and adjuvant therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-operative complications (including need for reoperation, prolonged healing,&#xD;
                loss of implant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional prospective data analysed will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire results&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tonometry (breast softness)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baker Capsular Contracture grade&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aesthetic outcome (using Likert score) This will be assessed by the clinical&#xD;
                researcher, and independently assessed using the medical photographs, with the&#xD;
                assessor blinded to the reconstruction technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Contracture Using the Baker Breast Contracture Scale, the researcher will&#xD;
      assess the Baker Grade for each breast to assess the level of capsular contracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baker Grade Parameters I the breast is normally soft and looks natural II the breast is a&#xD;
      little firm but looks normal III the breast is firm and looks abnormal IV the breast is hard,&#xD;
      painful, and looks abnormal&#xD;
&#xD;
