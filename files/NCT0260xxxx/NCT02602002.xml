    <textblock>
      This was a single centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, two-way cross-over&#xD;
      design study to assess the feasibility of pain PD tests and to determine the variability and&#xD;
      effects of a known analgesic drug (the opioid remifentanil) in South Korean healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

      Pain is an area of large unmet medical need and a priority disease area for GlaxoSmithKline.&#xD;
      Selection of new candidates for pain involves tests in animal models; however, their&#xD;
      predictive value may be limited. High risks are carried forward into Phase II Proof of&#xD;
      Concept (PoC) studies that require large financial and time commitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pain in Phase I studies can serve as a useful indicator of pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      activity of potential analgesic treatments to reduce development risks, help make decisions&#xD;
      about further compound progression, dose selection and design of clinical studies in pain&#xD;
      patients. GlaxoSmithKline's Pain &amp; Neurophysiology group at Clinical Unit Cambridge (CUC) has&#xD;
      developed a number of human pain models specifically tailored for GSK's portfolio and began&#xD;
      their implementation into clinical development. Some of these models have already been used&#xD;
      successfully to detect PD activity in Phase I [Chizh, 2007] Currently, for most candidates&#xD;
      selected by the neurology Centre for Excellence in Drug Discovery (CEDD, there are plans to&#xD;
      utilise human pain models as part of clinical development, including FTIH studies. Because of&#xD;
      the limited in-house capacities, there is an ongoing effort to identify a suitable external&#xD;
      group(s) to which some of the methodologies in pain models and PD assessments could be&#xD;
      transferred. Involving such external groups could also help access new patient groups, such&#xD;
      that Phase I and Phase II experimental assessments could be facilitated to provide early&#xD;
      indication of efficacy before large scale multi-centre trials are initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      South Korea has been identified as a country within the Asia-Pacific region to which&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline would like to collaborate more closely in terms of early phase clinical&#xD;
      trials, particularly First Time in Human studies. A satisfactory validation study will enable&#xD;
      us to use these methodologies in future pain studies in order to link early efficacy&#xD;
      assessments (Phase I) with future patient studies (Phase II) within South Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group that has been identified is the Clinical Trials Center of Seoul National University&#xD;
      Hospital. This site is being considered to perform a number of clinical studies of potential&#xD;
      new treatments for pain.&#xD;

          -  Has received over-the-counter (OTC) medicine within 48h before the first dosing day.&#xD;
             Subjects who have taken OTC medication may still be entered into the study, if, in the&#xD;
