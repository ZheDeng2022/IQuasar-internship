    <textblock>
      A multicentre multinational prospective management outcome study has recently proven the&#xD;
      safety of a diagnostic strategy combining clinical probability assessment with an&#xD;
      age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off, defined as a value of (age x 10) in patients &gt; 50 years, for&#xD;
      ruling out PE in outpatients, with a very low likelihood of subsequent symptomatic VTE.&#xD;
      Moreover, this study showed that such a strategy increased the diagnostic yield of D-dimers,&#xD;
      as it allowed ruling out PE without further investigation in a significantly higher&#xD;
      proportion of patients than when using standard cut-off, particularly so in patients 75 years&#xD;
      or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study is to confirm in a prospective cohort of &quot;real life&quot;&#xD;
      patients the usefulness of the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off to rule out PE in patients&#xD;
      presenting to the emergency department with suspected PE.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      PE diagnostic strategies Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequently suspected diagnosis in the&#xD;
      emergency room (ER) in patients presenting with shortness of breath and/or chest pain without&#xD;
      any obvious cause identified. Historically, PE diagnosis required a pulmonary angiography, a&#xD;
      costly and invasive procedure with associated morbidity and even mortality. Over the last 25&#xD;
      years, evolving diagnostic strategies have been developed and widely validated in prospective&#xD;
      multicentre management outcome studies, with the aim of confirming or excluding the diagnosis&#xD;
      of PE safely enough to avoid realising pulmonary angiography. Nowadays, PE diagnosis&#xD;
      therefore relies on diagnostic strategies, including sequential evaluation of clinical&#xD;
      probability, measurement of plasma D-dimer levels and most often CT pulmonary angiogram&#xD;
      (CTPA), rather than a standalone test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial and essential step is the assessment of pre-test clinical probability, either by&#xD;
      gestalt or by validated clinical prediction rules (Wells rule of Geneva score). This initial&#xD;
      evaluation separates patients into different groups of PE prevalence, and thus directly&#xD;
      influences the negative and positive predictive values of the diagnostic tests used in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-dimer measurement Plasma D-dimer measurement has been extensively evaluated for the&#xD;
      exclusion of PE in outpatients. The diagnostic usefulness of D-dimers lies in their high&#xD;
      sensitivity and hence their capacity to exclude PE when below a certain cut-off (&quot;negative&#xD;
      D-dimers&quot;) without further investigations. Indeed, in patients with &quot;non-high&quot; clinical&#xD;
      probability (low and intermediate groups in a three category score or unlikely group in a&#xD;
      dichotomic score), a highly sensitive negative D-dimer test safely excludes PE without&#xD;
      additional investigations. Sensitive D-dimer tests include those performed by the ELISA&#xD;
      technique (median sensitivity 99%; Vidas®, Stratus®, AxSYM®) and by quantitative latex&#xD;
      methods (median sensitivity 96%; STA Liatest®, Tinaquant®). In patients with high clinical&#xD;
      probability or likely PE, the negative predictive value of even a highly sensitive D-dimer&#xD;
      test will be insufficient to exclude PE. D-dimer measurement is thus not used in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance of D-dimers in elderly patients The specificity of the ELISA and quantitative&#xD;
      latex D-dimer tests for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is limited, ranging from 35 to 40%.&#xD;
      Indeed, D-dimers increase in various clinical situations, including cancer, infectious or&#xD;
      inflammatory states, pregnancy or during post-operative periods, but also with age, leading&#xD;
      to reduced specificity of the test in elderly patients. In other words, the probability of&#xD;
      having a negative test result is reduced, so that the number of patients needed to test (NNT)&#xD;
      to exclude one PE without further investigations is higher. Indeed, whereas PE can be ruled&#xD;
      out in presence of non-high clinical probability and negative D-dimers in one out of 3&#xD;
      outpatients presenting to the emergency room with suspected PE, it can be excluded in only&#xD;
      one out of 20 patients &gt; 80 years. As current diagnostic strategies for PE include imaging&#xD;
      (most often CTPA) in patients with positive D-dimers, lack of specificity of D-dimers in the&#xD;
      elderly leads to a high proportion of these patients undergoing CTPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off The question of a higher D-dimer cut-off in elderly patients was&#xD;
      raised a decade ago, but studies confirming the potential security of such a strategy by&#xD;
      retrospectively applying age-adjusted cut-offs to large prospective cohorts of consecutive&#xD;
      patients with suspected VTE were published between 2010 and 2012 and confirmed the safety of&#xD;
      using age-adjusted cut-offs on an overall population of several thousands of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A progressive age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off (agex10 microg/L in patients &gt; 50 years) was&#xD;
      retrospectively derived and validated in a sample of 1712 patients with suspected PE. The&#xD;
      retrospective validation study showed that the age-adjusted cut-off could increase by around&#xD;
      20% the number of patients in whom the D-dimer test was considered negative, without&#xD;
      increasing the proportion of false-negative results when compared to the standard cut-off&#xD;
      (&lt;500 microg/L). The increase in the diagnostic yield of D-dimers was particularly pronounced&#xD;
      in patients over 80 years, as the age-adjusted cut-off allowed an increase in the proportion&#xD;
      of &quot;negative&quot; D-dimers from 9% to 21%, without any false negative result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This progressive age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off has been prospectively validated in the&#xD;
      ADJUST-PE study, a large multicentre multinational (19 centres in Belgium, France, the&#xD;
      Netherlands, and Switzerland) management outcome study published at the beginning of this&#xD;
      year. All consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department with clinically&#xD;
      suspected PE were assessed by a sequential diagnostic work-up using clinical probability&#xD;
      assessment (by one of the two following scores: simplified, revised Geneva score or the&#xD;
      two-level Wells score for PE), highly sensitive D-dimer measurement (ELISA or&#xD;
      immuno-turbidimetric assays), and CTPA. Patients with a D-dimer level below their&#xD;
      age-adjusted cut-off did not undergo further investigations and were thus left without&#xD;
      anticoagulant treatment and followed-up for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADJUST-PE study included a total of 3346 patients with suspected PE, from whom 22 were&#xD;
      excluded (D-dimers not performed in 21 and 1 consent withdrawal), leaving 3324 patients&#xD;
      included for the analysis. The subgroup of particular interest was of course patients having&#xD;
      D-dimer levels between 500 microg/L and their age-adjusted cut-off (n=337). None of these&#xD;
      patients was lost to follow-up and 6 patients received therapeutic anticoagulation for&#xD;
      another indication than VTE. Of the remaining 331, 7 died and 7 had suspected VTE. Only one&#xD;
      of these 14 events was adjudicated as confirmed VTE (nonfatal PE). The so-called&#xD;
      &quot;failure-rate&quot; of the age-adjusted cut-off was thus very low at 1 / 331 (0.3%; 95% CI&#xD;
      0.1%-1.7%), so that this strategy can be considered as very safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ADJUSt-PE study, the overall number of patients ≥ 75 years was 766, of whom 673 had&#xD;
      non-high clinical probability (87.9%). Among these 673 patients, the proportion of patients&#xD;
      with D-dimer levels &lt;500 microg/L was 43/673 (6.4%; 95% CI 4.8%-8.5%). Additional 157/673&#xD;
      patients (23.3%) had D-dimer levels below their age-adjusted cut-off. This means that among&#xD;
      the patients ≥ 75 years with suspected PE and non-high clinical probability, 200/673 (29.7%;&#xD;
      95% CI 26.4%-33.3%) had a &quot;negative&quot; D-dimer result when age-adjusted cut-off was used. After&#xD;
      excluding 5 of these patients who received anticoagulation for another indication, none of&#xD;
      the remaining 195 patients experienced confirmed VTE during the 3 month follow-up (0.0%; 95%&#xD;
      CI 0.0%-1.9%). The diagnostic yield of D-dimers was thus particularly increased by using an&#xD;
      age-adjusted cut-off in patients ≥ 75 years, as the number of patients needed to test to&#xD;
      exclude one PE diminished from 16 with conventional cut-off to 3.4 with age-adjusted cut-off,&#xD;
      a figure that corresponds to the NNT in the general population in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing the proportion of patients in whom PE can be ruled out based on clinical&#xD;
      probability assessment and D-dimer measurement without further testing is particularly&#xD;
      interesting in older patients. Indeed, the higher prevalence of renal failure in this&#xD;
      population increases the potential risk of contrast-induced nephropathy related to CTPA or&#xD;
      even contra-indicates this test, and ventilation-perfusion lung scan (which can be performed&#xD;
      in patients with severe renal failure) provides a high proportion of inconclusive results in&#xD;
      older patients. Moreover, ruling out PE based on clinical probability and a simple blood test&#xD;
      could contribute to reduce the time spent in the emergency department and the costs related&#xD;
      to PE diagnostic work-up. Indeed, a previous study had shown that D-dimer measurement with&#xD;
      conventional cut-off was highly cost-saving in patients less than 80 years, but not in&#xD;
      patients over 80 years. Using an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off dramatically increases the&#xD;
      proportion of patients in whom PE can be ruled out and is thus highly likely to reduce the&#xD;
      costs of PE diagnosis in the emergency department.&#xD;
