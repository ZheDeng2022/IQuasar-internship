    <textblock>
      ZetrOZ's Ultrasonic Diathermy device is intended for use as a portable and wearable medical&#xD;
      device which, when applied to various areas of the body applies Low Intensity Therapeutic&#xD;
      Ultrasound (LITUS) to deep tissues. This device is FDA-cleared for pain reduction, treatment&#xD;
      of muscle spasm and joint contracture, and increasing local circulation. This study will look&#xD;
      at the use of therapeutic ultrasound to relieve pain and reduce disability in subjects with&#xD;
      chronic low back pain, a subset of which will have chronic low back pain due to a herniated&#xD;
      disc, over an 8-week treatment period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Chronic low back pain, may be secondary to herniated nucleus pulposus&#xD;
             (HNP) or other causes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18-60 years of age, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain severity score of at least 4 for a minimum 5 days&#xD;
             over the 1 week Baseline Period prior to being randomized to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pain lasting &gt;3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has MRI from within 2 months prior to Screening (If no recent MRI is available, then&#xD;
             subject must agree to have MRI performed prior to randomization of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If pain is secondary to HNP: MRI within the last 2 months demonstrating the presence&#xD;
             of a herniated disc; herniated disc is laterally located and not centrally located;&#xD;
             herniated disc is not sequestered&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has the presence of radicular pain as assessed by a health care practitioner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is willing and able to self-administer treatment daily within their place of residence&#xD;
             or during normal daily activity, excluding bathing, showering, or other water&#xD;
             activities which may result in submersion of the study device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is maintained on a stable pain management regimen, which may include opioid and/or&#xD;
             non-opioid analgesic medications, but must be willing to keep dosage(s) stable through&#xD;
             the study period; any dose adjustments that the investigator feels are required during&#xD;
             the study period must be discussed with the study sponsor; and the use of any&#xD;
             medications must be documented in the subject's Medication Log.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing to discontinue any other interventional treatment modalities on the lower&#xD;
             back during the study period (e.g., transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,&#xD;
             electronic muscle stimulation, traditional ultrasound).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cannot successfully demonstrate the ability to put on and take off the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Displays any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;

             ability to understand and follow instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participated in a clinical trial for an investigational drug and/or agent within 30&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a malignancy in the treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection, open sores, or wounds in the treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has impaired sensation in the treatment area, such as caused by chemotherapy or&#xD;
             anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known neuropathy (disease of the brain or spinal nerves).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a hereditary disposition (tendency) for excessive bleeding (hemorrhage).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has peripheral artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has BMI ≥30&#xD;
