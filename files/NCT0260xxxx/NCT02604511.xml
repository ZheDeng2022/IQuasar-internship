  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called ibrutinib as a possible treatment for untreated&#xD;
      Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved ibrutinib as a form of treatment&#xD;
      for the patient specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ibrutinib has been under investigation in research studies in participants with recurrent&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), mantle&#xD;
      cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and prolymphocytic leukemia, and&#xD;
      WM. In a study of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory WM patients, response rates were high and&#xD;
      the treatment was well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prior studies suggest that ibrutinib may be a useful treatment strategy for untreated WM&#xD;
      patients. This study will test the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib as an option for&#xD;
      untreated WM patients. The study will also conduct genomic sequencing of malignant WM cells&#xD;
      before the start of treatment, and 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months afterwards. Genomic sequencing&#xD;
      is the analysis of the entire DNA structure from tumor and normal cells. The purpose of this&#xD;
      sequencing is to study which genetic changes effect how ibrutinib works. The results of these&#xD;
      studies could also help in better understanding the course of WM disease, and be applicable&#xD;
      to the development of other effective drug treatments.&#xD;
