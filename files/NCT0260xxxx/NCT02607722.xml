  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional study based on new data collection to gather real-world&#xD;
      information (i.e., data under routine medical practice) on safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Ofev® Capsules treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a baseline visit and follow-up visits at Week 4, 13, 26, 39, 52,&#xD;
      65, 78, 91 and 104 for patients who have newly initiated Ofev® Capsules. The patients will be&#xD;
      followed up until discontinuation of Ofev® Capsules treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an observational study, no specific treatment is mandated or withheld from the&#xD;
      patients. The choice of maintenance treatment for IPF must be according to regular medical&#xD;
      practice and at the discretion of the physician (i.e., no randomised assignment of patient to&#xD;
      treatment is performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients administrated Ofev® Capsules after the launch at the sites contracted with the&#xD;
      sponsor will be registered. The Case Report Forms (CRFs) of 1000 patients will be collected.&#xD;
      However the patient registration continues until the approval condition has been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in the subsequent follow-up will undergo regular observations. These&#xD;
      observations should be reported after approximately Week 4, 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91 and&#xD;
      104 since the initiation of Ofev® Capsules as long as they continue to receive the treatment.&#xD;
      Patients will not be followed any longer once they are reported to have discontinued the&#xD;
      Ofev® Capsules treatment.&#xD;
