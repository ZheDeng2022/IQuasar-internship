  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, prospective, observational, single arm, multicenter trial to identify the&#xD;
      population at high risk of overstimulation associated with signs and symptoms of PCOS and&#xD;
      examines the utility of 12.5 international units (IU) increment of Gonal-f® new pen for&#xD;
      individualized controlled ovarian stimulation (iCOS).&#xD;
