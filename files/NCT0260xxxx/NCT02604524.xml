  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biggest challenges for glycemic control during the day time involve meals and exercise&#xD;
      variations, which are impacted by age, fitness level, duration, intensity and history of&#xD;
      exercise. Meal variability has the benefit that meals are typically announced and quantified.&#xD;
      Glucose control around exercise, on the other hand, is more complicated if the patient&#xD;
      doesn't announce a change in activity level.&#xD;

      The object of this study is to evaluate the Closed-Loop Control (CLC) in an environment where&#xD;
      muscle glycogen is systematically depleted, glucose uptake systematically increased, and meal&#xD;
      sizes are naturally larger than normal: a week of camp at high altitude, with the concomitant&#xD;
      variable of oxygen consumption that this environment involves; during the winter, that will&#xD;
      expose and challenge the different components of the system during cold temperatures, and&#xD;
      with twice daily practice of physical activity designed to deplete glycogen reserves such as&#xD;
      skiing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to demonstrate the superiority of the CLC, also known as Artificial&#xD;
      Pancreas (AP), compared to the state-of-the art system available on the market:&#xD;
      Sensor-augmented pump (SAP). This system has shown to diminish hypoglycemic events by setting&#xD;
      the alarms on the continues glucose monitor (CGM) and taken action, such as performing&#xD;
      self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) and treating if it is confirm to be low.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: To be eligible for the study, a subject must meet the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Criteria for documented hyperglycemia (at least 1 must be met):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (C-peptide levels and antibody&#xD;
                  determinations are not required)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Criteria for requiring insulin at diagnosis (both criteria must be met):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Daily insulin therapy for ≥ 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Insulin pump therapy for ≥ 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age 10 - 25 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Avoidance of acetaminophen-containing medications (i.e. Tylenol) while wearing the&#xD;
             continuous glucose monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willingness to wear a continuous glucose sensor and physiological monitor for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
