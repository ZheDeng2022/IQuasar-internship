      Pregnancy complications like pre-eclampsia (PE), pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH),&#xD;
      intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm labor (PTL), (i.e. the major part of&#xD;
      complications in pregnancy) are related to an impaired endothelial function. Endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction accounts for altered vascular reactivity, activation of the coagulation cascade&#xD;
      and loss of vascular integrity. Nitric oxide (NO), a free radical molecule derived from&#xD;
      L-Arginine by NOS (Nitric Oxide Synthase), is an endogenous endothelium-derived relaxing&#xD;
      factor influencing endothelial function. In the placental circulation, endothelial release of&#xD;
      NO dilates the fetal placental vascular bed and thus ensures feto-maternal exchange. The&#xD;
      impaired endothelial function in pregnancy complications originates from production of&#xD;
      inflammatory and cytotoxic factors by the ischemic placenta and results in oxidative stress&#xD;
      and an altered bioavailability of NO. Measurement of endothelial function using peripheral&#xD;
      artery tonometry and determination of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and RNS (reactive&#xD;
      nitrogen species) using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) gives an idea of the oxidative&#xD;
      stress that took place and the degree of endothelial dysfunction that occurred during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION. In normal pregnancy vascular remodelling of the maternal uterine spiral&#xD;
      arteries occurs. Trophoblast cells invade the spiral arterioles within the first 12 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy and replace the muscular wall of the vessels converting them into wide bore, low&#xD;
      resistance, large capacity vessels, a process normally completed by 20 weeks gestation. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis of generalized endothelial dysfunction in complicated pregnancies is subdivided&#xD;
      into two phases. The first phase exists of a poor trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries&#xD;
      during the placentation process, causing failure to transform the placental bed arteries from&#xD;
      high to low resistance vessels. This results in local ischemia, reperfusion damage and&#xD;
      oxidative stress. The local damage activates the second phase where enhanced production of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic factors and oxidative stress products results in systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      endothelial activation and decreased endothelial nitric oxide. In case the endothelial damage&#xD;
      is most outspoken, thrombotic micro-angiopathy is induced with platelet-fibrin thrombi in&#xD;
      micro-vessels. The angiopathy results in consumption of circulating platelets, causes&#xD;
      hemolysis in affected micro-vessels and reduces portal blood flow in the liver, finally&#xD;
      resulting in periportal necrosis, a condition seen in severe pre-eclampsia (PE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are present early in pregnancy&#xD;
           when pregnancy complications will develop later on.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are not entirely independent from each&#xD;
           other and can be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxidative stress can be reduced and endothelial function can be improved by&#xD;
           interventions that will reduce the risk of developing pregnancy complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus: measurement and integration in an algorithm of oxidative stress and endothelial&#xD;
      function in early pregnancy will allow us to determine which pregnancies will benefit from&#xD;
      preventive interventions. This selection will optimize targeted interventions on high risk&#xD;
      pregnancies without overtreatment of others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study design 1.1. Single center prospective longitudinal study For the first part of the&#xD;
           study, the investigators propose a prospective longitudinal design. Pregnant women in&#xD;
           their first trimester of pregnancy, will be eligible and will be followed throughout&#xD;
           pregnancy and until 6 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Multicenter matched case-control study The second part is a case control study&#xD;
           where patients with pregnancies complicated by PIH / PE / preterm birth / IUGR will be&#xD;
           compared to normotensive controls, matched for maternal and gestational age, parity,&#xD;
           smoking behavior, BMI and ethnic group. Patients will be followed throughout (the rest&#xD;
           of their) pregnancy and until 6 months postpartum. The patients in this study will be&#xD;
           included in UZA, Erasmus MC, Maastricht UMC, ZOL (Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of investigations 2.1 Endothelial function (RHI): The reactive hyperemia&#xD;
           index is measured using peripheral artery tonometry (PAT) (endoPAT®, Itamar). The&#xD;
           tonometer consists of a finger- mounted probe plethysmograph, capable of sensing volume&#xD;
           changes in the vessels of the index fingers. It is a non-operator-dependent and thus&#xD;
           reproducible technique. Sensors are placed at the fingertips of the index fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suprasystolic occlusion of the non-dominant upper arm, at 200mmHg or 60 mmHg above systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, will be obtained using a cuff. After upper-arm occlusion the response to&#xD;
      reactive hyperemia will be measured. The contralateral (dominant) arm is used as control, to&#xD;
      correct for systemic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Arterial stiffness (PWV, PWA): Pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis will be&#xD;
      calculated using the Sphygmocor system ® (Atcor Medical, West Ryde, Australia). To calculate&#xD;
      PWV, two pressure waveforms must be measured at a known distance apart and the distance&#xD;
      between measurement sites is divided by the propagation time. Aortic PWV is measured by&#xD;
      carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV) as it is the 'gold standard' measurement of the stiffness of the&#xD;
      aorta. Measurements of cfPWV will be performed using a pressure tonometer to transcutaneously&#xD;
      record the pressure pulse waveform in the underlying artery. The tonometer contains a&#xD;
      micromanometer that provides a very accurate recording of the pressure within the artery. The&#xD;
      carotid and femoral PWV will be assessed by gently compressing respectively the carotid&#xD;
      artery and the femoral artery with the tip of the tonometer at the site of maximal pulsation.&#xD;
      The Sphygmocor device will automatically calculate the cfPWV. PWA will calculate AIx by&#xD;
      placing the tonometer at the radial artery (site of maximum pulsation). A generalized&#xD;
      transfer function will derive the aortic pressure waveform from the radial artery waveform.&#xD;
      From the aortic pressure waveform, the augmentation pressure (AP) and augmentation index&#xD;
      (AIx) can be calculated. The AP (ΔP) is defined as the height of the late systolic peak above&#xD;
      the inflection point on the waveform. The AIx is defined as AP expressed as a percentage of&#xD;
      the aortic PP. As AIx is affected by heartrate, it will be standardized to a heart rate of 75&#xD;
      bmp (AIx-75).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Pulsatility index uterine artery (PI UA) and fetal biometry: Uterine artery Doppler&#xD;
      examinations will be performed using trans-abdominal color directed pulsed wave Doppler&#xD;
      (Voluson, GE Healthcare Technologies, USA). PI of both uterine arteries will be obtained on&#xD;
      either side of the cervix before 14 weeks' gestation and at the apparent crossover with the&#xD;
      external iliac arteries after 14 weeks. At the same moment basic fetal biometry parameters&#xD;
      will be measured: bi-parietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur&#xD;
      length and expected fetal weight using Hadlocks formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 NLR and MPV: Performing a complete blood count, NLR, MPV and platelet count will be&#xD;
      obtained using a ADVIA 120 Hematology System (Siemens healthcare, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Automated blood pressure measurement: SBP (systolic blood pressure), DBP (diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure) and MAP (mean arterial pressure) after 10 minutes rest in a sitting position, will&#xD;
      be measured using a Mindray VS 900 monitor (Mindray, China).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Oxidative stress 2.6.1 Electron paramagnetic resonance: NO and O2∙- EPR (electron&#xD;
      paramagnetic resonance) is derived from magnetic resonance spectroscopy and uses microwave&#xD;
      radiation to detect molecules with an unpaired electron number, like radicals. When an&#xD;
      magnetic field is created by the EPR spectrometer, all radicals will align. The EPR&#xD;
      spectrometer sends out a radio frequent microwave, causing the electrons to jump from a low&#xD;
      to a high energy state. This energy absorption can be measured and is directly correlated to&#xD;
      the amount of free radicals in the sample. A 'spin trap' will be added to scavenge the very&#xD;
      reactive radicals and to prolong their half live. The concentration of NO will be determined&#xD;
      using an Iron-DETC (Fe(II)DETC2 (iron(II)diethyldithiocarbamaat) solution. The spin probe for&#xD;
      the determination of O2∙- (superoxide) in maternal serum is CMH&#xD;
      (1-Hydroxy-3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine) and in placental tissue this is&#xD;
      ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). Vitamin C has an anti-oxidative effect and is abundantly present&#xD;
      in the human body. O2∙- reacts easily with vitamin C to form the ascorbic radical. This&#xD;
      ascorbic radical is a measure for the O2∙- concentration in placental tissue. Placental&#xD;
      tissue will be investigated at the time of delivery, maternal serum at week 9, week 28, at&#xD;
      delivery and 6 months post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6.2 Western blot analyse: ONOO-, eNOS en iNOS NO and O2∙- react to form ONOO-. The ONOO-&#xD;
      production will be indirectly measured in placental tissue via tyrosine nitration.&#xD;
      Nitrotyrosine arises when ONOO- reacts with tyrosine in proteins and can be quantified in&#xD;
      placental tissue with Western blotting using anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies. NO is formed out&#xD;
      of L-Arginine by NOS (Nitric Oxide Synthase). This reaction is regulated by VEGF (Vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor), an endothelial mitogen that has an important function in the&#xD;
      proliferation of endothelial cells and in angiogenesis. VEGF stimulates eNOS (endothelial&#xD;
      NOS) and induces therefore NO production. Placental ischemia will increase VEGF-production&#xD;
      and thus raise NO-production, as an compensatory mechanism to guarantee sufficient&#xD;
      feto-maternal transfusion. In an oxidative environment, the lack of NOS-stabilizing factors&#xD;
      results in NOS-uncoupling. NOS-coupling causes a shift from NO production to O2∙- production.&#xD;
      This maintains an oxidative setting. iNOS (inducible NOS) production is induced by cytokines&#xD;
      and endotoxins during inflammatory conditions. Monoclonal antibodies will determine&#xD;
      concentrations of eNOS and iNOS in placental tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample size calculation 1.1. Single center prospective longitudinal study For the&#xD;
           physiologic study of the RHI in pregnancy the investigators calculated that for a 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval, a population standard deviation of 0.5 (as described in other&#xD;
           populations for RHI) and a tolerable standard error of the mean (SEM) value of 0.1, 97&#xD;
           women have to be followed. Taking at least a 10% dropout into account the starting&#xD;
           sample size will be 110 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Multicenter matched case-control study In a pilot study by Yinon [Yinon, 2006] the&#xD;
           reactive hyperemia index (RHI) in normotensive pregnancies was 1.8, and in PE 1.5; in&#xD;
           most populations standard deviation is 0.5. For 80% power and a two sided α = 0.05 and&#xD;
           considering a 0.3 difference clinically relevant, the sample size for each group would&#xD;
           be 44; which will be considered the sample size for the cross-sectional study comparing&#xD;
           PE (44), PIH (44), IUGR (44) and preterm birth (44) with normotensive controls (44).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Descriptive statistics and data analysis 2.1. Single center prospective longitudinal&#xD;
           study For the physiologic study of the RHI in pregnancy the investigators will calculate&#xD;
           the reference values and 95% confidence interval. Longitudinal data will be plotted and&#xD;
           a linear mixed-effects model with random intercept will be fitted. Percentiles for RHI&#xD;
           and PWV will be calculated based on this model. Correlation coefficients between&#xD;
           baseline RHI, PWV, UA Doppler PI, fetal biometry, NLR, MPV, MAP, birth-weight percentile&#xD;
           and EDCs will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Multicenter matched case-control study RHI, PWV, UA Doppler PI, fetal biometry, NLR,&#xD;
      MPV, MAP, birth-weight and EDCs and other continuous variables in hypertensive versus non&#xD;
      hypertensive pregnancies will be tested for normality using the Shapiro Wilk Test. If there&#xD;
      is normality, they will be expressed as mean, standard deviations and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals and compared using two sided T test. If not, they will be expressed as median and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges and compared using Mann Whitney U Test.&#xD;
