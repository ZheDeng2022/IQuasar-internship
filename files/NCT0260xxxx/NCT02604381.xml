      The primary objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of alpha-D Glucosamine&#xD;
      Sulfate/Standardized Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaf versus a comparator product on&#xD;
      osteoarthritis pain as assessed by the between group change in WOMAC™ Osteoarthritis Index&#xD;
      Pain Subscale using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores in subjects with osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
      knee.&#xD;
