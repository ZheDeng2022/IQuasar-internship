    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the management of subjects with Standard of Care (SOC) when admitted to&#xD;
      the Emergency Department (ED) with hyperkalemia (potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L). Demographics&#xD;
      and medical history data, including previous ED visits and/or hospital admissions for&#xD;
      hyperkalemia and reason for current ED admission, will be recorded. Subjects who receive an&#xD;
      intervention/treatment for hyperkalemia will have study-related potassium values determined&#xD;
      at 30 minutes, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the start of treatment. Subjects who receive no&#xD;
      intervention/treatment during the initial 4-hour period will have a study-related potassium&#xD;
      value determined 4 hours after the baseline potassium measurement. Available data obtained as&#xD;
      part of SOC management will include physical examinations, vital signs, fluid intake and&#xD;
      urine output, ECGs, clinical laboratory data, and results of chest x-rays. Data regarding the&#xD;
      subject's chief complaint upon admission to the ED, the possible cause of the subject's&#xD;
      hyperkalemia, and admitting and discharge diagnosis will be recorded; the subject's overall&#xD;
      discharge summary will also be collected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the management of subjects with Standard of Care (SOC) when admitted to&#xD;
      the Emergency Department (ED) with hyperkalemia (potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L). If the&#xD;
      initial SOC potassium value is suspect, a second confirmatory SOC sample should be obtained&#xD;
      and must be ≥ 5.5 mmol/L to continue study participation. It is acceptable for the site to&#xD;
      use a point of care analyzer to obtain SOC potassium if this is the ED's standard practice.&#xD;
      Demographics and medical history data, including previous ED visits and/or hospital&#xD;
      admissions for hyperkalemia and reason for current ED admission, will be recorded. If a&#xD;
      baseline study-related potassium value determined prior to the first intervention/treatment&#xD;
      is unable to be obtained, the SOC potassium value that qualified the subject for entry into&#xD;
      the study will be used as the subject's baseline. Enrollment of subjects with baseline&#xD;
      potassium values &lt; 6.0 mmol/L will be limited to a maximum of 50 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who receive an intervention/treatment for hyperkalemia (eg, intravenous [IV]&#xD;
      calcium, insulin/glucose, beta2-agonists, diuretics, IV bicarbonate, sodium polystyrene&#xD;
      sulfonate (SPS), dialysis and/or other intervention for hyperkalemia) will have study-related&#xD;
      potassium values drawn at 30 minutes, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the start of treatment.&#xD;
      Subjects who receive no intervention/treatment during the initial 4-hour period will have a&#xD;
      study-related potassium value drawn 4 hours after the baseline potassium measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timing of each intervention/treatment and the collection of recordable outcomes following&#xD;
      admission to the ED will be recorded, together with the procedure followed, as well as dose&#xD;
      and route of administration. In addition concomitant medications will be collected from 14&#xD;
      days prior to ED admission and will continue until discharge from the ED. If the subject is&#xD;
      admitted into other care (eg, hospital, ICU, observational unit, etc), post-ED concomitant&#xD;
      medication collection will be performed for up to 7 days following admission to that unit or&#xD;
      until discharge from that unit, if earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recordable outcomes will be limited to pulmonary edema, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation,&#xD;
      pulseless electrical activity arrest, new clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
      changes (including but not limited to severe bradycardia, advanced heart block, bundle branch&#xD;
      block, tachycardia [&gt;100 bpm]), palpitations, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal-related&#xD;
      events (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and any other event deemed significant by the&#xD;
      investigator. In addition, recordable outcomes requiring positive-pressure ventilation,&#xD;
      central venous access, intubation, chest compressions, IV vasopressors, IV vasodilators, IV&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmics, IV fluid bolus, and/or emergency dialysis or resulting in death will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available data obtained as part of SOC management will include physical examinations, vital&#xD;
      signs, fluid intake and urine output, ECGs, clinical laboratory data, and results of chest&#xD;
      x-rays. Data regarding the subject's chief complaint upon admission to the ED, the possible&#xD;
      cause of the subject's hyperkalemia, and admitting and discharge diagnosis will be recorded;&#xD;
      the subject's overall discharge summary will also be collected. As applicable, dates and&#xD;
      times will be recorded for the following: ED admission, hospital admission, intensive care&#xD;
      unit admission, observation unit admission, step down admission, regular floor admission,&#xD;
      discharge (from any and all admissions), dialysis, Do Not Resuscitate order, death, and any&#xD;
      other event deemed significant by the investigator. If feasible, billing information and/or&#xD;
      Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes and/or Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APC)&#xD;
      associated with the ED visit and interventions/treatments will be collected.&#xD;
