  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing rates of obesity over the last few decades have led to growing demand for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, which may resulted in decreased comorbidities and improved patient&#xD;
      outcomes. Laparoscopic bariatric surgery has several clinical benefits in terms of improved&#xD;
      quality of analgesia, reduced pulmonary complications, enhanced recovery of bowel function,&#xD;
      less immune suppression, and shortened duration of hospital stay than open laparotomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some investigators reported delayed return of bowel function for approximately two days after&#xD;
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery, despite it occurred one day earlier than after open&#xD;
      laparotomy. This potentially can lengthen the duration of hospital stay after bariatric&#xD;
      procedures. With the impeding cost of health care in the developing countries, safely&#xD;
      reducing length of stay is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other investigators reported early return of bowel movements during the first postoperative&#xD;
      day in 65% of patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery due to reduced morphine&#xD;
      use with implementation of a multimodal analgesia strategy including ketorolac, and&#xD;
      propoxyphene hydrochloride/acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine was investigated in several studies for its use in multi-modal management&#xD;
      strategies to reduce postoperative pain and opioid use and enhance recovery. A recent&#xD;
      Cochrane review including 45 trials demonstrated that systemic administration of lidocaine&#xD;
      was associated with reduced pain scores at most of 'early time points' in patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic abdominal surgery (MD -1.14, 95% CI -1.51 to -0.78; low-quality evidence),&#xD;
      shorter times to first flatus (MD -5.49 hours, 95% CI -7.97 to -3.00; low-quality evidence)&#xD;
      and first bowel movement (MD -6.12 hours, 95% CI -7.36 to -4.89; low-quality evidence), and&#xD;
      less risk of paralytic ileus (risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.99; low-quality&#xD;
      evidence). However, no evidence of effect was found for lidocaine on shortening the time to&#xD;
      first defecation. This low-quality evidence may be related to the heterogeneity between the&#xD;
      studies in respect to the optimal dose, timing and duration of the administration of&#xD;
      intravenous lidocaine.&#xD;

      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing the need for enhanced bowel recovery for patients undergoing laparoscopic&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, the investigators hypothesize that perioperative administration of low&#xD;
      rather than high intravenous infusion rates of lidocaine can achieve early postoperative&#xD;
      restoration of bowel motility at lower plasma levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to the best of the investigators' knowledge there is no study addressed the effects of&#xD;
      perioperative administration of systemic lidocaine on postoperative recovery of bowel&#xD;
      function in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to compare the effects of perioperative administration of escalating doses of&#xD;
      intravenous lidocaine (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg/h) on the perioperative changes in hemodynamic,&#xD;
      pain scores, and plasma lidocaine concentrations, postoperative recovery of bowel function,&#xD;
      cumulative morphine use, hospital length of stay, and lidocaine related adverse effects in&#xD;
      obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgeries under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five minutes before induction of general anesthesia, participants will be allocated randomly&#xD;
      into four groups by drawing sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing a&#xD;
      software-generated randomization code to receive an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mL/kg of either&#xD;
      saline 0.9% or lidocaine 1.5% solution followed by a continuous infusion 0.1 mL/kg/h of&#xD;
      Saline 0.9% or lidocaine 1%, 1.5% or 2% solution which will be continued for 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery. All medications in the study protocol will be based on the dosing body weight [ideal&#xD;
      body weight (IBW) + 0.4 × (actual body weight-IBW)]. All study solutions looked identical and&#xD;
      will be prepared by a local pharmacy. All staff in the operating room will be unaware of&#xD;
      patient allocation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative management&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent anesthesiologist who will not be involved in the study will instruct the&#xD;
      participants preoperatively about the use of patient controlled analgesia and visual analogue&#xD;
      scale to assess the severity of postoperative pain (0 mm for no pain and100 mm for worst&#xD;
      imaginable pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic management will be standardized. Oral ranitidine 150 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg&#xD;
      will be administered the night before and 60 min before arrival in the operating room and&#xD;
      subcutaneous enoxaparin 60 mg will be administered 12 h before the scheduled operation for&#xD;
      prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's monitoring includes electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, plethysmography variability index (PVI) and capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following pre-oxygenation, in all participants, anesthesia will be induced with fentanyl 2-3&#xD;
      ug/kg and propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg will be administered to facilitate&#xD;
      tracheal intubation. Anesthesia will be initially maintained with 0.7-1.2 minimum alveolar&#xD;
      concentrations (MAC) of sevoflurane in combination with air (1 L/min) and oxygen (1 L/min)&#xD;
      mixture to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) are ≤20% of&#xD;
      the baseline values. Fentanyl 0.5 ug/kg increments will be administered when the MAP and HR&#xD;
      are ≥20% of the baseline values despite a MAC of sevoflurane ≥1.0. Rocuronium 0.1 mg/kg, will&#xD;
      be used to maintain surgical relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lungs will be initially ventilated in pressure-controlled mode to deliver a tidal volume of 8&#xD;
      ml/kg of predicted body weight (0.919 × (height in cm - 152.4) + 45.5 for women or 50 for&#xD;
      men) at an I/E ratio of 1:2 and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.&#xD;
      Respiratory rate will be adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (ETCO2)&#xD;
      between 35 and 40 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations will be performed by the same surgeons. During CO2 pneumoperitoneum, the&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure will be maintained at 12-14 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants position will be changed from supine to a 40° reverse Trendelenburg position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, intraoperative fluid management was guided by a goal directed therapy&#xD;
      algorithm using the PVI to guide fluid responsiveness. Hemodynamic control is standardized&#xD;
      according to the investigators' protocol. Hypotension (defined as MAP value &lt;25% of the&#xD;
      baseline value on two consecutive readings within 3 min), not responding to decrease the&#xD;
      sevoflurane MAC to 0.7 and a 5 ml/kg mL Ringer lactate or Acetate bolus over 5 min, will be&#xD;
      treated with intravenous boluses of ephedrine, 3 mg or norepinephrine, 5 ug IV. Hypertension&#xD;
      (defined as &gt;20% increase in mean baseline MAP) will be treated by deepening anesthesia and&#xD;
      administering doses of fentanyl, or labetalol, 20 mg. Tachycardia (defined as &gt;20% increase&#xD;
      in mean baseline HR) will be treated with esmolol, 20 mg. Bradycardia (HR &lt;45) persisting for&#xD;
      &gt;2 min will be treated with glycopyrrolate, 0.2 mg IV, boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous ondansetron, 4 mg IV, will be given for all participants for prevention of&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting. Before wound closure, bupivacaine 0.25% will be&#xD;
      infiltrated at all portals, and residual neuromuscular block will be antagonized with&#xD;
      neostigmine, 50 µg/kg IV, and glycopyrrolate, 10 µg/kg IV. After completing surgery,&#xD;
      sevoflurane will be discontinued and infusion of study medication will be continued for 24 h&#xD;
      after the wound closure. Times from discontinuation of sevoflurane to eye opening, obeying&#xD;
      simple commands (e.g., open mouth, squeeze hand) and tracheal extubation will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesic regime will be standardized in all participants including 30 mg of&#xD;
      intravenous ketorolac every 6 h and paracetamol 1 g IV every 6 h and rescue doses of&#xD;
      intravenous meperidine 25 mg. Participants will be discharged from the post-anesthesia care&#xD;
      unit when they have a modified Aldrete score levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous fluids will run at 40 mL/h on the night of surgery and will be discontinued 24 h&#xD;
      after surgery. Little attention is paid to urine output or oliguria in the absence of&#xD;
      abnormal vital signs. Strict parameters for fluid boluses the night of surgery are in place&#xD;
      based on hypotension and tachycardia. Active bedside mobilisation will be enforced for the&#xD;
      first time the evening after surgery and assisted ambulation the morning after surgery at&#xD;
      least twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for hospital discharge are as follows: absence of nausea and vomiting in the last 24&#xD;
      h, return of bowel function (daily defecation) and toleration of full diet, no to minimal&#xD;
      pain (VAS less than 4), afebrile and no surgically associated morbidity (fever, wound&#xD;
      dehiscence, wound infection, anastomotic leak, abscess). These variables will be recorded by&#xD;
      a blind assessor to the allocation, every day at 10:00, 14:00 and 18:00 h. Patients ready for&#xD;
      discharge after 14:00 h will be discharged on the following morning. All drains have to be&#xD;
      removed before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blindness&#xD;
&#xD;
      All staff in the operating room will be unaware of patient allocation group. Patients will be&#xD;
      unaware about their allocation group. All study solutions looked identical and will be&#xD;
      prepared by a local pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers: An independent anesthesiologist who will not be involved in the study will&#xD;
      instruct the patients preoperatively about the use of patient controlled analgesia and visual&#xD;
      analogue scale to assess the severity of postoperative pain (0 mm for no pain and100 mm for&#xD;
      worst imaginable pain) and will give the anesthetics and will be instructed to avoid using&#xD;
      local anesthetics. An independent investigator involved in the assessment of the data and&#xD;
      participants will be blind to the group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be tested for normality using the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Repeated-measures&#xD;
      analysis of variance will be used for serial changes in the continuous data at different&#xD;
      times after administration of study solution and the differences will be then corrected by&#xD;
      post-hoc Bonferroni correction test. Fisher's exact test will be used for categorical data.&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Wilcoxon rank sum t-tests will be used for&#xD;
      comparisons of the non-continuous data. Categorical data will be expressed as number (%),&#xD;
      ordinal data will be expressed as median [range] and continuous data will be expressed as&#xD;
      mean ± SD. A value of P&lt;0.05 is considered to represent statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis and sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a previous study, the time to the return of bowel movements after laparoscopic&#xD;
      bariatric surgery was normally distributed with a mean of 70 hours and a standard deviation&#xD;
      of 22 hours. An a priori analysis indicated that 45 patients in each group would be&#xD;
      sufficient to detect a 20% reduction in mean time to return of bowel movements, with a type I&#xD;
      error of 0.005 (0.05/10 possible comparisons) and a power of 80%. The investigators added 15%&#xD;
      more patients to account for drop-outs during the study.&#xD;
