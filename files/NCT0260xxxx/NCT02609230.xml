      This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of single agent ONC201 in patients with advanced solid tumors or multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This phase 1 study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase&#xD;
      II dose (RP2D) of ONC201, when given as a single agent, to patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors or multiple myeloma, in two dose schedules including every 3 weeks and weekly. For the&#xD;
      first arm (A), dose escalation will use the following single patient dose-escalation cohorts&#xD;
      based on 'Design 4' proposed by Simon and colleagues: 125, 250, 500, and 625 mg. Following&#xD;
      completion of Arm A dose escalation, subsequent cohorts will be tested in a minimum of 3&#xD;
      patients. The Arm B dose cohort will consist of dose levels administered once every one week&#xD;
      (planned dosing of 250, 375, 500 and 625 mg). Dependent on PK and PD data, or emerging&#xD;
      efficacy data, additional dose levels in Arm A or Arm B may be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Arm A, single patient cohorts will be used until the first instance of DLT or the second&#xD;
      instance of grade 2 toxicity. Either occurrence will lead to immediate use of a modified 3+3&#xD;
      design and ~40% dose increments. Arm B will use a 3 + 3 design for all cohorts. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that 16 - 48 evaluable patients in the dose escalation and an additional 17&#xD;
      patients in the expansion phase will be enrolled into this study over the course of 2 years.&#xD;
      Patients will receive ONC201 in 3-week cycles until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, or the patient discontinues for any other reason. The maximum duration of treatment&#xD;
      will be 12 months unless it is determined that a patient would derive benefit from continued&#xD;
      therapy beyond 12 months.&#xD;
