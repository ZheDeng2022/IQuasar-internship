      WorkUp is a prospective cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care. The main purpose&#xD;
      is to investigate effects of early structured care based on screening of red flags (signs of&#xD;
      serious medical conditions/disease), yellow flags (psychosocial factors, attitude to pain)&#xD;
      and blue flags (workplace related factors) and including a workplace intervention according&#xD;
      to the method &quot;Convergence Dialogue Meetings&quot; (CDM) for improving work ability, in comparison&#xD;
      with treatment as usual, in patients with neck and/or back pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal disorders are the most common reasons for sick leave in western countries.&#xD;
      Identifying risk factors and predictors for a stable return to work (RTW ) is essential. An&#xD;
      evidence-based safe care includes systems for detecting medical conditions with urgent need&#xD;
      for care (red flags) and psycho-social risk factors (yellow flags). To maintain work ability,&#xD;
      also requires different capacities related to work demands, (physical, mental and social) as&#xD;
      well as work environment aspects covered by a &quot;blue flag system&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since motivation is assumed to drive and sustain human behaviour, patients with back pain&#xD;
      seek health care when motivation reaches a threshold level. Patients want to be examined, get&#xD;
      treatment and self-care advice to resume normal daily activities. This might lead to improved&#xD;
      long-standing results in terms of health, function and work ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that WorkUp, a timely tailor-made and evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention leads to a faster recovery of health, function and RTW as compared to standard&#xD;
      care. This includes the identification of both the patient's risk factors (red, yellow and&#xD;
      blue flags) and motivational factors. Based on this screening, a structured tailored&#xD;
      intervention will be offered. The WorkUp model comprise of evidence-based treatment and&#xD;
      interaction between patient, health care and work place interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose is to test WorkUp in a comparison study with treatment as usual (TAU) in&#xD;
      primary health care (PHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A prospective paire wise cluster randomized trial in PHC including a one year&#xD;
      clinical follow-up and a three year register follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Through a flow chart the investigators in detail specify the medical and work&#xD;
      place interventions (all according to evidence-based guidelines). Red, yellow and blue flags,&#xD;
      and motivational factors are identified in a screening investigation. The aim of the&#xD;
      screening is to individually tailor the rehabilitation interventions. Physiotherapy&#xD;
      interventions are based on a bio-psychosocial and cognitive behavioural therapy perspective.&#xD;
      Behavioural medicine treatment principles will include careful examination and treatments&#xD;
      such as advice to stay active, instructions, OMI, OMT, MDT. The investigators apply&#xD;
      interventions based on ergonomics, motivational factors and work place changes according to&#xD;
      Convergence Dialogue Meetings(CDM). CDM is a three step structured dialogue and meeting model&#xD;
      supporting the patient, health care professionals and employer to summarize concrete&#xD;
      suggestions to support a RTW .&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAU patients follow the PHC's standard schedule and procedures including the so called&#xD;
      rehabilitation guarantee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient all treatment measures are recorded in a protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis indicated that the investigators needed to recruit a minimum of 20 PHCs and&#xD;
      500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of structured routine primary care can facilitate an adequate treatment for&#xD;
      patients with musculoskeletal pain and how to allocate sparse resources. If beneficial&#xD;
      results emerge a structured implementation program will follow.&#xD;
