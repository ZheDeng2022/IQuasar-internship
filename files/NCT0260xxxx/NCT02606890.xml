      The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to investigate the relationship between lesion&#xD;
      pattern on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and atrial fibrillation in patients with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that a pattern with lesions located in at&#xD;
      least two of the main arterial territories of the brain (left or right internal carotid&#xD;
      artery or posterior circulation territory) is associated with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will retrospectively analyze clinical data and imaging lesion pattern of&#xD;
      1000 consecutive patients who were admitted to the Department of Neurology (Charite -&#xD;
      Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin) and diagnosed with acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute stroke patients of this cohort underwent 3-Tesla MRI with Diffusion-weighted Imaging&#xD;
      (DWI) and Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences as well as standard 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG) on admission and cardiac monitoring with automated arrhythmia&#xD;
      detection during stroke unit care lasting at least 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DWI and FLAIR lesions are located in more than one of the main arterial territories,&#xD;
      lesion pattern will be categorized as &quot;multiple lesion pattern&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a multiple lesion pattern will be detected more frequently&#xD;
      in acute stroke patients with atrial fibrillation than in patients without atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this study might help to identify patients who could profit from extended&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up in order to detect atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke and can be detected in&#xD;
      about 27% of acute stroke patients treated on stroke units in Berlin. Stroke patients in whom&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation is detected benefit from anticoagulation rather than anti-aggregation as&#xD;
      a secondary prevention treatment. Lesions on brain imaging that are located in more than one&#xD;
      of the main arterial territories of the brain may indicate cardioembolic etiology.&#xD;
      Cardioembolic etiology is mainly due to atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation causes&#xD;
      cardiac emboli that may embolize in all brain arteries while other embolic sources e.g.&#xD;
      carotid plaque cannot. However, current data on the association between lesion patterns and&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation are inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to investigate the relationship between lesion&#xD;
      pattern on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and atrial fibrillation. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that a lesion pattern with brain lesions in more than one of the main arterial&#xD;
      territories of the brain (left or right internal carotid artery or posterior circulation&#xD;
      territory) is associated with atrial fibrillation in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The&#xD;
      findings of this study might help to identify patients with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded for clinical data the investigators will analyze imaging data and radiologic reports&#xD;
      of 1000 consecutive stroke patients who received 3-Tesla MRI imaging including&#xD;
      Diffusion-weighted Imaging (DWI) and Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequence.&#xD;
      DWI lesions correspond to acute stroke and FLAIR lesions to subacute and chronic stroke.&#xD;
      Brain lesions will be attributed to a vascular territory (left or right internal carotid&#xD;
      artery or posterior circulation territory) and the pattern consecutively categorized as&#xD;
      &quot;single&quot;, &quot;scattered&quot; and &quot;multiple&quot; as described by Braemswig et al..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal origin of the posterior cerebral artery and variability of vascular territories will be&#xD;
      taken into account. Vascular territory attribution in ambiguous cases will be conducted by&#xD;
      consensus between investigators. Demographic and clinical data will be collected from medical&#xD;
      records. Strokes meeting the criteria for Embolic Stroke of Unknown Source (ESUS) will be&#xD;
      identified according to Hart et al..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a pilot study including 250 patients the investigators estimate that atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation will be present in 38% of patients with a multiple lesion pattern on MRI and in&#xD;
      28% of patients with a non-multiple pattern. Based on these assumptions, 894 patients are&#xD;
      required to have a 80% chance of detecting, (as significant at the 5% level), a difference of&#xD;
      10% with 28% atrial fibrillation in patients without multiple lesion pattern and 38% atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation in patients with a multiple lesion pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with legislation in Berlin, Germany, an ethics committee approval is not&#xD;
      required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is multiple lesion pattern on MRI (DWI and FLAIR). Secondary Outcome is&#xD;
      multiple lesion pattern on MRI (DWI lesions only) Analyses will be conducted comparing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with and without atrial fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and patients without atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and patients with known atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients fulfilling ESUS criteria and patients who do not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with brain lesions outside of the overlap area of the main vascular territories&#xD;
           as defined by Tatu et al.&#xD;
