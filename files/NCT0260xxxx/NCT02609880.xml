  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gynecologic cancers cause substantial morbidity and mortality among women. Developing,&#xD;
      implementing, and disseminating interventions that reduce morbidity and mortality secondary&#xD;
      to gynecologic cancers are a public health priority. In spite of this, there is a paucity of&#xD;
      research examining the effects of psychosocial interventions on patient-centered and&#xD;
      physiological outcomes in this population. To the extent that psychological factors may&#xD;
      influence quality of life and tumor biology among women with gynecologic cancers,&#xD;
      psychological interventions may represent an important adjunct to standard clinical care in&#xD;
      this population. As such, this study will examine the effects of a psychosocial intervention&#xD;
      on sleep, pain, mood, cortisol, and cytokines in women with gynecologic cancers.&#xD;

      Gynecologic cancers cause substantial morbidity and mortality among women. Developing,&#xD;
      implementing, and disseminating interventions that reduce morbidity and mortality secondary&#xD;
      to gynecologic cancers are a public health priority. To the extent that psychological factors&#xD;
      may influence quality of life and tumor biology among women with gynecologic cancers,&#xD;
      psychological interventions may represent an important adjunct to standard clinical care in&#xD;
      this population. Among individuals with cancer, there is emerging evidence that stressors and&#xD;
      psychological responses to stressors activate central and peripheral stress systems,&#xD;
      resulting in downstream effects on the tumor microenvironment, e.g.&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, inflammatory/growth factor&#xD;
      upregulation that may favor tumorigenesis. Little is known about whether psychological&#xD;
      interventions may modulate biobehavioral factors that may promote tumorigenesis among women&#xD;
      with gynecologic cancer. This is a significant gap in the literature. Sleep quality, pain,&#xD;
      and mood are three patient-centered outcomes that may represent important intervention&#xD;
      targets for women with gynecologic cancers, as insomnia, pain, and negative mood states are&#xD;
      (1) prevalent and (2) have been associated with HPA dysregulation and inflammatory/growth&#xD;
      factor upregulation in this population in empirical research. This study will examine&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention effects on patient centered and physiological&#xD;
      outcomes among women with gynecologic cancers undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. Grounded&#xD;
      within the Central Arousal Theory of Stress (CATS) and a biobehavioral model of tumor&#xD;
      biology, the central hypothesis is that a CBT intervention targeting insomnia and pain will&#xD;
      (a) improve nighttime sleep patterns, pain, and negative mood states, and (b) reduce cortisol&#xD;
      levels, normalize daytime cortisol rhythm, and reduce proinflammatory/proangiogenic cytokine&#xD;
      levels in women with gynecologic cancers. The multidisciplinary team will have&#xD;
      research/clinical experience in psycho-oncology, psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), behavioral&#xD;
      sleep medicine, pain, reproductive immunology, and gynecologic oncology. The research study&#xD;
      is innovative in that it will (1) combine empirically-supported CBT techniques for insomnia&#xD;
      and pain into a multicomponent intervention tailored for women with gynecologic cancers, and&#xD;
      (2) examine CBT effects on central sensitization of pain among individuals with cancer using&#xD;
      quantitative sensory testing (QST). The results of this research will be significant to&#xD;
      public health initiatives, because although gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes&#xD;
      of cancer-related death among women, there is a paucity of research examining the effects of&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions on patient-centered and physiological outcomes in this population.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of daytime dysfunction due to insomnia (mood, cognitive, social, or&#xD;
             occupational impairment) at post-surgery.&#xD;

             conditions unethical.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past or current diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder or seizure disorder that would prevent&#xD;
             the safe implementation of sleep restriction techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or any nonpharmacological treatment for&#xD;
             sleep outside of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD).&#xD;
