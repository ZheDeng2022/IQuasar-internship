      Evaluation of FDG PET/CT to image immunotherapy response in adult thoracic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare pre- and post-treatment primary tumor uptake for FDG-PET/CT and correlate with&#xD;
      clinical markers of response. PET/CT tumor metabolic response will also be correlated will to&#xD;
      progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients, at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer or malignancy pleural mesothelioma&#xD;
             with at least one site of disease &gt; 1 cm by at least one type of standard imaging&#xD;
             (e.g.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CT, chest x-ray, MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recommended to start anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obtaining pre-PD1/PDL1 therapy clinical re-staging [18F]FDG-PET/CT scan at the&#xD;
             Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide&#xD;
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior&#xD;
             to study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and imaging&#xD;
             procedures in the opinion of the investigator or treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding at the time of screening will not be&#xD;
             eligible for this study. Female participants of child-bearing potential will have a&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test at the time of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with only a single site of primary non-small cell lung cancer or malignancy&#xD;
             pleural mesothelioma who have undergone or are recommended to undergo radiation&#xD;
             therapy to that site will not be eligible, the inclusion of patients who may be&#xD;
             undergoing radiation therapy to ancillary disease sites may be allowed to enter the&#xD;
             study at the discretion of the PI if it is not felt to affect the ability to capture&#xD;
             [18F]FDG information for at least one primary site of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone cancer surgery removing a significant portion of active&#xD;
             disease, in the opinion of an investigator, within 2 months prior to study enrollment&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an active auto-immune disease (ie. Multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of the investigator or&#xD;
             treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
