  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient (phase 2) pulmonary rehab is an important, but mostly underutilized intervention&#xD;
      to improve physical function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Of those&#xD;
      individuals who complete phase 2 pulmonary rehab, only a small cohort continues with any type&#xD;
      of maintenance exercise therapy (phase 3). This is largely due to personal factors, such as&#xD;
      access to transportation, weather, scheduling difficulties, and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about how to enhance physical activity among patients with IPF. In addition,&#xD;
      no studies have investigated the long-term maintenance strategies of physical training in&#xD;
      patients with IPF. Thus, the purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of a home-based, pulmonary rehab program for patients with IPF. A randomized,&#xD;
      blinded, clinical trial (RCT) design with two arms -- Wii Fit Plus exergame program and&#xD;
      cognitive video gaming, with no active whole body movement involved - will be used to&#xD;
      investigate the benefits of a home-based exergame program on improving pulmonary-related&#xD;
      function and symptoms in patients with IPF.&#xD;
