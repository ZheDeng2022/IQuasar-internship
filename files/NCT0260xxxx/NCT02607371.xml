      The main research question of this patient survey is to assess AF (Atrial Fibrillation)&#xD;
      patients' preferences associated with different attributes which describe the different&#xD;
      available anticoagulation treatment options (Vitamin K Antagonists [VKA] or New Oral&#xD;
      Anticoagulants [NOACs] and, in case of NOACs, Apixaban, Dabigatran, Edoxaban or Rivaroxaban).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VKAs (Marcoumar®, Sintrom ®) will be grouped together and compared to Rivaroxaban.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to investigate the following research questions in a&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey of German-speaking Swiss AF patients being treated either with a VKA&#xD;
      or with a NOAC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which attributes of a medication to prevent stroke do AF patients view as important?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do AF patients have a preference regarding the attributes of the medication options VKA&#xD;
           or NOAC and, in case of NOACs, with regards to rivaroxaban attributes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there subgroups of AF patients whose preference for one of the medication options&#xD;
           appears above or below average?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the quality of life of Swiss German-speaking AF patients? Are there subgroups&#xD;
           with differences in their quality of life (for example: subgroups of patients with&#xD;
           different CHA2DS2-VASc scores)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which burden do German-speaking Swiss AF patients experience in association with their&#xD;
           anticoagulation therapy? Are there differences in the burden of treatment (ACTS) between&#xD;
           patients treated with VKA or with NOACs?&#xD;
