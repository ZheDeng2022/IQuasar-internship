    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to correlate various diagnostic measurements taken during an&#xD;
      escalating dose oral food challenge to the subject's response. This study will investigate&#xD;
      whether non invasive objective biomarkers can indicate a positive response to an escalating&#xD;
      dose OFC before a systemic reaction occurs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients often discover their food allergies after consuming a given food and experiencing a&#xD;
      subsequent allergic reaction. The majority of patients (75%) will then consult a food&#xD;
      allergist for formal diagnosis and treatment information. With respect to patient quality of&#xD;
      life, there is tremendous benefit in having a confirmed diagnosis of food allergy as often&#xD;
      patients are unsure of the source of their reaction outside the office. Allergists will&#xD;
      conduct a Skin Prick Test (SPT) and assess serum specific IgE levels to screen for specific&#xD;
      food protein sensitivities. However, a positive response in SPT and specific IgE will confirm&#xD;
      only sensitivity, and in more than 70% of cases patients that respond positively to SPT and&#xD;
      specific IgE testing will NOT manifest an allergic response to food consumption. To address&#xD;
      this issue, most food allergists will recommend an oral food challenge in a controlled&#xD;
      setting to confirm the allergic response from consuming the suspected foods. The oral food&#xD;
      challenge (OFC) consists of consuming escalating levels of the suspect food, (usually mixed&#xD;
      in applesauce or controlled baked goods), until either a reaction manifests or until the&#xD;
      challenge is complete with no reaction. The food challenge process poses significant risk to&#xD;
      the patient. In 5% of cases, the patient experiences a severe allergic response which&#xD;
      requires the use of epinephrine. These responses typically consist of severe reactions in GI&#xD;
      or respiratory and arise from challenging patients with higher doses of food allergen then is&#xD;
      necessary to prove a mild allergic response, which is directly linked to variability in&#xD;
      diagnosis of a positive response, within subjects and within investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that measurements taken using minimally-invasive diagnostic&#xD;
      tests during the course of an escalating-dose oral food challenge will be able to detect a&#xD;
      positive response before a systemic reaction occurs in the patient and may be able to screen&#xD;
      with individuals predisposed to EOE.&#xD;
