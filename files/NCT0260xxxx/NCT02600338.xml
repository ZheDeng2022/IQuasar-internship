    <textblock>
      Legumes are generally recognized as healthy dietary components, and although beans and&#xD;
      legumes are recommended in food guidelines in North America, guidelines vary in regards to&#xD;
      how much and how often these foods should be consumed. Furthermore, although North American&#xD;
      and European guidelines recommend dietary pulses for glycemic control, dietary pulses and&#xD;
      other legumes are not specifically suggested for controlling blood pressure and maintaining&#xD;
      heart health. To improve evidence-based guidance for legume recommendations, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a systematic review of clinical studies to assess the effect&#xD;
      of eating legumes in exchange for other foods on blood pressure in humans. The systematic&#xD;
      review process allows the combining of the results from many small studies in order to arrive&#xD;
      at a pooled estimate, similar to a weighted average, of the true effect. The investigators&#xD;
      will be able to explore whether eating legumes has different effects in different&#xD;
      demographics, and whether or not the effect of legumes depends on how much/often they are&#xD;
      eaten. The findings of this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of&#xD;
      Canadians through informing recommendations for the general public, as well as those at risk&#xD;
      of heart disease and diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Legumes (e.g. chick peas, beans, lentils, peas, soy, peanuts, lupins) are a&#xD;
      source of slowly digestible carbohydrate, vegetable protein, fibre, and potassium. Canada's&#xD;
      Food Guide encourages consumption of legumes such as beans, lentils, and tofu &quot;often&quot; as meat&#xD;
      alternatives, and the dietary guidelines for Americans include beans, peas, and soy products&#xD;
      as &quot;foods to increase&quot;, and as possible components of a healthy eating pattern. While the&#xD;
      European (EASD), Canadian (CDA), and American (ADA) Diabetes Associations recommend the&#xD;
      consumption of dietary pulses as a means of improving diabetes control, and the American&#xD;
      Heart Association (AHA) recommends the consumption of a healthy eating pattern which includes&#xD;
      legumes for cardiovascular health, consolidated evidence for the specific recommendation of&#xD;
      legumes for heart health is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a review: The lack of data to support health claims and other cardiometabolic&#xD;
      recommendations represent an urgent call for stronger evidence. A systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials remains the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; of evidence for&#xD;
      nutrition guidelines development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To provide evidence-based guidance for public health policy, health claims, and&#xD;
      nutrition guidelines relating to legumes, the investigators will conduct a systematic review&#xD;
      and meta-analysis (knowledge synthesis) of randomized controlled feeding trials to assess the&#xD;
      effect of legumes on blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be&#xD;
      searched using appropriate search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Intervention trials that investigate diets high in legumes compared with&#xD;
      control diets not-containing legumes on blood pressure outcomes in humans will be included.&#xD;
      Studies that are &lt;3-wks duration or lack a control will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Independent reviewers (≥2) will extract information about study design,&#xD;
      sample size, subject characteristics, type and form of legume, dose, follow-up, and the&#xD;
      composition of the background diets. Mean±SEM values will be extracted for all outcomes.&#xD;
      Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The proposed analysis will assess blood pressure control, looking at systolic,&#xD;
      diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Where data for both change-from-baseline&#xD;
      differences and end differences are equally available, the investigators will use the&#xD;
      difference in change from baseline as the primary end point for analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Pooled analyses stratified by underlying disease status will be conducted for&#xD;
      each area of metabolic control using the Generic Inverse Variance method with fixed or random&#xD;
      effects models, depending on the number of relevant studies obtained. Random-effects models&#xD;
      will be used in the case of collection of 5 or more studies, even in the absence of&#xD;
      statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more conservative&#xD;
      summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Paired analyses will be&#xD;
      applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by the Cochran Q statistic and&#xD;
      quantified by the I2-statistic. Sources of heterogeneity will be explored by sensitivity and&#xD;
      subgroup analyses. A priori subgroup analyses will include legume type, legume dose, duration&#xD;
      of follow-up, sodium intake (absolute level, within-treatment change, and between-treatment&#xD;
      change), dietary fibre intake (absolute level, within-treatment change, and between-treatment&#xD;
      change), design (crossover, parallel), study quality, and baseline endpoint values.&#xD;
      Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup&#xD;
      analyses. Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of subgroups analyses. When&#xD;
      &gt;=10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel&#xD;
      plots and formal testing using the Egger test and the Begg test. If publication bias is&#xD;
      suspected, then the investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by&#xD;
      imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: Results will be disseminated through traditional means such as&#xD;
      interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and&#xD;
      publication in high impact factor journals. Target adopters will include the clinical&#xD;
      practice, public health, industry, research communities, and patient groups. Feedback will be&#xD;
      incorporated and used to guide areas for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary findings: The investigators previously conducted a systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of the effect of dietary pulses (a subset of legumes - does not include&#xD;
      leguminous oil-seeds) on glycemic control in 41 controlled feeding trials. It was found that&#xD;
      pulses alone or as part of low-glycemic index or high-fibre diets improved markers of&#xD;
      glycemic control. The investigators also previously conducted a systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of the effect of dietary pulses on blood pressure in 8 isocaloric controlled&#xD;
      feeding trials. It was found that diets high in dietary pulses significantly lowered systolic&#xD;
      and mean arterial blood pressure compared with diets not containing pulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects&#xD;
      of legumes on blood pressure, updating our knowledge synthesis on dietary pulses and&#xD;
      broadening it to assess the effect of all types of legumes, and strengthening the&#xD;
      evidence-base for dietary recommendations and health claims and improving heart health&#xD;
      outcomes through informing healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry&#xD;
      innovation, and guiding future research.&#xD;
