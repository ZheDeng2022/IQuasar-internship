    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, 1:1 parallel control and single dose&#xD;
      administration study design. Healthy subjects will be matched to moderate hepatic function&#xD;
      impaired (Child-Pugh B，7-9) subjects in age, gender and weight as parallel control, which&#xD;
      matches healthy with normal hepatic function according to the of subjects with impaired&#xD;
      hepatic function as, after enrollment of subjects with moderate impaired hepatic function&#xD;
      (Child-Pugh B，7-9). Hepatic function impaired group and control group both receive orally&#xD;
      single-dose of nemonoxacin malate capsule (0.5g). Collect the blood and urine samples before&#xD;
      and after the administration to perform pharmacokinetic analysis and safety observation.&#xD;
