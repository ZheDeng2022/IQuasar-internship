  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central aim of this study is to test the efficacy of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery&#xD;
      Enhancement (MORE), an intervention designed to disrupt the risk chain leading from chronic&#xD;
      pain to prescription opioid misuse and addiction. The investigators plan to conduct a full&#xD;
      scale clinical trial to determine whether MORE (relative to a support group control&#xD;
      condition) can reduce symptoms of chronic pain and opioid misuse among patients who are&#xD;
      receiving pain management in primary care via long-term opioid analgesic therapy.&#xD;
