  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to determine intermediate-term echocardiographic&#xD;
      outcomes in Medicare eligible patients (65 years of age and older) with moderate surgical&#xD;
      risk who have undergone mitral valve surgery for degenerative mitral regurgitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe mitral regurgitation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Mitral&#xD;
      valve surgical repair has proven to be an effective and durable option in the treatment of&#xD;
      symptomatic degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography remains a cornerstone in the evaluation of patients with degenerative (Type&#xD;
      II) mitral regurgitation allowing for assessment of mitral anatomy, quantification of&#xD;
      regurgitant severity, assessment of biventricular function, non-invasive measurement of&#xD;
      pulmonary artery systolic pressures and identifying the presence of other valvular disease.&#xD;
      The AHA/ACC Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines recommend the use of exercise echocardiography&#xD;
      in the setting of mitral regurgitation to determine the degree of mitral regurgitation and&#xD;
      pulmonary artery systolic pressures pre and post exercise in addition to an objective&#xD;
      determination of the symptoms and exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography (both resting and exercise modalities) is helpful in the post-mitral valve&#xD;
      repair period in the assessment of the mitral valve gradient and recurrent mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation. Symptomatic MR patients can have poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL)&#xD;
      which improves and / or returns to comparable age-adjusted norms for reference populations&#xD;
      after mitral valve repair or replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is limited assessment of the degree of mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis,&#xD;
      and exercise capacity following both surgical and percutaneous mitral valve intervention as&#xD;
      measured by exercise echocardiography. We propose that this modality with the addition of&#xD;
      novel imaging technologies will provide a robust avenue for the assessment of these patients&#xD;
      longitudinally. Additionally, assessment of HRQOL, including both the physical and mental&#xD;
      health domains, will provide important information with which to guide patient care after&#xD;
      mitral valve surgery.&#xD;
