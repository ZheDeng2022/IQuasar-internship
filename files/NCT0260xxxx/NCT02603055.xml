  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis E is characteristic by sporadic and local epidemic around the world, and mainly&#xD;
      infects adults aged 15 to 40 years old, resulting in the infection rate ranged from 1% to&#xD;
      15%. The investigational hepatitis E vaccine is a recombinant aluminium-adjuvant hepatitis E&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, randomized, blinding, parallel-controlled phase Ib clinical trial.&#xD;
      This study will determine the safety and immunogenicity of the investigational recombinant&#xD;
      hepatitis E vaccine in healthy adults between 16 and 65 years.&#xD;
