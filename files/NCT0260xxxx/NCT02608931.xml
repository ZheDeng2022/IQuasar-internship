  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical trial of dronabinol to treat disabling attacks of nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting in patients with familial dysautonomia (FD, also known as Riley Day syndrome or&#xD;
      hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III). FD is a rare autosomal recessive&#xD;
      disease in which the growth and development of selective nerves is impaired. Patients with FD&#xD;
      suffer recurrent uncontrollable nausea and vomiting crises accompanied by skin flushing,&#xD;
      tachycardia and arterial hypertension. Current treatments of nausea are ineffective or have&#xD;
      intolerable side sides. Our long-term goal is to treat nausea effectively and without side&#xD;
      effects, a therapeutic intervention that would markedly improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients with FD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      dronabinol for the treatment of nausea in patients with FD. The pilot trial will recruit 25&#xD;
      patients with FD who complain of severe nausea that affects their quality of life. The trial&#xD;
      will be divided into two consecutive, but independent parts. Part 1, will address the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of dronabinol in patients with FD using an open-label dose titration phase&#xD;
      followed by 4-weeks of wash-out period. Part 2 will address the efficacy of dronabinol for&#xD;
      the treatment of nausea in patients with FD using a randomized, placebo controlled, double&#xD;
      blind, 12-week cross over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first specific aim of this proposal is to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      dronabinol in patients with FD. The second specific aim of this proposal is to determine&#xD;
      whether stimulation of endocannabinoid receptors with dronabinol will improve recurrent&#xD;
      nausea in patients with FD. Secondary aims are to determine whether stimulation of&#xD;
      endocannabinoid receptors with dronabinol will increase weight, and decrease anxiety.&#xD;
