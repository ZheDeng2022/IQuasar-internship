      The aim of this observational, non-controlled, non-profit study is to describe the responses&#xD;
      to rehabilitative training with the robotic exoskeleton EKSO-GT in patients with incomplete&#xD;
      motor Spinal Cord Injury (AIS C or D). Such rehabilitative tool is employed during inpatient&#xD;
      intensive rehabilitation in a 3rd level Italian hospital. Safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      device are also assessed and described.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The locomotor training, defined as any &quot;therapeutic program aimed at the recovery of walking&#xD;
      through intense practice of the task of walking&quot;, is a very important part of the treatment&#xD;
      plan for patients with locomotor dysfunction of the lower extremities and is aimed at&#xD;
      retraining the nervous system, facilitating the recovery of muscle strength, improving&#xD;
      balance and voluntary motor coordination. In fact, the majority of gait rehabilitation&#xD;
      strategies is based on the concept of plasticity of the Central Nervous System and of&#xD;
      &quot;Central Pattern Generator&quot;: this plasticity is supposed to be facilitated by early,&#xD;
      intensive and specific therapies, able to enhance the natural recovery processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final goal is to help patients regain the highest level of personal autonomy which&#xD;
      consequently translates also in a better overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anthropomorphic robotic exoskeleton EKSO (Ekso Bionics, USA) is designed to assist in&#xD;
      upright, weight bearing over ground gait training of people with weakness or paralysis of the&#xD;
      lower limbs, due to a disorder, a disease or a neurologic injury. The training with EKSO is&#xD;
      possible even in the presence of minimal forearm strength in order to resting to an upfront&#xD;
      mobile walker. The device is available on the market for some years and it has recently been&#xD;
      introduced in the clinical practice of some Italian rehabilitative centers. Montecatone&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Institute acquired the most recent &quot;GT&quot; version of EKSO that enables variable,&#xD;
      adaptive assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational, longitudinal research study has a descriptive/exploratory intent. It aims&#xD;
      at describing the responses to rehabilitative training with the robotic exoskeleton EKSO-GT&#xD;
      in a cohort of incomplete motor Spinal Cord Injury patients (AIS C or D), as a rehabilitative&#xD;
      tool in a setting of intensive inpatient rehabilitation (3rd level hospital). Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability are also assessed and described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kind of study is justified by the fact that although the global network of professional&#xD;
      users agree on the potential of such &quot;young&quot; technology on rehabilitation outcomes, few are&#xD;
      the clinical data published in the scientific literature in relation to its use. It is&#xD;
      believed that the results obtained from this study will be useful for the future definition&#xD;
      of better protocols of use of the exoskeleton, more specific for the different types of SCI&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to describe the responses to the robotic over ground gait training with&#xD;
      EKSO-GT in an inpatient rehabilitative hospital setting, in people with incomplete motor SCI&#xD;
      (AIS C or D). This objective is achieved by means of the administration of walking tests and&#xD;
      the assessment of both lower limbs motor function and kinetic and endurance characteristics&#xD;
      of walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives, description in the same patients' population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and tolerability of locomotor training with the EKSO-GT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of strength and muscle trophism of the patient subjected to the robotic training;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any reductions in pain and/or spasticity due to SCI during and after the locomotor&#xD;
           training with the EKSO-GT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life and mood status of patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of patient satisfaction in relation to the gait training with the EKSO-GT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance of any acquired benefits (follow-up 45 days after the conclusion of the&#xD;
           training with the EKSO-GT), with respect to most outcomes taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All functional assessments are carried out when the patient does not wear the exoskeleton;&#xD;
      however, functional gait specific test (10-meter walk test and 6-minutes walk test) are&#xD;
      performed when the exoskeleton is worn and when it is not worn only by those patients able to&#xD;
      accomplish those gait specific tests in such a way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For gait specific tests the first evaluation with the exoskeleton worn is programmed to the&#xD;
      third robotic rehabilitative session, as the first sessions are necessary for set-up&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the safety and tolerability of the EKSO-GT training are recorded at the beginning and&#xD;
      at the end of each session, however a synthesis of safety outcomes will be carried out at&#xD;
      predefine time frames.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training with the EKSO-GT is carried out in addition to the &quot;conventional&quot; locomotor&#xD;
      training and in the presence of specifically trained physiotherapists, always under medical&#xD;
      supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo 12 or 18 rehabilitative EKSO sessions, 2-3 times per week, of max 1 hr each.&#xD;
