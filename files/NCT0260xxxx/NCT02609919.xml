      Our primary outcome is to assess the safety of Dotarem in children &lt;2 years old up to 24&#xD;
      hours after Dotarem injection. Patients will be monitored for any adverse events that occur&#xD;
      for 2 hours following the completion of the MRI exam. The type of event, time of onset,&#xD;
      duration of symptoms, intensity of the reaction (mild, moderate, severe), causality (not&#xD;
      related, probably related, related, definitely related, unclassifiable), and subsequent&#xD;
      outcome (required treatment, favorable outcome, recovery with sequela, or death) will be&#xD;
      documented. Parents will be given instruction sheets on who and when to call should any&#xD;
      adverse event occur after discharge. Parents will be called by the radiology department the&#xD;
      next day to identify any adverse events that occurred during the first 24 hours after&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary outcome is to assess image quality of the exam. The pre-contrast images will be&#xD;
      compared to the combined pre- and post-contrast images following administration of Dotarem by&#xD;
      radiologists who are blinded to the patients' clinical information to assess for improvement&#xD;
      of image quality and delineation of structures with contrast.&#xD;

      Our primary outcome is to assess the safety of Dotarem in these patients up to 24 hours after&#xD;
      Dotarem injection. The patients will be monitored in the hospital for at least 2 hours&#xD;
      following the completion of the MRI exam. Many of these patients will have received sedation&#xD;
      for the MRI and would be monitored normally for up to 1 hour after the exam is completed.&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for any adverse events that occurred during the observation&#xD;
      period. The type of event, time of onset, duration of symptoms, intensity of the reaction&#xD;
      (mild, moderate, severe), causality (not related, probably related, related, definitely&#xD;
      related, unclassifiable), and subsequent outcome (required treatment, favorable outcome,&#xD;
      recovery with sequela, or death) will be documented. Parents will be given an information&#xD;
      sheet prior to discharge indicating the possible adverse events that may occur related to the&#xD;
      administration of Dotarem with instructions on what to do and who to call, if necessary,&#xD;
      should any of them occur. Parents will be called by the radiology department the next day to&#xD;
      identify any adverse events that occurred during the first 24 hours after discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary outcome is to assess image quality of the exam. The pre-contrast images will be&#xD;
      compared to the combined pre- and post-contrast images following administration of Dotarem by&#xD;
      radiologists who are blinded to the patients' clinical information to assess for improvement&#xD;
      of image quality and delineation of structures with contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 patients are expected to be enrolled in this study over the course of 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients 2 years of age or older. Patients receiving an MRI exam without&#xD;
      contrast. Patients with a GFR &lt;30. Patients with known renal failure or prior gadolinium&#xD;
      based contrast agent hypersensitivity reaction. Patients who receive an MRI exam using a&#xD;
      different gadolinium-based contrast agent. Patients who are not accompanied by a parent will&#xD;
      not be included. Patients who are unable to complete the MRI exam prior to contrast&#xD;
      administration will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Any patient under 2 years of age undergoing an MRI exam of the neuraxis&#xD;
      or body with and without contrast as part of their standard of care. Included patients may be&#xD;
      scheduled with simultaneous sedation for the MRI. Nonsedated patients also qualify for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who qualify for Dotarem administration are usually preselected by the radiologist&#xD;
      depending on the type of exam and the reason for the study. While, the use of Dotarem is not&#xD;
      approved by the FDA in this patient population, off-label use of the agent is routinely&#xD;
      performed during routine clinical care of patients in this age group in our practice. Those&#xD;
      patients who would be given Dotarem as part of routine standard of care will be asked to&#xD;
      enroll. Written consent will be obtained from the parents. Patients will be recruited over an&#xD;
      18 month period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MRI exams will be performed on our 3T GE Discovery 750W or 1.5T GE Signa HDXT 23.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have the following information recorded: age, sex, weight, risk factors&#xD;
      (renal disease, cardiac disease, autoimmune disease, dehydration, other medical conditions),&#xD;
      reason for exam, type of exam, dose of Dotarem, route of injection (manual or power&#xD;
      injection), a premedication regimen (i.e. steroids), and tolerance to injection. In addition,&#xD;
      when applicable, the types of medications used for sedation will be recorded as well as the&#xD;
      route of sedation: deep sedation, laryngeal mask airway, or general endotracheal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given a weight-based dose of Dotarem of 0.2mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) body weight.&#xD;
      It will be administered as an intravenous bolus injection at a flow rate of approximately 1-2&#xD;
      mL/second either by manual or power injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the MRI exam, all patients will undergo continuous monitoring of heart rate and&#xD;
      peripheral oxygen saturation. Sedated patients will be monitored similarly until they reach&#xD;
      an Aldrete score &gt;6. After this the monitoring devices will be removed. The patients will&#xD;
      then be observed off the monitors until a total of 2 hours after the exam has elapsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse drug events (ADEs) will be documented including nausea, headache, injection site&#xD;
      pain, injection site coldness, burning sensation, heart arrhythmia, allergic reactions&#xD;
      (cardiac or respiratory arrest, laryngeal edema, angioedema, urticarial, seizures, syncope,&#xD;
      tremors, muscle spasms or weakness, diarrhea, drooling, and fever. If an ADE occurs, the&#xD;
      timing related to the injection of Dotarem will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crash cart is available directly across the hallway from the MRI suite in the&#xD;
      Sedation/Nursing area in radiology. Nursing staff and a staff radiologist are available at&#xD;
      all times for immediate reactions. If a severe anaphylactic or bronchospasm reaction occurs,&#xD;
      the patient will be brought to the Emergency Department. Management and treatment of acute&#xD;
      reactions to contrast media will follow the guidelines outlined in Table 4 of the ACR Manual&#xD;
      on Contrast Media Version 10.1 (2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aldrete Scoring System:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity Voluntary movement of all limbs to command 2 Voluntary movement of 2 extremities to&#xD;
      command 1 Unable to move 0 Respiration Able to breathe deeply and cough 2 Dyspnea,&#xD;
      hypoventilation 1 Apnea 0 Circulation B/P + 20% of pre-anesthetic level 2 B/P + 20%-50% of&#xD;
      pre-anesthetic level 1 B/P + 50% of pre-anesthetic level 0 Consciousness Fully awake 2&#xD;
      Arousable 1 Unresponsive 0 Color Pink 2 Pale, dusky, blotchy, jaundice, other 1 Cyanotic 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Call: The follow up phone call to the parents the next day (&gt;24 hours) will include&#xD;
      asking the parents the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Did your child experience any of the following after being discharged from the hospital from&#xD;
      the MRI exam? Headache Y/N Nausea Y/N Dizziness Y/N Dysgeusia Y/N Feeling Hot Y/N Injection&#xD;
      site reactions Y/N Vomiting Y/N Rash (includes generalize, macular, popular, pruritic) Y/N&#xD;
      Erythema Y/N Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactoid (i.e. urticarial, facial edema, eyelid edema,&#xD;
      flushing, cough, sneezing, wheezing, chest pain, cyanosis) Y/N Dyspnea Y/N Paresthesia Y/N&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following your child's discharge from MRI, did he/she have any other clinic appointments or&#xD;
      tests/exams in the hospital? If so, what were they?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary outcome is to assess the image quality of the exam. Patients will initially&#xD;
      undergo a pre-contrast MRI examination followed by the administration of Dotarem. The&#xD;
      pre-contrast images will be compared to the combined pre- and post-contrast images&#xD;
      independently by 3 radiologists blinded to the clinical information. The three primary&#xD;
      imaging components judged will be contrast enhancement, border delineation, and internal&#xD;
      morphology. In addition, within each of these components, the radiologist will assign a&#xD;
      result based on a pre-defined scoring scale. These include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-contrast images vs. Paired pre-post contrast images:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Border delineation: better, same, not better, missing Internal morphology: better, same, not&#xD;
      better, missing Contrast enhancement: better, same, not better, missing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better is defined as those patients in which the combined pre- and post-contrast exam images&#xD;
      were greater than the pre-contrast images alone. Same is defined as those patients in which&#xD;
      the characteristics of a lesion or disease did not change following contrast administration&#xD;
      because of the inherent characteristics of the lesion/disease in which enhancement is not&#xD;
      expected. Missing identifies those patients in which a score was not assigned.&#xD;
