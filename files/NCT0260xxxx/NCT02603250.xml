      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of a noninvasive Hb device (Pronto® with&#xD;
      DCI-mini™ sensors) as an accurate method for measuring Hb levels among children between 6 and&#xD;
      59 months against the standard reference hematology analyzer. The secondary purpose is to&#xD;
      evaluate the accuracy of two HemoCue® Hb 201+ capillary blood collection methods against the&#xD;
      standard reference hematology analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that the Pronto® with DCI-mini™ sensor will approximate Hb values&#xD;
      within ±1.0 g/dL and secondly, it will correctly classify participants as anemic or not&#xD;
      anemic with less than 31% disagreement when compared to the standard reference hematology&#xD;
      analyzer among children 6 to 59 months of age. Additionally, the two different HemoCue® Hb&#xD;
      201+ capillary blood collection methodologies will both approximate Hb values within ±1.0&#xD;
      g/dL and secondly, it will correctly classify participants as anemic or not anemic with less&#xD;
      than 35% disagreement when compared to the standard reference hematology analyzer among&#xD;
      children 6 to 59 months of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Hb values of 132 children, between 6 and 59 months of age will be obtained, using three&#xD;
      different Hb assessment methods during the same assessment visit for comparison with the&#xD;
      standard reference hematology analyzer(Sysmex KN21) results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the research is: 1) To evaluate the accuracy of the noninvasive Masmio Pronto®&#xD;
      device with DCI-mini sensor in measuring Hb when compared to measuring Hb using the standard&#xD;
      reference hematology analyzer, and 2) To evaluate the accuracy of both the HemoCue® Hb 201+&#xD;
      gravity and wicking methodologies of capillary blood collection against the standard&#xD;
      reference hematology analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate and determine the accuracy of the Pronto® with DCI-mini™ sensor, the 132 Pronto®&#xD;
      Hb values will be compared to the Hb values obtained by the standard reference hematology&#xD;
      analyzer to determine if the overall average difference between measurements does not exceed&#xD;
      1.0g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate and determine the accuracy of each of the two HemoCue® 201+ blood collection&#xD;
      methods, 50% of the children will have their Hb measured using the wicking method and 50%&#xD;
      will have their Hb measured using the gravity method. The Hb values obtained by the two&#xD;
      different HemoCue® 201+ blood collection methods will be compared to the standard reference&#xD;
      hematology analyzer to determine if the overall average difference between each method and&#xD;
      the standard reference is within 1.0g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each child, study nurse/coordinator will: collect health information from the child,&#xD;
      categorize skin pigmentation using the Massey and Martin NIS Skin Color Scale, measure and&#xD;
      record finger diameter using the Masimo finger measuring tool (if none of the fingers are the&#xD;
      appropriate size for the sensor, then the big toe will be measured and used instead).&#xD;
      Capillary blood samples of the children will be taken via finger pricking of the third or&#xD;
      fourth digit. If a child of 6-11 months is acutely malnourished (as determined by their&#xD;
      weight-for-height Z score), the blood drop will be obtained from their heel in accordance&#xD;
      with Hemocue® 201+ protocol and to ensure the finger bone is not injured due to insufficient&#xD;
      finger padding. For both blood sampling locations, the first two drops of blood will be wiped&#xD;
      away and only the third blood drop will be used. The randomization process and the data&#xD;
      analysis phase will not be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the accuracy of the noninvasive device, the difference between Hb values&#xD;
      obtained from the Pronto® with DCI-mini™ sensory and standard reference hematology analyzer&#xD;
      (Sysmex KN21™) will be calculated for each child and an average obtained. In addition to the&#xD;
      mean difference (bias), the standard deviation, 95% confidence interval, range, and limits of&#xD;
      agreement will also be obtained. Accuracy of Hb measurement by the noninvasive device will be&#xD;
      assessed by determining whether the measurement obtained with each noninvasive device falls&#xD;
      within ±1.0 g/dL of the standard reference. With 100 samples and assuming the correlation&#xD;
      between measurement methods is at least 0.93, we have 97-99% power to confirm that the&#xD;
      average difference between the two Hb measurement methods does not exceed 1.0 g/dL. This&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted using a paired t-test since we will be testing a limit on the&#xD;
      difference between the measures. The prevalence rate of anemia will also be estimated for the&#xD;
      group from the noninvasive measurements in comparison to the standard reference measurements&#xD;
      and analyzed by paired t-test. For this comparison, our sample size of 100 affords us enough&#xD;
      power to determine if participants are correctly classified as anemic or not anemic, with&#xD;
      less than 31% disagreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar process will be followed for each of the two HemoCue® Hb 201+ capillary blood&#xD;
      collection methodologies in comparison to the standard reference hematology analyzer using a&#xD;
      paired t-test to test the limit on the difference between measures. With 50 samples and&#xD;
      assuming the correlation between measurement methods is at least 0.93, we again have 77-99%&#xD;
      power to confirm that the average difference between each of the two Hb measurement methods&#xD;
      and the standard reference does not exceed 1.0 g/dL. The prevalence rate of anemia will also&#xD;
      be estimated for each of the HemoCue® 201+ study arms for comparison with the standard&#xD;
      reference measurements and analyzed by paired t-test. For this comparison, our sample size of&#xD;
      100 enables us to test if participants are correctly classified as anemic or not anemic, with&#xD;
      less than 35% disagreement.&#xD;
