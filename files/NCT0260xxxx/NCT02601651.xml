      The primary objectives of this study is to access the effect of perioperative lidocaine&#xD;
      infusion on total morphine requirement during the first 24 h postoperatively in patients who&#xD;
      underwent laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of intravenous lidocaine can be considered as a multimodal approach to pain relief.&#xD;
      This method of analgesia has been associated with reductions in post-operative pain,&#xD;
      analgesic consumption, nausea, vomiting and length of hospital stay in various surgeries&#xD;
      (abdominal, spinal, thoracic surgery) including laparoscopic procedure .The primary reason&#xD;
      for delayed patient recovery and longer hospital stays after surgery is postoperative pain&#xD;
      and ileus .Opioids are the mainstay drug to treat pain in the postoperative period. However,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, postoperative ileus and further delay in patient recovery will be&#xD;
      exacerbated by opioid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the higher inflammatory response is observed in the early postoperative phase following TEP&#xD;
      surgery compared to the conventional shouldice repair. Therefore, laparoscopic repair of&#xD;
      inguinal hernia should not be seen as less traumatic than the conventional approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-dose IV lidocaine (typically 1.5-3 mg/kg/h) is easy to administer, has well-established&#xD;
      analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and excellent safety record .&#xD;
      Because postoperative pain is to a large extent an inflammatory phenomenon, administration of&#xD;
      systemic local anesthetics, which have inflammatory modulatory properties, could&#xD;
      significantly reduce pain and therefore allow more rapid discharge. In addition, intravenous&#xD;
      lidocaine is an effective modality for treating visceral pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary : To access the effect of perioperative lidocaine infusion on total morphine&#xD;
      requirement during the first 24 h postoperatively in patients who underwent laparoscopic TEP&#xD;
      for inguinal hernioplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative NRS Scores at rest and during movement (i.e. deep breathing, coughing) (at&#xD;
           PACU, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to first perception of pain in the postoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of post operative nausea and vomiting, shivering, and tinnitus during the&#xD;
           first 24h&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Recovery based on QoR-40 questionnaire at 24 h of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction at 24 h of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of Chronic pain after TEP Repair at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS Perioperative intravenous lidocaine administration will not decrease&#xD;
      opioid requirements and pain scores during the first 24 h after TEP for inguinal&#xD;
      hernioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Written informed consent will be taken for the procedure from all the patients. A&#xD;
      total of 64 male subjects of ASA PS I and II undergoing laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal&#xD;
      inguinal hernia repair will be enrolled in the study. The study will be carried out according&#xD;
      to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and following CONSORT guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoperative evaluation, all of the patients will be premedicated with oral diazepam&#xD;
      (0.1-0.2 mg/kg; not exceeding &gt; 10 mg) at the night before and 2 hour before surgery.In order&#xD;
      to assess pain patients will be familiarized about the use of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NRS) (0-10 cm) where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable excruciating pain. They&#xD;
      will also be informed that they will be asked about the intensity of the pain using NRS score&#xD;
      and the site of pain (incisional pain or groin pain) in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, both the patient and the investigator observing the outcome will be blinded&#xD;
      about the assignment of patient group. In the preoperative holding area, the patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into any of two groups using computer generated random number. Details of&#xD;
      group assignment and case number will be kept in a set of sealed opaque envelope. The&#xD;
      anesthesia staff will open the envelope and prepare the intravenous solutions accordingly.&#xD;
      The attending anesthesiologist who is unaware of the group allocated will follow the standard&#xD;
      general anaesthesia protocol during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room standard monitoring device will be attached to monitor and baseline&#xD;
      heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure and oxygen saturation will be recorded. A peripheral&#xD;
      vein will be cannulated for administration of IV fluid with 18 G cannula. Preoxygenation will&#xD;
      be done with 100% oxygen for 3 min. Induction will be done with IV fentanyl 1.5 μg/kg,&#xD;
      propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg till cessation of verbal response and tracheal intubation facilitated&#xD;
      with vecuronium 0.1mg/kg IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At induction, lidocaine group (A group) patients will receive 1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine&#xD;
      (Loxicard®, Neon pharmaceuticals, India) IV bolus followed by infusion of 2 mg/kg/h. The&#xD;
      Normal Saline group (B group) will receive same volume IV bolus at induction followed by&#xD;
      continuous infusion until the tracheal extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both the group will receive preincisional infiltration in three trocar sites with&#xD;
      6 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups, anesthesia will be maintained with oxygen and isoflurane, adjusting the&#xD;
      end-tidal concentration of isoflurane to maintain Mean Arterial Pressure(MAP) within 20% of&#xD;
      baseline. IV fentanyl 0.5 μg/kg will be supplemented intraoperatively if MAP and heart rate&#xD;
      increase by 20% from the baseline after ensuring adequate end tidal concentration of&#xD;
      isoflurane ,muscle relaxation and targeted range of ETCO2. After observing curare notch in&#xD;
      capnograph, supplemental vecuronium IV bolus doses will be given . Paracetamol 1 gm IV&#xD;
      infusion will be started after induction and given over 15 min. Any episode of intraoperative&#xD;
      hypotension (MAP lower than 65 mmHg) and bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 50 bpm) will be treated&#xD;
      with ephedrine 5 mg and atropine 0.4 mg IV respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized surgical procedure for the hernia as described for endoscopic TEP for inguinal&#xD;
      hernia repair will be followed. Ketorolac 30 mg IV will be given at the end of surgery and&#xD;
      continued at 8 h intervals postoperatively. On the completion of surgery, residual&#xD;
      neuromuscular block will be reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg IV and glycopyrrolate 0.01&#xD;
      mg/kg IV. Following successful tracheal extubation, infusion of the lidocaine or saline will&#xD;
      be stopped and the patient will be transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Care and observation On arrival to the PACU, non-invasive blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, respiration, primary and secondary outcome variables will be monitored by the blinded&#xD;
      investigator. Pain including its site will be assessed at rest and on deep breathing or&#xD;
      coughing by NRS every 15 mins for the first 1 h and then at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after&#xD;
      surgery. If the NRS for pain is more than 3 at rest, morphine 1mg IV boluses will be&#xD;
      administered, and repeated at the interval of 5 min until NRS is ≤ 3 for the first 24 h.&#xD;
      Ondansetron 4 mg IV will be administered for persistent nausea (lasting &gt;5 min) or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our institution, no step-down high dependency unit is available and patients will be&#xD;
      transferred to the surgical ward after at least 2 h stay in the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters will be observed at PACU, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was based on previous study with the use of intravenous lidocaine&#xD;
      infusion for inguinal herniorrhaphy (Kang and Kim, 2011). Mean (SD) fentanyl consumption in&#xD;
      the first 4-8 h between the lidocaine and placebo were 15.7 (6.3) and 21.4 (8.4) μg. Cohen d&#xD;
      was used to calculate the effect size and was found to be 0.76.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using an online statistical calculator (G power® version 3.0.1).&#xD;
      It was estimated that a sample size of 29 patients in each study group would achieve a power&#xD;
      of 80% to detect an effect size of 0.76 in the primary outcome measure of opioid consumption,&#xD;
      assuming a type I error of 0.05. Assuming 10% drop-outs during the study period, a total of&#xD;
      32 patients will taken for the study.&#xD;
