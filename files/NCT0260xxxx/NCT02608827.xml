  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is serious health problem in Brazil and affects almost 30%of adult population.&#xD;
      It is known that there are pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies for treating&#xD;
      hypertension. Aerobic exercise and slow breathing are nonpharmacologic methods that reduce&#xD;
      blood pressure in an isolated form, but its combinations has never been studied. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the association of both strategies and also the mechanisms involved&#xD;
      in blood pressure reduction using slow breathing, in stages 1 and 2 hypertensives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of drugs and no medication for hypertension treatment has been widely&#xD;
      recommended, with emphasis on aerobic exercises (EXE), relaxation exercises, and the use of&#xD;
      equipment designed to decrease the respiratory rate called Resperate®. This intervention has&#xD;
      demonstrated a hypotensive effect in pressure measurements in clinical blood pressure and&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM). It is&#xD;
      unknown; however, if slow breathing (GRL) associated with other intervention, such as EXE,&#xD;
      for example, may potentiate the blood pressure (BP) reduction. The aim of this study will be&#xD;
      evaluate the acute responses of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and BP, in&#xD;
      association of the slow breathing versus control (listening to calm music) and the 24 hour&#xD;
      blood pressure response after the association of EXE and GRL. Twenty hypertensives will be&#xD;
      evaluated between 18 to 60 years old, mens and woman, sedentary, non-obese, without target&#xD;
      organs damage and associated comorbidities, after 4 weeks of placebo use (washout period).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups (GRL and GC) and both perform EXE on a&#xD;
      cycle ergometer. Volunteers will make a ABPM before and after the experimental session. In&#xD;
      this session will be recorded for 10 minutes, prior to the physical exercise, the systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate&#xD;
      (HR), after that, It will be held microneurography to register also the MSNA for 10 minutes,&#xD;
      then they will perform either GRL or listened to music for 15 minutes. Variables will be&#xD;
      measures for more 10 minutes. After finishing the session, volunteers will put the ABPM and&#xD;
      will go away.&#xD;
