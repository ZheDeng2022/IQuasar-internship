    <textblock>
      The Baltimore Reading and Eye Disease Study (BREDS) is a two year study to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of vision problems in an early school age population with reading difficulty.&#xD;
      Comprehensive vision and reading tests will be administered to 400 students at participating&#xD;
      schools in the Baltimore City Public School system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary goal is to examine the impact of vision treatment on reading performance.&#xD;
      Children with refractive error or convergence insufficiency will be provided treatment free&#xD;
      of charge. The investigators will evaluate the impact that the treatment has on vision&#xD;
      function and reading performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Learning to read is a fundamental skill taught in the early years of elementary school&#xD;
      education. Students who experience difficulty reading are at risk for long-term struggles&#xD;
      with academic achievement. In fact, achieving reading proficiency by the end of third grade&#xD;
      has been established as key predictor of life success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a number of factors contribute to reading problems, an undiagnosed or untreated ocular&#xD;
      condition may present one possible etiology. To the investigator's knowledge, there are no&#xD;
      large scale or prospective studies evaluating the prevalence of vision disorders in children&#xD;
      with reading difficulties. Previously, the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study performed&#xD;
      visual assessments in the Baltimore area for children 6 months through 5 years of age to&#xD;
      establish the prevalence of select ocular disorders in this pre-school population. Little is&#xD;
      known about the types of vision problems that affect a grade school population with and&#xD;
      without reading difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is general consensus that undiagnosed or untreated vision problems may contribute to&#xD;
      reading difficulty, although the extent to which treatment will improve reading performance&#xD;
      is not well established. Although there are some studies demonstrating that treatment of&#xD;
      vision problems can improve reading performance, publications on the efficacy of school-based&#xD;
      interventions to identify and treat vision problems in school-age children are lacking. If&#xD;
      successful, a school-based intervention could have significant impact improving reading&#xD;
      performance, especially in high poverty neighborhoods where children have the highest risk of&#xD;
      poor reading aptitude and limited access to eye care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this research study is to determine the prevalence of vision problems in&#xD;
      an early school age population with reading difficulty. To adequately address this question,&#xD;
      the investigators will administer reading and vision assessments to 400 second and third&#xD;
      graders in participating schools within the Baltimore City Public School system. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators will obtain information on how many children with vision problems have&#xD;
      received treatment in the past, and if not, why not. The investigators will also determine&#xD;
      how schools handle and refer children who are felt to be poor readers in order to assist with&#xD;
      planning future interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted over a two-year period. In the first year, the investigators&#xD;
      conducted baseline vision and reading assessment on all participating subjects. In the second&#xD;
      year, the investigators will conduct follow up vision and reading assessments on all children&#xD;
      treated with eyeglasses or eye exercises and a subset of subjects with healthy eye exams. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to evaluate any barriers to interventions, and where possible assist in&#xD;
      overcoming such barriers, for example by replacing lost/broken eyeglasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary goal is to examine the impact of vision treatment on reading performance.&#xD;
      Children with refractive error and convergence insufficiency will be provided treatment free&#xD;
      of charge. The investigators will evaluate the impact that the treatment has on vision&#xD;
      function and reading performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In subsequent phases of this project, the investigators also hope to learn how novel&#xD;
      treatments (e.g. iPads) impact reading performance.&#xD;
