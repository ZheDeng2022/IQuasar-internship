  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature birth deprives infants of sensory stimulation. Tactile stimulation such as massage&#xD;
      pressure with kinesthetic movement significantly increases the weight, bone density and&#xD;
      shorten the duration of stay of premature babies who benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using vegetable oils show an increase in the effect on weight gain by cutaneous&#xD;
      absorption. The mechanism is probably vagal (stimulation of baroreceptors and skin&#xD;
      mechanoreceptors) since it is found in children stimulated an increase in the vagal activity,&#xD;
      acceleration of gastric emptying and an increase in the secretion of insulin and IGF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have evaluated the effects of massage on the medium-term neurological development&#xD;
      in preterm infants and the effect of the essential oils in the effectiveness of touching the&#xD;
      short and medium term massage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the investigators study is to evaluate the neurological development in the short&#xD;
      and medium term in premature newborns and biological effects of massage with essential use of&#xD;
      vegetable oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and possible collaborations This is a monocentric, randomized, controlled, in a&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit. It concerns 60 children born between 26 and 30 weeks of&#xD;
      amenorrhea. Each child receives massage randomized with or without oil ISIO 4. The treatment&#xD;
      is administered 10 minutes twice a day for 10 consecutive days watching for signs of&#xD;
      intolerance. The quality of the spontaneous motility between 12 and 20 weeks of age corrected&#xD;
      is used as the first neurological assessment criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire (ASQ) Bricker and Squires (translated into French by Martha Bonin et al.)&#xD;
      is used to 6, 12, 24 months corrected age and completed by the parents as a second&#xD;
      neurological endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lipid chromatography is performed at the beginning and at the end of the massage time and&#xD;
      at the deliverance from NICU for comparing the profile of children's fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results Show that there is an improvement in the neurological development in&#xD;
      children who received massage with vegetable oil ISIO 4. Show that there is a skin absorption&#xD;
      of essential fatty acids that can substitute for a known major deficiency in premature even&#xD;
      in infants fed breast milk.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is represented by the assessment of neuro-development of children from 3 months of age corrected more precisely between 12 and 20 weeks post-term. The evaluation of neuro-development will be realized from measurement of the quality of spontaneous general movement. The motor repertoire was evaluated using the video-recording made between 11 to 16 weeks post-term, following Prechtl's method for the assessment of the motor repertoire between 3 and 5 months. Scores were assigned to the following five aspects: Quality of FMs, Age-adequacy of concurrent movements, Presence and normality of concurrent movements, Presence and normality of postural patterns and Quality of concurrent movements. Scores for each aspect can range from 1 to 4. The scores for the five aspects of the motor repertoire are summed to provide a Motor Optimality Score, range 5 to 20. Higher scores indicate higher movement quality.</description>

    <description>The evaluation of neuro-development between 12 and 20 weeks post term from motor score will be complemented by an assessment using the questionnaire &quot;Ages and Stages Questionnaire&quot; (ASQ) at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The ASQ [Bricker and Squires 2000] questionnaire is a child developmental delay screening tool, thus identifying children in need of a thorough assessment of their development.</description>
