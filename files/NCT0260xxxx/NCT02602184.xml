      This clinical study will be a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized and&#xD;
      centrally evaluated intra-individual comparative study to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      AR/101 concomitantly administered with SoC in accelerating re epithelialization of split&#xD;
      thickness wounds compared with placebo and concomitantly with SoC, in the pannus of&#xD;
      volunteers undergoing elective abdominoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the treatment in the study is 21 days. The patients will be treated with&#xD;
      AR/101 or placebo until complete re epithelialization or up to 21 days, whichever comes&#xD;
      first. Evaluation and treatment will be done daily in the outpatient clinic. Throughout the&#xD;
      study, safety data on adverse events will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard supportive care and dressing supplies concomitantly with&#xD;
      AR/101 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers who are scheduled for an elective abdominoplasty at the practice of the principal&#xD;
      investigator will have superficial split thickness wounds created on their abdomen according&#xD;
      to protocol about 4 weeks prior to their scheduled abdominoplasty. A total of 8 split&#xD;
      thickness (5X5 cm, 0.0254 mm in thickness) wounds will be distributed on the abdomen between&#xD;
      the umbilicus and the suprapubic hairline. All patients will have to agree to daily treatment&#xD;
      in the hospital clinic by professional staff through the study duration. Degree of&#xD;
      re-epithelialization will be assessed photographically and confirmed by the absence of&#xD;
      drainage on wound dressings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treated wounds that achieve complete re-epithelialization within the study period will be&#xD;
      evaluated for the retention of an intact epithelium at the end of the study (22 days). At the&#xD;
      time of the subject's abdominoplasty surgery, the pannus of each subject will be surgically&#xD;
      removed as part of the abdominoplasty procedure, and skin samples will be harvested from the&#xD;
      excised pannus for further histologic and molecular analysis.&#xD;
