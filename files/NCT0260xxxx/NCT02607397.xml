      The cost of particle therapy (PT) are considerably higher than conventional radiotherapy (RT)&#xD;
      with photons. Considering potential dosimetric advantages of PT, it is necessary to determine&#xD;
      if PT are more cost-effective than photons per indication regarding quality of life,&#xD;
      survival, and progression free survival. Given the lack of evidence for the benefit of&#xD;
      particle therapy in relevant cases, investigators proposed an in silico trial to investigate&#xD;
      to what extend proton therapy decrease the amount of irradiated normal tissue and,&#xD;
      consequently, the risk of side effects in the surrounding normal tissue as well as the risk&#xD;
      of secondary tumors. Given validated dose-response curves and/or NTCP models, a 10% lower&#xD;
      mean dose of proton therapy on normal tissue compared to photon therapy should result in at&#xD;
      least a 20% lower risk of side effects.&#xD;

      Patients with low grade glioma have a far better prognosis than patients with high grade&#xD;
      glioma. Despite their low incidence and initial favorable biological behavior, low-grade&#xD;
      gliomas are behaving as malignant brain tumours leading to considerable morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality especially in young patients. Low-grade infiltrating gliomas in adults include&#xD;
      diffuse astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma and oligodendroglioma. With the WHO 2007 classification&#xD;
      the variety within the low grade glioma patient group was large. With the introduction of&#xD;
      molecular marker like IDH, MGMT, 1p/19q the classification of glioma's in general is a matter&#xD;
      of debate, because shifts in treatments and prognosis. In this context, the importance of&#xD;
      molecular markers is recognized and used for designing new trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of this improved determining of long term survivors like low grade glioma patients,&#xD;
      reducing the long term side effect becomes even more relevant. One of the prominent side&#xD;
      effect of radiotherapy in low grade glioma patients is the decline in neurocognitive function&#xD;
      and loss of memory. This enables patients in their daily activities and causes loss of&#xD;
      quality of life. The hippocampus and associated limbic system have long been known to be&#xD;
      important in memory formation and pre-clinical models show loss of hippocampal stem cells&#xD;
      with radiation as well as changes in architecture and function of mature neurons. Cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes in clinical studies are beginning to provide evidence of cognitive effects&#xD;
      associated with hippocampal dose and the cognitive benefits of hippocampal sparing. With&#xD;
      currently developing IMRT techniques attempts are made to lower the dose to the hippocampus.&#xD;
      Besides the hippocampus the dose to the posterior part of the cerebellum seems to influence&#xD;
      cognition. Koziol wrote recently the current consensus paper which gathers diverse views on a&#xD;
      variety of important roles played by the cerebellum across a range of cognitive and emotional&#xD;
      functions. This paper considers the cerebellum in relation to neurocognitive development,&#xD;
      language function, working memory, executive function, and the development of cerebellar&#xD;
      internal control models and reflects upon some of the ways in which better understanding the&#xD;
      cerebellum's status as a &quot;supervised learning machine&quot; can enrich our ability to understand&#xD;
      human function and adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This in silico planning study compares different treatments (photon, proton and C-ion)&#xD;
      focusing on normal tissue radiation exposure for a fixed tumor dose, using the same&#xD;
      delineation of gross target volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target&#xD;
      volume (PTV). The comparison will be based on dosimetric parameters on normal tissues such as&#xD;
      mean hippocampus dose, etc. In addition, the NTCP for a fixed tumor dose or the same expected&#xD;
      TCP will be determined. Cobalt Gy equivalent doses will be used when reporting the proton and&#xD;
      C-ion dose. In the case of protons, a constant RBE value of 1.1 will be used for both the&#xD;
      tumor and the normal tissues. The RBE of C-ions will be calculated based on the models used&#xD;
      by the participating centers. The GSI in-house treatment planning system uses RBE values&#xD;
      calculated on the basis of the local effect model (LEM). The LEM I (alpha/beta=2) is based on&#xD;
      the radial dose distribution of each charged particle crossing into a cell nucleus, as well&#xD;
      as on the radiosensitivity and repair capacity of the tissue. The TPSs used by UHM is also&#xD;
      based on the LEM model. The model used at NIRS utilizes fixed RBE values that are dependent&#xD;
      on the depth in the body, but independent of dose level or tumor type.&#xD;
