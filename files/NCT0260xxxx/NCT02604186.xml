      Hereditary spastic paraplegias constitute a heterogeneous group of diseases with the common&#xD;
      predominant feature of spasticity of the lower limbs. The clinical picture is composed of&#xD;
      difficulty walking, exaggerated deep reflexes, pathological reflexes such as the Babinski&#xD;
      sign, sphincter disturbances and various degrees of weakness as well as sensory disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spasticity is the symptom that provoques greater incapacity. Although there have been recent&#xD;
      advances in the genetic and pathogenic characterization of SPG there is scarcity of&#xD;
      therapeutic options. The Botulinum Toxin (BTx) is a well established treatment for movement&#xD;
      disorders such as cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and arm spastic following stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose the execution of a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment with Btx over&#xD;
      SPG patient's gait. The primary outcome measure will be gait velocity with the 10 meter&#xD;
      walking test 8 weeks after injection. Each participant will be submitted to one injection&#xD;
      session of Btx and one of placebo (consisting of sterile sodium chloride), each one separated&#xD;
      by a period of 6 months. The primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated by a blind&#xD;
      investigator 8 weeks after each injection session.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereditary spastic paraplegias (SPG) constitute a heterogeneous group of diseases with a&#xD;
      common predominant feature: spasticity of the lower limbs and difficulty walking. The&#xD;
      neurologic examination reveals spasticity, exaggerated and pathological reflexes, such as the&#xD;
      Babinski sign, and minor hypoesthesia. Spasticity is more evident when the patient walks than&#xD;
      during passive movement. Weakness may or may not be present, and typically is less disabling&#xD;
      than spasticity, especially during the initial years of the disease. The increase in tonus&#xD;
      leads to reduced amplitude of movement and abnormal posture, altogether leading to a very&#xD;
      slow gait, falls and articular deformities. Clinically, SPG is divided into pure and&#xD;
      complicated forms. The first one is characterized by almost exclusive dysfunction of the&#xD;
      pyramidal tracts. Minor sensory and sphincter disturbances are also present. The complicated&#xD;
      subtypes encompass a wide variety of associated features such as ataxia, cognitive decline&#xD;
      and vision loss. Genetically, SPGs are divided into autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive&#xD;
      and X-linked forms. Pure forms are mostly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, whereas&#xD;
      the autosomal recessive forms mostly manifest as complicated forms. Although useful&#xD;
      clinically, this genotype-phenotype correlation is not always true. The most used SPG&#xD;
      classification is based on the locus that harbors the mutated gene. Each subtype is&#xD;
      designated by the initials SPG, followed by a number that corresponds to a specific gene. The&#xD;
      gene number is established following the chronological order of identification of each locus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discovery of new genes and the unraveling of molecular pathways of SPGs have lead to a&#xD;
      better understanding of the disease in the past few years. Despite that, there are very few&#xD;
      treatment options . There is no placebo-controlled clinical trial performed to assess any&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention for SPG. Oral anti-spastic agents such as baclofen and tizanidine&#xD;
      are frequently employed. When the response is inadequate, or there are significant side&#xD;
      effects, botulinum toxin injections may be attempted. The substance blocks liberation of&#xD;
      acetylcholine from the pre-synaptic cleft. With less activation of the nicotinic receptors at&#xD;
      the post-synaptic junction the muscle contraction is inhibited. Botulinum Toxin (Btx) is a&#xD;
      first-line treatment for movement disorders such as cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and&#xD;
      spastic arm following stroke. Studies with Btx in patients with SPG are limited to small&#xD;
      open-label case series, and there is no solid evidence that patients actually benefit from&#xD;
      this therapy. The rationale basis for its use is based on the well established knowledge that&#xD;
      Btx reduces muscle tonus. The functional impact on gait, on the other hand, is not well&#xD;
      known, as well as the impact this treatment could produce over symptoms such as fatigue and&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification Spasticity is the most disabling manifestation in patients with SPG. Although&#xD;
      there have been recent advances in the genetic and pathogenic characterization of the&#xD;
      disease, there is scarcity of therapeutic options. The use of oral anti-spastics is limited&#xD;
      by frequent side effects such as somnolence and drowsiness. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Btx injections in patients with SPG. The primary outcome measure will&#xD;
      be gait velocity assessed through the 10 meter walking test 8 weeks after injection. Each&#xD;
      participant will be submitted to one injection session with Btx and one with placebo&#xD;
      (consisting of sterile sodium chloride), each one separated by a period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives General Objective To evaluate the effects of Btx compared to placebo injections in&#xD;
      a cohort of patients with SPG. The primary outcome will be increase in gait velocity, a&#xD;
      measure that reflects functional gain. Secondary outcomes will include measures of&#xD;
      spasticity, pain and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether Btx injections improve maximum gait velocity in patients with SPG&#xD;
           compared to injections of placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effects of the treatment versus placebo over the following functional&#xD;
           measures: Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS), Visual Analogic Pain Scale, Brief Pain&#xD;
           inventory, Modified fatigue impact scale, Ashworth Spasticity and muscle strength&#xD;
           (through the Medical Research Council Scale) for adductors and triceps surae muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients Selection Patients will be selected during regular consultations at two&#xD;
      University Hospitals in Brazil: the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) and the Federal&#xD;
      University of Paraná (UFPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Estimate The sample size calculus was based on a recent exploratory study (Niet,&#xD;
      2015) where 15 patients with autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia were submitted to Btx&#xD;
      injections at the triceps surae. This provoked and increase in gait velocity of 9% after 4&#xD;
      weeks and of 12% after 18 weeks. Estimating a 12% effect for an alfa value of 0.08 and a p&#xD;
      value of 0.05, the investigators obtained a N of 54 individuals after correcting for possible&#xD;
      losses (approximately 10%). The Stata version 13.1 was used for the estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures All patients recruited will be randomized to receive injections of Prosigne&#xD;
      (Botulinum Toxin A) or a Placebo solution (sterile Sodium Chloride 0.9%). Each patient in the&#xD;
      treatment group will receive 400 units of botulinum toxin. 100 units will be injected at&#xD;
      adductors at each leg and 100 units will be applied in each triceps surae bilaterally. The&#xD;
      botulinum toxin as well as the placebo solutions will be prepared by a blind investigator.&#xD;
      Prosigne will be diluted with sterile sodium chloride (10U/0.2mL). Within 24 to 28 weeks of&#xD;
      the first treatment groups will be switched. Those patients that received botulinum toxin&#xD;
      will receive a placebo solution and vice-versa (crossover point). During the study, all&#xD;
      patients will be oriented to maintain the ongoing use of medications. They will receive an&#xD;
      explanatory sheet regarding stretching exercises, at least one month before receiving&#xD;
      treatment, and will be trained by a physiotherapist to execute those exercises twice a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and interpretation Patients will be evaluated by an experienced and blind&#xD;
      neurologist regarding the efficacy parameters of the study. This evaluation will take place&#xD;
      immediately before each treatment section and 8 weeks after it. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be maximum gait velocity. Each patient will be asked to walk a 10 meter distance&#xD;
      barefooted 3 times, as fast as he can. The average velocity between the 3 trials will be used&#xD;
      as the final measure. Assistive devices are permitted. Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale&#xD;
      (SPRS), Ashworth modified spasticity scale, medical research council scale for muscular&#xD;
      strength (for adductors, thigh and triceps surae muscle groups), visual analogic scale of&#xD;
      pain, brief pain inventory and the modified fatigue impact scale, together with the 10 meter&#xD;
      comfortable walking velocity, will be evaluated at the same day as the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure and will serve as secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
