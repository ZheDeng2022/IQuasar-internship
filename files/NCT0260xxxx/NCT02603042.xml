    <textblock>
      Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized the abnormal development of&#xD;
      bones and teeth. These abnormalities occur due to defective mineralization, the process by&#xD;
      which bones and teeth take up minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. These minerals are&#xD;
      required for proper hardness and strength. Defective mineralization results in bones that are&#xD;
      soft and prone to fracture and deformity. Defective mineralization of teeth can lead to&#xD;
      premature tooth loss. The specific symptoms can vary greatly from one person to another,&#xD;
      sometimes even among members of the same family. There are five major clinical forms of HPP&#xD;
      that range from an extremely severe form that can cause stillbirth to a form associated with&#xD;
      only premature loss of baby (deciduous) teeth, but no bone abnormalities. Hypophosphatasia is&#xD;
      caused by mutations in the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) gene. This gene is&#xD;
      also known as the TNSALP gene. Such mutations lead to low levels of the tissue nonspecific&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase enzyme. Depending on the specific form, hypophosphatasia can be&#xD;
      inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypophosphatasia is an extremely variable disorder. Five major clinical forms have been&#xD;
      identified based primarily upon the age of onset of symptoms and diagnosis. These are known&#xD;
      as perinatal, infantile, childhood, adult, and odontohypophosphatasia. Generally, the&#xD;
      severity of these different forms of hypophosphatasia correlates to the residual alkaline&#xD;
      phosphate activity in the body, with less enzyme activity causing more severe dis- ease.&#xD;
      Because hypophosphatasia is a highly variable disorder, it is important to note that affected&#xD;
      individuals may not have all of the symptoms and that every individual case is unique. Some&#xD;
      children will develop severe complications early in life; others have mild disease that may&#xD;
      improve during young adult life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perinatal hypophosphatasia is associated with profound inactivity of alkaline phosphatase and&#xD;
      markedly impaired mineralization. Consequently, the skeleton fails to form properly in the&#xD;
      womb. Specific skeletal malformations may vary, but short, bowed arms and legs and&#xD;
      underdeveloped ribs often occur. Some pregnancies end in stillbirth. In other cases, affected&#xD;
      newborns survive for several days, but pass away from respiratory failure due to deformities&#xD;
      of the chest and underdeveloped lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infantile hypophosphatasia may have no noticeable abnormalities at birth, but symptoms may&#xD;
      become apparent at any time within the first six months. The initial symptom may be the&#xD;
      failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate for age and gender referred to as&#xD;
      &quot;failure to thrive.&quot; Some affected babies later exhibit early fusion of the bones of the&#xD;
      skull (craniosynostosis), which can result in the head appearing disproportionately wide&#xD;
      (brachycephaly). Craniosynostosis may be associated with increased pressure of the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid, a condition known as &quot;intracranial hypertension.&quot; This complication can&#xD;
      cause headaches, swelling of the optic disk (papilledema), and bulging of the eyes&#xD;
      (proptosis). Affected infants have softened, weakened bones that lead to the skeletal&#xD;
      malformations of rickets. Rickets is a bone disease that occurs during growth with softening&#xD;
      of bone and characteristic bowing deformities of the legs from growth plate abnormalities.&#xD;
      Enlarged wrist and ankle joints may occur. Affected infants may also have deformities in the&#xD;
      chest and ribs and rib fractures, predisposing them to pneumonia. Varying degrees of&#xD;
      pulmonary insufficiency and breathing difficulties may develop, potentially progressing to&#xD;
      life-threatening respiratory failure. Episodes of fever and bone pain, or tender bones may&#xD;
      occur. Some infants exhibit diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) so that a baby appears&#xD;
      &quot;floppy&quot; as well as elevated levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). Hypercalcemia&#xD;
      can cause vomiting, constipation, weakness, and poor feeding. In rare cases, vitamin&#xD;
      B6-dependent seizures may occur. Increased excretion of calcium may lead to kidney (renal)&#xD;
      damage. Sometimes there is spontaneous improvement in mineralization during early childhood,&#xD;
      with the exception of craniosynostosis. Short stature and skeletal deformities may persist&#xD;
      lifelong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childhood hypophosphatasia is highly variable, but is less severe than the infantile form.&#xD;
      Affected children may sometimes have craniosynostosis and exhibit signs of intra- cranial&#xD;
      hypertension. Skeletal malformations that resemble rickets may become apparent at 2 to 3&#xD;
      years of age. Bone and joint pain and fractures may occur. Baby teeth may fall out earlier&#xD;
      than normal. Some children are weak and experience delays in walking, and when they do learn&#xD;
      to walk may have a distinct, waddling gait. Spontaneous remission of bone symptoms has been&#xD;
      reported in young adult life, but such symptoms can recur during middle age or late&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult hypophosphatasia is characterized by a wide variety of symptoms. Affected individuals&#xD;
      have osteomalacia, a softening of the bones in adults. Some individuals have a history of&#xD;
      rickets during childhood, or have experienced premature loss of their baby teeth. Individuals&#xD;
      with adult hypophosphatasia can experience fractures, especially stress fractures in the feet&#xD;
      or pseudofractures of the thigh. Repeated fractures can result in chronic pain and debility.&#xD;
      Fractures of the spine seem less common, but also occur. Bone pain is a common complication.&#xD;
      Some affected adults develop joint inflammation and pain near or around certain joints due to&#xD;
      the accumulation of calcium crystals (calcific periarthritis) or a condition called&#xD;
      chondrocalcinosis, characterized by the accumulation of calcium crystals within the cartilage&#xD;
      of joints, sometimes damaging the joint. Others have sudden, severe pain in the joint (pseudo&#xD;
      gout). Affected adults may experience loss of adult teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Odontohypophosphatasia is characterized by the premature loss of teeth in childhood, or loss&#xD;
      of teeth in adulthood. It is an isolated finding that does not occur along with the&#xD;
      characteristic bone symptoms of other forms of hypophosphatasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hypophosphatasia, mutations in the ALPL gene can be inherited in an autosomal recessive&#xD;
      or autosomal dominant manner. The perinatal and infantile forms of HPP are inherited in an&#xD;
      autosomal recessive manner. The childhood form can be autosomal recessive or autosomal&#xD;
      dominant. The adult form and odontohypophosphatasia typically are autosomal dominant&#xD;
      disorders, but in rare cases can be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnosis of hypophosphatasia is based upon identification of characteristic signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, and a variety of&#xD;
      laboratory tests including x-ray studies. Proper diagnosis of hypophosphatasia is easy for&#xD;
      physicians who are familiar or experienced with this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future&#xD;
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from&#xD;
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose&#xD;
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;
