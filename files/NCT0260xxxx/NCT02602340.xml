    <textblock>
      This project aims to identify brain and behavioral characteristics of individuals&#xD;
      experiencing symptoms of depression that will predict the effectiveness of Behavioral&#xD;
      Activation Therapy. Brain imaging aspects of the study will use functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). Behavioral assessments will include&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires, computer-based and observational tasks, and interviews.&#xD;
      Assessments will focus on how individuals process positive information (such as reward) and&#xD;
      negative information (such as distressing images), as well as how people make decisions.&#xD;
      These assessments will be conducted across 2-3 in-person sessions prior to beginning the&#xD;
      treatment, and will be repeated across 2-3 in-person sessions after completing treatment. A&#xD;
      blood draw will also be conducted pre- and post- treatment. Behavior Activation therapy will&#xD;
      consist of 10, 90-minute weekly therapy sessions conducted in small groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anxiety and mood disorders are the most prevalent class of mental health disorders, with&#xD;
      lifetime prevalence estimated at 32% and 18%, respectively. These disorders have tremendous&#xD;
      personal and socioeconomic impacts (cost &gt;$1500 per-patient/year) due to days lost at work,&#xD;
      increased health care utilization, and increased risk of mortality (e.g. cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease). First-line treatments for depression include pharmacologic (e.g. selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and psychotherapeutic interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy and behavioral therapy). While both are superior to placebo treatments, only 40-60%&#xD;
      of patients experience significant improvement and 15-25% of responders relapse within one&#xD;
      year. Thus, long-lasting improvements are experienced by less than 50% of patients. This&#xD;
      ineffectiveness has been moderately associated with symptom severity, illness duration, and&#xD;
      comorbidity, but these findings do not provide any strategies for improving treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness. The current study will seek to identify behavioral or cognitive-affective&#xD;
      predictors that indicate how well a patient is responding to treatment so that interventions&#xD;
      can be further individualized to more effectively treat refractory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify whether neural, biological, and behavioral responses&#xD;
      related to the arbitration of conflicting avoidance and approach drives can predict behavior&#xD;
      therapy response for depressed individuals. This aim will be accomplished using behavioral,&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and genetic analyses pre and post Behavioral&#xD;
      Activation therapy. Research subjects will include treatment-seeking individuals with&#xD;
      clinically significant symptoms of unipolar depression. Diagnosis will be assessed using&#xD;
      structured clinical interviews. Anxious and depressive symptom severity, personality&#xD;
      characteristics, and general functioning will be collected via self-report paper-and-pencil&#xD;
      questionnaires. Objective measures of approach, avoidance, and conflict behavioral responses&#xD;
      will be collected using computer-administered testing and related neural responsivity will be&#xD;
      measured using fMRI. For exploratory aims, a blood draw will be collect pre and&#xD;
      post-treatment to examine genetic factors that may predict response to behavior therapy. This&#xD;
      research has the potential to identify neural and behavioral approach-avoidance&#xD;
      characteristics that can help predict which patients are likely to respond to behavior&#xD;
      therapy for depression (i.e., predictors of treatment effectiveness) and reveal targets for&#xD;
      future treatment modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Clarify the potential contribution of approach-avoidance behaviors and neural&#xD;
      responses to depression symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: Approach-related behaviors and conflict arbitration behavior will explain a&#xD;
      significant amount of variance in depressive symptoms, above and beyond avoidance-related&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Activations within approach-related (i.e., striatum) and conflict arbitration&#xD;
      (i.e., lateral PFC) neural circuitry will explain significant variance in depressive symptom&#xD;
      severity above and beyond activations within avoidance-related (i.e., amygdala) neural&#xD;
      circuitry. Specifically, the investigators expect increased levels of depression to relate to&#xD;
      reduced striatal responsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify approach-avoidance behaviors and neural responses that predict the&#xD;
      effectiveness of behavioral activation therapy (BA) for depressed subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1: Approach-related behaviors and/or conflict arbitration behavior will help&#xD;
      predict treatment response above and beyond avoidance-related behavior and baseline symptom&#xD;
      severity. Specifically, the investigators expect that decreased reward sensitivity will&#xD;
      predict nonresponse of depressed patients to BA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2: Approach-related and conflict arbitration neural circuitry will help to&#xD;
      predict treatment response above and beyond activations within avoidance-related neural&#xD;
      circuitry. Specifically, the investigators expect striatal responsivity to reward to predict&#xD;
      response of depressed patients to BA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Identify whether functional improvement with BA is associated with change in&#xD;
      approach-avoidance behaviors and/or neural responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.1: The level of change in reward sensitivity will positively relate to the level&#xD;
      of improvement in overall functioning with BA.&#xD;
