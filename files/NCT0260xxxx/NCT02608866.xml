    <textblock>
      The investigators proposed this randomized study to determine the feasibility of delivering&#xD;
      single-fraction 16-Gy versus 3-fraction 24-Gy toward spine metastatic lesion and to evaluate&#xD;
      their toxicity profiles. The investigators' analysis will provide robust data as well as&#xD;
      predictive factors regarding the outcome after SSRS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although conventionally fractionated radiation therapy has been utilized for decades, the&#xD;
      rates of complete pain relief and local control for complex tumors are sub-optimal. The&#xD;
      management of patients with spine metastasis has undergone a great deal of change in the past&#xD;
      5 years. Improvements in neuroimaging, computer-assisted treatment planning, and radiation&#xD;
      therapy techniques have led to the development of extracranial radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSRS is rapidly being adopted in the clinic as preliminary applications of SSRS appears&#xD;
      promising. However, the role of SSRS remains in its infancy and lacked high-quality evidence&#xD;
      about the treatment schedule and lacked a solid understanding of the adverse events. The&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0631 phase 2/3 study was initiated to determine&#xD;
      whether a more intensive radiation dose delivered by image guided 16-Gy dose single fraction&#xD;
      SRS could improve pain control and quality of life as compared with conventional&#xD;
      external-beam radiotherapy in patients with localized spine metastases . While other group&#xD;
      used treatment schedule in a total dose of 27-30 Gy in three fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events such as vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is a fairly low-risk&#xD;
      adverse event after conventional radiotherapy, nevertheless, the crude risk estimates for VCF&#xD;
      after spinal stereotactic body radiation therapy is relative more frequent. Previous reports&#xD;
      has raised the caution about the given dose and predictive factors, however; whether these&#xD;
      two most widely used SSRS schedule (ie. single fraction versus three fractions) provide&#xD;
      equivalent pain control and minimal side effects remained to be answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was no randomized trials to assess the SSRS treatment response and SSRS induced grade 3&#xD;
      or higher adverse events between the two most widely adopted scheme. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      proposed the randomized study to determine the feasibility of delivering a single 16-Gy SRS&#xD;
      dose versus 3 fractions 24-Gy SRS dose and tried to evaluate the toxicity profile and gain&#xD;
      robust data as well as predictive factors regarding the risk of complications after SSRS,&#xD;
      including VCF. The investigators will incorporate the recently developed and reported&#xD;
      reliable Spinal Instability Neoplastic Scoring (SINS) system and well-designed patient&#xD;
      reported outcome measures (PROMs) into the protocol to predict the adverse event and quality&#xD;
      of life of each participant. The researchers also tried to investigate the possible&#xD;
      associations of the potential bone biomarkers for the risk assessment of SSRS-related adverse&#xD;
      bone events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the patients were randomized for treatment arms, the effectiveness of SSRS treatment&#xD;
      scheme and adverse profile can be investigated more properly in the present study.&#xD;
