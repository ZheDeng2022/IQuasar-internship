    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      Amivantamab as a monotherapy and in combination with lazertinib, and to determine the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) (monotherapy), recommended Phase 2 combination dose (RP2CD)&#xD;
      (combination therapy), and to determine recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2q3W) with combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Amivantamab in combination with standard of care carboplatin and pemetrexed) in&#xD;
      21 day treatment cycle for participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

      This open label (all participants know the identity of the study drug), multicenter (more&#xD;
      than one study site), first-in-human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a Amivantamab&#xD;
      Monotherapy and Combination Dose Escalations and Part 2 Amivantamab Monotherapy and&#xD;
      Combination Dose Expansions. In Part 1, participants with evaluable NSCLC will be enrolled&#xD;
      into cohorts at increasing dose levels of Amivantamab monotherapy, the RP2CD of the&#xD;
      Amivantamab and lazertinib combination which will be administered in 28 day treatment cycles,&#xD;
      and RP2q3W of Amivantamab in combination with standard of care carboplatin and pemetrexed&#xD;
      (chemotherapy combination) which will be administered in 21 day treatment cycles. The dose&#xD;
      will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD, or maximum administered dose [MAD],&#xD;
      if no MTD is found) is reached. Part 1 will follow a traditional 3+3 design. At each dose&#xD;
      level, 3 participants will complete Cycle 1. If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in&#xD;
      these 3 participants, then escalation will continue in a new cohort of 3 participants. Data&#xD;
      from Part 1 will be used to determine one or more RP2D regimen(s). In Part 2, participants&#xD;
      with documented epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and measurable disease,&#xD;
      whose disease has progressed after previous treatment will be enrolled and receive&#xD;
      Amivantamab at the RP2D determined in Part 1 as a monotherapy at the RP2D regimen(s), or in&#xD;
      combination with lazertinib at the RP2CD regimen. For both parts, the study consists of&#xD;
      following periods: an optional pre-Screening period; a Screening period (up to 28 days prior&#xD;
      to the first dose of study drug); a Treatment period (first dose of study drug until 30(+7)&#xD;
      days after the last dose of study drug or prior to starting any subsequent anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment, whichever comes first); and a Follow Up period (approximately 6 months). All&#xD;
      participants will be followed for survival in the post-treatment follow-up period until the&#xD;
      end of study and safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

             validated IHC assay performed by the central laboratory and have progressed on prior&#xD;
             platinum-containing chemotherapy and PD-1/L1 therapy, either as a combined regimen or&#xD;
             as a separate line of therapy. Eligibility may be determined through IHC analysis of&#xD;
             either archival (pre-screening) or mandatory fresh tumor tissue collected during the&#xD;
             Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0&#xD;
             or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has uncontrolled inter-current illness, including but not limited to&#xD;
             poorly controlled hypertension, or diabetes, ongoing or active infection, (that is,&#xD;
             has discontinued all antibiotics for at least one week prior to first dose of study&#xD;
             drug), or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements. Participants with medical conditions requiring chronic continuous oxygen&#xD;
             therapy are excluded. For Part 1 Chemotherapy Combination Cohort only: additionally,&#xD;
             participants with active bleeding diathesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had prior chemotherapy, targeted cancer therapy, immunotherapy, or&#xD;
             treatment with an investigational anticancer agent within 2 weeks or 4 half-lives&#xD;
             whichever is longer, before the first administration of study drug. For agents with&#xD;
             long half-lives, the maximum required time since last dose is 4 weeks. Toxicities from&#xD;
             previous anti-cancer therapies should have resolved to baseline levels or to Grade 1&#xD;
             or less, (except for alopecia [any grade], Grade less than or equal to [&lt;=] 2&#xD;
             peripheral neuropathy, and Grade less than [&lt;] 2 hypothyroidism stable on hormone&#xD;
             replacement). For Part 1 Combination Dose Escalation: Any previous treatment with&#xD;
             systemic anti-cancer immunotherapy, including but not limited to anti-PD-1,&#xD;
             anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 agents. For Part 1 Chemotherapy Combination Cohort only:&#xD;
             Any previous treatment with systemic anti-cancer immunotherapy in the past 3 months or&#xD;
             localized radiotherapy to lung within the past 6 months. For Part 2 only: Cohorts A&#xD;
             and B: Prior treatment with chemotherapy for metastatic disease is not allowed unless&#xD;
             the tumor mutation carries de-novo resistance to EGFR TKI (example, Exon 20&#xD;
             insertions). Cohort C and MET-1: Prior treatment with more than 2 lines of cytotoxic&#xD;
             chemotherapy for metastatic disease (maintenance therapy is not included). Cohort D:&#xD;
             Previous treatment with an EGFR TKI with activity against EGFR Exon 20 insertions&#xD;
             (such as poziotinib). Cohort E (combination Amivantamab and lazertinib): Any previous&#xD;
             treatment in the metastatic setting with other than a first, second, or third&#xD;
             generation EGFR TKI. Cohorts WT-Ad and WT-Sq: more than three lines of prior systemic&#xD;
             therapy in the metastatic setting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with untreated brain metastases. Participants with definitively,&#xD;
             locally-treated metastases that are clinically stable and asymptomatic for at least 2&#xD;
             weeks and who are off or receiving low-dose corticosteroid treatment (&lt;=10 mg&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to study treatment are eligible.&#xD;
             Exception: participants with asymptomatic, untreated brain metastases, each less than&#xD;
             1 cm in diameter, may be eligible for Amivantamab and lazertinib combination therapy&#xD;
             in the Part 1 Combination Dose Escalation or Part 2 Combination Expansion Cohort E&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history of malignancy other than the disease under study within 3&#xD;
             years before Screening (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin&#xD;
             and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, with concurrence with the sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured&#xD;
             with or minimal risk of recurrence within a year from Screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has not fully recovered from major surgery or significant traumatic injury&#xD;
             prior the first dose of study drug or expects to have major surgery during the study&#xD;
             period or within 6 months after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has, or will have, any of the following: a. An invasive operative&#xD;
             procedure with entry into a body cavity, within 4 weeks or without complete recovery&#xD;
             before Cycle 1 Day 1. Thoracentesis, if needed, and percutaneous biopsy for baseline&#xD;
             tumor tissue sample may be done less than 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, as long as&#xD;
             the participant has adequately recovered from the procedure prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug in the clinical judgement of the investigator; b. Significant traumatic&#xD;
             injury within 3 weeks before the start of Cycle 1 Day 1 (all wounds must be fully&#xD;
             healed prior to Day 1); c. Any medical condition that requires intact wound healing&#xD;
             capacity and is expected to endanger subject safety if wound healing capacity would be&#xD;
             severely reduced during administration of the investigational agent; d. Expected major&#xD;
             surgery while the investigational agent is being administered or within 6 months after&#xD;
             the last dose of study drug&#xD;
