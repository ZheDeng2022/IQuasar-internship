      This research will test the effect of mass media or mass media plus a clinic based education&#xD;
      program will improve appropriate aspirin use for cardiovascular disease prevention. It is a&#xD;
      group randomized design of 24 geographic areas in Minnesota with adjacent states serving as&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;

      Proposed is a demonstration and implementation project to increase the appropriate use of&#xD;
      aspirin for primary prevention of acute myocardial infarction and stroke in the population of&#xD;
      Minnesota. Although significant progress in the reduction of acute myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      stroke is apparent, these cardiovascular disorders continue as the leading causes of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. In recent years, and in the context of the positive results from&#xD;
      large randomized clinical trials, there is growing consensus that aspirin, when appropriately&#xD;
      used, reduces cardiovascular morbidity in men aged 45-79 and women aged 55-79 years. The use&#xD;
      of aspirin for primary prevention was recommended in the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force&#xD;
      Report in 2009 and more recently in the CDC/CMS 'Million Hearts' ABCs (aspirin, blood&#xD;
      pressure, cholesterol, smoking) campaign. Aspirin use is also recommended in the Healthy&#xD;
      People 2020 goals. However, many adults who would benefit, are not taking aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have been fortunate to receive a large philanthropic donation to launch a&#xD;
      campaign to increase appropriate aspirin use in the State of Minnesota. The proposed grant&#xD;
      requests funding to evaluate that campaign and the innovative approaches it proposes. In the&#xD;
      context of a innovative mass media effort, the investigators intend to test new methods for&#xD;
      health system change to increase appropriate aspirin use. Using a two-arm design, the&#xD;
      investigators have defined 24 geographic areas in the state that will form the basis for a&#xD;
      group-randomized trial. This design will allow us to distinguish the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention methods. The interventions will be evaluated by sequential surveys of the&#xD;
      target-age general population at baseline and follow-up. Appropriate aspirin use in that&#xD;
      population will be the primary goal and endpoint. Simultaneous surveys of adjacent Upper&#xD;
      Midwestern states (Iowa, North and South Dakota, Wisconsin) will assess secular trends.&#xD;
      Morbidity and mortality data will monitor disease trends and complications associated with&#xD;
      aspirin use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial pilot study in a middle sized community in Northern Minnesota allows us to&#xD;
      refine and validate our intervention and measurement methods at the community level. This&#xD;
      pilot also demonstrated behavior change of a magnitude supportive of our design assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program, if successful, should result in a generalizable program tested in a real world&#xD;
      population setting.&#xD;
