    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an abnormal bulging of the main abdominal artery,&#xD;
      which is the called the abdominal aorta. The purpose of this observational study is to&#xD;
      identify whether a blood biomarker protein RhoA can predict which small AAA patients may need&#xD;
      surgery in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients will receive an ultrasound and blood draw. The patients will be&#xD;
      divided into expanding and stable aorta groups after determining each patient's aortic&#xD;
      expansion rate. The blood RhoA levels and aortic expansion rates between both groups would&#xD;
      then be compared to look for any relationships.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an asymptomatic problem until rupture occurs, causing&#xD;
      excruciating pain and sudden death. It is diagnosed typically by ultrasound when the aortic&#xD;
      diameter is ≥ 3.0 cm and an aortic diameter ≥ 5.5 cm generally requires surgical repair to&#xD;
      prevent rupture. A normal aorta is 2.0 cm in diameter. For patients with small AAA (3.0-5.4&#xD;
      cm) serial imaging studies is recommended along with risk factor modification. However,&#xD;
      follow up ultrasound protocols are difficult to follow, resulting in many patients with&#xD;
      expanding AAA not being detected until too late. To streamline and better identify patients&#xD;
      with small AAAs at risk for expansion, the investigators look to RhoA as a possible&#xD;
      biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit within a 3-year period a total of 200 subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      small AAA 3.0-5.4 cm diameter from the VA Northern California Health Care System. All&#xD;
      subjects enrolled will already have a baseline aortic diameter established at the time of&#xD;
      initial AAA screening or diagnostic imaging. The investigators expect the follow up&#xD;
      ultrasound measurement for this study will be at least 1 to 5 years after their baseline&#xD;
      ultrasound study. The follow up evaluation will then assess expansion rates of the aorta.&#xD;
      Stable aorta subjects will have an expansion rate of less than 0.2 cm/year and expanding&#xD;
      aorta subjects will have an expansion rate ≥ 0.2 cm/year as based on preliminary data. After&#xD;
      the ultrasound, 30 ml of blood will be drawn into heparinized tubes and undergo blood&#xD;
      analysis for the RhoA protein in monocytes. All patients will be notified of the possible&#xD;
      need to return back for either clinical reason: AAA greater than 5.5 cm or research protocol&#xD;
      reasons: inadequate monocyte collection or changing clinical data requirements.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular risk factors will also be collected. All collected data between stable and&#xD;
      expanding AAA groups will then be compared for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If biological or clinical risk factors are identified as reliable biomarkers for AAA&#xD;
      expansion, then AAA screening programs could be modified to increase screening yield and&#xD;
      improve surveillance for small AAAs. Additionally, novel diagnostic techniques could be&#xD;
      developed to better identify small AAA patients at risk for surgery.&#xD;
