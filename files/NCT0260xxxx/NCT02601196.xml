      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reviewing the relevant medical data the investigators assume that treating a woman with&#xD;
      intramural fibroid not distorting the uterine cavity or mostly intramural with less than 50%&#xD;
      submucosal component with Ulipristal Acetate (UPA) for a 13 weeks course would reduce the&#xD;
      fibroid size and improve her chance for conceiving by IVF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A proof of concept prospective not randomized study. The patients: About 20&#xD;
      women treated in the fertility and IVF unit after at least one IVF failure, with mostly&#xD;
      intramural (IM) fibroid [class 2-5 by FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and&#xD;
      Obstetrics) classification system] in the size of &gt;4 cm confirmed by Transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
      (TVUS) and diagnostic hysteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After US examination and diagnostic hysteroscopy to ascertain suitability for this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will offer a course of 13 weeks treatment with UPA 5 mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after cessation of treatment the investigators will perform another TVUS&#xD;
      examination &amp; diagnostic hysteroscopy plus endometrial biopsy in order to assess the&#xD;
      endometrial &amp; uterine status and will conduct an additional IVF cycle, using the same&#xD;
      stimulation protocol undertaken during the immediate cycle previous to the UPA treatment&#xD;
      course.&#xD;

      Ulipristal Acetate - Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leiomyomas are well established factors to affect fertility. The key factor for fertility&#xD;
      disturbance is the fibroid location and not its size. The presence of submucosal fibroids has&#xD;
      long been known to reduce fertility as opposed to subserosal fibroids which do not alter&#xD;
      fertility. The effect of intramural fibroids on fertility is still a mystery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings were best described in a meta-analysis of 23 studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With no respect to location, women with fibroids have a lower chance for ongoing&#xD;
           pregnancy or live birth (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.59-0.83) and a greater chance for spontaneous&#xD;
           abortion (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.37-2.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with fibroids that were submucosal or intramural with an intracavitary component&#xD;
           were less likely to become pregnant (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.74) and more likely to have&#xD;
           a spontaneous abortion (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The picture is less clear for women with intramural fibroids. Overall, studies of women&#xD;
           with fibroids that did not distort the uterine cavity were less likely to become&#xD;
           pregnant (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94), less likely to have an ongoing pregnancy or to&#xD;
           deliver a live newborn (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.58-0.85) and more likely to have a spontaneous&#xD;
           abortion (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to these findings, women with cavity-distorting fibroids who undergone&#xD;
           myomectomy had a significant increase in conception rate (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.08-3.83).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There were no significant differences between women who had myomectomy for intramural&#xD;
           fibroids and those who did not go through surgical treatment, although the data for this&#xD;
           issue is quite lame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another strong evidence for the relevance of intramural fibroids for fertility can be found&#xD;
      in a meta-analysis that evaluated the association between non-cavity-distorting intramural&#xD;
      fibroids and IVF outcome, this study shows a significant decrease in the live birth (RR 0.79,&#xD;
      95% CI 0.70 -0.88) and clinical pregnancy rate (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 - 0.94) in women with&#xD;
      non-cavity-distorting intramural fibroids compared with those without fibroids, following IVF&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulipristal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulipristal acetate (UPA) is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) prescribed for&#xD;
      women with symptomatic leiomyomas. Few phase 3 studies were conducted in order to prove its&#xD;
      clinical use and efficacy in treating women suffering from fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PEARL (PGL4001 Efficacy Assessment in Reduction of Symptoms Due to Uterine Leiomyomas) I&#xD;
           was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial (48 patients in the placebo&#xD;
           arm, 95 treated with daily dosage of 5 mg &amp; 94 with 10 mg of UPA) proving that treatment&#xD;
           with UPA 5 mg or 10 mg once daily for a 13 weeks course is efficient in controlling&#xD;
           uterine bleeding (91% &amp; 92% respectively) in comparison to placebo (19%), P&lt;0.001 for&#xD;
           each dose. The rates of amenorrhea were 73%, 82% and 6% respectively. The median change&#xD;
           in total fibroid volume was -22%, -12% &amp; +3% (p=0.002 for the 5 mg group &amp; 0.006 for the&#xD;
           10 mg group in comparison to the placebo group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PEARL II was a double blind non-inferiority trial comparing UPA (5 mg or 10 mg once&#xD;
           daily) treatment for 3 months to once-monthly IM Leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg (97 patients&#xD;
           in the 5 mg arm, 103 in the 10 mg arm &amp; 101 treated by Leuprolide acetate). The rates of&#xD;
           uterine bleeding were comparable between the three groups - 90%, 98%, 89%. Median times&#xD;
           to amenorrhea were 7 days, 5 days, 21 days - respectively. Adverse effects in the matter&#xD;
           of moderate to severe hot flashes were much more common for women treated with&#xD;
           Leuprolide acetate - 40% in comparison to those treated with UPA (11% for the 5 mg group&#xD;
           &amp; 10% for the 10 mg group, p&lt;0.001 for both groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In November 2014 Luyckx et al. published a retrospective analysis of a series of 52 patients&#xD;
      from one medical center (participants in PEARL II or PEARL III) - of these patients, 21&#xD;
      wished to conceive upon treatment completion - 15 of them (71%) succeeded for a total of 18&#xD;
      pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Median time to conceive was 10 months after completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two women who did not need myomectomy after completion of the UPA treatment achieved 3&#xD;
           of the pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 pregnancies were after myomectomy (8 by laparoscopy, 7 by laparotomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 of the pregnancies (6 of 18, 33%) resulted in early missed abortion while 12 of the&#xD;
           pregnancies ended in the live births of 13 babies. The relative high ratio of&#xD;
           miscarriage can be related to the age of the women (median 36.4 years) and to high&#xD;
           proportion of IVF (3/6 miscarriages).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only one of the deliveries was a vaginal delivery, 7 had elective cesarean delivery and&#xD;
           4 had emergent cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There was no significant fibroid regrowth during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There was only one fetal anomaly in this cohort - in a patient who was treated by a new&#xD;
           UPA course while she was already pregnant (unexpectedly) - a fetus showing ectopic right&#xD;
           kidney on the inferior pole of the left kidney. A review of pregnancies after exposure&#xD;
           to mifepristone to induce abortion or UPA given as emergency contraception shows no&#xD;
           additional risk for congenital anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective progesterone receptor modulators as UPA are well known to induce endometrial&#xD;
      modification known as PAEC (Progesterone receptor modulators Associated Endometrial Changes)&#xD;
      - these changes are benign, non-proliferative &amp; non-physiological. This histological pattern&#xD;
      is apparent in a large proportion of women after 13 weeks UPA treatment course (in PEARL I -&#xD;
      74.2% of the patients in the 5 mg group &amp; 70.4% in the 10 mg group; in PEARL II 65.1% in the&#xD;
      5 mg group &amp; 69.8% among the treated with 10 mg UPA). Endometrial biopsies taken six months&#xD;
      after treatment cessation showed return to normal histological endometrial appearance. In&#xD;
      both RCT's all endometrial biopsy examinations taken after week 13 showed only benign changes&#xD;
      except: (a) one patient after 5 mg UPA treatment whose specimen showed simple hyperplasia and&#xD;
      (b) one patient in the placebo group with complex atypical hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reviewing the relevant medical data the investigators assume that treating a woman with&#xD;
      intramural fibroid not distorting the uterine cavity or mostly intramural with less than 50%&#xD;
      submucosal component with UPA for a 13 weeks course would reduce the fibroid size and improve&#xD;
      her chance for conceiving by IVF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A proof of concept prospective not randomized study. The patients: About 20&#xD;
      women treated in our fertility and IVF unit after at least one IVF failure, with mostly&#xD;
      intramural fibroid [class 2-5 by FIGO classification system] in the size of &gt;4 cm confirmed&#xD;
      by TVUS and diagnostic hysteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After US examination and diagnostic hysteroscopy to ascertain suitability for our study, we&#xD;
      will offer a course of 13 weeks treatment with UPA 5 mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after cessation of treatment the investigators will perform another TVUS&#xD;
      examination &amp; diagnostic hysteroscopy plus endometrial biopsy in order to assess the&#xD;
      endometrial &amp; uterine status and will conduct an additional IVF cycle, using the same&#xD;
      stimulation protocol undertaken during the immediate cycle previous to the UPA treatment&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data - Age, BMI. Obstetrical data - Gravida, para. Gynecological data - Hormonal&#xD;
      profile, uterus size, fibroids features (location, size), infertility features (duration,&#xD;
