    <textblock>
      WelTel Oak Tree is a repeated measures study that enrolled 85 HIV+ individuals from the Oak&#xD;
      Tree Clinic at BC Women's Hospital. Participants were be provided with a cell phone and/or&#xD;
      unlimited text messaging capability if they do not have it already, and for one year received&#xD;
      a weekly text message stating &quot;How are you&quot;. Participant problems and non-responses were be&#xD;
      followed up by a nurse. Data on demographics, CD4 counts, HIV viral loads, HIV medication&#xD;
      adherence and attendance at appointments was collected for the year prior to the intervention&#xD;
      and during the intervention for comparison. Data assessing quality of life was also collected&#xD;
      at three points during the one year study period. Cost effectiveness and cost benefit of the&#xD;
      intervention is being studied to assess feasibility of transferring the intervention to a&#xD;
      programmatically funded facet of patient care.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide a weekly text messaging intervention to 85 high risk HIV+ participants attending&#xD;
      the Oak Tree HIV Clinic in order to improve medication adherence, attendance at appointments&#xD;
      and subsequently, CD4 counts and HIV viral load values over a 1 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada, around 65,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS, approximately 14,300 of whom are&#xD;
      women. AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART) has led to enormous improvements in the health and&#xD;
      survival of individuals with HIV. Moreover, by decreasing the amount of virus circulating in&#xD;
      the body (viral load), HAART offers the possibility of treatment as a preventative measure.&#xD;
      However, high levels of engagement in care, timely initiation of ARVs, and adherence to&#xD;
      medication are required to maximize the benefits of HAART in order to prevent resistance,&#xD;
      progression to AIDS, transmission or mortality. Unfortunately, engagement in ongoing HIV care&#xD;
      can be poor, with one study from the United States (US) showing only 52% retention in care&#xD;
      over 1 year. Further, adherence among high-risk populations is low, with women being less&#xD;
      adherent partly due to their role as care providers for children and partners, potential&#xD;
      abuse in partner relationships, fear of stigma, homelessness, and concerns regarding side&#xD;
      effects. Conversely, active drug use (especially cocaine), lack of social supports, and&#xD;
      depression are just a few of the variables that affect both men and women alike. Current&#xD;
      methods of engagement in care have failed to overcome these barriers to adherence, which&#xD;
      makes finding an effective adherence intervention critically important. Mobile health&#xD;
      (mHealth), the use of mobile phone technology to deliver health care, is an emerging area of&#xD;
      disease management that can assist in patient adherence to prolonged chronic treatment&#xD;
      regimens and monitoring of care. A randomized controlled trial (WelTelKenya1), conducted by&#xD;
      Dr. Richard Lester et. al, tested the clinical effectiveness of text message support for HIV&#xD;
      treatment adherence in Kenya. WelTelKenya1, of which 67% were women, showed that patients&#xD;
      receiving text message support had significantly higher rates of treatment adherence and&#xD;
      viral suppression than patients who received standard care alone. In Canada, cell phone&#xD;
      penetration exceeds 70% and is expected to reach 100% within the next decade. The WelTel&#xD;
      system offers a clinical management model that can be carried out using standard services&#xD;
      offered by cellular network providers with minimal additional infrastructure and is both&#xD;
      flexible and scalable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have completed one of the first studies of text messaging support for HIV&#xD;
      care in Canada. The pilot study called WelTelBC1 involved 25 individuals from five patient&#xD;
      groups 1) Non-suppressed (CD4 &lt;200, VL &gt;250); 2) Youth (ages 14-24); 3) Mature (Age ≥50); 4)&#xD;
      English as a second language; and 5) Distance (those residing 3+ hours travel time from the&#xD;
      clinic), who receive a weekly text message asking them &quot;How are you?&quot; Participants were then&#xD;
      instructed to respond with &quot;OK&quot; or to let the investigators know if they had a problem.&#xD;
      Participants who responded that they are &quot;not okay&quot; or did not respond were then followed up&#xD;
      by a clinic nurse. The pilot study was designed to look at feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      the weekly text messaging intervention in a Canadian HIV+ population, and resulted showed&#xD;
      that the intervention was been perceived as beneficial among participants. In regards to&#xD;
      acceptability, the pilot study has been extremely informative, and has enabled investigators&#xD;
      to engage participants previously only seen sporadically; overcoming gaps that prevent&#xD;
      optimal care and follow-up. In addition, we have seen from our pilot project, that to reach&#xD;
      those in most need of a link to care we need to be prepared to provide cell phones and phone&#xD;
      plan support to those without one (only 50% of those enrolled in our intervention owned a&#xD;
      cell phone, and only 40% had unlimited text messaging - anecdotally these are the patients&#xD;
      with whom engagement has most improved during the intervention). It is now critical to expand&#xD;
      this program to all individuals at Oak Tree Clinic who could benefit and to study the&#xD;
      efficacy of this intervention in engaging patients in care and improving adherence to HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Selection and Recruitment: A list of patients with a CD4 count ≤500 or previous&#xD;
      prescription for antiretroviral therapy (other than for pregnancy) prior to the control year,&#xD;
      as well as a detectable viral load (≥200) in the control year was assembled. The list was&#xD;
      reviewed by the clinic physicians, nurse, pharmacist, dietician, counselor, outreach worker&#xD;
      and social worker to determine which patients would benefit most from participating in the&#xD;
      WelTel text messaging program (i.e. poor engagement in care, difficult to contact, poor or&#xD;
      non-adherence to ARV therapy, advanced HIV infection/AIDS, vulnerable or socially isolated&#xD;
      patients). A consensus based approach was used for patient selection. In addition, all 25 of&#xD;
      the Oak Tree pilot study participants (WelTelBC1), were invited into the current study. Once&#xD;
      nominated, when patients attended clinic for a clinical visit, they were introduced to the&#xD;
      WelTel intervention concept. Those interested were approached by research staff for a full&#xD;
      explanation. The intervention protocol was the same as that used for the WelTelBC1 pilot&#xD;
      study at Oak Tree, developed through use of patient questionnaires as well as patient and&#xD;
      health care worker focus groups/interviews at Oak Tree, and yet very similar to the&#xD;
      intervention used in the initial WelTelKenya1 intervention. Following fully informed&#xD;
      consenting with completion of consent forms, participants were provided with a cell phone&#xD;
      with unlimited text messaging if they did not have one, or if they had their own cell phone,&#xD;
      had their plan topped up to include unlimited text messaging service. Baseline clinical data&#xD;
      including historical CD4 counts, and HIV viral loads were abstracted from patient charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, study participants were asked to complete a Quality of Life Assessment (QOL)&#xD;
      questionnaire (the SF-12 questionnaire) at study entry (0 months), mid-way through study (6&#xD;
      months +/- 6 weeks) and at study exit (12 months +/- 6 weeks). The questionnaire consisted of&#xD;
      12 questions; was self-administered or interviewer administered; and took between 10 -15&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention protocol was the same as that used for the WelTelBC1 pilot study. This was&#xD;
      modeled on the WelTelKenya1 intervention but adapted to the Oak Tree Clinic patient&#xD;
      population through the use of patient questionnaires as well as patient and health care&#xD;
      worker focus group and individual interviews. Each Monday, patients received a text message&#xD;
      from a number not traceable to the clinic stating simply &quot;How are you?&quot; Patients were&#xD;
      instructed to respond to the message if they are &quot;OK&quot; or to state that they have a problem.&#xD;
      Messages were reviewed and triaged daily by our program research team member and in all cases&#xD;
      of a negative or complex response other than OK, participants were contacted by the program&#xD;
      nurse (patients were instructed that this is NOT an emergency service). Non-responders&#xD;
      received a second text message on Wednesday at 12:00 pm (48 hours after the initial text sent&#xD;
      out), and if there was no response, were contacted by the program nurse Wednesday afternoon&#xD;
      or Thursday morning for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants wiwere asked their ethnicity at study enrolment. Participants were also asked to&#xD;
      complete a 12 question QOL assessment questionnaire at study entry, mid-way through the study&#xD;
      and at study end. Frequency of attendance in care was assessed from the outpatient clinic&#xD;
      electronic booking system. Chart abstraction of clinical health status included: participant&#xD;
      age (in years), housing status, current illicit drug use and postal code, CD4 counts and&#xD;
      percentages, HIV viral loads, antiretroviral drug (ARV) regimen (including date of initiation&#xD;
      or discontinuation), and degree of medication adherence (as determined from timing of ARV&#xD;
      refills, and self-report), which was collected at baseline then at each clinical visit for&#xD;
      the following one year. All available like data for one year prior (up to 2 years if in the&#xD;
      Pilot Study) to enrollment in the WelTel program was alsocollected such that participants&#xD;
      served as their own controls in the intervention (repeated measures study), and for the year&#xD;
      following the intervention to assess the longevity of the intervention's impacts. Staff costs&#xD;
      / savings were calculated by looking at Pharmacy, Nursing and Outreach worker time used both&#xD;
      prior to and throughout the intervention. The planned duration of the intervention was one&#xD;
      year, and of the study, 18 months. At that time data was analyzed and the program evaluated.&#xD;
