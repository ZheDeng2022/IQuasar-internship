    <textblock>
      A pilot study was conducted, randomized, triple-blind study with allocation concealment.&#xD;
      Which consisted in the application of KT in the anterior tibial muscle for 24 hours. 14&#xD;
      subjects were randomized into 2 groups: intervention (with voltage) and sham (no pressure).&#xD;
      Patient's gait footage was shot in the opening balance of phases, average balance and initial&#xD;
      contact (first without the application of Kinesio Taping and after 24 hours of application)&#xD;
      to be measured the angles of the ankle joints, knee and hip. Balance was assessed by the&#xD;
      Biodex Balance System platform, configured to analyze the postural stability in level eight.&#xD;
      The mean differences were assessed (MD) between groups and confidence interval (CI) of 95%.&#xD;

      The sample was selected from the list of patients waiting for care in Kinesiology Laboratory&#xD;
      and Functional Assessment of the Department of Physical Therapy, Federal University of&#xD;
      Pernambuco - UFPE where the operation was performed. In the period from May to July 2014. The&#xD;
      study was approved by the Ethics Committee in Research with Human beings of the Health&#xD;
      Sciences Center of UFPE, CAAE 15238913.9.0000.5208. On admission, patients were informed&#xD;
      about the research, met the free and informed consent. Randomization was taken by&#xD;
      randomization.com site, and the allocation concealment was done with opaque and sealed&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for application of Kinesio Taping As for the protocol, the intervention group and&#xD;
      the sham group underwent the same way care for skin preparation. Trichotomy, when necessary&#xD;
      was held; the skin was cleaned with alcohol and dry with a paper towel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They were used as a reference point between the proximal fibular head and the tibial&#xD;
      tuberosity (point A) and the apex of the first metatarsal (Point B). The experimental group&#xD;
      received the voltage for activating muscle and were positioned to receive the application of&#xD;
      KT in accordance with the manual taping kinesio - Kenzo Kase method. And only one tape mark&#xD;
      was used, which is recommended by the Kinesio Taping Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KT application in the intervention group The patient was placed on a stretcher in the supine&#xD;
      position, his ankle was positioned in plantar flexion and inversion (maximum amplitude&#xD;
      achieved passively by the patient), a measure was held between Point A and B with a tape&#xD;
      measure, then immediately KT was removed from the paper and cut to the same extent. The KT&#xD;
      was pulled to its maximum limit and measured with a tape for a second evaluator. This measure&#xD;
      found after the maximum tensile strain represented 100% and a rule of three was applied in&#xD;
      order to find the 35% voltage for muscle activation. The tension of KT was calculated to&#xD;
      ensure an approximate voltage to all participants in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finding the measure of 35% strain in centimeters, the evaluator cut KT this measurement&#xD;
      and the same was discarded. Finally the tape was positioned at Point A; pulled up to Point B;&#xD;
      and fixed. This procedure was carried out with the ankle positioned in plantar flexion and&#xD;
      inversion, maximum amplitude achieved passively by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KT application in the sham group The sham group received the tape applied without tension.&#xD;
      The patient was positioned supine; the ankle was placed in a neutral position (90 degrees);&#xD;
      and measured between Point A and Point B with a tape measure placed on the skin was&#xD;
      performed. Once registered this measure in centimeters the evaluator cut the KT with the same&#xD;
      measure, but without the presence of paper attached to it to ensure that there was no&#xD;
      tension, because the KT needs a minimum voltage to be applied on paper. After measured and&#xD;
      cut the KT, it was applied to the patient in the supine position with the ankle positioned at&#xD;
      90 degrees with no traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images of funding for procedures The patient was markers (pressure ball) in the lower limbs&#xD;
      at predetermined anatomical points: head of the fifth metatarsal, below the midpoint of the&#xD;
      lateral malleolus, head of the fibula, lateral femoral condyle and greater trochanter of the&#xD;
      femur. They recorded images with a Digital Camcorder (CANON PowerShot A2600) fixed to a&#xD;
      tripod. Environmental calibration was performed by a board calibration with 120 cm high, with&#xD;
      a tag of 60 cm, which was calibrated at the midpoint of the focus of the camcorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recording were filmed right and left profiles of the patient. This was dressed in&#xD;
      shorts containing a side screen, allowing viewing and palpation of anatomical points already&#xD;
      mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the markers at the anatomical points the patient was encouraged to walk on a&#xD;
      flat track with eight meters long by three times, the two central meters used. The 1ºgravação&#xD;
      was carried out without application of KT and the patient was instructed to walk at their&#xD;
      normal pace of the march. After application of KT patient returned and was released after 24&#xD;
      hours. They were placed markers in pre-determined anatomical points and the patient was&#xD;
      encouraged to walk again on track in its normal rhythm of the march to the 2nd recording&#xD;
      taking place with the same conditions of the first day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Balance evaluation The tool used to assess postural balance was the Biodex Balance System,&#xD;
      a device used in order to check and / or train in closed kinetic chain static and dynamic&#xD;
      postural stability in patients with one foot or bipedal. The apparatus consists of two&#xD;
      components: an adjustable platform 12 different levels of stability, being &quot;1&quot; the more&#xD;
      unstable level and &quot;12&quot; as static level and a display, which is given a feedback of the&#xD;
      location of the center of mass of the individual. The level used in Postural Stability test&#xD;
      was 8 (following the manual protocol) for providing low loss of balance and postural&#xD;
      adjustment the patient uses the ankle strategy, in which there is greater participation of&#xD;
      the gastrocnemius muscles to a previous imbalance and tibialis anterior for a subsequent&#xD;
      imbalance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The display demonstrates a point on the screen as center of pressure of the patient and their&#xD;
      displacement is attributed to the balance of the body that is quantified by CP movement in&#xD;
      the anterior / posterior direction (generating the index of anterior / posterior stability:&#xD;
      IAP) and medial / side (generating medial stability index / side: IML) together IAP and the&#xD;
      IML result in the general stability index (GSE), the higher the value the higher indices the&#xD;
      body of the swing, ie, the greater the instability in patients. In addition to providing the&#xD;
      percentage of evaluation time within each zone (A, B, C and D) and each quadrant (I, II, III&#xD;
      and IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the balance through the BBS used the level 8 in the test Postural&#xD;
      Stability. The test was performed three times with a duration of 20 seconds, with 10 seconds&#xD;
      interval between repetitions, with the first evaluation, four replications and excluding the&#xD;
      first to reduce the potential effects of learning. The result was considered a final average&#xD;
      of three tests for each variable. All values are saved on your computer and recorded in a&#xD;
      spreadsheet by the evaluator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry out the balancing test, age and the patient's height were recorded on the equipment,&#xD;
      then the participant was asked rise in the BBS platform and the positioning of the feet was&#xD;
      also recorded. Was asked to what patient adopt a comfortable posture with arms along the&#xD;
      body, did not move the feet of the place throughout the test, put the ball in the center of&#xD;
      the picture and look at the phone's display throughout the duration of the evaluation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction Rating Twenty-four hours after application of patients returned to service and&#xD;
      KT was removed. Then the patients were asked about their satisfaction with the use of Kinesio&#xD;
      with the question: &quot;Did you notice positive differences regarding the use of KT to facilitate&#xD;
      the walk? &quot;. For the answer patients had two options &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; And they could express&#xD;
      verbally how and where was this positive difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the images The images were captured in the sagittal plane in video form and then&#xD;
      transferred to a computer and analyzed by the Free Software Tracker - Tool analysis and&#xD;
      physical modeling videos. The software was used to analyze joint angles of knee, hip and&#xD;
      ankle. They were selected frames of three gait phases: opening balance, average balance and&#xD;
      initial contact. At each stage of it was marked angles of the ankle, knee and hip; each angle&#xD;
      was measured 3 times to produce an average angular. The image calibration done in software&#xD;
      using a tag in the center of the track in black with 60 cm length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data were tabulated in Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and then reviewed by&#xD;
      a researcher blinded to the status of the groups. Statistical analysis was performed using&#xD;
      SPSS 13.0 for Windows versions. To characterize the sample was used descriptive analysis&#xD;
      using measures of central tendency (mean) and dispersion (standard deviation) for&#xD;
      quantitative variables and frequency for categorical variables. Due to the small sample size,&#xD;
      non-parametric tests were used. For intergroup analysis was performed Mann-Whitney test and&#xD;
      intra-group analysis was done Wilcoxon obtaining differences between the groups and their&#xD;
      respective confidence intervals (95% CI). The level of significance with statistical&#xD;
      difference was p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
