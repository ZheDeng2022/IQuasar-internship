    <textblock>
      Before starting treatment with XR-NTX, a medication that blocks the positive effects of&#xD;
      opioids and helps people stay off opioids, individuals who are dependent on opioids first&#xD;
      have to endure a difficult withdrawal process. This study aims to develop and test an&#xD;
      intervention to help people who are opioid dependent successfully complete that transition;&#xD;
      the investigators will also develop and test a comparison condition aimed at reducing HIV&#xD;
      risk behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid dependence is a serious and increasingly pervasive problem. Opioid dependent&#xD;
      individuals are at significantly increased risk for a wide range of physical and&#xD;
      psychological problems including HIV and STIs. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is an&#xD;
      effective treatment for opioid dependence, but it requires that opioid-dependent individuals&#xD;
      be completely opioid-free prior to its initiation to avoid precipitated withdrawal. The great&#xD;
      majority of individuals attempting to cease opioid use will relapse before initiation of&#xD;
      XR-NTX because of opioid withdrawal symptoms during detoxification. Distress Tolerance (DT)&#xD;
      focused psychosocial interventions are well suited to address the clinical phenomena&#xD;
      experienced by individuals withdrawing from opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to develop a DT intervention to improve detoxification&#xD;
      outcomes and an active comparison intervention targeting HIV and STI (HIV/STI) risk behavior.&#xD;
      The DT intervention will be adapted from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The HIV/STI&#xD;
      risk behavior intervention will target behaviors that put patients at risk for HIV and STIs&#xD;
      including unprotected sex and needle sharing, as well as promoting regular HIV testing. Both&#xD;
      interventions will be delivered through a telehealth videoconferencing system. If the HIV/STI&#xD;
      intervention is found to result in reduced HIV/STI risk behavior and more frequent HIV&#xD;
      testing, relative to the DT intervention, the investigators will incorporate its components&#xD;
      into the DT intervention prior to launching a large-scale clinical trial. The long-term&#xD;
      objective of this research program is to improve substance use and HIV/STI outcomes for&#xD;
      opioid dependent individuals attempting to cease opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1 of this project, the investigators will develop and pilot a DT intervention for&#xD;
      individuals transitioning to XR-NTX and a time-matched HIV/STI risk reduction comparison&#xD;
      intervention; both will be developed using an iterative process of piloting and modification&#xD;
      based on data collected from pilot participants. In Phase 2, opioid dependent individuals&#xD;
      transitioning to XR-NTX will be randomly assigned to DT, HIV/STI, or Treatment-As-Usual. All&#xD;
      patients will receive medication assisted detoxification from the study recruitment site. It&#xD;
      is expected that, as a result of this project, the investigators will have developed a&#xD;
      well-specified and novel DT intervention tailored to meet the needs of opioid dependent&#xD;
      patients transitioning to XR-NTX, the efficacy of which can be further tested in future Stage&#xD;
      II randomized controlled trials. If found to be efficacious, this intervention will serve as&#xD;
      an effective means of facilitating detoxification and opioid antagonist initiation, reducing&#xD;
      the individual and societal burden due to opioid dependence.&#xD;
