  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocular melanomas have been treated for a long time by enucleation, with an unfavorable major&#xD;
      impact on the patient's quality of life, social life, self-image, how they feel about others&#xD;
      and about living with this disability. As a matter of fact, classical radiation therapy by&#xD;
      photons is not accurate enough to deliver a sufficiently high dose to eradicate a melanoma&#xD;
      without causing irreversible ocular brain complications since these tumors are &quot; relatively&#xD;
      radio resistant &quot;. The possibility of delivering high doses due to the precision of protons&#xD;
      (&quot;Bragg peak&quot;) has allowed to overcome this limitation. The conservative uveal melanoma&#xD;
      treatment has become a standard after the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS)&#xD;
      indicating an equivalent rate of metastases and a non-impaired survival rate with a&#xD;
      conservative treatment when compared to immediate enucleation. The quality of life benefits&#xD;
      due to a conservative treatment has been demonstrated. Protontherapy dose has been defined in&#xD;
      an empirical manner, it is probably excessive even if it applies to radio-resistant tumors.&#xD;
      In France, radiotherapy by protons for choroidal melanomas delivers a dose of 60 Gy cobalt&#xD;
      equivalent (that is 52 measured Gy, or &quot; Physical dose&quot;) in 4 fractions and 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referential treatment of ocular melanomas (other than conjunctiva) indicates proton-therapy&#xD;
      for T1, T2, T3 &lt; 40% of ocular volume, and T4 only if extra scleral extension ≤ 2mm. However,&#xD;
      there is an enucleation indication for T3 &gt; 40% of ocular volume and T4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our purpose is to override this relative contraindication, choroidal melanoma volume ≥ 40% of&#xD;
      ocular volume. As a matter of fact, the investigators observe an increasing demand from&#xD;
      ophthalmologists and patients for not performing primary enucleation. Also, during the last&#xD;
      five years treatment of complications have improved and a less &quot; hard &quot; hypo fractionation&#xD;
      (6.5 Gy per fraction) has equivalent local control results as for &quot; hard &quot; fractionation (13&#xD;
      Gy per fraction).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A more fractioned proton-therapy treatment, with doses per fraction of 6.5 Gy rather than 13&#xD;
      Gy, can limit the rate and the severity of complications degrading the quality of life by&#xD;
      complications (pain, diminished visual acuity) and treatments (intra-ocular injections...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will receive a total dose of 52 Gy in four 13 Gy sessions for the&#xD;
      standard arm and in eight 6.5 Gy sessions for the experimental arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect an identical local control rate within 2 year's time with a decrease&#xD;
      in rate and severity of severe complications due to adapted fractionation (eight sessions&#xD;
      with lower doses instead of four fractions with very high doses as it is usually recommended&#xD;
      in the guidelines for small to medium melanomas).&#xD;
