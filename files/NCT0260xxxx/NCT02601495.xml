      In this study the investigators will seek to improve their understanding of how positive and&#xD;
      negative valence systems, cognition, and arousal/interoception are inter-related in disorders&#xD;
      of trauma, mood, substance use, and eating behavior for women involved in a court diversion&#xD;
      program in Tulsa, Oklahoma (Women in Recovery). The investigators will recruit 100&#xD;
      individuals and use a wide range of assessment tools, neuroimaging measures, blood and&#xD;
      microbiome collections and behavioral tasks to complete the baseline and follow-up study&#xD;
      visits. Upon completion, the investigators aim to have robust and reliable dimensional&#xD;
      measures that quantify these systems and a set of assessments that should be recommended as a&#xD;
      clinical tool to enhance outcome prediction for the clinician and assist in determining who&#xD;
      will likely benefit from the diversion program, and to inform future revision or augmentation&#xD;
      of the program to increase treatment effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroscience has made tremendous progress in understanding the basic neural circuitry that&#xD;
      underlies important processes such as attention, memory, and basic emotion processing. Yet,&#xD;
      little progress has been made to utilize these insights to apply them to psychiatric&#xD;
      populations in order to make clinically meaningful predictions. The connection between&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders and their underlying neurobiology has been difficult to establish. The&#xD;
      overarching theme of this study is to determine how biological and objective behavioral&#xD;
      measures can contribute to improving assessment and treatment of women who attend a court&#xD;
      diversion program (Women in Recovery [WIR]) that includes treatment for mental health&#xD;
      symptoms. The investigators will use the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research&#xD;
      Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a heuristic approach that integrates neuroscience and&#xD;
      psychopathology to study the positive and negative valence systems, cognition and&#xD;
      arousal/interoception domains. Within this framework the investigators will study a group of&#xD;
      treatment seeking individuals with mental health conditions to determine how dysfunctions of&#xD;
      affect, substance use, and eating behavior organize across different levels and whether these&#xD;
      latent factors can be used to generate clinically useful prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using self-report, behavior, physiology, neural circuit, cell, molecule, and gene unit of&#xD;
      analysis measures, the investigators propose to enroll 1000 individuals from four different&#xD;
      cohorts over 5 years: (1) anxiety and/or depression; (2) eating problems; (3) substance use&#xD;
      problems; and (4) healthy controls. Each individual will undergo a multi-level assessment&#xD;
      that consists of (a) a standardized diagnostic assessment, (b) self-report questionnaires,&#xD;
      (c) behavioral tasks, (d) physiological measurements, (e) structural and functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG, (f) biomarker and microbiome assessments, (g) blood to&#xD;
      derive induced pluripotent stem cells, (h) and genetic and epigenetic assessments. These&#xD;
      individuals will be followed up for one year and will be re-assessed using a multi-domain&#xD;
      assessment of functioning, which will include: (a) symptom severity and duration, (b)&#xD;
      subjective well-being, (c) psychosocial function, (c) occupational function, (d) physical&#xD;
      health, (e) utilization of mental health resources (treatment), and (f) compliance with&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
