  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find an effective and sustainable approach to reducing disparities in&#xD;
      accessing mental health services for an underserved and growing population group of&#xD;
      low-income, racially diverse, homebound older adults. It will compare two aging-service&#xD;
      integrated, teledelivered depression treatments for these seniors. One model is short-term&#xD;
      problem-solving therapy by licensed clinicians; the second model is self-care management&#xD;
      support by trained lay advisors. The findings are expected to create a foundation of&#xD;
      information for guiding the implementation of acceptable, effective, and sustainable&#xD;
      depression care within widely available aging-service infrastructures.&#xD;

      The long-term objective of the proposed study is to improve access to depression treatments&#xD;
      for low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors, a population experiencing significant&#xD;
      disparities in mental health care due to their homebound and low-income status. Specific aims&#xD;
      are to compare the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, treatment cost, and budget impact&#xD;
      of the two teledelivered treatment delivery models: problem-solving therapy (PST) by licensed&#xD;
      clinicians and self-care management (SCM) support by trained lay mental health&#xD;
      workers/advisors. The interventionists will be integrated into an aging-service agency;&#xD;
      hence, integrated tele-PST (IT-PST) ad integrated tele-SCM (IT-SCM). Although&#xD;
      tele-psychotherapy is likely to be an effective mental health service delivery model for the&#xD;
      target population, the current and projected shortage of such clinicians and the costs of&#xD;
      deploying highly trained professionals pose barriers to this model's widespread real-world&#xD;
      adoption and sustainability. A more plausible option may indeed have to utilize trained lay&#xD;
      mental health workers. The study participants will be 276 low-income, racially diverse&#xD;
      homebound seniors who are served by a home-delivered meal (HDM) program and other&#xD;
      aging-service agencies in Austin, Tex. In a 3-arm, pragmatic clinical trial with&#xD;
      randomization prior to consent (a preferred public health approach), the participants will&#xD;
      receive five sessions of IT-PST, five sessions of IT-SCM, or five telephone check-in calls&#xD;
      (for the usual care-UC-group). Our first hypothesis is that IT-PST and IT-SCM will be equally&#xD;
      acceptable to the participants. Our second hypothesis is that both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be&#xD;
      more effective than UC in reducing depressive symptoms, although IT-PST may be more effective&#xD;
      than IT-SCM. Symptoms will be assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (HAMD) at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Additional outcomes will be depression-free&#xD;
      days (DFDs) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Our third hypothesis is that IT-SCM will have a&#xD;
      lower delivery cost than IT-PST, but both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more cost-effective than&#xD;
      usual care. The analyses include (a) comparisons of delivery costs between IT-PST and IT-SCM;&#xD;
      (b) assessment of cost-effectiveness (CEA) based on DFDs and health-related quality adjusted&#xD;
      life-year measured by EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D); and (3) budget impact (BIA) of IT-PST relative to&#xD;
      IT-SCM. Both CEA and BIA will employ a hybrid public program perspective of the AoA and the&#xD;
      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Public health significance of this study is that the data&#xD;
      will help aging-service providers and funders assess respective strengths and weaknesses of&#xD;
      each model as a sustainable approach to providing depression care for an underserved and&#xD;
      growing population group and improving their access to evidence-based mental health services.&#xD;
      (The terms older adults and seniors are used interchangeably because the latter term is&#xD;
      frequently used in aging services.)&#xD;
