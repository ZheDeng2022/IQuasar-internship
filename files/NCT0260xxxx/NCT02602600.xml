      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of treatment with Liraglutide on the&#xD;
      coronary microvasculature and angina symptoms, in overweight patients with microvascular&#xD;
      dysfunction and angina pectoris but no coronary artery stenosis.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with symptoms and signs of ischemia are referred to coronary angiography (CAG) or CT&#xD;
      angiography (CT-CAG). A significant proportion of these patients and especially women appear&#xD;
      to have no obstructive coronary stenosis. Patients with angina-like symptoms and no&#xD;
      macrovascular coronary stenosis have previously been considered without increased risk of&#xD;
      major cardiovascular events, but novel data indicate that this assumption may not be true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal coronary flow and metabolic response to stress have been reported, which is&#xD;
      consistent with a possible microvascular ethology for the symptoms. Both endothelium- and&#xD;
      non-endothelium dependent impaired coronary reactivity may contribute. The endothelium&#xD;
      dependent component has been linked to risk factors and pro-inflammatory processes promoting&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. The non-endothelium dependent mechanisms may involve vascular smooth muscle&#xD;
      cells, undergoing alterations in phenotype in response to physiological and&#xD;
      pathophysiological stimuli like hypertension and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both invasive and non-invasive diagnostic methods are available for the assessment of&#xD;
      coronary microvascular dysfunction. In the absence of a flow limiting stenosis upstream,&#xD;
      indirect measurement is possible by using transthoracic Doppler stress echocardiography&#xD;
      (TTDSE). TTDSE provides assessment of coronary blood flow velocity in one of the major&#xD;
      coronary vessels that can be used to determine coronary flow velocity reserve (CFR) after&#xD;
      hyperemia. This method does primarily assess the non-endothelium dependent component of&#xD;
      coronary microvascular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite reassurance that no stenosis on major coronary vessels is found, many patients&#xD;
      continue to have chest pain resulting in emergency visits, hospitalizations and repeat&#xD;
      cardiac catheterizations with adverse effect on quality of life, employment and health care&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for patients with angina symptoms are lacking when no macrovascular&#xD;
      coronary stenosis is found. Standard anti-angina treatments are usually tried, but do not&#xD;
      relieve symptoms in many of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies with Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists&#xD;
      demonstrate cardioprotective effects. However, the underlying mechanisms are often not well&#xD;
      defined. Many studies do not distinguish between direct versus indirect actions of GLP-1R&#xD;
      agonists, nor take into account the potential actions of the cleavage product, GLP-1. GLP-1R&#xD;
      is found in atrial cardiomyocytes in animal models and in the sinoatrial node in humans.&#xD;
      Furthermore endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells seem to be targets for GLP-1&#xD;
      action. In animal models GLP-1 promotes myocardial glucose uptake independent of insulin,&#xD;
      increases contractility and coronary flow and improves outcome and survival after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction in vivo. Limited data exists on the cardioprotective effect of GLP-1 in humans. A&#xD;
      few studies have evaluated the effect of GLP-1 in patients presenting acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction or stenosis of major coronary vessels, whereas no data exists on the effect in&#xD;
      patients with stable coronary artery disease. Two randomized studies have investigated the&#xD;
      effect of GLP-1 infusion in ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction, and found reduced&#xD;
      infarct size at three months follow-up. Several small pilot studies in patients with coronary&#xD;
      heart disease have found that GLP-1 infusion or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor improves&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction. None of the human trials have involved prolonged&#xD;
      treatment with GLP-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from previous work suggest that GLP-1 and weight loss may have beneficial effects on&#xD;
      microvascular circulation and cardiovascular risk factors. In a small cross-over study of 20&#xD;
      patients with type2 diabetes but no angina, 10 weeks of GLP1-R agonist treatment&#xD;
      (Liraglutide, 1,2 mg/day) led to a small but insignificant improvement in coronary&#xD;
      microcirculation, concomitant with a significant decrease in body weight and blood pressure&#xD;
      and improvement in glycemic control. Another study included overweight patients with ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease and found, that a mean weight loss of 10.6% achieved through a low energy diet&#xD;
      improved microvascular function (CFR) and coronary risk factors such as blood pressure, lipid&#xD;
      profile, and glycemic control (non-diabetics) as well as symptoms. Thus data on any&#xD;
      cardioprotective effect of long-term treatment with GLP-1 in humans is sparse, and it may be&#xD;
      speculated that any beneficial effect may be due to the weight lowering effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of treatment with&#xD;
      Liraglutide on the coronary microvasculature and angina symptoms, in overweight patients with&#xD;
      microvascular dysfunction (CFR≤2,5) and angina pectoris but no coronary artery stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Liraglutide improves microvascular function and alleviates symptoms in women with&#xD;
      angina pectoris and microvascular coronary dysfunction, but no obstructive stenosis of major&#xD;
      coronary vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design An open label trial consisting of a four-weeks control period without intervention,&#xD;
      followed by Liraglutide 3 mg once daily for 12 weeks + 2 weeks of weight maintenance diet.&#xD;
      Study participants will serve as their own controls during the first four weeks not receiving&#xD;
      treatment. Outcome parameters will be measured at baseline and at 4 and 18 weeks. The first&#xD;
      two measurements (baseline and four weeks measurements) will in this way serve as&#xD;
      documentation of the variance of repeated measurements. Blinding of participants and&#xD;
      investigators will not be possible due to the study setup, but investigators will be blinded&#xD;
      to pre- and posttreatment measurements when analysing results at the end of the study.&#xD;
      Furthermore investigator will be blinded to previous CFR measurements during data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug Liraglutide s a once daily human GLP-1 analogue with 97% linear amino-acid&#xD;
      sequence homology to human GLP-1. Liraglutide works by stimulating the release of insulin&#xD;
      only when glucose levels become too high and by inhibiting appetite. It lowers blood glucose&#xD;
      with the unique advantage that glucose lowering ceases when blood glucose gets into the&#xD;
      normal range. Liraglutide is approved in the EU and US for the treatment of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus at doses up to 1,8 mg administered subcutaneously once daily. Recently the US Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have approved&#xD;
      Liraglutide as obesity treatment. The indication is as an adjunct to lifestyle modifications&#xD;
      for chronic weight management in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2, or&#xD;
      BMI≥27 kg/m2 with at least one weight-related comorbidity such as dysglycaemia (pre-diabetes&#xD;
      or type 2 diabetes mellitus), hypertension, dyslipidaemia or obstructive sleep apnoea. The&#xD;
      max dose for obesity treatment is 3.0 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When prescribed with the aim of weight loss, Liraglutide is administrated subcutaneously and&#xD;
      titrated up to the maximally recommended dosage for obesity. By treating participants on the&#xD;
      indication overweight interference with other antihyperglycemic medications is avoided.&#xD;
      Treatment is initiated with 0.6 mg once daily for one week and increased weekly until the&#xD;
      recommended max dose of 3 mg. If it is not possible to reach maximal dosage due to adverse&#xD;
      effects, the participants will stay at the highest dose tolerated. Participants will be&#xD;
      excluded if they do not tolerate a treatment dose of at least 1.2 mg Liraglutide per day,&#xD;
      since a lower dosage is unlikely to result in a weight loss of at least 5% .Treatment&#xD;
      duration will be 12 weeks and the last two weeks will consist of a weight maintenance diet&#xD;
      before outcome measurements are done. On this dosage and duration a weight loss of at least&#xD;
      5% is expected. Participants will be advised to reduce calorie intake and increase physical&#xD;
      activity. Control of compliance will be made at visits by telephone calls (structured open&#xD;
      questions interviews) Furthermore participants will note every time the medication is taken&#xD;
      in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Study participants will be recruited from an ongoing multicenter study of women&#xD;
      with symptoms and signs of angina pectoris, 'Improving diagnosis and treatment of women with&#xD;
      angina pectoris and microvascular disease (iPower)'. Before inclusion in the iPower study,&#xD;
      participants have undergone CAG or CT-CAG with no significant stenosis of major coronary&#xD;
      vessels. As part of the iPower study the coronary flow reserve is measured by transthoracic&#xD;
      doppler stress echocardiography with dipyridamole induces stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic methods Fasting blood samples will be collected. Some of the blood samples will be&#xD;
      stored in a biobank. Blood samples will be stored until the end of the study (last patient,&#xD;
      last visit) plus five years, and the blood samples will be destroyed thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angina symptoms will be assess by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) which is a 19-item&#xD;
      health-related quality-of-life measure for patients with coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A score change of 10 points is clinically perceptible to patients and is considered a&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference, while a substantial change is considered to be a change of 20&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic measurements of CFR, systolic and diastolic function including strain will&#xD;
      be done both at rest and during dipyridamole induced stress. CFR is calculated as the ratio&#xD;
      between coronary flow velocity during hyperemia and rest. Coronary microvascular dysfunction&#xD;
      is defined as CFR&lt;2.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial function will be measured by flow mediated dilation (FMD). Peripheral endothelial&#xD;
      function correlates well with coronary endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A whole body dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan will be performed at baseline and after 18&#xD;
      weeks to estimate body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics There are two main outcomes: Microvascular function assessed by CFR and symptom&#xD;
      burden assessed by SAQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFR is a continuous response variable. A difference in repeated measurements within each&#xD;
      subject is found to be normally distributed with a standard deviation 0.35. If the mean&#xD;
      change in CFR post treatment is 0.23, the investigators will need to study 27 subjects to be&#xD;
      able to reject the null hypothesis that there will be no change in the mean CFR with&#xD;
      probability (power) 0.9. The Type I error probability associated with this test of the null&#xD;
      hypothesis is 0.05. At least 33 participants will be included in anticipation of around 20%&#xD;
      drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAQ has four subscales each with a score from 1-100. According to previous studies a change&#xD;
      in SAQ score of 10 points is perceptible by the patients and therefore clinically meaningful.&#xD;
      The investigators have not found data on within-study subject variation on SAQ. However,&#xD;
      previous trials have obtained changes in SAQ of 10-20 points after an intervention. Based on&#xD;
      these findings the investigators expect to see a change in SAQ score of at least 10 point. By&#xD;
      estimating a SD of 15, it is calculated that 26 study subjects is sufficient to attain a&#xD;
      statistical power of &gt;90% to detect a significant difference of 10 points post treatment in&#xD;
      any SAQ item.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the remaining secondary outcomes, if the response is normally distributed, the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to detect a true difference in the mean response of participants&#xD;
      of 0.66 x the SD of the within group change with a probability (power) 0.9. The Type I error&#xD;
      probability associated with this test of the null hypothesis, that the population mean is&#xD;
      unchanged after the intervention, is 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored by the unit for Good Clinical Practice (GCP-unit) at the&#xD;
      University of Copenhagen. Quality checks of data, data registry procedures and source data&#xD;
      verification will be performed by the GCP-unit.&#xD;
