  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vegetarian and vegan diets have been shown to reduce chronic disease risk, including diabetes&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease, as well as several cardiometabolic risk factors. Whether&#xD;
      vegetarian and/or vegan dietary patterns improve cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals&#xD;
      with diabetes remains unclear. To address the uncertainties, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the totality of the evidence from&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials to distinguish the effect of vegetarian and/or vegan diets on&#xD;
      the prevention and management of diabetes. The findings generated by this proposed knowledge&#xD;
      synthesis will help improve the health of consumers through informing evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients,&#xD;
      stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Vegetarian and/or vegan dietary patterns have been shown in prospective cohort&#xD;
      and cross-sectional studies to be associated with lower diabetes risk and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled trials also&#xD;
      suggest that vegetarian diets may be beneficial for glycemic control, blood lipids, weight&#xD;
      loss, and blood pressure. On the contrary, evidence from previous meta-analyses of&#xD;
      prospective cohort studies, as well as more recent prospective cohort studies have shown that&#xD;
      diets higher in animal protein, specifically in red meat, are associated with an increased&#xD;
      incidence of T2D. The effect of following a vegetarian/vegan dietary pattern on&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with diabetes is less clear. Furthermore, not all&#xD;
      diabetes guidelines recommend following a vegetarian and/or vegan dietary pattern for the&#xD;
      management of diabetes or they provide a low-grade evidence rating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials represent the highest level of evidence to support dietary guidelines and&#xD;
      public health policy development. As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted&#xD;
      toward food and dietary-pattern based recommendations, there is a need for systematic reviews&#xD;
      and meta-analyses comparing the role of vegetarian/vegan diets in the prevention and&#xD;
      management of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To improve evidence-based guidance for diabetes guidelines and public health&#xD;
      policy development, the investigators will conduct a series of systematic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses of the effects of vegetarian/vegan diets on cardiometabolic risk factors in&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes including measures of (1) glycemic control, (2) blood lipids, (3)&#xD;
      adiposity and (4) blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Each systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by&#xD;
      manual searches of references of included studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Dietary randomized controlled trials conducted in humans with a follow-up&#xD;
      duration ≥ 3 weeks investigating the effect of vegetarian/vegan diets on measures of (1)&#xD;
      glycemic control, (2) blood lipids, (3) adiposity, and (4) blood pressure will be included.&#xD;
      Studies that are not conducted in humans, not randomized, have an acute feeding design (&lt;3&#xD;
      weeks), lack a suitable control (non-isocaloric) and/or do not report viable endpoint data&#xD;
      will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and&#xD;
      assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved&#xD;
      by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The proposed syntheses will each assess a set of outcomes related to a different&#xD;
      area of cardiometabolic risk: (1) glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin),&#xD;
      (2) blood lipids (LDL-C, non-HDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides), (3) adiposity (body weight, BMI,&#xD;
      waist circumference), (4) blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Separate pooled analyses will be conducted for each area of cardiometabolic&#xD;
      control using the Generic Inverse Variance method. Random-effects models will be used even in&#xD;
      the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more&#xD;
      conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Exceptions&#xD;
      will be made for the use of fixed-effects models where there is &lt;5 included trials&#xD;
      irrespective of heterogeneity or small trials are being pooled with larger more precise&#xD;
      trials in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity. Paired analyses will be&#xD;
      applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochran's Q statistic and&#xD;
      quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If there are&#xD;
      &gt;=10 studies, then the investigators will also explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori&#xD;
      subgroup analyses by study design (parallel or crossover), follow-up duration (&lt;12 weeks or&#xD;
      ≥12 weeks), comparator diet, baseline measurements, risk of bias and diabetes duration.&#xD;
      Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup&#xD;
      analyses (e.g. age, sex, level of feeding control [metabolic, supplemented, dietary advice],&#xD;
      washout in crossover trials, energy balance of the background diet, composition of the&#xD;
      background diet [total % energy from fat, carbohydrate, protein], change in cholesterol&#xD;
      intake, change in glycemic index, etc.). Meta-regression analyses will assess the&#xD;
      significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. When &gt;=10 studies are&#xD;
      available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal&#xD;
      testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, then the&#xD;
      investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study&#xD;
      data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific&#xD;
      communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for&#xD;
      future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among&#xD;
      opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of&#xD;
      vegetarian/vegan diets in the prevention and management of diabetes, strengthening the&#xD;
      evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers&#xD;
      and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;
