      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) affects 2 - 3% of children and adolescents older than&#xD;
      10 years and is of unknown cause. It was initially thought that occurrences of back pain (BP)&#xD;
      were similar to the one encounter in healthy adolescents. Recently, literature has shown that&#xD;
      there is a two-fold prevalence of BP among AIS patients compared to healthy adolescents. As&#xD;
      such, BP appears as a condition that might have a detrimental effect on the well-being of AIS&#xD;
      patients and seems associated with increases in health care costs. Further, BP in adolescents&#xD;
      would appear to be a predictive factor for adult BP. Is vertebral manipulation (VM) a viable&#xD;
      alternative? Since 2006, four guidelines were in agreement as to the value of that approach&#xD;
      with acute or chronic BP in adults. Unfortunately, no study was found in adolescents. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to verify if VM is efficacious at improving AIS patients' back pain&#xD;
      and to find out if it can help these patients to obtain a better quality of life and improve&#xD;
      their spinal flexibility. Recruitment will take place at Ste Justine's hospital where&#xD;
      patients will have 2 evaluations, conducted by an independent orthopaedist (baseline and 4&#xD;
      weeks). Patients will be allocated to either the experimental (VM) or the usual medical care&#xD;
      group. Spinal manipulation treatment will last over a 4-week period. The study will be the&#xD;
      first trial evaluating the efficacy of vertebral manipulation in adolescent idiopathic&#xD;
      scoliosis patients with back pain. Finally, no other study was found on available and&#xD;
      effective treatment regarding back pain management for this population. A well-structured&#xD;
      trial is needed to provide clinicians with a better understanding and best evidence regarding&#xD;
      treatment protocols.&#xD;

      Introduction Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is defined by the Scoliosis Research&#xD;
      Society (SRS) has a three-dimensional deviation of the vertebral column of unknown origin&#xD;
      appearing in adolescents older than 10 years. Chronic non-specific back pain (CNSBP) is often&#xD;
      associated with adolescent scoliosis patients, and the associated prevalence is almost double&#xD;
      that of non-scoliosis healthy adolescents. Furthermore, CNSBP seems to be a predictor of&#xD;
      CNSBP in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies evaluated BP among AIS patients and in those who did, conflicting results,&#xD;
      regarding back pain prevalence, were observed. Among these, only two studies looked at back&#xD;
      pain in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Ramirez et al. retrospectively evaluated, 2442&#xD;
      scoliosis adolescent patients' files establishing BP prevalence at 32%. He concluded that the&#xD;
      established prevalence was similar to the one encountered in a general non-scoliotic&#xD;
      adolescent population. Joncas and Labelle prospectively evaluated 239 adolescents with&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis for the prevalence of BP. They observed that BP occurred in 54% of&#xD;
      patients, and the average pain intensity was 49,4 mm. More recently, Sato's studied back pain&#xD;
      prevalence in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. He conducted a large-scale&#xD;
      cross-sectional epidemiological study, where 43 630 children aged 9 to 15-year-old were&#xD;
      required to complete a take-home questionnaire. They reported a back pain prevalence of 58.8%&#xD;
      in scoliosis patients compared to 32.9% in non-scoliosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding BP Management in AIS Patients, a comprehensive review of the literature did not&#xD;
      yield any study on BP management in AIS patients. Spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) is a&#xD;
      recognised and safe treatment for low back pain and is performed primarily by chiropractors,&#xD;
      physical therapists, and osteopaths. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, only one&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial (Rowe 2006) has been conducted with children and adolescents diagnosed&#xD;
      with AIS. Though under powered, results showed that SMT was associated with only minor&#xD;
      adverse events, there was no curve progression in the treatment group, and quality of life,&#xD;
      evaluated by the Scoliosis Quality of life Index, has not been negatively impacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the paucity of literature on the management of back pain in nonsurgical AIS&#xD;
      patients, and considering the lack of evidence in regards to the efficacy of SMT for back&#xD;
      pain in adolescents, and the lack of guidance regarding management of back pain in&#xD;
      adolescents, it would be important to evaluate the effectiveness of SMT compared to usual&#xD;
      medical care for back pain among adolescents with idiopathic nonsurgical scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to verify the effect of Spinal Manipulative&#xD;
      Therapy on back pain management of adolescents with idiopathic nonsurgical scoliosis. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are two-fold: 1) to verify the effect of SMT on low back function, 2) to&#xD;
      verify the feasibility and acceptability of SMT according to patients' level of satisfaction.&#xD;
      This pilot study will be used to verify some implementation strategies before proceeding to a&#xD;
      subsequent larger trial, such as recruitment rate, treatment compliance and loss to follow&#xD;
      up, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Study Design This pilot study is a single prospective centre randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial with one experimental and one control group. This study will be recruiting from&#xD;
      Ste-Justine University Hospital in Montreal, Canada, and patients will be required to attend&#xD;
      at least 80% of the treatment sessions otherwise they will be considered as non-compliant.&#xD;
      Chiropractors will be recruited from their professional regulatory board. Different&#xD;
      instruments will be used during this trial: questionnaires; the Brief Pain Inventory&#xD;
      Questionnaire, and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire; the modified&#xD;
      Fingertip-to-floor distance, the modified-modified Schöber test, and the Biering-Sorenson&#xD;
      back muscles extensor test. Patients will be evaluated upon trial entry and at 4 weeks (end&#xD;
      of trial). Co-interventions will be documented and accounted in the analysis. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomized according to blocks of 4 to either the experimental (SMT) or the&#xD;
      control (UMC) arm after informed consent has been obtained. The randomisation list will be&#xD;
      generated and managed by an independent statistician. Statistical software SPSS version 22&#xD;
      will be used for data analyses. All analyses will be conducted under the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle. To ensure balance, groups will be compared for possible confounders (age, gender,&#xD;
      brace) at baseline. The group mean (Std. Deviation) and frequencies will be presented. Tests&#xD;
      will be 2-tailed, and the significance level will be set at 0.05. Statistical analysis will&#xD;
      include t-test (or Mann-Whitney) for continuous variables and χ2 for categorical variables.&#xD;
      Considering that patient's inclusion criterion is chronic pain, and that by definition&#xD;
      chronic pain is defined as constant over a period; the investigators expect this variable not&#xD;
      to be time influenced. Ste-Justine University Hospital ethical committee has approved this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>The intensity and quality of low back pain will be with the use of the Brief Pain Inventory. Questionnaire (BPI). This questionnaire is used to evaluate the quality and the intensity of pain and determine its impact upon the patient. The BPI includes 9 questions and uses an 11 -point scale (0 = &quot;no pain&quot;; and 10 =&quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;) to evaluate the intensity of pain at the time of being surveyed, pain at its worst, pain at rest, and average pain in the past week. This instrument also records the location of pain on a diagram using a human silhouette and requires patients to select words that best describe their pain.</description>

    <time_frame>The RMDQ will be administered at baseline and at four week follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assessed by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ).&#xD;
The RMDQ consists of 24 statements about activity limitations due to back pain, e.g. walking, lying and self-care. Patients are asked to answer yes or no to each statement. Each positive answer is worth one point with scores ranging from 0 (no disability) to 24 (severely disabled).</description>

    <measure>Spinal forward flexion</measure>
    <time_frame>The spinal forward flexion will be administered at baseline and at four week follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Spinal forward flexion will be evaluated using the Fingertip-to-floor distance (FTFD).&#xD;
The fingertip-to-floor test is performed while the patient is standing on a platform 30 cm from the floor. The distance between the patient's third finger and the platform is measured in centimetre and assigned a positive or negative value depending if the patient is unable to reach the platform fully or if the patient reaches further than the platform.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Spinal Forward Flexion</measure>
    <time_frame>The spinal forward flexion will be administered at baseline and at four week follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Spinal forward flexion will also be assessed using the Schöber test.&#xD;
The Schöber test uses two landmarks. An intersecting line to the line connecting both posterior superior iliac spines (PSIS) with the mid-line of the back and a mark drawn 15 cm above. Once these reference points are marked, the examiner asks the patient to bend forward as far as possible. The distance between the two-reference landmarks is then measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Isometric trunk extensor muscles endurance.</measure>
    <time_frame>The spinal forward flexion will be administered at baseline and at four week follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric trunk extensor muscles endurance will be evaluated using the Biering-Sorenson back muscle' extensor test. This test is performed while the patient is in a prone position with the lower half of the body below the level of the anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS) strapped to a plinth at the ankle, the knee and the hips. The test consists in measuring the amount of time a person can hold the unsupported upper body in a horizontal prone position with the lower body fixed to the examining table. The time during which the patient keeps the upper body straight and horizontal is recorded. In patients who experience no difficulty in holding the position, the test is stopped after 240 s.</description>
