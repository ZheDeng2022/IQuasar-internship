      Tumors of the UUT are rare and usually presenting as micro- or macrohematuria either&#xD;
      symptomatic or asymptomatic. Rapid advances in CT technology accelerated the research into&#xD;
      the application of this new technology in the evaluation of the UUT and readily proved to be&#xD;
      superior to other imaging modalities. Nevertheless the increase in radiation dose is a major&#xD;
      issue of concern. Initial research into the utility of MRI in the evaluation of the UUT was&#xD;
      promising, yet the success of CT together with the cost, limited availability and the longer&#xD;
      duration of MR urography (MRU) examination, nearly halted the investigations into the&#xD;
      feasibility of MRU which is unfortunate as MRU is a safe alternative to CT.&#xD;

      Images from a MDCT scan are reconstructed into thin slices which can be viewed in any&#xD;
      orientation with similar image quality compared to the original axial images. Completely&#xD;
      isotropic resolution in 16- to 64-slice CT can be achieved using 0.5- to 0.625-mm slice&#xD;
      thickness. Resulting images have high noise levels unless the tube load is increased&#xD;
      considerably. In most clinical situations a near-isotropic resolution with 1.0- to 1.5-mm&#xD;
      effective slice thickness suffices for high-quality images created in any plane using MPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ‬Research into the accuracy of CTU in the evaluation of possible UUT malignancy soon proved&#xD;
      CTU to be a very sensitive and specific method with pooled sensitivity of 96% (range&#xD;
      88-100%), and pooled specificity of 99% (range 93-100%). Furthermore direct comparison&#xD;
      confirmed the superiority of CTU over IVU in terms of sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce confusion in terminology, the European Society of Urogenital Radiology's&#xD;
      (ESUR) CTU Working Group proposes to define CTU as &quot;a diagnostic examination optimized for&#xD;
      imaging the kidneys, ureters and bladder. The examination involves the use of MDCT with&#xD;
      thin-slice imaging, intravenous administration of a contrast medium, and imaging in the&#xD;
      excretory phase.&quot; ESUR guideline comprehensively addresses all aspects of CTU based on&#xD;
      extensive literature review and on the opinion of leading researchers in this&#xD;
      field.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ To begin with, hydrating the patient is beneficial to reduce possible&#xD;
      contrast induced nephropathy especially in otherwise dehydrated or not well hydrated patient,&#xD;
      and at the same time provides negative bowel contrast medium. Usually 1 liter of water is&#xD;
      slowly ingested during a period of 20-60 minutes before the CTU examination or alternatively&#xD;
      a maximum of 500 ml slow intravenous drip-infusion of 0.9% saline may be used in patients who&#xD;
      cannot tolerate per oral hydration. Nevertheless the ESUR guideline also concludes that the&#xD;
      net benefit of intravenous saline bolus hydration is probably minimal and its routine use is&#xD;
      thus not advocated. Bowel preparation with positive contrast will inevitably interfere with&#xD;
      the interpretation especially in the demonstrative quality of reformatted images and is not&#xD;
      recommended. In diuretic-enhanced CT urography, the patients are asked to empty their bladder&#xD;
      before starting the CTU examination, nevertheless the ESUR guidelines have no stand on this&#xD;
      issue. The use of compression pads is a routine practice in IVU and consequently it was&#xD;
      thought that this maneuver can be transferred to the CTU protocol. However after evaluating&#xD;
      of the available evidence ESUR guideline do not advocate the use of compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are scanned in supine position. Prone position is not advocated to be used routinely&#xD;
      but can be used in special cases e.g. to reduce layering effects of the contrast medium,&#xD;
      especially when the renal collecting system is dilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the introduction of the rapid MDCT technology it became clear that this new imaging&#xD;
      modality is more accurate than IVU in the initial workout of a wide range of UUT pathology.&#xD;
      Images from a MDCT scan are reconstructed into thin slices which can be viewed in any&#xD;
      orientation with similar image quality compared to the original axial images. Completely&#xD;
      isotropic resolution in 16- to 64-slice CT can be achieved using 0.5- to 0.625-mm slice&#xD;
      thickness. Resulting images have high noise levels unless the tube load is increased&#xD;

&#xD;
      ‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬The first popular CTU protocol is the single-bolus&#xD;
      3-phase technique. After hydration, a low-dose unenhanced CT is acquired from the top of&#xD;
      kidneys to the base of the bladder, followed first by low-dose diuretic and 1-2 minutes later&#xD;
      by contrast injection. Imaging strategy after the administration of contrast material is&#xD;
      controversial with different protocols available aimed mainly to detect or rule out possible&#xD;
      malignancies and no scientific evidence is available on the superiority of specific&#xD;
      protocols. Contrast enhanced abdominal scan can be obtained at corticomedullary phase (25-35&#xD;
      s delay after start of contrast injection) or at nephrographic (delay of 90-110 s) or with a&#xD;
      combination of nephrographic-corticomedullary (so called dose-efficient or&#xD;
      arterial-nephrographic-corticomedullary phase after splitting of the contrast injection into&#xD;
      two or three bolus in modified protocols. The third excretory phase (240-480 s delay) is the&#xD;
      most important scan with the purpose of achieving excellent endoluminal opacification,&#xD;
      preferably with some UUT dilatation. Even better results are reported if acquisition is&#xD;
      further delayed to 720 s for improved depiction of the lower ureter while opacification of&#xD;
      other UUT segments are not sensitive to delay time. When low-dose furosemide is administered,&#xD;
      excretory phase delay may be reduced to an average of 450 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other CTU protocol is called the split-technique with considerably different protocols of&#xD;
      contrast bolus. The main idea is in the administration of one bolus of contrast followed by a&#xD;
      variable delays of 480-1,000 s (recent practices report 600-660 s delay) and then followed by&#xD;
      the injection of a second contrast bolus. After a constant delay of 90-120 s from the second&#xD;
      bolus, an abdominal scan is acquired and as the first injected contrast is already excreted,&#xD;
      the acquisition contains combined nephrographic and excretory phases in one scan therefore&#xD;
      reducing radiation dose. Further modifications of the split-bolus technique includes&#xD;
      triple-bolus contrast injection for the acquisition of combined&#xD;
      corticomedullary-nephrographic-excretory phase data some 510 s after start of the first bolus&#xD;
      with or without low-dose diuretics‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ ‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ Imaging of the UUT with MRI is&#xD;
      challenging and, as with other imaging modalities MRU, has its strengths and weaknesses. MRI&#xD;
      is susceptible to various artefacts including chemical shift misregisteration, wraparound,&#xD;
      phase-encoded motion and susceptibility artefacts, which might be more prominent at higher&#xD;
      field strength‬. Furthermore standing wave and conductivity artifact ‬are noticed in obese or&#xD;
      ascites patients at 3T imaging. Therefore good knowledge and experience of both normal&#xD;
      anatomy and artefacts are a prerequisite for correct image interpretation. MRI is lengthy&#xD;
      examination and needs patient cooperation. Breath-hold ultrafast sequences and the use of&#xD;
      parallel imaging reduces imaging time and are useful to obtain high quality images and hence&#xD;
      help reduce movement artifacts. It is also beneficial to raise the arms over the head during&#xD;
      coronal imaging to prevent wraparound artifact. In the investigators' experience reader&#xD;
      should be always familiar with the artefacts related to the enhanced excretion of urine such&#xD;
      as void lines and turbulence artefacts especially in the dilated pelvis. The investigators&#xD;
      also recommend imaging the UUT routinely in both axial and coronal planes during the&#xD;
      excretory phase.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ The&#xD;
      inability to visualize calcifications are considered as a limitation to the use of MRU in the&#xD;
      evaluation of UUT stone disease. Indeed possible stone is visualized as a partial or complete&#xD;
      intraluminal filling defect which is nonspecific and should be differentiated with blood clot&#xD;
      or tumor. Nevertheless, a clot is usually hyperintense at unenhanced sequence and do not&#xD;
      enhance after the administration of contrast and additionally the margins of the soft-tissue&#xD;
      abnormality are usually irregular compared with the well-defined margins of calculi. Opposite&#xD;
      to that a tumor will usually enhance. Therefore any MRU protocol should include both T2 and&#xD;
      T1 sequences and the latter both pre- and postcontrast sequences. The failure to do so might&#xD;
      result in misinterpretations, yet occasionally severe edema might be misinterpreted as of a&#xD;
      possible tumo. Different results from the literature should be interpreted with caution&#xD;
      because of the variability of used sequences and selection bias. Not all studies evaluating&#xD;
      the performance of MRU use both T1 and T2 sequences and as previously mentioned, T2 sequences&#xD;
      alone are insufficient to evaluate the cause of obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRU was shown to be superior to IVU in the detection of UUT stones. MRU was found to be at&#xD;
      least as accurate as helical CT in the evaluation of patients with acute flank pain. Also the&#xD;
      presence of secondary signs of obstruction such as the perirenal edema on the side of&#xD;
      symptoms are highly suggestive of acute obstruction and is better visualized at MRU than at&#xD;
      CT. Yet CT gained wider acceptance: CT is widely available, accurate and rapid imaging&#xD;
      modality in the evaluation of acute flank pain and stone disease. MRU is an acceptable&#xD;
      substitute in cases where the use of radiation is not desired in special patient populations&#xD;
      i.e. in children, young adults and pregnant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another limitation of MRU is in the slight underestimation of the size of ureteral stones&#xD;
      compared to CT and IVU. Also, according to the published results, small ureteral stones can&#xD;
      be occasionally missed in chronic obstructions, especially when the secondary signs of acute&#xD;
      obstruction are absent to raise the suspicions of a stone disease. Additionally MRU is&#xD;
      insensitive in the detection of small calyceal stones therefore cannot reliably evaluate the&#xD;
      actual stone disease-burden of the calyceal system, yet small stones are rarely of clinical&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive MRU protocol facilitates evaluation of the renal parenchyma, UUT, surrounding&#xD;
      structures and if needed the renal vasculature. This &quot;one-stop evaluation&quot; approach is fully&#xD;
      applicable with MRU which is additionally free from radiation. Additionally MR is superior to&#xD;
      CT in that it provides better tissue contrast resolution and greater sensitivity for contrast&#xD;
      enhancement. Therefore MRU became the secondary investigation of choice after US in pediatric&#xD;
      UUT imaging. The European Society of Paediatric Radiology uroradiology task force and ESUR&#xD;
      paediatric working group recommends to always consider MRU, when available, as a secondary&#xD;
      investigation after US in applicable situations, with the main principle being to avoid CT&#xD;
      whenever possible. The few accepted major indications for CTU in children being severe&#xD;
      urinary tract trauma, complicated/equivocal urolithiasis (if high level US+KUB are not&#xD;
      conclusive and if there is expected therapeutic impact).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRU protocol includes always Both T2 and T1 breath-hold sequences in coronal orientation&#xD;
      as a minimum. Nevertheless there are no universally accepted consensus protocol. As a safe&#xD;
      method the investigators believe that MRU protocols should not duplicate CTU protocols in&#xD;
      comparison, but a comprehensive protocol with multiple acquisitions is most probably&#xD;
      beneficial.&#xD;
