  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and ipilimumab work in treating patients with&#xD;
      hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body and express&#xD;
      androgen receptor-variant-7 (AR-V7). Tumor cells expressing AR-V7 has been shown to be&#xD;
      resistant to hormone therapy and some chemotherapy in patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Biomarker-driven therapy, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may work by blocking key&#xD;
      biomarkers or proteins that help tumor cells to escape the immune system surveillance and&#xD;
      this may help the immune system to kill tumor cells that express AR-V7.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the effect of administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the proportion of&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses (&gt; 50% PSA decline) in metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with detectable AR-V7 transcript in&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipilimumab + nivolumab in AR-V7-positive&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the PSA-PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the proportion of &quot;durable&quot; responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the overall response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine the overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To evaluate changes in AR-V7 detection (or expression levels) before and after treatment&#xD;
           with ipilimumab + nivolumab and correlate with PSA responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To explore potential biomarkers associated with clinical efficacy (ORR, PFS, and OS) of&#xD;
           nivolumab and ipilimumab by analyzing absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood as&#xD;
           well as programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in CTCs and/or in tumor&#xD;
           biopsies, and immune profiling of sera and tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes every&#xD;
      2 weeks for 36 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
