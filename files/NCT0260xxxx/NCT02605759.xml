      Multi-center, prospective, single arm, non-randomized study. The study will proceed in two&#xD;
      phases: a pilot phase, followed by the feasibility, safety and efficacy phase. In the pilot&#xD;
      phase, up to five (5) patients at one (1) site will be treated with the CryoBalloon Ablation&#xD;
      System to confirm its safety and feasibility in the treatment of squamous dysplasia. The&#xD;
      second phase will be conducted at two (2) centers and will enroll up to 50 subjects to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the CryoBalloon Ablation System for the&#xD;
      treatment of squamous dysplasia.&#xD;
