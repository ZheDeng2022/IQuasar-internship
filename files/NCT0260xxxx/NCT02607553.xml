      An open-label, single-arm, single-center Phase II study to evaluate the safety and activity&#xD;
      of G-202 in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma that expresses PSMA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial tumors, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), have the ability to grow&#xD;
      to only a finite size in the absence of vascularization. RCC is characterized as a&#xD;
      highly-vascularized tumor and inhibiting angiogenesis has the potential to impair tumor&#xD;
      growth, including growth of RCC. Therapeutic targeting of integral biological pathways in&#xD;
      RCC, including those involving VEGF and mTOR, has produced robust clinical effects and&#xD;
      revolutionized the treatment of metastatic RCC. These approaches offers significant clinical&#xD;
      benefit and sequential use of these agents has become the empirical standard of care.&#xD;
      However, complete or durable responses are uncommon and resistance develops after a median&#xD;
      interval of 6-15 months. This raises the pressing clinical need for additional therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches for patients with metastatic clear cell RCC. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the approach of targeted delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy with G-202 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced, refractory RCC. This study is based on prodrug tumor targeting, in&#xD;
      which an inactive form of a toxic agent is administered systemically and gets activated in&#xD;
      specific locations in the body, resulting in higher concentrations of the cytotoxic form at&#xD;
      the tumor location. G-202 is a prodrug that is activated by PSMA in the blood vessels of&#xD;
      tumors, but not normal tissue; once activated, G-202 leads to disruption of intracellular&#xD;
      calcium levels and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Thus, G-202 is expected to bring about&#xD;
      cell death in RCC and destroy the blood supply of RCC tumors. This single-arm, open-label&#xD;
      Phase II clinical trial will evaluate the safety and activity of G-202 in patients with RCC&#xD;
      that expresses PSMA.&#xD;
