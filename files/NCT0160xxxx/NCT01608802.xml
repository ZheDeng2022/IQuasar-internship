    <textblock>
      Despite overwhelming need for effective HIV palliative care in sub-Saharan Africa, a&#xD;
      systematic appraisal of the literature found almost no outcome or evaluative evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of HIV palliative care training and a simple&#xD;
      palliative care assessment tool provided to nurses of patients on Antiretroviral Therapy&#xD;
      (ART), and to evaluate this in terms of patient outcomes under clinical experimental&#xD;
      conditions in 2 African countries using randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention being tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each well-established HIV ART clinic, patients will be randomly allocated to either&#xD;
      continue receiving standard care (control group) or to receive standard care plus&#xD;
      appointments with a clinic nurse trained in basic palliative care (intervention group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Each Phase III clinical trial (i.e. one trial in each of 2 countries) will be powered&#xD;
      and conducted in parallel to a common research design protocol, thus permitting evidence of&#xD;
      outcomes that reflects 2 different ART providers, providing evidence of palliative care&#xD;
      efficacy relevant to different HIV care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Each trial has been powered to a primary endpoint of pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcomes are the core domains of palliative care as defined&#xD;
      by the WHO (i.e. physical, including symptoms, psychological, social and spiritual) and&#xD;
      measured by the APCA African POS. Further secondary outcomes measured will be: adherence to&#xD;
      treatment; risk behaviours; health-related quality of life; psychological morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion: Patients will be screened and invited into the trial if they are on ART, score 3-5&#xD;
      on the 0-5 APCA African POS pain or symptom items, are 18 years or older, and can give&#xD;
      informed consent to trial entry and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted to determine treatment response&#xD;
      differences between the two conditions. In order to maximise the efficiency of longitudinal&#xD;
      data, multi-level modelling will be applied as appropriate.&#xD;

      Background / rationale Despite overwhelming need for effective HIV palliative care in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa (as evidenced by the epidemiology of primarily HIV and cancer), a&#xD;
      systematic appraisal of the literature found almost no outcome or evaluative evidence.&#xD;
      Further systematic reviews of palliative care and HIV palliative care effectiveness have&#xD;
      found the evidence to have been generated mainly in high income countries, before the advent&#xD;
      of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the evidence from Africa to be of generally lower quality&#xD;
      (i.e. non-trial data) with limited potential for inclusion in evidence-based health care&#xD;
      planning and delivery. In order to influence clinical practice, policy and guidelines, it is&#xD;
      essential to provide high quality trial evidence of the effectiveness of palliative care for&#xD;
      people on ART. In order to achieve the goal of maximum coverage, the capacity building of&#xD;
      existing HIV care services to provide palliative care to their patients seems the most&#xD;
      feasible. Further, the evidence demonstrates that the pain and symptom burden of those on ART&#xD;
      is not different to those not on ART, therefore a key role for palliative care may be in the&#xD;
      support of those accessing treatment. Our proposed study will develop a model of care that&#xD;
      extends palliative care delivery into existing HIV/ART delivery sites, offering a mechanism&#xD;
      of greater coverage and feasibility than alternative approaches such as referral of all&#xD;
      palliative care-related problems out to specialist external providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim We aim to evaluate the efficacy of HIV palliative care training and a simple&#xD;
           palliative care assessment tool provided to nurses of patients on ART, and to evaluate&#xD;
           this in terms of patient outcomes under clinical experimental conditions in 2 African&#xD;
           countries using randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention being tested Within each well-established HIV ART clinic, patients will be&#xD;
           randomly allocated to either continue receiving standard care (control group) or to&#xD;
           receive standard care plus appointments with a clinic nurse trained in basic palliative&#xD;
           care (intervention group). The intervention nurse will receive weekly supervision from a&#xD;
           local palliative care service and will use a simple assessment form at each patient&#xD;
           appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methods Design: Each Phase III clinical trial (i.e. one trial in each of 2 countries)&#xD;
           will be powered and conducted in parallel to a common research design protocol, thus&#xD;
           permitting evidence of outcomes that reflects 2 different ART providers, providing&#xD;
           evidence of palliative care efficacy relevant to different HIV care settings. Each of&#xD;
           the 2 HIV care facilities (one in each of Kenya and South Africa) is a highly&#xD;
           experienced HIV and ART care provider, with proven longevity. The providers of the&#xD;
           palliative care training are longstanding experts in the delivery of both palliative&#xD;
           care training and palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Each trial has been powered to a primary endpoint of pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcomes are the core domains of palliative care as defined&#xD;
      by the WHO (i.e. physical, including symptoms, psychological, social and spiritual) and&#xD;
      measured by the APCA African POS. Further secondary outcomes measured will be: adherence to&#xD;
      treatment; risk behaviours; health-related quality of life; and an additional measure of&#xD;
      psychological morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary outcomes are the same for each country's trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to reject the null hypothesis that receipt of palliative care in addition to&#xD;
      standard care does not affect pain compared to those receiving standard care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion: Patients will be screened and invited into the trial if they are on ART, score 3-5&#xD;
      on the 0-5 APCA African POS pain or symptom items, are 18 years or older, and can give&#xD;
      informed consent to trial entry and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted to determine treatment response&#xD;
      differences between the two conditions. In order to maximise the efficiency of longitudinal&#xD;
      data, multi-level modelling will be applied as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Outputs We have selected an RCT design, with multiple country partners, in order that&#xD;
      outputs have maximum potential influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The revised CONSORT trial statement for non-drug trials has been applied to ensure potential&#xD;
      publication in the leading 400 medical journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of a clinical and policy audience for the findings, the inclusion of 2 partner&#xD;
      countries enables us to demonstrate the efficacy of 2 providers of ART care (as there is much&#xD;
      heterogeneity between HIV care providers in Africa), and to maximise the ability to replicate&#xD;
      findings, while dissemination will describe and compare the two providers of care delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to journal publications, we intend to present summary outputs to relevant Country&#xD;
      Teams / policy / advocacy stakeholders, to present to international HIV / palliative care&#xD;
      conference audiences, and to provide a podcast of findings to be freely downloaded on the&#xD;
      web.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-applicants and Collaborators This application represents a highly effective and proven&#xD;
      group who have, over the past 5 years, delivered clinical audit, POS tool development and&#xD;
      validation, longitudinal studies, and various patient outcome studies in HIV palliative care&#xD;
      in Africa. The University departments are those most closely aligned to the palliative care&#xD;
      field in each country, and offer an active clinical / teaching / research interface. The&#xD;
      collaboration has a strong track record of successfully conducting clinical and public health&#xD;
      research and in clinical care. Each collaborating training palliative care centre is a long&#xD;
      standing recognised provider of quality palliative care, operating in line with the WHO&#xD;
      definition of palliative care.&#xD;
