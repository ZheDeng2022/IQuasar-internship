  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical need to consistently provide best practice care for adult patients with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease (SCD) who present to emergency departments (EDs). Patients with SCD&#xD;
      suffer a shortened lifespan, and often die of many disease associated complications in their&#xD;
      4th and 5th decade of life. These complications include, but are not limited to: stroke,&#xD;
      sepsis, pulmonary embolus, acute chest syndrome, and multi-system organ failure. Patients&#xD;
      typically present to the ED with severe acute pain that requires rapid analgesic&#xD;
      administration, often with high doses of opioids. The perception among many clinicians is&#xD;
      that these patients, usually African American, are &quot;drug seeking&quot;. This results in delays to&#xD;
      administration of analgesics and inferior pain management. Finally, a small proportion of&#xD;
      adults with SCD have a large number of visits. A recent study revealed that approximately 25%&#xD;
      of adult patients with SCD had more than six ED visits per year with about 10% having more&#xD;
      than 23 visits. Several patients had up to 175 visits over a 2-year period. There is also&#xD;
      evidence that SCD patients with more than two hospitalizations/year are at an increased risk&#xD;
      of death. ED clinicians are often frustrated when they see the same patient for multiple ED&#xD;
      visits. This also leads to inadequate analgesic management. These issues highlight the&#xD;
      suboptimal effectiveness of the process and systems of ED care for adults with SCD. ED&#xD;
      practices for SCD care would significantly benefit from re-design and implementation of&#xD;
      innovative best practice management strategies to optimize ED evaluation and management of&#xD;
      VOC-related pain and facilitate appropriate referral to a primary care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ED-SCANS is a validated and reliable decision support tool developed by the principal&#xD;
      investigator to help guide ED clinicians in delivering best practice care to adults with SCD.&#xD;
      However, optimal integration of the tool within ED systems and process of care and the effect&#xD;
      of the tool on both ED system and patient outcomes have not been evaluated. This study is the&#xD;
      next logical step in the implementation of the ED-SCANS. The proposed study will use four key&#xD;
      decisions of the ED-SCANS (triage, analgesic management, identification of high risk&#xD;
      patients, and patient referral for care) as a framework to improve the processes and systems&#xD;
      in ED management of adults with SCD. A proactive risk assessment methodology -- Failure&#xD;
      Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) -- will be used in two EDs to identify the&#xD;
      vulnerabilities, risks, and weak points (failures) in the systems and processes involved in&#xD;
      four key decisions of the ED-SCANS. Based on the aggregated results of the FMECA's,&#xD;
      generalizable quality improvement interventions (QII's) will be developed and implemented&#xD;
      with the purpose of changing the way emergency care for adults with SCD is delivered and&#xD;
      organized. These re-designed systems and processes (interventions) will be developed to be&#xD;
      generalizable to most EDs, with minor modifications. A formal program evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted to determine the barriers and facilitators to implementation of the interventions.&#xD;
      Preliminary, hypothesis generating data will be collected for selected outcomes related to&#xD;
      each of the four decisions associated with the ED-SCANS. A toolbox of educational materials&#xD;
      and electronic medical record prompts for EDs will be developed to facilitate implementation&#xD;
      of the ED-SCANS at EDs across the country. This study will therefore focus on (1) developing&#xD;
      an optimal implementation strategy using formal risk assessment (FMECA) and quality&#xD;
      improvement (PDSA) methods focused on four key decisions of the ED-SCANS: Decision 1: triage,&#xD;
      Decision 2: analgesic management, Decision 3: identification of high risk patients, and&#xD;
      Decision 7: patient referral for care to improve the processes and systems involved in the&#xD;
      care of adults with SCD and (2) conducting a formal program evaluation consisting of a&#xD;
      process evaluation (to understand whether the optimal implementation strategy performs as&#xD;
      intended (e.g. actual versus planned) through assessment of the barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      the implementation) and an outcomes evaluation of relevant clinical performance indicators,&#xD;
      and patient and clinician outcomes. The outcome evaluation is designed to be hypothesis&#xD;
      generating, not hypothesis testing. Finally, a toolbox of educational materials and other&#xD;
      implementation tools such as decision support tools (e.g., documentation templates) will be&#xD;
      developed during the project.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27 months</time_frame>
    <description>High user criteria include: No Primary Care Physician, &gt;3 painful episodes per year, &gt;3 ED visits or hospitalizations per year, difficulty getting appointments with PCP. Specific outcome measures include: decrease in the number of ED visits and hospitalizations, as well as improvement in the proportion of physician, social service, and psychiatric service referrals made for high risk/high utilizer patients when indicated. Data will be collected via quarterly medical record reviews (every quarter) and patient interviews (quarters 3-10).</description>

    <description>This outcome is exploratory and designed to be hypothesis generating. A combination of clinical performance indicators and patient and clinician outcomes will be analyzed, including Triage Score (correct/incorrect), Time to initial analgesic from arrival (minutes from arrival to administration of 1st dose), and patient satisfaction with ED analgesic management.</description>
