  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ZELTIQ System and the&#xD;
      CoolCurve+ applicator for non-invasive fat reduction in flanks for a patient population with&#xD;
      sharp body curvature.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Zeltiq System with the CoolCurve+ applicator will be evaluated for safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness in subjects with subcutaneous fat on the flanks and who have sharp body&#xD;
      curvatures. The curvature of interest is typical of individuals who are relatively thin with&#xD;
      a small body frame.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety of the Zeltiq System for Non-invasive Fat Reduction in Subjects With Greater Flank Curvature.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks and 16 weeks post final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by determination of the number of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) at the 8-week and 16-week post-treatment visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fat Layer Thickness When Compared to Untreated Control</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks post final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the fat layer thickness will be calculated by comparison of pre-treatment and 16 week post-treatment ultrasound measurements taken in the area treated with the device, and in the contralateral untreated control area. The Sponsor's standardized techniques for obtaining ultrasound imaging will be used. Overall fat layer thickness changes were normalized for each subject by subtracting the change in the untreated control from the change in treated area to remove the influence of weight variations. Results indicate the mm of fat layer reduction in the treated area.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Pre-treatment Images Correctly Identified</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks post final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images of the treated areas. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. Results reflect the proportion of correctly identified images.</description>

    <measure>Additional Safety Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment though 16 weeks post final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of device or procedure-related adverse events will be evaluated. The investigator determines if the Zeltiq CoolSculpting System (device) or the treatment (procedure) are related to all reported adverse events.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects &gt; 18 years of age and &lt; 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has clearly visible fat on the flanks, which in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             may benefit from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has not had weight change exceeding 10 pounds in the preceding month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with body mass index (BMI) up to 29. BMI is defined as weight in pounds&#xD;
             multiplied by 703 divided by the square of the height in inches.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with sharp flank curvature that fits well with the CoolCurve+ applicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 5 pounds) by not making any&#xD;
             major changes in their diet or lifestyle during the course of the study.&#xD;

             or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.&#xD;

        <title>Change in Fat Layer Thickness When Compared to Untreated Control</title>
        <description>Change in the fat layer thickness will be calculated by comparison of pre-treatment and 16 week post-treatment ultrasound measurements taken in the area treated with the device, and in the contralateral untreated control area. The Sponsor's standardized techniques for obtaining ultrasound imaging will be used. Overall fat layer thickness changes were normalized for each subject by subtracting the change in the untreated control from the change in treated area to remove the influence of weight variations. Results indicate the mm of fat layer reduction in the treated area.</description>

The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images.
