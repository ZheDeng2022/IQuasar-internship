  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there are studies that investigated the use of non-pharmacological pain relief and&#xD;
      correction of dystocia during labor, there are few randomized controlled trials, especially&#xD;
      related to combined protocols that use such resources. The use of combined protocols could&#xD;
      potentiate the effects of resource use alone, evidencing the need for more studies related to&#xD;
      the topic, as well as the effects of these methods on maternal and perinatal outcomes. In&#xD;
      order to verify the effect of these methods in various stages of labor, childbirth and&#xD;
      immediately becomes necessary to conduct a randomized controlled trial well-designed and&#xD;
      adequate sample size that can make the future systematic reviews that can definitely conclude&#xD;
      about the potential effectiveness of protocols that use combined resources to&#xD;
      non-pharmacological pain relief in labor. Aim of our study is to evaluate the effects of a&#xD;
      protocol of non-pharmacological resources on pain of pregnant women in the active phase of&#xD;
      cervical dilatation and compared with controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Labor is a natural physiologic process triggered by mechanical and hormonal events that&#xD;
      promote uterine contractions. Several non-pharmacological resources can be used during labor,&#xD;
      such as relaxation techniques and ongoing support, maternal mobility, walking, breathing&#xD;
      exercises, massage, Swiss ball, stool, shower, whirlpool and application of transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (ENT .) Despite the role of physiotherapy in labor is not an&#xD;
      established practice in public hospitals, it is expected that with the evidence of the&#xD;
      benefits of non-pharmacological resources at this time, managers and health professionals&#xD;
      validate the importance of interdisciplinary care in pregnancy - postpartum. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effects of resources on non-pharmacological pain of mothers in the&#xD;
      active phase of cervical dilatation when compared to controls. This research is a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled clinical study that includes pregnant women randomly assigned to two groups:&#xD;
      Intervention Group (IG) women who will use the following sequence features: ambulation (with&#xD;
      cervical dilatation of 4 to 5 cm), alternating stance associated with ENT (cervical&#xD;
      dilatation from 6 to 7 cm) and a shower (with dilation&gt; 7 cm) for 40 minutes each resource;&#xD;
      Control Group (CG) women who will not use any physical therapy resource, are subject only to&#xD;
      routine procedures of maternity care . For pain assessment will use the Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
      - VAS and the body diagram of the location and spatial distribution of pain. Results are&#xD;
      presented in tables and graphs made to better understand the comparisons between the control&#xD;
      and intervention. To compare maternal morbidity, obstetric and neonatal between groups will&#xD;
      be used Fisher's exact test or chi-square.&#xD;

    <description>Moment when a patient requested analgesia for pain relief. Data captured from the medical record by the partograph.&#xD;
A partogram was used, which is a printed document and allows the registration of all procedures and complications that occurred during labor, showing the conditions of the parturient and the fetus during this phase. This information is noted on a graph that makes it possible to assess all labor and duration. The doctor filled out the partograph and assessed the patient during labor, and she did not know which group belonged to the patient</description>

    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Analyze and compare between the groups the types of dystocia.&#xD;
Dystocia:&#xD;
b.1) Functional dystocia was considered when cervical dilation increased progressively, but with a speed less than 1 centimeter per hour; b.2) Secondary stop of the dilation was considered when there were 2 vaginal touches with the same cervical dilation in an interval of at least two hours, without being total.&#xD;
b.3) Secondary descent stop was considered when, with complete dilation of the uterine cervix, the same height of fetal descent was found in two successive touches with an interval of one hour (Protocol Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2012).</description>

    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Analyze and compare Apgar scores of the 1-min &gt;7 and 5-min &gt;7, between groups. The APGAR score reflects the degree of fetal maturity and predicts healthy child development. It is a scale that can vary from 0 to 10, which 0 is a bad vitality and 10 is an excellent score. When the APGAR score is below 7, especially in the fifth minute, it is a warning sign to give special attention to the newborn.&#xD;
Newborns who have an Apgar in the first minute greater than 7, demonstrate good birth conditions.</description>

b.1) Functional dystocia was considered when cervical dilation increased progressively, but with a speed less than 1 centimeter per hour; b.2) Secondary stop of the dilation was considered when there were 2 vaginal touches with the same cervical dilation in an interval of at least two hours, without being total.&#xD;
b.3) Secondary descent stop was considered when, with complete dilation of the uterine cervix, the same height of fetal descent was found in two successive touches with an interval of one hour (Protocol Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2012).</description>
