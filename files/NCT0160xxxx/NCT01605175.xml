      The aim of this study is to prospectively identify, at diagnosis of the disease, factors&#xD;
      predictive of mucosal healing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with&#xD;
      anti-TNF.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) are both chronic idiopathic inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that result in a considerably decreased quality of&#xD;
      life. Long term experience with standard therapies for inflammatory bowel disease patients up&#xD;
      to the late 1990s demonstrated diverse limitations. Corticosteroids have good short term&#xD;
      efficacy, but are not suitable for maintaining remission, while treatment with&#xD;
      immunomodulators are associated with an important risk of side effects. The introduction of&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) therapy has offered new treatment&#xD;
      options originally in patients with Crohn's disease and more recently in those with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis as well. Several clinicians based on the results of clinical trials, now&#xD;
      advocate the early use of intensive therapy (immunosuppressants and/or biologics) to maintain&#xD;
      a good quality of life from the first flare up and prevent any irreversible consequence of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, the assessment of tissue healing has become of paramount importance in patients&#xD;
      treated for inflammatory bowel disease. Simple clinical assessment does not reflect real&#xD;
      activity and inflammation at the tissue level. Moreover, cumulative tissue damage generated&#xD;
      by the persisting tissue inflammation leads to non reversible anatomic and functional&#xD;
      consequences. Therefore, in order to evaluate both the natural history and impact of&#xD;
      treatment in inflammatory bowel disease standardized assessment of tissue healing must be&#xD;
      available. Endoscopic and histological healing has been shown to be associated with a reduced&#xD;
      risk of recurrence of the disease, in addition to reduced hospitalization and surgery.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in patients treated with costly and highly immunosuppressive TNF-a antagonists,&#xD;
      achievement of an objective treatment response is essential. Consequently, endoscopic healing&#xD;
      should be regarded as the primary approach in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several clinical trials have identified, at diagnosis, factors predictive of a&#xD;
      subsequent disabling course of the disease, therefore identifying patients that would mostly&#xD;
      benefit from early aggressive therapy with anti-TNF, factors predictive of mucosal healing&#xD;
      have not yet been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy (ileocolonoscopy) will be performed at baseline (i.e. before anti-TNF&#xD;
      administration) for all patients included in the study. The outcome of anti-TNF therapy will&#xD;
      be evaluated by two follow up endoscopies, at 3 months and at 12 months after the start of&#xD;
      therapy. At the same time periods the disease activity will be documented as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Crohn's disease patients, the simplified endoscopic severity index will be recorded&#xD;
      (SES-CD), table 1. According to current guidelines, mucosal healing will be defined as an&#xD;
      SES-CD of lower than 5 points. For all CD patients, the CD activity index (CDAI) will also be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ulcerative colitis, the Mayo endoscopic subscore will be recorded (0: normal mucosa, 1:&#xD;
      faded vascular pattern, mild friability, 2: loss of vascular pattern, erosions, friability,&#xD;
      3: ulcers of spontaneous bleeding). According to recent recommendation of the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration, mucosal healing will be defined as a Mayo score of 0. Disease activity will&#xD;
      be graded according to the Clinical Activity Index (Lichtiger's CAI), with a highest possible&#xD;
      score of 21. For all ulcerative colitis patients the Montreal classification of the extent of&#xD;
      the disease will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data on blood hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells, plasma or serum albumin&#xD;
      and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be collected for all patients at baseline. Use of&#xD;
      concurrent medication will be recorded, especially the dosage data of corticosteroids and&#xD;
      those of other immunosuppressant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab will be administered at 5 mg/Kg body weight at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and thereafter,&#xD;
      every 2 months for the follow up period of 1 year. Adalimumab will be administered at a dose&#xD;
      of 160mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, 40 mg at week 4 and 40 mg every other week thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to identify predictors, at baseline, for mucosal healing in&#xD;
      patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease that will receive infliximab or&#xD;
      adalimumab for control of their disease. For this reason at the end of the follow up period&#xD;
      (12 months), the following variables will be tested by univariate analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age at onset of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concomitant corticosteroid use at start of anti_TNF therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concomitant immunosuppressant use at start of anti-TNF therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood hemoglobin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematocrit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  White blood cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-reactive protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fecal calprotectin level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDAI at baseline for CD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lichtiger score at baseline for UC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous major abdominal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indication for anti-TNF therapy in CD patients (luminal CD, luminal and fistulizing CD,&#xD;
           luminal CD with extra-intestinal manifestations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of disease for CD patients (ileitis, colitis, ileocolitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of disease for UC patients (Montreal classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior appendectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, immunological markers with predictive value for mucosal healing at 1 year will&#xD;
      be sought at the intestinal as well the systemic level. Investigators will test these markers&#xD;
      both at baseline but also at week 12. In this way, investigators will try to identify&#xD;
      pre-treatment predictors of mucosal healing but also early predictors of response to anti-TNF&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the determination of mucosal markers, at endoscopy investigators will collect 2 biopsy&#xD;
      samples in RNA-later. These samples will be stored at -80 C, and used for the quantitative&#xD;
      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of various immunological markers, mainly&#xD;
      cytokines and their receptors, adhesion molecules and other inflammatory proteins by&#xD;
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A third biopsy specimen will be immersed in&#xD;
      formalin and maintained for protein expression studies by immunohistochemistry. Biopsies will&#xD;
      be collected both from overtly inflamed and normal-looking mucosa and from various locations&#xD;
      when feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the determination of systemic markers, blood will be collected from the patients and&#xD;
      serum separated and stored at -26 C. These samples will be used for the measurement of&#xD;
      soluble inflammatory markers that may demonstrate predictive value for the achievement of&#xD;
      mucosal healing. Inflammatory markers may be measured by Multiplex assays of by individual&#xD;
      ELISAs.&#xD;
