      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is a rare genetic disease that&#xD;
      results in changes to certain brain chemicals. These chemicals may affect brain excitability,&#xD;
      or how likely nerve cells are to turn on. Changes in brain excitability may help to explain&#xD;
      the symptoms of the disease, including learning and memory problems, seizures, and poor&#xD;
      balance. A supplement called taurine may help people with SSADH deficiency by working on the&#xD;
      brain chemical GABA. GABA helps to regulate brain activity. Researchers want to see if&#xD;
      taurine can help people with SSADH deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about how taurine affects the brain in people with SSADH deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 12 years of age who have SSADH deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#xD;
           provide blood and urine samples. They will also take taurine supplements as part of this&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two sets of study tests. One set will be given while participants&#xD;
           are taking taurine. The second will be given when they are not taking it. Each testing&#xD;
           session will take about 2 days to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Half of the participants will have the &quot;off taurine&quot; testing before starting on the&#xD;
           taurine supplement. The other half will start taking taurine first, have the &quot;on&#xD;
           taurine&quot; testing, and have the &quot;off taurine&quot; testing about 3 months after stopping&#xD;
           taurine. Participants may decide the order in which they will have the testing done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the following tests at the two test visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paper and pencil tests of learning and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation to study the excitability of nerve cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies to show GABA receptors in the brain and measure their activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalogram to measure brain waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture to collect spinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored with regular study visits while they receive the taurine&#xD;
           supplement treatment.&#xD;

      Objective: To study the physiologic effects of taurine therapy in patients with succinic&#xD;
      semialdehyde Dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Eighteen children and adults with SSADH deficiency receiving taurine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This small open label trial will evaluate the effect of taurine treatment on key&#xD;
      SSADH biomarkers and neurocognitive performance. Study evaluations will include neurological&#xD;
      and neuropsychological examinations, positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-flumazenil&#xD;
      (FMZ), (optional and only for those over age 18), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)&#xD;
      (optional) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection (optional) to measure gamma-aminobutyric&#xD;
      acid (GABA) levels, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure cortical&#xD;
      excitation and inhibition, in patients given taurine for SSADH deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations will be performed twice, on and off therapy.&#xD;
