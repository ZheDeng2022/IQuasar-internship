      Background An increasing number of patients are suffering from stress-related symptoms and&#xD;
      diseases. No scientific studies have examined the effects of Medical yoga on stress-related&#xD;
      symptoms in patients in primary care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Medical yoga&#xD;
      treatment in patients with stress-related symptoms and diagnosis in primary health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A randomized, controlled study was performed at a primary health care centre in&#xD;
      Sweden from March to June 2011. Patients were randomly allocated to a control group receiving&#xD;
      standard care, or a yoga group treated with Medical yoga for 1 hour, once a week, over a&#xD;
      12-week period in addition to the standard care. A total of 37 men and women, mean age 53±12&#xD;
      years, seeking care for stress-related symptoms at the primary health care centre were&#xD;
      included and followed up after the 12-week study period. General stress level (measured using&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), burnout (Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ)), anxiety&#xD;
      and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), insomnia severity (Insomnia&#xD;
      Severity Index (ISI)), pain (visual analogue scale (VAS)) and overall health status (Euro&#xD;
      Quality of Life-VAS (EQ-VAS)) were measured before and after 12 weeks.&#xD;

      Main outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Perceived Stress Scale is a 10-item self report questionnaire that measures persons'&#xD;
      evaluation of the stressfulness of the situations in the past month of their lives. The&#xD;
      citation for the 10-item scale is Cohen, S., &amp; Williamson, G. (1988). Perceived stress in a&#xD;
      probability sample of the United States. In S. Spacapan &amp; S. Oskamp (Eds.). The Perceived&#xD;
      Stress Scale is the only empirically established index of general stress appraisal. &quot;The PSS&#xD;
      measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful&quot; (Cohen, et&#xD;
      al., 1983; p. 385).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSS-10 scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the four positive items, e.g., 0=4,&#xD;
      1=3, 2=2, etc. and then summing across all 10 items. Items 4,5, 7, and 8 are the positively&#xD;
      stated items. Scores can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PSS is not a diagnostic instrument, so there are no cut-offs. There are only comparisons&#xD;
      between people in a given sample. There are some normative data on the PSS based on a 1983&#xD;
      Harris Poll of a representative U.S. sample. These data may be helpful in providing&#xD;
      comparisons, but they are over 20 years old. See: Cohen, S., &amp; Williamson, G. (1988).&#xD;
