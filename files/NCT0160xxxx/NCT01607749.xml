      Undertake a study of educational intervention in primary schools in Andalusia&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are differences in quality of life associated with asthma (as measured by the&#xD;
      questionnaire PAQLQ) and the level of asthma control in students with asthma aged 11 and 12&#xD;
      years who receive an educational intervention with their peers without asthma versus those&#xD;
      receiving standard information in schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: To compare the control of asthma symptoms, quality of life in asthma and asthma&#xD;
      knowledge among a group receiving an educational intervention delivered by specialist&#xD;
      teachers of physical education (MEEF) in Primary Schools (CEIP) and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MÉTODOS group: Randomized controlled single-blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: Students of 11 and 12 years old in Andalusia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 258 children / children with asthma for a mean contrast (alpha error of 3.4%.&#xD;
      80% power, a confidence level of 95% considering 20% loss. 2580 students will be enrolled&#xD;
      prevalence of asthma 10%) . Conglomerates of the CEIP in urban, rural, public and&#xD;
      private-reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: Training MEEF with the educational program &quot;Sports and Health Asthma and&#xD;
      subsequent delivery, then the students MEEF are 5th and 6th grade ( 3 sessions). CONTROL: The&#xD;
      standard instruction in schools. OUTCOME VARIABLES: Quality of life (Juniper) and &quot;control&#xD;
      del asthma en niños&quot;(CAN) in asthmatics, Knowledge (NAKQ questionnaire) and attitudes toward&#xD;
      asthma (all students and teachers). Pre-intervention (T0), post-intervention at 5-6 months&#xD;
      (T1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables: Sex, suffering or not asthma, intervention / control, type CEIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Comparison of continuous variables: T Students (If normal distribution)&#xD;
      &quot;Mann-Whitney (If non-normal distribution). To study qualitative variables chi-square test&#xD;
      (normal distribution) and Kruskal-Wallis ( no-normal distribution).&#xD;

      DESIGN. Single-blind clinical trial with random allocation to the group receiving educational&#xD;
      intervention and control group, developed throughout the school year (September 2011 to May&#xD;
      2012). The unit of randomization will be the schools to avoid intracenter contamination of&#xD;
      the students during the educational intervention. The units of analysis are the students of&#xD;
      schools FIELD OF STUDY. Students aged 10 and 13 years old attending school and Primary&#xD;
      Education (CEIP) in Andalusia, a world population of 38,829 students from a total of 728&#xD;
      CEIP. The schools will be recruited through AVERROES tool of the Ministry of Education of the&#xD;
      Andalusia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve a power of 90.0% to detect differences in the contrast of the null hypothesis H ₀:&#xD;
      μ ₀ = μ ₀ by t-Student test bilaterally for two independent samples, considering that the&#xD;
      significance level is 5%, and assuming a mean difference to the quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      between groups of 0.5 and the common standard deviation is 1.10 units, with estimated losses&#xD;
      of 15% is necessary to include 129 units in the experimental group Reference and 129 units in&#xD;
      the Experimental group, totaling 258 experimental units in the study. Since the prevalence of&#xD;
      asthma is approximately 10% in our population, we need to include a total of 2580 students,&#xD;
      for a total of 258 students with asthma and other students will be students without asthma&#xD;
      who get the outcome measures and compare your average asthma knowledge and attitudes to&#xD;
      asthma of all students involved in the study and teaching centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEIP will be chosen by randomization by computer, which will be offered to participate. One&#xD;
      of the researchers contacted the directors and teachers of Physical Education (MEF) of the&#xD;
      sites, explaining the purpose of the study. Upon acceptance to participate, seek the approval&#xD;
      of the School Councils to inform parents of students about the study, again requesting&#xD;
      consent for their children's participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSIGNMENT randomly to two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation will be 1:1 in the control group and intervention group, after school&#xD;
      stratification by public / private and rural / urban, by number of students enrolled in&#xD;
      schools will be invited to participate. (Annex 1) As for the post randomisation losses,&#xD;
      estimated at 15%, for not attending educational sessions at 3 is an analysis by intention to&#xD;
      treat and per protocol. In those subjects lost to follow up and can be reached, apply them to&#xD;
      complete the study questionnaires and PAQLQ ACT to determine the degree of asthma control and&#xD;
      quality of life before the completion of the course. Randomization to intervention and&#xD;
      control centers shall be made to avoid contamination between control and intervention that&#xD;
      occur within a single center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will train in the use of educational package to the MEF will be different&#xD;
      from the group of researchers who collected the questionnaires, the questionnaires correction&#xD;
      made without knowing which group was assigned to the student and therefore do not know the&#xD;
      type of intervention in the CES. Teachers and students in the intervention and control groups&#xD;
      did not examine the content of the curriculum of another comparison group. The researchers&#xD;
      who conducted the statistical treatment, will not know the assignment to experimental and&#xD;
      control centers will have a key for identification. The Principal Investigator will know the&#xD;
      allocation of control and experimental groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schools in the intervention group received the educational program &quot;Asthma, Sport and Health&quot;&#xD;
      23, as validated by our grupo24 to be taught within the curriculum of the CEIP once you have&#xD;
      been approved by the school board for each center. This program will be taught to students in&#xD;
      three lessons with equipment designed and developed by the research group to be taught within&#xD;
      the curriculum of the CEIP. The contents of each class and its methods of work are detailed&#xD;
      in the same educational program. However it offers a framework in Annex 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teachers of physical education specialists responsible for the project at each center will&#xD;
      receive the training curriculum for use in a training seminar for a school day by researchers&#xD;
      from the health of our group. Once familiar with the educational package of three sessions&#xD;
      taught his students and fellow faculty (on different days for teachers and students) within&#xD;
      15-30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL: The control group provides information on asthma that supplies the Ministry of&#xD;
      Education to all schools in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the main hypothesis &quot;An intervention through an educational program to all students, with&#xD;
      or without asthma in primary schools can improve the quality of life associated with asthma&#xD;
      (as measured by the questionnaire PQALQ) and level of asthma control (measured with the&#xD;
      questionnaire ACT) and students with asthma, &quot;the study variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Dependent variable (primary):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of quality of life achieved through the following: (PAQLQ). Quantitative values&#xD;
           ranging between 1 and 7. The minimal clinically important difference is 0.5 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The level of asthma control achieved during follow-up. and &quot;control del asthma en&#xD;
                niños&quot;(CAN) in asthmatics: Quantitative values ranging between 5 and 25. The&#xD;
                minimal clinically important difference is 3.7 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dependent Variable (secondary objective)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge of asthma with the questionnaire NAKQ. Quantitative values ranging between 0&#xD;
           and 31.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attitudes towards asthma among teachers and students, between the intervention and&#xD;
           control. We will use a questionnaire based on a model that includes multiple domains&#xD;
           (internal control, tolerance to asthma, chance and external control) detailed in ANNEX&#xD;
           5. Is filled following a Liker scale between 1 and 6 strongly agree strongly disagree.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measures to protect asthmatics applied in primary schools after the educational&#xD;
           intervention on students and faculty obtained by researchers in schools. Quantitative&#xD;
           values ranging between 0 and 20 (ANNEX 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality of Life Questionnaire in children with asthma-version with standardized&#xD;
           activities (PAQLQ (S) of E. Juniper, validated Spanish. (Consists of 23 items with&#xD;
           values for poorer quality of life 1, best value 7 per item, which are averaged together)&#xD;
           APPENDIX 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control of asthma (ACT). Annex 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. asthma knowledge questionnaire will use the asthma knowledge questionnaire of Newcastle,&#xD;
           whose linguistic validation was conducted by our group and approved by their original&#xD;
           authors. ANNEX 5. This questionnaire has a maximum score of 31, with a range of possible&#xD;
           values between 0-31.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Survey of attitudes to asthma. We will use a questionnaire based on a model that&#xD;
           includes multiple domains (internal control, tolerance to asthma, chance and external&#xD;
           control) detailed in ANNEX 6. Is filled following a Liker scale between 1 and 6 strongly&#xD;
           agree strongly disagree.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Resource Questionnaire Asthma at School (Annex 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data Sheet for students with authorization for treatment in case of crisis. Baseline&#xD;
           questionnaires were used for measuring and monitoring quality of life, asthma control,&#xD;
           attitudes to asthma knowledge questionnaire on asthma and asthma Resources at CES. The&#xD;
           questionnaires were obtained before surgery (T0), and 6 months after it (T1) to check&#xD;
           the duration of the changes obtained after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, we intergroup comparison (intervention and control) of qualitative variables&#xD;
      using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test when necessary. Quantitative variables&#xD;
      follow or not as a normal distribution (Shapiro Wilks test) were analyzed with Student's t-or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the mean intragroup comparison (intervention or control) repeated throughout the study,&#xD;
      apply the Student t-test for related samples Wilcoxon or in the event of non-normality. To&#xD;
      compare means of the 2 study groups during follow-up will use repeated measures ANOVA on the&#xD;
      assumption of normality and the assumption of non-normality in each group will discuss any&#xD;
      changes with the Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis was performed using SPSS-V18. Analysis by intention to treat: They take into&#xD;
      account the results for each group initially assigned, regardless of the intervention, to&#xD;
      meet the program's effectiveness in real conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will also be a per protocol analysis to determine the effectiveness of the program in&#xD;
      ideal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIFFICULTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection bias. In the case of children with asthma are not included in the study all&#xD;
           children who may have asthma, or by the refusal to know or because the disease is&#xD;
           diagnosed in many cases and is only recognized by euphemistic terms . Randomization&#xD;
           could solve the problem between intervention and control&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Refusal by the parents of patients selected to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lack of cooperation throughout the study by faculty and / or students.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We have chosen a large enough sample for the study lacks statistical power no.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  provide for losses in the entire study from the first randomization of the sample&#xD;
                universe.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change of school that the student belongs. 3) You may bias awareness of the&#xD;
                subjects included in the study by the mere fact of knowing and not being observed&#xD;
                strict consequence of the educational intervention. Random assignment of&#xD;
                intervention and control groups minimize their influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
                4) Intervention studies with training activities, increase the level of knowledge&#xD;
                of pathology addressed, but do not always produce positive changes in attitudes&#xD;
                aimed at controlling the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ethical&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The project has been approved by the Ethics Committee for Health Research Health&#xD;
           District Primary Care Sevilla dated April 15, 2009. (ANNEX 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After completing the study, the primary schools involved in the control arm receive the&#xD;
           same treatment as the intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parents will be obtained informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Confidentiality of data. The information contained herein is&#xD;
