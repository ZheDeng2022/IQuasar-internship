      Aims and Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to implement stroke caregiver programs that involve low-cost&#xD;
      interventions that are sustainable in routine clinical practice. The immediate objective is&#xD;
      to test, using a randomized controlled trial, a problem-solving intervention for stroke&#xD;
      caregivers that can be delivered during the transitional care period (e.g., time which&#xD;
      Veteran is discharged to home) followed by online, in-home sessions. The investigators will&#xD;
      modify the traditional, problem-solving intervention by adding web-based training using&#xD;
      interactive modules, factsheets, and tools on previously developed and nationally available&#xD;
      RESCUE Caregiver website (www.cidrr8.research.va.gov/rescue). The investigators will also&#xD;
      provide on-line, skills training and application of the problem-solving approach via the&#xD;
      RESCUE messaging center. The immediate, primary aim (#1) is to test the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on stroke caregivers' depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data&#xD;
      collection. Aim #2 is to test the effect of the intervention on stroke caregivers' burden,&#xD;
      positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and&#xD;
      satisfaction with care at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #3 is to test&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention on Veterans' outcomes: functional abilities and healthcare&#xD;
      utilization (i.e., unintended hospital bed days of care, number of emergency room visits,&#xD;
      number of unscheduled clinic visits) at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Aim&#xD;
      #4 is to determine the budgetary impact for implementing the intervention. Aim #5 is to&#xD;
      determine the facilitators, barriers and best practices for implementing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial. The investigators&#xD;
      will enroll 240 stroke caregivers at 8 study sites (North Florida/South Georgia Veterans&#xD;
      Healthcare System, Miami VA Healthcare System, James A. Haley Veterans Hospital in Tampa,&#xD;
      Michael E. Debakey VAMC in Houston, Hunter Holmes McGuire VAMC in Richmond, Central Arkansas&#xD;
      Veterans Healthcare System, VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, and the VA Boston&#xD;
      Healthcare System). Eligible caregivers will be interviewed, complete baseline measures, and&#xD;
      then be randomized to two groups: 1) intervention group, or 2) standard care. A team member&#xD;
      will telephone caregivers at 11 weeks and 19 weeks after baseline data collection to answer&#xD;
      questions on instruments with established reliability and validity. Qualitative interviews&#xD;
      will be conducted with selected caregivers to obtain in-depth perceptions of the value,&#xD;
      facilitators, and barriers of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first known study to test a transition-to-home intervention combined with&#xD;
      technology to improve the quality of caregiving and the recovery of Veterans.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregiver depression is common following a family member's stroke and is a major contributor&#xD;
      of survivor's hospital readmission and institutionalization. Researchers have consistently&#xD;
      found that interventions to help caregivers resolve problems are effective in reducing&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. However, these problem-solving interventions have been underused in&#xD;
      practice because they involve multiple, in-person or telephone sessions and require large&#xD;
      amounts of staff time to implement. To overcome these barriers, the long-term goal is to&#xD;
      implement stroke caregiver programs that involve low-cost interventions that are sustainable&#xD;
      in routine clinical practice. The immediate objective is to test, using a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, a problem-solving intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered&#xD;
      shortly after the Veterans' in-patient stays followed by online, in-home sessions. The&#xD;
      investigators will modify the traditional, problem-solving intervention by adding web-based&#xD;
      training using interactive modules, factsheets, and tools on previously developed and&#xD;
      nationally available RESCUE Caregiver website (www.cidrr8.research.va.gov/rescue). The&#xD;
      investigators will also provide on-line, skills training and application of the&#xD;
      problem-solving approach via the RESCUE messaging center, a secure site behind the VA&#xD;
      firewall. This work builds on the team's extensive experience in stroke caregiver education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate, primary aim (#1) is to test the effect of the intervention on stroke&#xD;
      caregivers' depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Primary&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Stroke caregivers who receive the intervention will have less depressive symptoms&#xD;
      at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection compared to stroke caregivers who receive&#xD;
      standard care. The investigators propose four secondary aims. Aim #2 is to test the effect of&#xD;
      the intervention on stroke caregivers' burden, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and satisfaction with care at 11 and 19 weeks after&#xD;
      baseline data collection. Aim #3 is to test the effect of the intervention on Veterans'&#xD;
      outcomes: functional abilities and healthcare utilization (i.e., unintended hospital bed days&#xD;
      of care, number of emergency room visits, number of unscheduled clinic visits) at 11 and 19&#xD;
      weeks after baseline data collection. Aim #4 is to determine the budgetary impact for&#xD;
      implementing the intervention. Aim #5 is to determine the facilitators, barriers and best&#xD;
      practices for implementing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial with repeated measures&#xD;
      and use mixed methods to determine caregivers' perceptions of the intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 240 stroke caregivers at 8 study sites (North Florida/South Georgia&#xD;
      Veterans Healthcare System, Miami VA Healthcare System, James A. Haley Veterans Hospital in&#xD;
      Tampa, Michael E. Debakey VAMC in Houston, Hunter Holmes McGuire VAMC in Richmond, Central&#xD;
      Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, and the VA Boston&#xD;
      Healthcare System). Eligible caregivers will be interviewed, complete baseline measures, and&#xD;
      then be randomized to two groups: 1) intervention group, or 2) standard care. A study team&#xD;
      member will telephone caregivers at 11 weeks and 19 weeks after baseline data collection to&#xD;
      answer questions on instruments with established reliability and validity. The team member&#xD;
      will review the Veterans' VA Computerized Patient Record System health record to obtain&#xD;
      information on the Veterans' healthcare utilization. The investigators will determine the&#xD;
      budgetary impact of the intervention by examining the cost data in the VA Managerial Cost&#xD;
      Accounting System (MCAS) (formerly DSS) National Data Extracts and Non-VA Medical Care files.&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with selected caregivers to obtain in-depth&#xD;
      perceptions of the value, facilitators, and barriers of the intervention. Throughout all&#xD;
      phases of the project, the investigators will collaborate with VA (Offices of Nursing Service&#xD;
      and Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first known study to test transition-to-home intervention combined with&#xD;
      technology to improve the quality of caregiving and the recovery of Veterans. Other outcomes&#xD;
      will be a state-of-the-art website and an evidence-based model (in-patient, discharge&#xD;
      planning and online, training and caregiver-provider messaging) that can be transportable to&#xD;
      other disease models&#xD;
