      Double-blind, randomized, multicenter, multinational (South Korea and India), parallel group&#xD;
      study The study was divided into three parts: part 1 was started with an initial 2 weeks of&#xD;
      exercise/diet program followed by another 2 weeks of single-blind placebo run-in period; part&#xD;
      2 was a double-blind treatment period during which eligible patients were randomized to&#xD;
      LC15-0444 50mg or placebo groups and received the assigned treatment for 24 weeks; part 3 was&#xD;
      for those patients who completed part 1 &amp; 2 and consented to receive another 28 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with LC15-0444 50mg. Screening tests were performed on the patients who had given&#xD;
      the written informed consent. After 2-week exercise/diet program according to the generally&#xD;
      recognized guideline, patients took placebo for another 2 weeks while continuing&#xD;
      exercise/diet program. When the 2-week placebo run-in period was completed, eligible patients&#xD;
      were assigned either to placebo or 50 mg of LC15-0444 with 1:1 ratio. During the total of 24-&#xD;
      week treatment period of part 2 after randomization, each patient visited the investigational&#xD;
      site at Week 6, 12, 18, and 24. Completing treatment with placebo or LC15-0444 50mg for 24&#xD;
      weeks after randomization, each patient was asked to provide consent to participate in the&#xD;
      part 3 of the study where all the patients were to receive LC15-0444 50mg regardless of the&#xD;
      treatment received during the part 2 of the study. During 28-week treatment period of the&#xD;
      part 3, each patient visited the investigational site at Week 30, 38, 46, and 52. Total study&#xD;
      period from screening was 56 weeks per each patient.&#xD;
