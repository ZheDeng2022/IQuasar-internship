      Rationale: Ischaemic preconditioning (IP) refers to the reduction of ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      injury induced by a brief preceding period of ischemia. Also the arterial endothelium can be&#xD;
      protected by IP. Several studies performed in animals and humans have demonstrated that the&#xD;
      protective effects of IP are attenuated with aging. However, no previous study directly&#xD;
      examined the underlying mechanisms of this observation. Possibly, the reduced protective&#xD;
      effect of IP with aging relates to a direct effect on the endothelium, consequently leading&#xD;
      to an attenuated ability of IP to prevent endothelial dysfunction after ischaemia reperfusion&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several previous studies failed to demonstrate the ability of pharmacological stimuli to&#xD;
      mimic the beneficial effects of IP in aged vessels. Restoration of the age-related reduction&#xD;
      in effectiveness of IP may be possible through exercise training. In aged animals, physical&#xD;
      training restores the efficacy of ischemic preconditioning. Indirect evidence indicates that&#xD;
      physical activity, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors, protects against a&#xD;
      occurrence as well as the severity of a myocardial infarction in humans. Although this&#xD;
      suggests that physical activity may beneficially influence the age-related reduction in IP,&#xD;
      no previous study provided direct evidence for this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine the impact of age and physical fitness on the ability of ischaemic&#xD;
      preconditioning to protect endothelial damage in response to ischaemia reperfusion injury in&#xD;
      healthy humans. A secondary objective is to explore the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR)&#xD;
      signalling in the induction of IP in young and old subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease has become a worldwide burden. In the Netherlands over 40.000 persons&#xD;
      die annually due to coronary artery disease, either acute myocardial infarction or heart&#xD;
      failure.1 Through plaque formation and negative vascular remodelling, significant stenotic&#xD;
      lesions develop in the coronary arteries that subsequently limit coronary blood flow and&#xD;
      ultimately can cause ischemic events. Reperfusion therapy (either pharmacologic, endovascular&#xD;
      or surgical) is mandatory for salvage of ischemic tissue. However, during reperfusion several&#xD;
      deleterious events take place causing further damage. Murry found that ischemia and&#xD;
      reperfusion injury (IR-injury) could be reduced by a phenomenon called ischemic&#xD;
      preconditioning.2 Short lasting repetitive episodes of ischemia prior to an ischemic event&#xD;
      can induce tissue tolerance against IR-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discovery of this phenomenon, ample research has been devoted to elucidation of the&#xD;
      underling protective mechanism, but also factors that improve or impair the ability of this&#xD;
      phenomenon to protect arteries against ischaemia reperfusion injury. Several studies&#xD;
      performed in animals and humans have demonstrated that the protective effects of IP are&#xD;
      attenuated with aging. Much of this work has been performed in animal models or in human in&#xD;
      vitro studies. Interestingly, no previous study directly examined the underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      of this observation in humans using in vivo techniques. One potential explanation for an&#xD;
      age-related reduction of the protective effect of IP relates to a direct effect on the&#xD;
      endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much scientific effort has been devoted to develop a human in vivo model to study ischemia&#xD;
      and reperfusion injury. Recently, publications emerged using the flow mediated dilation (FMD)&#xD;
      of the brachial or radial artery before and after a sustained ischaemic stimulus (20 minutes)&#xD;
      to establish the presence of a blunted endothelial function after ischaemia reperfusion&#xD;
      injury.3, 4 This effect of reperfusion injury on the endothelial function can be abrogated by&#xD;
      ischemic preconditioning.3 Endothelial dysfunction is acknowledged to be the first&#xD;
      (subclinical) manifestation of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.5, 6 It is&#xD;
      significantly correlated to occurrence of myocardial infarction and stroke.6 Assessment of&#xD;
      the flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery as measure of endothelial (dys)function, is&#xD;
      a validated model to research effects of possible protective strategies3, 4 and perform&#xD;
      mechanistic experiments4, 7, 8 on IR-injury in humans in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several previous studies failed to demonstrate the ability of pharmacological stimuli to&#xD;
      mimic the beneficial effects of IP in aging vessels.9 Restoration of the age-related&#xD;
      reduction in effectiveness of IP may be possible through exercise training. Indirect evidence&#xD;
      indicates that physical activity, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors, protects&#xD;
      against an occurrence as well as the severity of a myocardial infarction in humans.10&#xD;
      Although this suggests that physical activity may beneficially influence the age-related&#xD;
      reduction in IP, no previous study provided direct evidence for this hypothesis in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cross-sectional observational experiment we will study the impact of aging (young&#xD;
      versus older subjects) and physical fitness (sedentary versus trained older subjects) on the&#xD;
      protective effects of ischaemic preconditioning on brachial artery endothelial function after&#xD;
      ischaemia-reperfusion injury in healthy humans in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that aging is associated with an attenuated ability of ischaemic&#xD;
      preconditioning to prevent the decrease in brachial artery endothelial function observed&#xD;
      after ischaemia reperfusion injury. Moreover, we expect that the age-related reduction in&#xD;
      effectiveness of ischaemic preconditioning to prevent endothelial dysfunction after&#xD;
      reperfusion injury is (at least partly) preserved in trained older subjects.&#xD;
