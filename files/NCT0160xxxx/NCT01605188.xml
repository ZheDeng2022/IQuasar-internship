      The aim of our study is to prospectively identify, at diagnosis, factors predictive of&#xD;
      non-response or loss of response in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with&#xD;
      anti-TNF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both chronic idiopathic inflammatory conditions of&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract that result in a considerably decreased quality of life. Long term&#xD;
      experience with standard therapies for inflammatory bowel disease patients up to the late&#xD;
      1990s demonstrated diverse limitations. Corticosteroids have good short term efficacy, but&#xD;
      are not suitable for maintaining remission, while treatment with immunomodulators are&#xD;
      associated with an important risk of side effects. The introduction of monoclonal antibody to&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) therapy has offered new treatment options originally in&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease and more recently in those with ulcerative colitis as well.&#xD;
      Several clinicians based on the results of clinical trials, now advocate the early use of&#xD;
      intensive therapy (immunosuppressants and/or biologics) to maintain a good quality of life&#xD;
      from the first flare up and prevent any irreversible consequence of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1998 infliximab was the first anti-TNF therapy to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active&#xD;
      luminal and fistulizing CD who have an inadequate response to conventional therapies. In 2007&#xD;
      adalimumab was also approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe CD.&#xD;
      More recently, infliximab has been approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis patients.&#xD;
      The current recommendation for infliximab dosing comprises induction with 5 mg/kg at 0, 2,&#xD;
      and 6 weeks, followed by maintenance 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Adalimumab is administered at a&#xD;
      dose of 160 mg initially followed by 80 mg 2 weeks later and then at a dose of 40 mg every&#xD;
      other week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the aim of administering anti-TNF therapy is achieving disease remission, it should be&#xD;
      noted that in the clinical setting, remission is defined as the absence of any gut-related&#xD;
      symptoms, with a normal C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation ratio (ESR),&#xD;
      hemoglobin, albumin, and platelet count. Clinical response is defined as the improvement of&#xD;
      symptoms (reduced bowel frequency, reduced urgency, improved stool consistency, reduced&#xD;
      abdominal pain, reduced rectal bleeding, improved general well-being, increased energy, and&#xD;
      reduced lethargy) and improvement in blood test parameters (reduced CRP, ESR, and platelet&#xD;
      count, and improved albumin and hemoglobin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the high response rate, some patients do not improve after initiation of anti-TNF&#xD;
      therapy or worsen after initial response. In the ACCENT I trial, 42% of patients had a&#xD;
      primary lack of response to infliximab induction therapy, while in the CHARM trial, 42% of&#xD;
      patients had a primary non-response to open label adalimumab induction therapy. According to&#xD;
      literature data, diminished or complete loss of initial response to anti-TNF therapy can&#xD;
      occur at any time after treatment begins and can occur at 30-50% of the patients treated.&#xD;
      Regaining response can be achieved by either reducing the frequency of infusions or by&#xD;
      increasing the dose, whether sometimes an increase of the dose plus a reduction of the dose&#xD;
      interval is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary non-response is defined as the lack of response or minimal, clinically insignificant&#xD;
      response after initiation of a biological agent. To be defined as demonstrating primary&#xD;
      non-response a patient should have objective evidence of active inflammation and symptoms&#xD;
      related to IBD. There is currently no consensus on how long a biological drug should be&#xD;
      continued before lack of response is declared, although 58% of patients who will demonstrate&#xD;
      a response to infliximab do so within 2 weeks. A substantial proportion of patients, however,&#xD;
      will demonstrate a response up to 12 weeks after commencing treatment. Most responders&#xD;
      demonstrate a clinical response by week 14 (in the case of infliximab that usually includes&#xD;
      three induction plus one further dose). With adalimumab induction therapy it may require up&#xD;
      to 12 weeks to determine whether response has been achieved. Loss of response is defined as&#xD;
      an initial response to a biological drug followed by a diminished or less durable response&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CD patients, primary non-response has been defined variously as failure to achieve a&#xD;
      defined fall of CDAI from baseline, or a CDAI which remains greater than 220. Loss of&#xD;
      response has been defined by a CDAI of greater than 220, which correlates with at least mild&#xD;
      disease activity. In patients with primary non-response, or loss of response, to an anti-TNF&#xD;
      drug, consideration should be given to reassessing disease activity and excluding&#xD;
      complications such as the development of stenosing disease, an abscess, or infections,&#xD;
      including cytomegalovirus and Clostridium difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the morbidity associated with inappropriate dosing and the high costs associated with&#xD;
      therapy with biologic agents, determining predictors of non-response of loss of response&#xD;
      (need for dose escalation) has important clinical and economic implications. However, there&#xD;
      exists a paucity of research examining such factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy (ileocolonoscopy) will be performed at baseline (i.e. before anti-TNF&#xD;
      administration) for all patients included in the study. For Crohn's disease patients, the&#xD;
      simplified endoscopic severity index will be recorded (SES-CD), table 1, while the CD&#xD;
      activity index (CDAI) will also be determined. For ulcerative colitis, the Mayo endoscopic&#xD;
      subscore will be recorded (0: normal mucosa, 1: faded vascular pattern, mild friability, 2:&#xD;
      loss of vascular pattern, erosions, friability, 3: ulcers of spontaneous bleeding). Disease&#xD;
      activity will be graded according to the Clinical Activity Index (Lichtiger's CAI), with a&#xD;
      highest possible score of 21. For all ulcerative colitis patients the Montreal classification&#xD;
      of the extent of the disease will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data on blood hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells, plasma or serum albumin&#xD;
      and C-reactive protein will be collected for all patients at baseline. Use of concurrent&#xD;
      medication will be recorded, especially the dosage data of corticosteroids and those of other&#xD;
      immunosuppressant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab will be administered at 5 mg/Kg body weight at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and thereafter,&#xD;
      every 2 months for the follow up period of 1 year. Adalimumab will be administered at a dose&#xD;
      of 160mg at week 0, 80mg at week 2, 40mg at week 4 and 40mg every other week thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of anti-TNF therapy will be evaluated every 2 months and finally at 12 months&#xD;
      after the start of therapy. At the same time periods the disease activity will be documented&#xD;
      as well. For patients that need dose escalation, the type of dose escalation, i.e. increase&#xD;
      in dosing frequency (every one month for infliximab - every week for adalimumab) or increase&#xD;
      in dosage (10mg/Kg body weight for infliximab - 80mg for adalimumab) will be recorded. The&#xD;
      time from anti-TNF initiation till the need for this dose escalation will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to identify predictors, at baseline, for anti-TNF&#xD;
      non-response and anti-TNF loss of response, leading to dose escalation in patients with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease that will receive infliximab (CD/UC) or adalimumab (CD)&#xD;
      for control of their disease. For this reason at the end of the follow up period (12 months),&#xD;
      the following variables will be tested by univariate analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age at onset of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of disease until the initiation of anti-TNF therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concomitant corticosteroid use at start of anti_TNF therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concomitant immunosuppresant use at start of anti-TNF therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood hemoglobin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematocrit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  White blood cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-reactive protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-ds DNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fecal calprotectin level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDAI at baseline for CD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lichtiger score at baseline for UC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous major abdominal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indication for anti-TNF therapy in CD patients (luminal CD, luminal and fistulizing CD,&#xD;
           luminal CD with extraintestinal manifestations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of disease for CD patients (ileitis, colitis, ileocolitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of disease for UC patients (Montreal classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior appendectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history of IBD&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, immunological markers with predictive value for anti-TNF non-response or loss of&#xD;
      response will be sought both at intestinal and systemic level. For the determination of&#xD;
      mucosal markers, 2 biopsy samples in RNAlater will be collected during the endoscopy prior to&#xD;
      the initiation of anti-TNF therapy. Samples will be stored at -80oC and used for the&#xD;
      quantitative mRNA expression of various immunological markers, mainly cytokines and their&#xD;
      receptors, adhesion molecules and other inflammatory proteins by real time PCR. A third&#xD;
      biopsy specimen will be immersed in formalin and maintained for protein expression studies by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry. For the determination of systemic markers, blood will be collected from&#xD;
      patients and serum will be separated and stored at -80oC. These samples will be used for the&#xD;
      measurement of soluble inflammatory markers that may demonstrate predictive value for&#xD;
      anti-TNF non-response or loss of response. Inflammatory markers will be measured by Multiplex&#xD;
      assays or by individual ELISAs&#xD;
