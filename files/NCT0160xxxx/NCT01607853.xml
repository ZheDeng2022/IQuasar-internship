      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-psoriatic effect of Daivobet® gel applied&#xD;
      then removed after 10 minutes (+/- 2 minutes), Daivobet® gel applied then removed after 20&#xD;
      minutes (+/- 2 minutes) compared with Daivobet® gel and Daivobet® gel vehicle applied for 24&#xD;
      hours (+/- 2 hours), using the psoriasis plaque test modified from the method developed by KJ&#xD;
      Dumas and JR Scholtz.&#xD;
