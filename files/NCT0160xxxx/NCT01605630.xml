  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The no show rate for mammography screening is high among Navajo women. One barrier to&#xD;
      preventive screening is a lack of cancer literacy including low knowledge and cultural&#xD;
      attitudes (e.g., fatalism) about screening. The investigators will examine the potential&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a cancer literacy intervention for families of Navajo women&#xD;
      who have no showed for three consecutive times to mammography screening who have never or&#xD;
      rarely been screened in the past.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This proposal describes a community-based participatory research study to develop and pilot&#xD;
      test a new behavioral intervention to promote mammography screening among Navajo women. From&#xD;
      a public health perspective, the intervention has the potential to reach many Navajo women,&#xD;
      as 80% of women scheduled for mammography appointments do not follow through. These women&#xD;
      (over 1,500 each year) are referred to the Nation Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention&#xD;
      Program (NNBCCPP). A key barrier toward implementing cancer prevention and control efforts in&#xD;
      the Navajo community is a lack of cancer literacy or cultural and conceptual knowledge&#xD;
      regarding cancer. Other barriers to screening are fear of cancer, stigma of cancer (even&#xD;
      talking about cancer) often experienced by the patient, family and community, and lack of&#xD;
      knowledge about the etiology of cancer and importance of early detection. Therefore,&#xD;
      communication about cancer is impeded within Navajo families and the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal builds on our successful partnership and collaboration with Din√© College (the&#xD;
      Navajo tribal college). The proposed study is designed to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      potential efficacy of a cancer-literacy focused, family-based intervention on completion of&#xD;
      mammography screening for Navajo women. The intervention will include culturally and&#xD;
      linguistically appropriate educational materials about cancer (e.g., the Navajo Cancer&#xD;
      Glossary). The project will be implemented in two phases. During Phase 1, the investigators&#xD;
      will develop the family cancer literacy intervention with feedback from our community&#xD;
      advisory committee. In addition, the Cancer Literacy Measure will be adapted for Navajo women&#xD;
      through focus groups and individual interviews. Phase 2 will consist of a formative&#xD;
      evaluation of the intervention. The NNBCCPP patient and a female family member will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in pairs to the control condition (existing NNBCCPP health education&#xD;
      services, N=40 pairs) or to receive these health education services plus the family cancer&#xD;
      literacy intervention (N=40 pairs). The investigators will assess the intervention's&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability as indicated by the recruitment and retention rates and&#xD;
      qualitative ratings of treatment acceptability. In addition, the investigators will examine&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention compared with the control group on the proportion of women who&#xD;
      complete mammography screening at 3-month follow-up documented by NNBCCPP records. The&#xD;
      investigators will also examine changes in Cancer Literacy Measure scores from baseline to&#xD;
      3-month follow-up among both patients and family members. The investigators expect that as a&#xD;
      result of this project, the investigators will have developed a replicable, feasible, and&#xD;
      acceptable intervention, the efficacy of which can be tested in future large-scale randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials. In addition, the adapted Cancer Literacy Measure could be used in future&#xD;
      cancer prevention and control projects within the Navajo Nation. The overall objective is to&#xD;
      reduce breast cancer morbidity and mortality among Navajo women.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In Phase 1, we will recruit 17 Navajo women for individual interviews (n=5) and focus&#xD;
        groups (n=12) to adapt our measures. Eligibility criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. aged 40 years or older and&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. provides written informed consent. We chose to develop our measures based on feedback&#xD;
             from the general community of women who are screening eligible instead of matching the&#xD;
             inclusion/exclusion criteria to that used in the formative evaluation of the&#xD;
             intervention (Phase 2). This will enhance our ability to use the Cancer Literacy&#xD;
             Measure and other assessments in subsequent breast cancer prevention and control&#xD;
             studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In Phase 2, we will recruit a total of 40 patient-family member pairs. To be eligible for&#xD;
        the study, the NNBCCPP patient must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. be aged 40 years or older,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. provide written informed consent,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. be referred to the NNBCCPP as a &quot;no-show&quot; for mammography screening after three&#xD;
             scheduling attempts,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. have no prior history of mammography screening,&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. have no prior history of breast cancer, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. can identify a female family member or other individual who resides in or near the&#xD;
             home who could participate in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, the family member must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. be female,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. aged 18 years or older,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. be fluent and literate in Navajo,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. be interested and able to participate, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
