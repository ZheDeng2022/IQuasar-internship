  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with tetraplegia often retain some level of mobility of the upper body. The proposed&#xD;
      study will test the hypothesis that it is possible to develop personalized interfaces, which&#xD;
      utilize the residual mobility to enable paralyzed persons to control computers, wheelchairs&#xD;
      and other assistive devices. If successful the project will result into the establishment of&#xD;
      a new family of human-machine interfaces based on wearable sensors that adapt their functions&#xD;
      to their users' abilities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of these studies is to enable persons paralyzed by spinal cord injury (SCI) to drive&#xD;
      powered wheelchairs and interact with computers by acting through an interface that maximizes&#xD;
      the effectiveness of their residual motor function. This is called a &quot;body-machine interface&quot;&#xD;
      because it maps the motions of the upper-body (arms and shoulders) to the space of device&#xD;
      control signals in an optimal way. In this way, paralyzed persons that cannot operate a&#xD;
      joystick controller because of lack of hand mobility can effectively use their whole upper&#xD;
      body as virtual joystick device. An important characteristic of the proposed approach is that&#xD;
      it is based on the possibility to control a computer or a wheelchair by bodily movements&#xD;
      through an interactive learning process, in which the interface adapts itself to the&#xD;
      subject's mobility and the subject learns to act through the interface. This study aims at&#xD;
      developing and testing the customization of this interface to a group of SCI participants&#xD;
      with tetraplegia, resulting from high-level cervical injury. The proposed research is&#xD;
      organized in three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 1) To develop new functional capabilities in persons with spinal cord injury by&#xD;
      customizing a body-machine interface to their individual upper body mobility. After fitting&#xD;
      the interface to the residual movements of each subject, participants will practice computer&#xD;
      games aimed at training two classes of control actions: operating a virtual joystick and&#xD;
      operating a virtual keyboard. This study will test the ability of the subjects to perform&#xD;
      skilled maneuvers with a simulated wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 2.) To test the hypothesis that practicing the upper-body control of personalized&#xD;
      interfaces results in significant physical and psychological benefits after spinal-cord&#xD;
      injury. A study will evaluate and quantify the impact of the practicing functional upper-body&#xD;
      motions on the mobility of the shoulder and arms by conventional clinical methods and by&#xD;
      measuring the subjects' ability to generate coordinated upper body movements and to apply&#xD;
      isometric forces. Other studies under this aim will evaluate the effects of operating the&#xD;
      body-machine interface on musculoskeletal pain and on the mood and mental state of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 3) To train spinal-cord injury survivors to skillfully operate a powered wheelchair&#xD;
      using their enhanced upper body motor skills and customized interface parameters. Finally,&#xD;
      the last study will test the hypothesis that the skills learned through practice in the&#xD;
      virtual environment are retained for the control of an actual powered wheelchair. After&#xD;
      reaching stable performance in the simulated wheelchair, subjects will practice the control&#xD;
      of the physical wheelchair in safe a testing environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 4.) To understand how extensive practice with a body machine interface affects the&#xD;
      cortical representation of the trained limbs. A study will evaluate and quantify the impact&#xD;
      of the practicing functional upper-body motions on corticospinal excitability as a correlate&#xD;
      to sensorimotor skill learning. Participants will meet the inclusion criteria for both the&#xD;
      main study and satisfy the additional optional criteria. Participant will practice upper-body&#xD;
      movements using the body-machine interface. The study will evaluate the evolution of&#xD;
      corticospinal excitability in related areas of the motor cortex during the training compared&#xD;
      to the baseline and after a follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this study will lead to effective operation of a highly customized interface&#xD;
      that adapts to the residual motor capability of its users. Physical and psychological&#xD;
      benefits are expected to derive from the sustained and coordinated activity associated with&#xD;
      the use of this body-machine interface&#xD;

    <description>The intervention compares two ways of customizing the body-machine interface which will be used for subjects for 40 sessions (spread over 8 months). In one case (SCI static), the body-machine interface is static. In the other case (SCI Machine Learning), there is a machine learning algorithm that adapts to the movements made by the subject.</description>
