      STUDY BACKGROUND AND RATIONAL Most low-income countries are making slow progress in&#xD;
      addressing childhood mortality - too slow to achieve the fourth Millennium Development Goal&#xD;
      by 2015. Countries, donors and development agencies are responding to the situation by&#xD;
      redoubling efforts to stimulate and support child survival activities in countries,&#xD;
      particularly in Africa. The Catalytic Initiative to Save a Million Lives (CI) is a&#xD;
      partnership between donor agencies committed to accelerate progress toward MDGs 4 and 5&#xD;
      through support of scale-up of proven high impact interventions. UNICEF and the Canadian&#xD;
      International Development Agency (CIDA), as part of the CI, are undertaking a major&#xD;
      initiative to reduce mortality among children less than five years of age in several&#xD;
      countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethiopia has a high under-five mortality rate, estimated at 123 per 1000 live births by the&#xD;
      2005 Demographic and Health Survey. The country has made a commitment to achieve the MDG 4&#xD;
      target of a two-thirds reduction in mortality by 2015 as reflected through the launching of&#xD;
      the national Health Extension Program (HEP) in 2004, with continued support from UNICEF and&#xD;
      CI funding. The key program strategy is to train and support approximately 30,000 Health&#xD;
      Extension Workers (HEWs) to provide promotive, preventive, and selected curative health care&#xD;
      services at the community level. Previously, the HEWs treated diarrhea with ORS and malaria&#xD;
      with rapid diagnostic kits and ACTs; pneumonia cases were referred to health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethiopia has recently adopted a policy to expand management of pneumonia among children&#xD;
      under-five with antibiotics to communities through HEWs. This provides a unique opportunity&#xD;
      to accelerate increases in coverage of treatment of pneumonia, which is one of the greatest&#xD;
      killers of children under-five in Ethiopia. This expansion, when combined with the existing&#xD;
      community management of malaria, diarrhea and severe acute malnutrition, is referred to as&#xD;
      integrated community case management (HEP+ICCM) and is largely supported through the&#xD;
      Catalytic Initiative by CIDA and UNICEF and will focus on its first stage on five regions of&#xD;
      the country: Amhara, Benishangul-Gumaz, Oromia, SNNP and Tigray. The leading strategy of the&#xD;
      HEP+ICCM initiative is to increase the capacity of the HEWs to effectively assess, classify,&#xD;
      and manage the leading causes of preventable child mortality including pneumonia, malaria,&#xD;
      diarrhea, and severe acute malnutrition. In the focus regions, plans have been developed to&#xD;
      introduce CCM of childhood pneumonia with cotrimoxazole and diarrhea with ORS and zinc,&#xD;
      malaria with ACTs, and malnutrition with therapeutic feeding. The program plans to conduct&#xD;
      refresher trainings of HEWs and their supervisors, strengthen supervision, logistical support&#xD;
      and the ICCM system overall. The initial implementation will start in August 2010 and to be&#xD;
      phased in Oromia region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the ICCM varies across specific country contexts and depends on the&#xD;
      strength of implementation. It is therefore essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      scale-up strategy to provide a basis for future program improvement and global evidence on&#xD;
      effective strategies for accelerating reductions in under-five mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The Institute for International Programs at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg&#xD;
      School of Public Health (IIP-JHU) has been commissioned by CIDA and UNICEF to conduct an&#xD;
      independent prospective evaluation of the HEP+ICCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study objective is to conduct a full prospective evaluation of the impact of the&#xD;
      Ethiopian HEP+ICCM of common childhood illnesses implemented through HEWs on mortality and&#xD;
      nutritional status of children under the age of five.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To measure the effect of the HEP+ICCM program relative to routine HEP approach in the&#xD;
      country over an 18 month period on changes in coverage of case management of common childhood&#xD;
      illnesses and severe acute malnutrition, reductions in mortality among children under the age&#xD;
      of five, and improvements in nutritional status using a rigorous evaluation design; ii. To&#xD;
      track program implementation inputs, processes, outputs and contextual factors; and iii. To&#xD;
      measure implementation strength and assess the quality of child health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY In Oromia region, implementation of the HEP+ICCM program will be phased allowing&#xD;
      the possibility to identify comparison areas for the evaluation. The prospective evaluation&#xD;
      will use a cluster randomized design with stratification by zone, within which woredas are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to intervention and comparison arms using a restricted randomization&#xD;
      procedure. Coverage of childhood interventions will be measured at baseline and end-line with&#xD;
      a midterm &quot;quality of care implementation snapshot&quot; to assess the strength of implementation.&#xD;
      Mortality estimates for both the intervention and comparison woredas will be generated&#xD;
      retrospectively through the end-line household survey. Program implementation and contextual&#xD;
      factors will be documented throughout the evaluation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be focused the Jimma and West Hararge zones. Woredas within the two&#xD;
      evaluation zones will be randomly assigned to intervention and comparison areas. Intervention&#xD;
      areas are referred to as phase 1 area and comparison areas referred to as phase 2 areas. The&#xD;
      phase 1 and 2 woredas will be randomly assigned through an adapted, restricted randomization&#xD;
      process, balanced by the presence of malaria, food security and the zone. Urban areas were&#xD;
      excluded since the urban HEP is a recent addition and implemented differently. In Jimma zone,&#xD;
      the seventeen woredas will be divided into nine phase 1 woredas and eight phase 2 woredas. In&#xD;
      West Haraghe zone, there will be seven woredas in phase 1 and phase 2 areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ORHB has committed to at least an 18-month phase-in between the identified intervention&#xD;
      and comparison areas in these two areas. Phase 1 woredas will implement HEP+ICCM while the&#xD;
      Phase 2 woredas will continue to offer services included in the routine HEP. Phase 1&#xD;
      implementation in the two evaluation zones will begin in February 2011, following the&#xD;
      baseline coverage survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SOURCES Household Surveys: The primary data for the evaluation will come from baseline&#xD;
      and end-line household surveys. The baseline survey was conducted in January - February 2011&#xD;
      and the end-line survey will be conducted 18 months following the end of the HEW training as&#xD;
      part of phase one. These surveys will measure coverage of the child health interventions of&#xD;
      interest and nutritional status among children under five. The end-line survey will include,&#xD;
      in addition to coverage measures, a full birth history for women 15-49 years old to measure&#xD;
      retrospectively mortality among children under five. Partners report that phase one&#xD;
      implementation was completed in July 2011; therefore the end-line survey is planned for&#xD;
      January 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the baseline survey, we estimate that 3,700 households (1850 in each arm) are required to&#xD;
      detect a change in coverage indicators between baseline and end-line. For the end-line&#xD;
      survey, sample size of households is calculated to detect a difference in differences of 20&#xD;
      percentage point in under-five mortality between intervention and comparison areas with 80%&#xD;
      power. We estimate a conservative sample of about 15,157 households in each arm of the study&#xD;
      will be required, making a total sample size of 30,314 households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of implementation strength and assessment of quality of child health care data: A&#xD;
      community-level survey of HEWs is planned to provide a &quot;snapshot&quot; of HEP +ICCM implementation&#xD;
      strength in the two evaluation zones. The data collected will comprise core indicators of&#xD;
      implementation strength, as well as indicators on demand-generation activities, utilization&#xD;
      and the quality of services provided by HEWs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will sample functional 104 health posts in the intervention areas and 46 in the&#xD;
      comparison areas. Study participants will include: 1) HEWs performing case management of&#xD;
      childhood illnesses, 2) sick children 2-59 months of age presenting at health posts for&#xD;
      consultations and their caretakers and 3) sick children 2-59 months in the communities&#xD;
      surrounding health posts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS The main analysis of the data will involve comparison of trends in coverage and&#xD;
      impact indicators between intervention and comparison arms, using appropriate statistical&#xD;
      models that adjust for clustering at cluster level. Adequacy of implementation in each arm of&#xD;
      the evaluation will be determined using data from baseline surveys, process documentation&#xD;
      data and the implementation snapshot survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using data from the end-line survey, under-five mortality will be computed on 18-month period&#xD;
      before the baseline survey (which will represent the baseline under-five mortality) and on&#xD;
      18-month period after full implementation (the end-line under-five mortality). Precaution&#xD;
      will be taken to measure the end-line mortality only on period starting from time when full&#xD;
      implementation (training and deployment of HEWs with drugs) has been completed. Full&#xD;
      implementation in intervention woredas was achieved in July 2011, six months after the&#xD;
      completion of the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first level of analysis will assess &quot;intention to treat&quot;, which consists of analyzing the&#xD;
      data from the intervention and comparison arms as per the start-up design. This analysis will&#xD;
      compare changes between baseline and end-line in under-five mortality rates as well as&#xD;
      nutritional status among children under-five in the intervention and comparison areas.&#xD;
      Difference in differences analysis will be conducted to estimate the impact of the ICCM on&#xD;
      mortality. Proportion hazard models will also be applied to control for possible differences&#xD;
      in baseline characteristics and contextual factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important secondary objective of the HEP+ICCM is to increase equity in access to high&#xD;
      impact, cost-effective preventative and curative interventions. The evaluation team will&#xD;
      assess changes in inequalities associated with the implementation of the HEP+ICCM program&#xD;
      interventions by examining project outcomes and impact across socioeconomic and demographic&#xD;
      subgroups.&#xD;
