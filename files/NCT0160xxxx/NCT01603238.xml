  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, non-randomised, single-dose study in 6 healthy male subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects attended a screening visit within 28 days before drug administration. Subjects were&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical unit on the morning of the day before dosing (Day -1) and received a&#xD;
      single oral administration of study drug in a fasted state on Day 1. Subjects were resident&#xD;
      in the clinic for up to 7 days after dosing; they could be discharged sooner if a mass&#xD;
      balance cumulative recovery of &gt;95% was achieved, or if a mass balance cumulative recovery of&#xD;
      &gt;90% was achieved and &lt;1% was collected within 2 separate, consecutive 24 h periods. At&#xD;
      specified times during the study period, blood samples were taken and urine and faeces were&#xD;
      collected for PK analysis. Safety assessments were also performed.&#xD;
