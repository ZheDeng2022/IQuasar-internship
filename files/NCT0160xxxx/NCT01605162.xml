             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential&#xD;

             appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been&#xD;
             sterilized surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing). Females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
             (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method [such as&#xD;
             condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral&#xD;
             contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout&#xD;
             the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently&#xD;
             abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double-barrier method as described above if&#xD;
             she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug&#xD;
             discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a&#xD;
             stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30&#xD;
             days after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and&#xD;
             their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing&#xD;
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and&#xD;
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation).&#xD;
