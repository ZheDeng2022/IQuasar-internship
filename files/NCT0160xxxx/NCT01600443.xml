  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is undertaken to investigate if the urethral microtrauma, caused by intermittent&#xD;
      catheterization, differs between three hydrophilic catheters for intermittent&#xD;
      catheterization, LoFric; SpeediCath (SC) and SpeediCath Compact Male (SCCM). The study is a&#xD;
      prospective, randomised, cross-over, single-centre study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be randomized to use three different catheter types. Three catheterizations&#xD;
      will be performed with each catheter type during one day, with at least two hours between&#xD;
      each catheterization. The washout period between catheter switch will be at least one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate urethral microtrauma for three hydrophilic catheters&#xD;
      with regards to hematuria after intermittent catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate urethral microtrauma for three hydrophilic catheters&#xD;
      with regards to pyuria and subjective evaluation after intermittent catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the three catheters will be evaluated in terms of adverse advents, non-serious&#xD;
      and serious, rated for causality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that level of hematuria is equal after using different catheters will be&#xD;
      tested using Wilcoxon signed rank test. The hypothesis will be rejected if the p-value is&#xD;
      less than 5%.&#xD;
