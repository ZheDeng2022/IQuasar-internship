    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) affects up to 50% of adult populations and stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (SUI) is the most common form of UI, accounting for approximately 60% of&#xD;
      patients. Women are affected by SUI much more often than men. Urine leakage in women with SUI&#xD;
      occurs on exertion or during tasks that increase pressure on the bladder such as sneezing or&#xD;
      coughing. SUI has been shown to be a barrier to physical activity in women, and as such can&#xD;
      contribute to the development of diseases and disorders associated with inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUI appears to have many contributing factors such as structural damage (eg. tears in the&#xD;
      pelvic organ supporting tissues), muscle weakness related to nerve injury or aging, or&#xD;
      thinning of the urethral wall and/or its surrounding muscular sphincters. Currently the most&#xD;
      common treatments for SUI are conservative therapy, which normally takes the form of exercise&#xD;
      therapy provided by specialized nurses or physical therapists, and surgery, which is aimed at&#xD;
      enhancing urethral support. Exercise therapy is effective, resulting in complete cure in 50%&#xD;
      of cases, and surgery is effective for approximately 80% of patients but carries risks such&#xD;
      as the development of urinary retention. It is currently not clear which treatment approach&#xD;
      is better for which women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the proposed research, the investigators aim to determine how to predict which&#xD;
      patients will improve or be cured with exercise therapy such that surgery can be avoided.&#xD;
      Specifically the investigators will determine what is different between patients in whom&#xD;
      exercise therapy succeeds and in whom exercise therapy fails. The investigators will also&#xD;
      determine whether physiotherapist-supervised training of the pelvic floor muscles before&#xD;
      surgery improves surgical outcomes. The proposed research will enable us to better understand&#xD;
      the female continence system and how it responds to physiotherapeutic intervention. It will&#xD;
      help us to develop improved assessment procedures that can streamline patient management.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that participants in the physical therapy group will demonstrate greater&#xD;
      improvements in pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function after treatment when compared to the&#xD;
      control group. It is also expected that women in the physical therapy group will show better&#xD;
      post-surgical outcomes when compared to the control group. The investigators will also&#xD;
      develop and test a predictive model to identify those women with SUI who will benefit from&#xD;
      physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: to evaluate characteristics predictive of the success or failure of PFM training&#xD;
      in women with SUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet this objective, a cohort study will be used. Women with SUI will be recruited&#xD;
      prospectively, will provide demographic information, will undergo a clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      their PFM strength, will fill out the International Consultation on Incontinence&#xD;
      Questionnaires (ICIQs), and will undergo an extensive evaluation of their continence system&#xD;
      using ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound imaging will be used to measure muscle morphology (the&#xD;
      presence and extent of PFM defect, PFM cross sectional area, urethral sphincter cross&#xD;
      sectional area), fascial support (position of the bladder neck at rest and on Valsalva&#xD;
      maneuver) and urethral mobility (amount of excursion of the urethra on coughing). A&#xD;
      predictive multivariate binary logistic regression model will be developed to determine&#xD;
      whether demographic variables, PFM strength, PFM morphology measures, fascial support or&#xD;
      urethral mobility measured prior to the intervention can predict which women with SUI are&#xD;
      cured after a standardized 12-week physical therapy program aimed at improving the strength,&#xD;
      power, endurance and motor control of the PFMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: to determine whether a program of pre- and peri-operative physical therapy aimed&#xD;
      at improving the strength and motor control of the PFMs improves surgical outcomes relative&#xD;
      to usual care in women with predominant symptoms of SUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are waiting for surgery to treat symptoms of SUI at two hospital sites will be&#xD;
      randomized to either a physical therapy group or a control group. Women assigned to the&#xD;
      physical therapy group will receive a standardized 12 week program of PFM training prior to&#xD;
      their surgery, will continue with these exercises until they undergo surgery, and will resume&#xD;
      their exercises after surgery. The control group will receive usual care, which is a handout&#xD;
      describing PFM exercises. The primary outcome of this study will be reported scores on&#xD;
      patient-oriented ICIQs, which will be completed on entering the study, twelve weeks later,&#xD;
      and at surgical follow up visit 12 weeks after surgery. Analysis of variance models will be&#xD;
      used to compare outcomes between the physiotherapy group and the control group both before&#xD;
      surgery and at 12 weeks after surgery. Chi Square models will assess whether cure rates are&#xD;
      higher in women belonging to the physical therapy as compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, the results will direct clinical decision making around the delivery of&#xD;
      appropriate interventions for women with SUI, particularly physical therapy and TVTand TVT-O&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF METHODS AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Study Design and Methodology: Subjects and Screening All women above the age of 18 who&#xD;
      report symptoms of SUI and who have been evaluated by a urogynaecologist (Dr. M.A.Harvey or&#xD;
      Dr. S. Johnston) at Kingston General Hospital (KGH), (Dr. K. Baker) at the Ottawa Hospital,&#xD;
      (Dr. Magali Robert) at the Foothills Hospital in Calgary or (Dr. V. della Zazzera) at the&#xD;
      Montfort Hospital in Ottawa and who have been deemed appropriate for TVT or TVT-O surgery and&#xD;
      have decided to pursue this option will be asked by their physician if they are willing to be&#xD;
      contacted by the investigators. For those who agree, they will receive a follow-up phone call&#xD;
      to determine their interest in participating and, if appropriate, their eligibility. Eligible&#xD;
      and interested participants will be instructed on how to complete a three-day bladder diary&#xD;
      to record the number of daily episodes of urine leakage experienced over a typical three day&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be scheduled to attend a baseline evaluation at the Pelvic Floor Laboratory&#xD;
      at Queen's University or at the Dr. Linda McLean's Pelvic Floor Laboratory at the University&#xD;
      of Ottawa. At this first visit, eligibility of the participant will be confirmed based on the&#xD;
      bladder diary results (they must have experienced at least one episode of urine leakage over&#xD;
      the three-day diary), a pad test and the absence of evidence of any neurological cause of&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who are still eligible will have their height and weight recorded, and bladder volume&#xD;
      will be measured using trans-abdominal ultrasound (US) imaging. If the bladder volume is at&#xD;
      least 250 ml, then the participant will begin a standardized pad test (i.e., a circuit of&#xD;
      walking and stair climbing for 30 minutes, which has been shown to be highly sensitive and&#xD;
      specific to the diagnosis of urinary incontinence. If the bladder volume is less than 250mL,&#xD;
      the volunteer will be asked to drink 350mL of water and will wait until proper volume is&#xD;
      attained. In this case, the volunteer will complete the study questionnaires described below&#xD;
      while waiting for her bladder to fill. Once her bladder has been filled to 250mL, she will&#xD;
      then begin the test. For the test, an incontinence pad will be weighed and adhered to her&#xD;
      undergarment. The woman will then perform a standardized circuit of walking and stair&#xD;
      climbing for 30 minutes, after which time the weight of the pad will be measured again. An&#xD;
      increase in weight greater than 1g will confirm the presence of urine leakage and will&#xD;
      confirm the participant's eligibility. If the participant is deemed ineligible at this point,&#xD;
      she will be thanked for her participation and withdrawn from the remainder of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, volunteers who meet the bladder diary and pad test requirements will undergo&#xD;
      an urogynecological screening exam by a research assistant.. This physical screening includes&#xD;
      palpation to rule out pelvic mass(es), manual muscle testing to evaluate PFM strength, and&#xD;
      sensory and reflex testing to rule out neurologic causes of incontinence. This will&#xD;
      constitute the last step to evaluate participant's eligibility. If the participant has no&#xD;
      evidence of pelvic mass or neurologic defects, all criteria are met, and the woman will enter&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this same session, eligible participants will undergo a three-dimensional (3D) US imaging&#xD;
      assessment of her pelvic region. Ultrasound imaging will be performed first in the lithotomy&#xD;
      position using a transvaginal endoprobe to evaluate the urethral sphincter. Next, using a 3D&#xD;
      curvilinear transducer, the PFMs will be visualized in the axial plane while the participant&#xD;
      performs three repetitions of a maximal voluntary contraction. A 2D curvilinear transducer&#xD;
      will then be used to capture video clips in the sagittal plane while the participant performs&#xD;
      three repetitions of a Valsalva maneuver, and of a cough. The participant will then move to a&#xD;
      standing position with a wide stance to allow for the curvilinear transducer to be applied&#xD;
      against her perineum. She will be asked to repeat three repetitions of the Valsalva maneuver,&#xD;
      and three repetitions of a maximal effort cough. This will conclude the US imaging testing&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they have not already been completed, the participant will conclude this session by&#xD;
      completing the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaires (ICIQs) to evaluate&#xD;
      their incontinence symptoms, and each participant will be given a standard educational sheet&#xD;
      describing how to perform PFM strengthening exercises. They will be advised that they will be&#xD;
      contacted to inform them whether they have been randomized to the physical therapy or control&#xD;
      group. The entire baseline testing will take approximately 2.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either the physical therapy&#xD;
      group or the control group using a secure web-based computerized randomization system which&#xD;
      will conceal future randomizations. Randomization will be stratified by site using permuted&#xD;
      blocks of random size. Participant blinding is not possible in a study of this nature,&#xD;
      however the research assistant performing the pre- and post-treatment assessments will remain&#xD;
      blinded to group assignment during all data collection and processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: A total of 400 volunteers will be randomly assigned to each of the two&#xD;
      experimental groups: Physical therapy or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Therapy Group The women in the standardized physical therapy treatment group will&#xD;
      attend six sessions over a 12-week period. Treatments will be delivered by physical&#xD;
      therapists with post-graduate training in urinary incontinence management. Physical&#xD;
      therapists will have been trained on how to deliver the semi-standardized treatment protocol&#xD;
      at their respective physical therapy clinics in the cities of Ottawa, Kingston or Calgary. In&#xD;
      the first session, volunteers will learn to perform a proper PFM contraction using manual&#xD;
      palpation and feedback to optimize PFM contraction quality in which they will learn to&#xD;
      contract their PFMs before tasks that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing and&#xD;
      postural perturbations (i.e., the Knack exercise). The women will be instructed to perform&#xD;
      their prescribed exercises daily. At each 45-minute visit, the physical therapist will review&#xD;
      and reinforce a proper PFM contraction technique, will evaluate PFM strength using a modified&#xD;
      Oxford scale to provide feedback about progress, will review the Knack exercise (a quick&#xD;
      contraction of the PFM during high intra-abdominal pressure) and will supervise the volunteer&#xD;
      while she performs each task to ensure correct performance. The exercises will be progressed&#xD;
      and compliance will be recorded as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group Participants in the control group will be asked to follow the recommendations&#xD;
      on their pelvic floor muscle training educational sheet. They will be asked on follow up&#xD;
      visits to report whether or not they attempted PFM exercises and if so, at what frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention/Pre-surgical testing Women in both groups will return to the laboratory 12&#xD;
      weeks after the baseline testing described above. To ensure the evaluators remain blinded to&#xD;
      group assignment, women will be asked not to reveal to the research assistant whether or not&#xD;
      they received physical therapy treatment. The pre-surgical testing will repeat the baseline&#xD;
      testing procedures in the same manner as described above (i.e., bladder diary, pad test, US&#xD;
      imaging, questionnaires), with the exception that the neurological assessment that was&#xD;
      initially used to determine eligibility will not be performed. After this pre-surgical&#xD;
      testing, the women in the physical therapy group will be instructed to continue their&#xD;
      exercise program and will visit their physical therapist every four weeks until their&#xD;
      surgery. Women in the control group will be advised to continue their at-home PFM exercises,&#xD;
      according to the information that was provided on their standard educational sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical intervention Only women in the physical therapy group will be advised to&#xD;
      continue their exercise program starting the day after their TVT surgery. Each woman will&#xD;
      visit her physical therapist one week, three weeks and five weeks after her surgery to ensure&#xD;
      she is performing her PFM exercises correctly and to continue the progression of her PFM&#xD;
      exercises according to her progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical testing All women will return to the laboratory 12 weeks after their surgery&#xD;
      and will be re-evaluated by the research assistant (still blinded to group assignment) using&#xD;
      the ICIQs and the pad test. This post-surgical testing will last 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up testing All women enrolled in the study will undergo long-term follow up&#xD;
      using the bladder diary, ICIQs and pad test at 12 months and 2 years post-surgery. The ICIQs&#xD;
      can be administered by phone, and this will be done by research assistants whenever patients&#xD;
      cannot attend their follow-up visit(s) in order to reduce the number of participants lost to&#xD;
      follow-up. This will conclude all participation and all women will be mailed or emailed a&#xD;
      research study debriefing sheet outlining the study findings&#xD;
