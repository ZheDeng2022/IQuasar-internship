  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PC-A11 with superficial&#xD;
      and/or interstitial laser light application in patients with recurrent SCCHN.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 650 000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed worldwide each year&#xD;
      (2). Europe alone, it is estimated that there are approximately 143 000 new cases and more&#xD;
      than 68 000 deaths each year (3). The vast majority (&gt;90%) of head and neck malignancies are&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinomas. Most (60-70%) patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and&#xD;
      neck (SCCHN) present with loco regionally advanced disease (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment options for SCCHN include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Single-modality treatment with surgery or radiotherapy is generally recommended for the 40%&#xD;
      of patients who present stage I or II disease. Each of the two modalities results in similar&#xD;
      survival with cure rates ranging between 60% and 90% (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 60% of the patients who present with locally advanced disease at diagnosis, combined&#xD;
      modality therapy is generally recommended. For patients with unresectable disease the current&#xD;
      standard treatment is concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation. This is also the standard&#xD;
      for patients with resectable disease when organ preservation is desired and, as adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment, for patients with high-risk pathological findings at surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite such an approach, a substantial percentage of patients (20-30%) develop local and/or&#xD;
      regional recurrences and distant metastases (3). Recurrent disease is often not resectable,&#xD;
      and even in resectable cases, some patients decline the surgical procedure due to quality of&#xD;
      life considerations. Additionally, in recurrent disease the radiation tolerance of the normal&#xD;
      tissues makes re-irradiation technically challenging and frequently more toxic than the&#xD;
      initial course (4). The prognosis of patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN is generally&#xD;
      poor, with a median survival of 6-9 months (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic ratio in recurrent SCCHN is narrow. Therefore, there is a large unmet medical&#xD;
      need for novel treatments in this patient group, both to lengthen overall survival, and to&#xD;
      improve the patients' quality of life&#xD;

             lifestyle of the subject, periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;

&#xD;
         27. Evidence of any other medical conditions (such as psychiatric illness, infectious&#xD;
             diseases, physical examination or laboratory findings) that may interfere with the&#xD;
             planned PC-A11 treatment, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk&#xD;
