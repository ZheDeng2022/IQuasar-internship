      The aims of this study were to characterise relative bioavailability of Diena (Test) in&#xD;
      comparison to Valette® (Reference) after single dose administration under fasting conditions&#xD;
      and to assess bioequivalence of Test vs. Reference after single dose administration under&#xD;
      fasting conditions, determined by use of area under the concentration time curve AUC0-tlast&#xD;
      and maximal concentration Cmax obtained for ethinylestradiol (EE) and dienogest (DNG).&#xD;
      Furthermore, a descriptive characterisation of safety and tolerability of the investigational&#xD;
      products in the study population was performed.&#xD;
