  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Verruca vulgaris (VV), or the common wart, is a relatively prevalent and often frustrating&#xD;
      cutaneous disease to treat. A single, highly effective therapy for the treatment of VV has&#xD;
      not been found. Liquid nitrogen is considered the standard of care for VV and studies report&#xD;
      a 44% to 47% cure rate. In search of more efficacious and convenient therapeutic options, a&#xD;
      variety of lasers have been reported in the treatment of VV including the Nd:YAG laser&#xD;
      (1064nm). Lasers offer the potential for decreased treatment associated pain, fewer office&#xD;
      visits, higher cure rates and lower recurrence rates. However, many of the available&#xD;
      published studies draw conclusions from case reports and small case series without any&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials. A randomized, controlled study is needed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the microsecond Nd:YAG (1064nm) compared to conventional cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use the Cutera CoolGlide Nd:YAG laser that operates in the infrared spectrum&#xD;
      at a wavelength of 1064nm. This a single site, double blind, randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the efficacy of the Nd:YAG laser (Cutera) in the treatment of verruca&#xD;
      vulgaris of the hands and feet versus conventional liquid nitrogen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there will be a significantly higher number of warts with&#xD;
      complete resolution at 4 months follow-up in the Nd:YAG treated group versus the liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen therapy group. The investigators also hypothesize that there will be a faster time&#xD;
      to complete resolution of the verruca in the Nd:YAG treated group versus the liquid nitrogen&#xD;
      treated group.&#xD;

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be complete resolution of the lesion defined as:&#xD;
      clinical absence of verruca vulgaris with redevelopment of skin lines on the dorsal surface&#xD;
      and dermatoglyphics (ridges of the skin) on the inner surface of the palms and feet, as&#xD;
      determined by a blinded clinician investigator blinded to the treatment will evaluate each&#xD;
      lesion and determine whether the lesion. A secondary outcome will include: time to complete&#xD;
      resolution of the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Objectives and Specific Aims 1.1. Primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      Cutera CoolGlide 1064nm Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of verruca vulgaris of the hands and&#xD;
      feet versus conventional therapy with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Research Design and Methods This a single site double blind (faculty observer and patient&#xD;
      blinded; operator/clinician non-blinded), randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of the Nd:YAG laser (Cutera) in the treatment of verruca vulgaris of the hands&#xD;
      and feet versus conventional therapy with liquid nitrogen in 52 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Study Procedures Informed consent A signed informed consent form will be obtained from&#xD;
      each patient prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination A brief physical examination of the skin including the affected area&#xD;
      will be performed. Photographs will be taken of affected areas, prior to and after each&#xD;
      treatment from baseline through the fifth treatment follow-up. The investigator will document&#xD;
      the number, size and location of each lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests No laboratory testing will be performed for this research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Visit (DAY 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the clinic visit and treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient will be screened for inclusion by a study team member using a screening&#xD;
           questionnaire (Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A sub-investigator will review the screening criteria to validate that the patient meets&#xD;
           eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Written informed consent will be obtained from the patient before participation in the&#xD;
           study (Appendix B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The qualifying eligible patient who has consented to participate in the study will be&#xD;
           assigned to receive either Nd:YAG laser treatment or liquid nitrogen therapy using a&#xD;
           previously established block randomization schema prepared by the research statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All lesions will be evaluated and pared with a #15 surgical blade if thickness, a&#xD;
           callous, crust or debris is noted, or if hyperkeratosis or other skin thickening is&#xD;
           evident which would impede evaluation of the wart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The attending faculty physician will confirm the diagnosis with use a dermatoscope and&#xD;
           will be blinded to the treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Photos will be taken of the lesions, after paring with a #15 blade to remove any crust&#xD;
           or thickened skin above the wart, prior to treatment, and after treatment. A consistent&#xD;
           photography procedure (Appendix C) will be used. Each wart will be numbered; size and&#xD;
           location will be documented on the Dermatology Study Wart Assessment and Treatment&#xD;
           Records (Appendix D). Photographs will be taken before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All lesions will be anesthetized with topical lidocaine (LMX 4%) applied under occlusion&#xD;
           for 15minutes prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All patients will be prepared for treatment in the same manner. They will wear the&#xD;
           protective goggles used in laser treatment and will use head phones to muffle the sound&#xD;
           of treatment. Both treatment modalities will be turned on prior to the treatment so&#xD;
           sounds may not be predictive of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. The patients that have been randomly selected to receive Nd:YAG laser treatment will be&#xD;
      fully treated with the following parameters for the laser. If the warts are greater than 3mm&#xD;
      the following settings will be used: 20 millisecond pulse width, fluence 180 J/cm2, spot size&#xD;
      5 mm. If warts are 3mm or less in diameter, the laser settings will be: 180 J/cm2, spot size&#xD;
      3mm, pulse width 15 milliseconds. No laser gel will be used during treatment. After each&#xD;
      laser pulse, the treated area can be briefly cooled with the tip of the laser. If more than&#xD;
      one pulse is needed to cover the entire area of the wart, 10% overlap will be used and area&#xD;
      outside of the wart border will not be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. The patients that have been randomly selected to receive liquid nitrogen treatment will&#xD;
      receive liquid nitrogen spray gun for 5-7 seconds creating and maintaining a 1-2 mm freeze&#xD;
      halo around lesion for the duration of the application. Use nozzle extender for warts less&#xD;
      than 3 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Patients will be instructed to avoid treating the warts at home, but they may use&#xD;
      vaseline, aquaphor, or plain petrolatum and a band aid as needed for comfort until the next&#xD;
      visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Patients will schedule a return visit in two weeks for assessment of the effects of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. Patient treatments will be documented on the appropriate Dermatology Study Wart Treatment&#xD;
      Record (Appendix D). Revision of the Dermatology Study Wart Treatment Record is attached with&#xD;
      the Request for Revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.1 Document the patient's medications on the Master Medication Record 12.2 Document the&#xD;
      patient's warts on the Master Record of Warts&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatments #2, 3, 4, 5 (DAY 14, 28, 42, 56; +/- 7 days) Patient will return at 2week&#xD;
           intervals for evaluation and documentation of lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An objective faculty observer blinded to treatment, will evaluate wart persistence or&#xD;
           clearance at treatments #2, 3, 4, and 5, after the lesion is pared. Faculty will&#xD;
           document findings on the Wart Study Attending Faculty Observer Assessment Tool Appendix&#xD;
           E).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Photos will be taken after paring lesions with a #15 blade; number, size, and location&#xD;
           of lesions will be documented, as well as occurrence of any new warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If the patient has no clinical lesions present as determined by a blinded faculty&#xD;
                clinician, the patient will move on to follow up phase, see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If there is still clinical evidence of persisting lesions the patient will be&#xD;
                retreated with the same randomized modality as in treatment #1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If new warts are identified, the investigators will document the number, size, and&#xD;
                location of the warts, and photograph the new warts before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Treatment of new warts will be with the same randomized treatment modality to avoid&#xD;
                patient un-blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All lesions will be anesthetized with topical lidocaine (LMX 4%) applied under occlusion&#xD;
           for 15 minutes prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All patients will be prepared for treatment in the same manner. They will wear the&#xD;
           protective goggles used in laser treatment and will use head phones to muffle the sound&#xD;
           of treatment. Both treatment modalities will be turned on prior to the treatment so&#xD;
           sounds may not be predictive of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Proceed with treatment of warts in the same manner as randomization. Complete steps 9-&#xD;
           11 as listed under the initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Phase: Clinical Clearance Once a lesion is clinically clear, the patient will move&#xD;
      on to the follow up phase. No lesion will be treated more than 5 times. Patients who do not&#xD;
      clear after the evaluation of the 5th treatment will be considered treatment failure and will&#xD;
      be removed from the study. Patients who fail study treatment will be offered continuing&#xD;
      treatment outside of the study through Dermatology Clinic. The patient will be responsible&#xD;
      for standard charges for any additional treatment through Dermatology Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who clear will return to the clinic for evaluation at 1 and 2 months after clinical&#xD;
      clearance to determine continued clearance or recurrence. Recurrence will be defined as a new&#xD;
      clinical evident lesion that appear in the same location(s) as the previously treated wart(s)&#xD;
      up to 2 months post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 and 2 Month Follow Up&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinician will perform an examination of the treated areas as in previous visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Photos will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Size and location of new lesions, if any, will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recurrence of previously treated lesions will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Month Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 4 months following the clearance date, a structured telephone interview will investigate&#xD;
      the status of the lesion(s). If the patient is unsure of the status of clearance, the patient&#xD;
      will be asked to return for evaluation by the sub-investigator. If the wart recurs or&#xD;
      persists, the patient will be offered additional treatment using other options and will be&#xD;
      billed for any post-study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Data management and statistical analysis Data Collection and management Data will be&#xD;
      collected on paper Case Report forms by the resident physician treating the subject. See data&#xD;
      collection tools (Appendix D) and rules in the Procedure Book. Double data entry will be&#xD;
      provided by data entry staff into two separate excel spread sheets. Data comparison will be&#xD;
      completed by the research statistician. Any discrepancies will be reviewed by the study team.&#xD;
      Issues in need of adjudication will be decided by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination: Sample size was calculated based on a formula for effective sample&#xD;
      size in a randomized clustered design with binary outcomes. On average, patients will present&#xD;
      with approximately three lesions (usually between 1 and 5) requiring treatment. An estimate&#xD;
      of a 50% cure rate, using cryotherapy for plantar warts, was drawn from a Cochrane review&#xD;
      published in 2006 [10, 11]. We will consider a clinically significant improvement, if at&#xD;
      least 80% of the warts treated by Nd:Yag laser are completely resolved at the 6 month visit.&#xD;
      We will assume a moderate intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.3. Given the cluster&#xD;
      design, enrolling 52 patients with, on average, 3 warts each, randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatments, will be needed to provide 84% power to show a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference in cure rate. Significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis All analyses will be done using SAS® 9.2. Demographic and&#xD;
      clinical variables will be summarized using means, medians and percentages, as appropriate.&#xD;
      To determine whether the primary outcome, complete resolution of each lesion at 2 and 4&#xD;
      months follow-up, is different between treatment groups, we will use a generalized linear&#xD;
      mixed model with a binomial distribution, and with initial lesion size and duration, as&#xD;
      covariates in the model. The correlation of outcomes within patient will be modeled using a&#xD;
      random effect. The secondary outcome, time to complete resolution will be analyzed using a&#xD;
      using a multilevel survival model with patient as a random effect and initial lesion size and&#xD;
      duration as covariates in the model. To see whether the results are sensitive to missing&#xD;
      data, both models will be analyzed with and without the self-reported 4-month outcomes.&#xD;
