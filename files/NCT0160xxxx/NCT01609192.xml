      The project's background: Sickle cell disease is, at present in France, the most frequent&#xD;
      genetic illness. Recent progress in its treatment, in particular the use of hydroxyurea, has&#xD;
      considerably modified the prognosis of this disease. Many more patients now reach&#xD;
      reproductive age and do consider fathering. Exceptional studies have reported the potential&#xD;
      impact of this medical treatment on the sperm parameters and fertility of male patients. In a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis, the investigators found that the observed alterations of semen&#xD;
      parameters due to sickle cell disease seem to be exacerbated by hydroxyurea treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis: A large prospective study is essential to assess the potential adverse&#xD;
      impact of the medical treatment of sickle cell disease on spermatogenesis and consider the&#xD;
      advisability of proposing sperm cryopreservation before this treatment is started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary purpose of the protocol: evaluate the impact of a treatment by hydroxyurea (20-30&#xD;
      mg/kg/day), 6 months after its beginning, in 34 men with sickle cell disease (18-60 years&#xD;
      old). The main trial criterion will be the average difference of the concentration of&#xD;
      spermatozoa s (millions/ml) in the ejaculate, before and after 6 months of medical treatment.&#xD;

      Purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell disease is, at present in France, the most frequent genetic illness. Recent&#xD;
      progress in its treatment, in particular the use of hydroxyurea, has considerably modified&#xD;
      the prognosis of this disease. Many more patients now reach reproductive age and do consider&#xD;
      fathering. Exceptional studies have reported the potential impact of this medical treatment&#xD;
      on the sperm parameters and fertility of male patients. In a retrospective analysis, the&#xD;
      investigators found that the observed alterations of semen parameters due to sickle cell&#xD;
      disease seem to be exacerbated by hydroxyurea treatment. Moreover, after hydroxyurea&#xD;
      cessation, while global results in 30 patients were not statistically different before and&#xD;
      after hydroxyurea treatment, in four individuals follow-up sperm parameters did not seem to&#xD;
      recover quickly and the total number of spermatozoa per ejaculate fell below the normal range&#xD;
      in about half the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a large prospective study is essential to assess the potential adverse impact of&#xD;
      the medical treatment of sickle cell disease on spermatogenesis and consider the advisability&#xD;
      of proposing sperm cryopreservation before this treatment is started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the impact of a treatment by hydroxyurea (20-30 mg/kg/day), 6 months after its&#xD;
      beginning, in 34 men with sickle cell disease (18-60 years old). The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      the average difference of the concentration of spermatozoa s (millions/ml) in the ejaculate,&#xD;
      before and after 6 months of medical treatment. Six months represent 2 complete cycles of&#xD;
      spermatogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will be the other sperm parameters: vitality, mobility, motility,&#xD;
      morphology of spermatozoa and the assessment of sperm nuclear DNA fragmentation by TUNEL&#xD;
      assay (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, multicenter, cohort study should allow evaluating the impact of a treatment&#xD;
      by hydroxyurea on spermatogenesis in men with sickle cell anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the hypothesis of a five time reduction in spermatozoa concentration (38 millions ± 43&#xD;
      before treatment), at least 34 analyzable patients are required (aged 18 to 60 years old) who&#xD;
      have never received any compound known to be toxic for spermatogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drepanocytic men who are eligible for a first treatment by hydroxyurea will be sent to the&#xD;
      CECOS (center for the study and cryopreservation of oocytes and spermatozoa) at Tenon, Cochin&#xD;
      or Jean Verdier hospitals. Their medical history will be recorded and sperm parameters will&#xD;
      be analyzed according to WHO criteria. Part of the ejaculate will be fixed and stored (-&#xD;
      20°C) for further DNA fragmentation assay. The rest of the semen could be cryopreserved,&#xD;
      according to the patients' will, in case of a potential deleterious effect of the medical&#xD;
      treatment on male fertility. Six months after the beginning of the treatment by hydroxyurea,&#xD;
      another sperm recovery will be required for the same analysis and the already described&#xD;
      parameters will be evaluated and compared to initial results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study should bring valuable data on the effects of hydroxyurea on human spermatogenesis.&#xD;
      If any significant impairment is observed, it would be recommended to perform sperm&#xD;
      cryopreservation before the treatment's start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study could also help to distinguish between the detrimental effects due to the acute&#xD;
      adverse events of sickle cell disease itself and those linked to the administration of&#xD;
      hydroxyurea.&#xD;
