      The purpose of this study is to determine determine the safety of intraspinal delivery of&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the cerebral spinal fluid of patients with Amyotrophic&#xD;
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using a dose-escalation study.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of intrathecal delivery of&#xD;
      autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with&#xD;
      ALS using a dose-escalation study. The trial will include 25 adult, non-ventilator-dependent&#xD;
      patients with clinically definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cells will be isolated&#xD;
      from adipose tissue, expanded ex vivo and then, after ~8 weeks, intrathecal (IT) autologous&#xD;
      delivery of MSCs will be performed. There will be 5 treatment groups of up to 5 patients&#xD;
      each. Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive a single dose of cells. Groups 3 and 5 will receive 2&#xD;
      doses of cells separated by 1 month. Groups will be completed sequentially so that patients&#xD;
      will not be enrolled into the next treatment group until at least 3 patients in the preceding&#xD;
      group have completed the treatment and 1 month of additional observation without significant&#xD;
      toxicity. All patients will be followed on a regular basis until death or for a minimum of 2&#xD;
      years after completion of the final infusion. Initial clinical follow-up will be weekly with&#xD;
      scheduled blood, CSF and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations. After 1 month,&#xD;
      patients will have clinical evaluations at 3 month intervals, or earlier if indicated by&#xD;
      clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addendum: Five subjects from the Group 5 dosing level will received additional injections of&#xD;
      MSCs in an extension of the original study, if tolerated.&#xD;

    <description>There will be five treatment groups of up to five patients each. Groups 1, 2 and 4 will receive a single dose of cells. Groups 3 and 5 will receive 2 doses of cells separated by one month. Intrathecal injections into new subjects will be timed so that there is a minimum of one week between subject injections. The cell dose per group is as follows:&#xD;
Group 1: single intrathecal dose of 1 x 107 cells&#xD;
Group 2: single intrathecal dose of 5 x 107 cells&#xD;
Group 3: one intrathecal dose of 5 x 107 cells followed one month later by a second intrathecal dose of 5 x 107 cells&#xD;
Group 4: single intrathecal dose of 1 x 108 cells&#xD;
Group 5: one intrathecal dose of 1 x 108 cells followed one month later by a second intrathecal dose of 1 x 108 cells</description>
