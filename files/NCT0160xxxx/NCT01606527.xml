  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial evaluating ibuprofen and placebo for the prevention of neurological forms of altitude&#xD;
      illness [including high altitude headache (HAH), acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude&#xD;
      cerebral edema (HACE), and an emerging concept of High Altitude Anxiety]. The study will take&#xD;
      place in the spring and summer of 2012 at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center&#xD;
      in the Eastern Sierras near Bridgeport, California. US Marines from near sea level will&#xD;
      participate in battalion-level training exercises at between 8,500-11,500 Feet, where some&#xD;
      altitude illness is expected. Concurrent measures used to determine objective markers of&#xD;
      altitude illness, such that validated clinical scales, rapid cognitive screening tests, will&#xD;
      inform us of symptoms of altitude illness.&#xD;

        that are likely to antagonize adequate respiration, blood oxygenation, and/or circulation.&#xD;
