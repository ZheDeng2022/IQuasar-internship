      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of Macular Degeneration, i.e., at least three, hard or soft drusen must be&#xD;
             present there must be RPE changes (migration, clumping or atrophy) within the central&#xD;
             6mm of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. As a prerequisite for entry into the study, all patients will have their diagnosis of&#xD;
             dry AMD confirmed by an ophthalmologist via a retinal exam and Fluorescein Angiography&#xD;
             will also determine whether or not the subject is a candidate for laser surgery. Only&#xD;
             subjects who have AMD will be admitted to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Both sexes are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The best-corrected visual acuity can be no better than 20/40 and no worse than 20/100&#xD;
             in the treated eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age greater than 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must be highly motivated, alert, oriented, mentally competent and able to&#xD;
             understand and comply with the requirements of the study, abide by the restrictions,&#xD;
             return for all required visits, and provide voluntary informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Both eyes of the subject must show no evidence of wet AMD. If one eye is wet and the&#xD;
             fellow eye is dry, the subject will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with seizure disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with additional eye-related diseases that have associated ongoing retinal&#xD;
             bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with any implanted electrical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have smoked, on average, more than half a pack of cigarettes per day&#xD;
             during the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with known allergy to contrast dye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who are in poor general health, have unstable diseases, are terminally ill,&#xD;
             have a life expectancy of less than 12 months, are non-ambulatory or bedridden, live&#xD;
             in a geographical location which would likely prevent regular attendance at study&#xD;
             visits or are considered not suitable for participation by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects exposed to an investigational device or drug within the past 30 days or&#xD;
             involved concurrently in other treatment clinical trials. Note: Subjects participating&#xD;
             in studies investigating the natural progression of AMD may not participate in this&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects unwilling to adhere to visit or examination schedules as described in the&#xD;
             study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with a known history of alcoholism, drug abuse, psychosis, clinical evidence&#xD;
             of depression, poor motivation, emotional or intellectual problems, or any other&#xD;
             conditions which would likely limit validity of consent or appropriate responses to&#xD;
             participate in the study or who are deemed unsuitable psychologically or&#xD;
             physiologically for study participation by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any subject experiencing an acute stressor that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             might affect the course or treatment of AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Anyone with diagnosis of malignant or poorly controlled glaucoma in the eye(s) that&#xD;
             would be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Anyone with diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Anyone with a progressive corneal dystrophy in the eye(s) that would be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Anyone with any noted chorio retinal disease (other than AMD) in the eye(s) that would&#xD;
             be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Anyone with a progressive nuclear cataract in the eye(s) that would be treated. Stable&#xD;
             cortical cataract patients may be included. Any patient with an immature cataract, one&#xD;
             in which scattered opacities are separated by clear zones, may be included in the&#xD;
             study. All patients with mature, hypermature or morgagnian cataracts in the eye(s)&#xD;
             that would be treated will be excluded. Patients with a grade 3 or grade 4 cataract in&#xD;
             the eye(s) that would be treated will be excluded. Grade 1 and Grade 2 cataract&#xD;
             patients may be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects participating in an AMD natural history study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subjects with one eye diagnosed with wet AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subjects with any previous retinal bleeding, injury, or retinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subjects that have previously been diagnosed with amblyopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subjects currently taking blood-thinning medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subjects cannot have previously been involved in a TESMAC™ study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subjects that take two or more of the following antioxidants daily at the following&#xD;
             doses: 500 milligrams of vitamin C; 400 international units of vitamin E; 15&#xD;
             milligrams of beta-carotene; 80 milligrams of zinc as zinc oxide; and two milligrams&#xD;
             of copper as cupric oxide and have done this for more than 2 years. These subjects may&#xD;
             be included, but their study results will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
