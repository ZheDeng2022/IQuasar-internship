      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videoconference (VC) is a common clinical tool and has huge potential to alter medical&#xD;
      practice and to offer patients the best expertise in treatment and follow-up in spite of long&#xD;
      distances, especially in rural areas. Studies upon selected patient groups have shown that VC&#xD;
      is safe and cost-effective. However, RCT of VC patients with stoma problems have never been&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stoma problems are resource demanding patients. The University Hospital North&#xD;
      Norway (UNN) has several hundred consultations for this patient group each year, serving the&#xD;
      population in North Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this randomised controlled trial (RCT), patients are either randomised to a VC&#xD;
      consultation or a regular consultation at the outpatient clinic. All patients with a stoma&#xD;
      that needs special attention are eligible for inclusion. Patients randomised to the VC group,&#xD;
      are set-up to a meeting at the nearest VC studio located to their home community. There will&#xD;
      be educated VC- stoma nurses that will participate in the clinical examination at the&#xD;
      hospital outpatient clinic and at the rural VC studio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary endpoints are patient satisfaction and quality of life. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are number of consultations and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations showed that 170 patients had to be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that postoperative follow-up of stoma patients by VC will not&#xD;
      have any impact on patients' quality of life compared to Hospital outpatient follow-up.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will&#xD;
      improve.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been substantial development in the uses of VC among medical personnel [1].&#xD;
      Therefore, new applications of VC are emerging, such as surgical telementoring, trauma and&#xD;
      emergency medicine, postoperative follow-up of patients, education of medical personnel, and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team meetings [2]. VC has a great and unused potential, this is recently&#xD;
      described in an &quot;invited commentary&quot; in World Journal of Surgery [3]. Furthermore, during&#xD;
      recent years, the cost of VC equipment has become less expensive, and advanced technical&#xD;
      skills are not required to use the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stoma problems are a large and resource demanding group. Each year there are&#xD;
      performed several hundred consultations at the surgical outpatient clinic at University&#xD;
      Hospital of North-Norway for this patient group. These patients are surgically treated at the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, urological and gynaecological department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visual component is critical to give patients with stoma problems the best care, VC will&#xD;
      therefore be well suited for this patient group [4, 5]. Furthermore, the infrastructure for&#xD;
      VC in northern Norway is well developed for VC. In the county of Finnmark, Troms and Nordland&#xD;
      there are a VC network, all linked together through the Norwegian Health Network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to obtain insight into quality of life (QoL) among patients&#xD;
      followed up in a hospital outpatient setting or by VC, and into the incremental&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness ratio from the point of view of health care and of society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design Study design This study is a randomized controlled trial where patients&#xD;
      either will be randomized to follow up at the surgical outpatient clinic (control group) or&#xD;
      by VC (intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Patients (inclusion and exclusion criteria's)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical doctors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stoma nurses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Patients are randomized to follow-up either by VC (intervention) or at the&#xD;
      surgical outpatient clinic. All patients will receive their first postoperative check-up at&#xD;
      the hospital. A clinical examination will then be performed and information about the RCT&#xD;
      given. If the patient gives informed consent, randomization is performed. Patients randomized&#xD;
      to VC follow-up are referred to their GP and the local VC stoma nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm Patients in the control group consist of patients randomized to regular follow-up&#xD;
      at the hospital's surgical outpatient clinic. This follow-up is performed by consultants in&#xD;
      digestive surgery, or a specially educated stoma nurse. QOL questionnaires The EQ-5D&#xD;
      questionnaires for the two-year follow-up period (at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 month&#xD;
      follow-up) are given to the patient at baseline examination. Economic evaluation&#xD;
      questionnaire: A questionnaire has been developed to enable calculation of costs related to&#xD;
      patient examinations. This questionnaire is incorporated in the QOL questionnaire, and&#xD;
      patients are requested to fill out the questionnaire at 1, 3 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24&#xD;
      months after inclusion. The cost elements will include patient- and family-related costs due&#xD;
      to outpatient visits, VC visits, laboratory tests, radiographs/ultrasound, examinations due&#xD;
      to stoma complications, treatment of stoma complications, traveling, production losses,&#xD;
      co-payments and other patient expenses. Control arm Patients in the control group consist of&#xD;
      patients randomized to regular follow-up at the hospital's surgical outpatient clinic.&#xD;
      Consultants in digestive surgery or stoma nurses perform this follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective We aim to compare quality of life and costs of follow-up among&#xD;
      patients followed up by VC or at the surgical outpatient clinic. We hypothesize that patients&#xD;
      followed up by VC will experience similar or higher scores on quality of life measures and&#xD;
      lower costs during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective We want to establish a nurse led VC stoma school, prior to the clinical&#xD;
      trial. Nurses, specially educated to treat patient with stoma problems, will write the&#xD;
      curriculum. Five to ten nurses from logistic important VC communities all over North Norway&#xD;
      will be invited to a 10 to 20 hour course in stoma treatment and technical aspects around VC.&#xD;
      This will be done prior to the start of the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary outcome (measured at 1, 3, 6,9,12,15,18,21 and 24 months) Quality of&#xD;
      life EQ-5D is a standardized generic instrument for use as a measure of health outcome.&#xD;
      Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple&#xD;
      descriptive profile and a single index value for health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EQ-5D measures five dimensions of health-related quality of life (HRQOL): mobility,&#xD;
      self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. EQ Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale: The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertically graduated&#xD;
      (0-100) visual analogue scale [6]. Economic analysis A cost-effectiveness analysis will be&#xD;
      performed alongside the randomized controlled trial. A Markov model will be employed. If the&#xD;
      trial reveals no difference in health outcomes or quality of life of the patients, a&#xD;
      cost-minimization analysis will be carried out. If we reveal a difference in quality of life&#xD;
      between the two groups, we will implement a cost-utility analysis. The economic evaluation&#xD;
      will have a health care and societal perspective. Resources used in both treatment arms will&#xD;
      be registered prospectively based on reports by the patients and on the hospital patient&#xD;
      records. Costs related to consultations at the primary and secondary care level, both at&#xD;
      baseline and up to 24 months after randomization, including direct medical costs, indirect&#xD;
      costs (production losses), travel costs and patient-/family-related costs will be registered.&#xD;
      Quality of life measurements will be collected both at baseline and at several time points&#xD;
      during the intervention. A 3% discount rate will be used to discount future costs and&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost elements will include costs related to outpatient visits, GP visits, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, radiographs and ultrasound, examinations due to suspected stoma complications,&#xD;
      treatment of stoma complications, traveling/transportation, and production losses,&#xD;
      co-payments and other patient/family expenses. The net costs and outcomes of the two&#xD;
      treatment options will be compared and presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size calculations are according to Campbell's [7] and EQ-5D guidelines&#xD;
      [8]. Alpha and beta were set at 0.05 and 0.2 respectively and tests were two-sided. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients followed up by VC will have a minor to moderate increase in the QoL&#xD;
      scores. Allowing for a dropout rate of 20%, detecting this difference with confidence we&#xD;
      required a total sample size of 170 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be done at the 1-month check-up (baseline) after the&#xD;
      patients have given informed consent. The randomization service is web-based and managed by&#xD;
      the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to VC follow-up may be referred back to surgical clinics at any point in&#xD;
      the study. Data gathering Data are being collected for patients in the intervention and the&#xD;
      control group in identical ways. QoL and &quot;cost questionnaires&quot; are sent after each follow-up&#xD;
      appointment by the patients to the trial center up to 24 months postoperatively. These&#xD;
      questionnaires are optically readable, data being consecutively collected in a trial&#xD;
      database. SCEs are registered via hospital chart review at 24 months postoperatively. The&#xD;
      Norwegian Data Inspectorate has approved the study. All data will be handled with strict&#xD;
      confidentiality, and study reports or presentations will maintain the anonymity of patients,&#xD;
      surgeons, GPs and hospitals. Data collection will be complete by the end of 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis We will use the intention-to-treat principle when analyzing data. Treatment arms&#xD;
      will be compared with respect to potential covariates using continuous and categorical&#xD;
      univariable analyses. These will include variables relating to patients (age, sex,&#xD;
      comorbidities, cost), treatment (surgical resection, surgical complications), hospital&#xD;
      surgical outpatient clinic (cost, patient satisfaction, QoL), VC consultation (cost, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, QoL). The cost elements will include costs related to outpatient visits, VC&#xD;
      visits, laboratory tests, radiographs/ultrasound, and examinations due to suspected&#xD;
      complications, treatment of complications, traveling/transportation, production losses,&#xD;
      co-payments and other patient expenses. The net costs and outcomes of the two&#xD;
      treatment/follow-up options will be compared and presented as cost-effectiveness ratios. If&#xD;
      the trial reveals no difference in health outcomes or quality of life for the patients, a&#xD;
      cost-minimization analysis will be carried out. If we find a difference in quality of life or&#xD;
      overall survival rates between the two groups, we will use a cost utility approach. The&#xD;
      economic evaluation will have a societal and health care perspective. The method of analysis,&#xD;
      including adjusting for covariates will comply with the CONSORT statement [9]. The results&#xD;
      will be expressed as odds ratios for binary outcomes, hazard ratios for time- to-event&#xD;
      outcomes or mean differences for continuous outcomes with corresponding standard errors, 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals, and associated p-values. P-values will be reported to three decimal&#xD;
      places with p-values less than 0.001 reported as p &lt; 0.001. For all tests we will use alpha =&#xD;
      0.05 level of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics, North Norway approved this&#xD;
      protocol. Patients must provide written consent before entering the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion VC is used as an instrument for follow-up of patients in the postoperative period&#xD;
      and for outpatient consultation. From our hospital, we have extensive experience in the use&#xD;
      of VC in the follow-up of haemodialysis patients [10] and in dermatology [11, 12]. In&#xD;
      addition, a new project has started in the orthopaedic department, where a VC line has been&#xD;
      established between the University Hospital and the district medical centre Nordreisa, 155&#xD;
      miles away. In this project, both outpatient patients and postoperative patients are examined&#xD;
      by a district orthopaedic nurse under the supervision of an orthopaedic consultant located at&#xD;
      the University Hospital. This project has now been organized as a randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial, where the primary endpoints are cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several articles have reported the use of VC in the follow-up of surgical patients. Wallace&#xD;
      et al. aimed to compare joint VC between general practitioners, specialists (surgeons), and&#xD;
      patients with standard outpatient referral. This randomised controlled trial showed that&#xD;
      allocation of patients to virtual outreach consultations was variably associated with&#xD;
      increased offers of follow-up appointments according to site and specialty, but led to&#xD;
      significant increases in patients' satisfaction and substantial reductions in tests and&#xD;
      investigations. Efficient operation of such services will require appropriate selection of&#xD;
      patients, significant service reorganization, and provision of logistical support [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study from Finland investigated the use of VC in the examination of orthopaedic&#xD;
      outpatients. VC was found to be feasible and the equipment functioned well technically. The&#xD;
      conclusion was that VC between primary and secondary care could be used in the examination of&#xD;
      orthopaedic patients whenever no demanding imaging technology was needed [14] Whether VC is&#xD;
      cost-effective in the follow-up of surgical patients is debated. The clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      and costs of VC in orthopaedics between primary and secondary care were examined in an&#xD;
      eight-month prospective comparative study. The general surgery outpatient clinics of two&#xD;
      Finnish district hospitals were compared. The direct costs of an outpatient visit were 45%&#xD;
      greater per patient than for a VC. A cost-minimization analysis of the alternative&#xD;
      interventions showed a net benefit of EU 2,500 in favour of VC [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another Finnish study had similar results. Wider utilization of the VC equipment for other&#xD;
      purposes, or the use of less expensive VC equipment, would make services cost saving even at&#xD;
      relatively short distances [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      VC can be used in almost any medical specialty, although the specialties best suited are&#xD;
      those with a high visual component. Wound healing and wound management are thus prime&#xD;
      candidates for VC follow-up. Development of a suitable telemedical system in this field could&#xD;
      have a significant effect on wound care in the community, tertiary referral patterns, and&#xD;
      hospital admission rates [5, 17].&#xD;
