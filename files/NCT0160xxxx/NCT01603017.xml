    <textblock>
      Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Therapy (NMRT) is gaining as a novel mode of therapy in&#xD;
      osteoarthrosis. A prospective double blind randomised study of 100 patients was conducted to&#xD;
      investigate efficacy of NMRT in the treatment of mild to moderate osteoarthrosis (OA) of the&#xD;
      knee joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis was that there is no benefit of NMRT over placebo in mild to moderate&#xD;
      oteoarthosis of the knee.&#xD;

      This study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee. Patients were recruited from&#xD;
      referrals made by General Practitioners to a single Orthopaedic Outpatient Department between&#xD;
      October 2007 and February 2008. The study was a prospective placebo controlled, double blind&#xD;
      randomised mono centric study with a follow up period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential trial participants demonstrated symptomatic mild to moderate OA of the knee&#xD;
      joint diagnosed by an experienced consultant orthopaedic surgeon. Radiographic evidence was&#xD;
      gathered by means of standard clinical standing antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of&#xD;
      the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment included :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. active Range of movement&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. plain radiographs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. WOMAC osteoarthritis index&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Oxford Knee Score (OKS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Severity of pain VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Strength and frequency of any painkillers taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Phyasiotherapy Study design was directed at use of NMRT in a clinical setting. It was&#xD;
           therefore considered valid to not restrict the use of the pain killers and&#xD;
           physiotherapy. Positional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (pMRI) scan of the knee joint was&#xD;
           undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation was carried out by means of visually identical computer chip cards numbered&#xD;
      from 1 to 100 which had been independently programmed by the manufacturer. Thus, half of the&#xD;
      computer chip cards (n=50) were programmed to activate the magnetic fields (= treatment&#xD;
      group) and remaining half (n=50) were programmed not to activate magnetic fields (=placebo&#xD;
      group) of the device. The research team and patients were blinded to the programmed activity&#xD;
      of the cards. The magnetic resonance indicator LED lamp on the device was disabled by the&#xD;
      manufacturer to ensure that the operator and patients were blinded to the therapy status.&#xD;
      Every patient entering the study was asked to choose a numbered card from those available,&#xD;
      and this card was then used to operate the device for that specific patient for all five&#xD;
      sessions of NMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used the manufacturer's clinical recommendation for therapy. Patients were&#xD;
      subjected to one-hour sessions of NMRT (or placebo) on five consecutive days, giving a total&#xD;
      of five hours of NMRT (or placebo). This was given on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is made up of twelve independently controlled coil systems that are spaced&#xD;
      orthogonally. These are designed to produce a 3-dimensional therapy field. Along with a&#xD;
      separately generated permanent magnetic field, the 3-dimensional therapy field forms a&#xD;
      nuclear resonance field in the center of the coil system. The desired dose of NMRT is&#xD;
      achieved with the help of MBSTÂ® - Treatment software, which is controlled by a computer chip&#xD;
      card. The device can generate a magnetic field of 3.0 mT (typical) and maximum of 10 mT&#xD;
      extending up to 30 cm around the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were called for review at 1 week (1w), 1 month (1m), 3 months (3m) and 6 months (6m)&#xD;
      when clinical examination, WOMAC osteoarthritis index and OKS were repeated. They were also&#xD;
      asked to record VAS and details of painkillers taken during the week before each review. Due&#xD;
      to the lack of recognised analgesia equivalencies, the quantity of pain killers taken were&#xD;
      graded with reference to the amount and frequency taken at baseline - less than baseline was&#xD;
      graded as 1, same as baseline was graded as 2 and more than baseline was graded as 3.&#xD;
