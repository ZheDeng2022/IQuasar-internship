  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of tobacco is very high among Alaska Native women. The investigators are conducting a&#xD;
      three phase study. The first phase will examine biomarkers of tobacco exposure in pregnant&#xD;
      women and their newborns. The second phase is a qualitative study to translate the biomarker&#xD;
      findings into intervention messages. The third phase is a pilot of the biomarker feedback&#xD;
      intervention compared with a control condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Developing effective tobacco cessation interventions during pregnancy for American Indian and&#xD;
      Alaska Native people is a national priority and will contribute to the U.S. public health&#xD;
      objective of reducing tobacco-related cancer health disparities. The proposed project builds&#xD;
      on our successful partnership with the Alaska Native community and previous work with Alaska&#xD;
      Native pregnant women. We propose to develop and test a novel biomarker feedback intervention&#xD;
      relating cotinine levels in the urine of pregnant women with the woman and infant's likely&#xD;
      exposure to the tobacco specific nitrosamine and carcinogen&#xD;
      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK). This 5-year project will be conducted&#xD;
      in three phases. In Phase 1 we will utilize a non-randomized, clinical observational trial to&#xD;
      examine biomarkers of nicotine and carcinogen exposure (urine cotinine and total NNAL [a&#xD;
      metabolite of NNK], respectively) among 150 maternal-infant pairs with assessments conducted&#xD;
      during pregnancy and at delivery. In Phase 2, we will obtain qualitative feedback on the&#xD;
      findings from Phase 1 through individual interviews conducted with 32 women who use tobacco&#xD;
      to develop the biomarker feedback intervention messages. Phase 3 will consist of a formative&#xD;
      evaluation of the biomarker feedback intervention with 80 pregnant women using a two-group&#xD;
      randomized design to assess the intervention's feasibility and acceptability, and the&#xD;
      biochemically confirmed abstinence rate at the end of pregnancy. All phases of the project&#xD;
      will be guided by a Community Advisory Committee. Each phase is an important step to advance&#xD;
      our understanding of the potential for biomarker feedback as a strategy to help Alaska Native&#xD;
      pregnant women quit tobacco use. The potential reach of the intervention is significant from&#xD;
      a public health perspective as over 600 tobacco users deliver each year at the Alaska Native&#xD;
      Medical Center in Anchorage where the proposed project will take place. Developing effective&#xD;
      interventions for tobacco cessation during pregnancy is important to reduce adverse health&#xD;
      consequences for the mother and neonate and future risk of tobacco-caused cancers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible the woman must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. be Alaska Native,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. be aged 18 years or older,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. provide written informed consent,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. be currently pregnant (1st, 2nd or 3rd trimester), and&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. plan to deliver at the ANMC. An additional inclusion criterion for current tobacco&#xD;
             users is any use in the past 7 days. Our preliminary studies indicate that women may&#xD;
             use more than one form of tobacco. To enhance feasibility of recruitment and&#xD;
             generalizability, women will not be excluded if they use more than one form of&#xD;
             tobacco. Instead, group composition will be based on the primary type of tobacco used.&#xD;
             An additional inclusion criterion for non-tobacco users is no use of any form of&#xD;
             tobacco in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women will be excluded if they have used nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or have&#xD;
             participated in a behavioral or pharmacological tobacco cessation program within the&#xD;
             past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Alcohol and other drug use will not be an exclusionary criterion because the&#xD;
             biomarkers are specific to tobacco exposure.&#xD;
