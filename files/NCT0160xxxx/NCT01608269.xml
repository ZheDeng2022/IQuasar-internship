      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and antivira activity of&#xD;
      Epzicom in virologically controlled HIV subjects.&#xD;

      Utilizing the ABC/3TC FDC tablets as the NRTI backbone, this open label study will compare&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of ABC/3TC when used as replacement for subjects with suboptimal CD4-&#xD;
      cells count who are receiving TDF/FTC. TYhis study will be conducted for 48 weeks in HIV&#xD;
      infected, HLA*B5701 begative subjects who were initially suppressed on a HAART regiment that&#xD;
      includes TDF/FTC QD.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treatment experienced subjects on virologically stable HAART regimen containing&#xD;
             tenofovir-emtricitabine or tenofovir-lamivudine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with CD4 cells that do not increase by 15% and/or that decrease by 15% over&#xD;
             previous 12 months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -≥ 18 years of age&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient does not currently have or has not been treated for an active opportunistic&#xD;
             infection (OI) consistent with CDC definition (Appendix C) within 30 days of screening&#xD;

             acute illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,&#xD;
             including any female who is post-menopausal) or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child-bearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screen, and agrees to&#xD;
             one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the study&#xD;
             drug, throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after completion or premature&#xD;
             discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of the investigational drug.&#xD;
             Should a patient decide to become sexually active during the course of the study, she&#xD;
             must be counseled and be willing to use one of the birth control methods listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Double barrier method (male condom/spermicide, male condom/diaphragm,&#xD;
             diaphragm/spermicide)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the expected failure&#xD;
             rate is &lt;1% per year (not all IUDs meet this criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sterilization (female patient or male partner of female patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of active substance abuse, excluding cannabis, or psychiatric illness that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, would preclude compliance with protocol, dosing&#xD;
