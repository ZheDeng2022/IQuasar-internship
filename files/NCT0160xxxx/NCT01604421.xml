  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis is that plastic bags used in combination with WHO thermoregulation&#xD;
      care will reduce the incidence of hypothermia in preterm/low birth weight and full term&#xD;
      infants when compared to routine WHO thermoregulation care alone. Part II is for preterm/low&#xD;
      birth weight infant with or without plastic head cover used from 1 hour after birth until&#xD;
      discharge or 24 hours after birth to assist with temperature regulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to limited resources, hospitals in the developing world struggle to provide sufficient&#xD;
      incubators and to maintain climate-controlled nurseries. Therefore, premature low birth&#xD;
      weight infants continue to be at an increased risk of hypothermia throughout their&#xD;
      hospitalizations. This study will compare the incidence of hypothermia in preterm/low birth&#xD;
      weight infants randomized to receive WHO thermoregulation care (control groups) or WHO&#xD;
      thermoregulation care and a plastic bag covering their torsos and lower extremities&#xD;
      (intervention group) starting at one hour after birth and continued to discharge or 24 hours&#xD;
      after birth, whichever occurs first. The axillary temperature of each infant will be taken&#xD;
      one hour after birth, every subsequent 3-4 hours, and at discharge or 24 hours after birth&#xD;
      when infants will be removed from the plastic bags. Seizures, hyperthermia, room temperature,&#xD;
      and death will be recorded throughout the hospitalization for all infants. With an estimated&#xD;
      baseline hypothermia rate of 50% and a hypothesized 20% absolute risk reduction (40% relative&#xD;
      risk reduction), a sample size of 182 will be used to have a power of 80% and a confidence&#xD;
      interval of 95%.&#xD;

    <description>One hour after birth, the infant will be placed into a plastic bag up to his/her axillae, and the bag will be folded and taped to itself to prevent it from covering the infant's nose or mouth.
