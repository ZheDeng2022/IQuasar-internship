  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RealU addresses smoking in a young adult population of occasional and daily smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine the efficacy of providing individually tailored smoking cessation&#xD;
      messages as part of a general interest website for young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To determine the efficacy of providing individually tailored smoking cessation&#xD;
      messages plus peer email, phone and online support as part of a general interest website for&#xD;
      young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were recruited via direct emails sent to undergraduate and graduate students at&#xD;
      the University of MI as well as direct emails sent to participants from Survey Sampling&#xD;
      International and National Data Group. Individuals were invited to complete an online survey&#xD;
      about health and hope in young adults. Participants eligible for the full intervention were&#xD;
      invited to join the RealU Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were asked to complete an online enrollment survey and consent form. Eligible,&#xD;
      enrolled participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an untailored general interest/lifestyle website&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an individually tailored web intervention about health and lifestyle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an individually tailored web intervention about health and lifestyle with coaching from&#xD;
           peers, including video, phone, and email&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments were conducted at 7 weeks and 12 weeks post-enrollment. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure is self-reported 30-day abstinence at 12 weeks.&#xD;
