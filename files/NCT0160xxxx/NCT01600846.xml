  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further integrate pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing into clinical&#xD;
      practice by educating physicians about pharmacogenetics and offering testing to their&#xD;
      patients. Pharmacogenetic testing may help physicians choose the best drug and dosage for&#xD;
      their patients which can reduce side effects, increase effectiveness, and improve patient&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two clinics will be involved. One clinic will have a pharmacist on-site as a resource to&#xD;
      physicians and to advise what patients may benefit from PGx testing; the other clinic will&#xD;
      have a pharmacist on call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and physician perspectives about PGx testing and their utilization will be examined&#xD;
      via surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that with education about PGx testing, more physicians will&#xD;
      utilize testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess two delivery models of PGx testing (physician-initiated and&#xD;
      pharmacist-initiated) for commonly prescribed drugs in primary care practices and evaluate&#xD;
      the delivery of testing from three perspectives: physician, patient, and practice setting. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that greater utilization will be influenced by increased physician knowledge and&#xD;
      awareness of drugs with PGx testing, comfort in discussing PGx testing with patients and&#xD;
      applying results to therapeutic decision-making and positive attitudes towards the testing&#xD;
      process. We hypothesize that the pharmacist-initiated approach will result in the most&#xD;
      effective use and rapid uptake of PGx testing given the hands-on educational approach with&#xD;
      the pharmacist providing expert guidance. We also hypothesize that having a pharmacist with&#xD;
      PGx testing expertise as part of the medical team will result in greater physician comfort&#xD;
      with test ordering and application of results as compared with the physician-initiated model.&#xD;
      In addition, an economic analysis will be conducted to evaluate and compare the costs of each&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also examine patient perspectives about PGx testing and their utilization of test&#xD;
      results. We hypothesize that patients who have experienced adverse responses or a poor drug&#xD;
      outcome (no response) in the past, are taking chronic medications, and those who are older&#xD;
      will be more likely to consent to PGx testing. We hypothesize that patients' increased&#xD;
      awareness about their genetic predisposition to adverse responses will result in greater&#xD;
      discussion with prescribing physicians and pharmacists about the PGx results when new&#xD;
      treatments are prescribed, with greater attention to adverse effects of new drugs and&#xD;
      potentially greater medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will implement and evaluate two delivery models of PGx testing into primary care&#xD;
      practices: physician-initiated testing and pharmacist-initiated testing. Each practice will&#xD;
      be provided an educational intervention and will be surveyed prior to the seminar and&#xD;
      following the intervention period to assess primary care practitioner (PCP) knowledge and&#xD;
      attitudes about PGx testing. These surveys will take about 10-15 minutes to complete and will&#xD;
      be available through an online system like SurveyMonkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pharmacist-initiated group, a pharmacist based within the practice will identify&#xD;
      prescribed drugs with available PGx testing through chart review and provide specific&#xD;
      information and recommendations about PGx testing to the ordering physician. In the&#xD;
      physician-initiated group, physicians will order testing as they deem necessary, but will&#xD;
      also have on-call pharmacist support to consult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are offered PGx testing will also be surveyed: once after deciding whether or&#xD;
      not to pursue PGx testing and then, if they consent to testing, after they receive their test&#xD;
      results. These surveys will take about 10-15 minutes to complete and will be on paper&#xD;
      (pretest) and online through a system like SurveyMonkey (post-test). The pretest survey will&#xD;
      have 3 sections: demographics, perceived risks and benefits of PGx testing, and satisfaction&#xD;
      with test results. The post-test will assess information-seeking behavior, medication&#xD;
      adherence, and knowledge of adverse drug reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chart reviews will be conducted throughout the study to collect various data-points. All&#xD;
      extracted data-points will be coded; the key will be stored in a separate file to minimize&#xD;
      any breach of privacy. In summary, the medical records of patients scheduled to be seen at&#xD;
      either clinic during the first or second phase of the study (see Figure 1) will be reviewed&#xD;
      to identify those patients that were prescribed a drug from Table 1. A post-intervention (the&#xD;
      third and final phase of the study) chart review will be conducted to monitor the number of&#xD;
      new prescriptions for drugs listed in Table 1, the frequency with which PGx testing is&#xD;
      ordered, by which physicians, and for which drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct chart reviews at the end of each phase of the study (pre-intervention period,&#xD;
      intervention period, and post intervention period) of patients prescribed targeted&#xD;
      medications. No HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) identifiers will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All PCPs practicing at the two clinics involved in the study are eligible to participate. All&#xD;
      physicians who participate in the educational intervention in either arm will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the pre and post-intervention surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient survey population will include patients who were offered and consented or&#xD;
      declined testing. All patients 18 years and older who were prescribed a drug for which PGx&#xD;
      testing is available and offered a PGx test by their physician during the intervention period&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in the initial survey. Patients must be English-speaking and&#xD;
      able to complete the survey without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chart review will include all patients who were scheduled an appointment at either of the&#xD;
      clinics within the designed study period. Data abstracted (full chart review) will be limited&#xD;
      to those patients who were prescribed a target drug during the designated period.&#xD;
