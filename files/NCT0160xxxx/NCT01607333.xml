      The studies described in this protocol are all performed within the framework of PROTECT&#xD;
      (Pharmacoepidemiological Research on Outcomes of Therapeutics by a European ConsorTium)&#xD;
      Workpackage 2 and Workgroup 1. Primary aim of these studies is to develop, test and&#xD;
      disseminate methodological standards for the design, conduct and analysis of&#xD;
      Pharmacoepidemiological (PE) studies applicable to different safety issues and using&#xD;
      different data sources. To achieve this, results from PE studies on five key adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) performed in different databases will be evaluated. Therefore, emphasis will be on the&#xD;
      methodological aspects of the studies in this protocol and not on the clinical consequences&#xD;
      of the association under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present project, investigators use Columbia Classification Algorithm of suicide&#xD;
      assessment (C-CASA) definitions as a basis to specify the operational definitions of the&#xD;
      different aspects of suicidality. The focus of the main analyses is on attempted suicide&#xD;
      including completed suicide. This is due to statistical power issues. However, investigators&#xD;
      will apply two additional outcome definitions in sensitivity analyses: 1) completed suicide&#xD;
      only and 2) completed suicide, suicide attempt, preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal&#xD;
      behavior, suicidal ideation plus indeterminate or potentially suicidal events. Investigators&#xD;
      will not include terms which clearly indicate an accidental event, or self-injurious behavior&#xD;
      without a suicidal intent. These definitions are listed in the statistical analysis plan&#xD;
      together with lists of terms from the dictionaries used in the different databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to 1) Compare the study results which are based on two data&#xD;
      sources (he UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and Danish registries) and different&#xD;
      designs and evaluate the impact of design and population differences on the outcome of the&#xD;
      study results (the UK database 'The Health Improvement Network' (THIN) may be included in&#xD;
      these analyses as well); 2) Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the two data sources to&#xD;
      study a possible association of antiepileptic drug (AED) use and suicidality, in particular&#xD;
      the specific outcomes of death from suicide, hospitalization due to suicide attempt, and&#xD;
      reports of the aspects of suicidality by the patients; 3) Estimate risks of completed&#xD;
      suicide, completed suicide and attempted suicide, and completed suicide, suicide attempt,&#xD;
      preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation plus indeterminate or&#xD;
      potentially suicidal events overall for all AEDs and by individual AEDs prescribed in UK and&#xD;
      Denmark; and 4) Describe the patterns of AED prescribing in six European databases (GPRD and&#xD;
      THIN, UK; Danish registries; Mondriaan, Netherlands; Bavaria, Germany; Base de Datos para la&#xD;
      Investigación Farmacoepidemiologica en Atencion Primaria (BIFAP), Spain).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a major public heath concern. The estimated global burden of suicide is a million&#xD;
      deaths per year. Self-inflicted death accounts for 1.5% of all deaths and is the tenth&#xD;
      leading cause of death worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compiling evidence on suicidality is fraught with problems. E.g. suicide deaths are generally&#xD;
      perceived as underreported or prone to misclassification during cause-of-death ascertainment&#xD;
      procedures. The suicide rates may be underestimated by 10% to 22%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reliability of suicidality recording in electronic databases has recently been studied.&#xD;
      Arana et al investigated data from the United Kingdom database THIN and found that the codes&#xD;
      and the algorithm used to identify suicidality had a very high predictive value (97%). The&#xD;
      positive predictive values for completed suicide was lower (88%) and 14% of 'true', completed&#xD;
      suicides were not identified as having died. Hall who did a validation study of death and&#xD;
      suicide recording in the same databases identified seven cases of suicide out of 1394 'true&#xD;
      deaths' (0.5%). One had a record of 'suicide' as a Read code, a second case was identified by&#xD;
      'hanging' in the comments section, a third probable suicide case by the Read term 'overdose&#xD;
      of drug' plus an additional comment 'paracetamol/propaxyphene', and the four remaining cases&#xD;
      were identified by external documents such as death certificates. Hall excluded patients with&#xD;
      'major emotional events' and a history of cancer. This may be one of the reasons why the&#xD;
      percentage of suicide deaths was lower than expected (0.5% versus 1.5%) as mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiepileptic medications are a heterogeneous pharmacologic class characterized by various&#xD;
      chemical structures and postulated mechanisms of actions. The main therapeutic applications&#xD;
      of antiepileptics include epilepsy, bipolar disorder, depression, neuralgia, and migraine.&#xD;
      AEDs are among the most commonly prescribed centrally active agents. In a survey, carried out&#xD;
      in a Danish County, 1.1% of the studied people received AEDs. The use of these drugs&#xD;
      increased with increasing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the above mentioned indication such as epilepsy, major depression, and bipolar&#xD;
      disorders have a higher risk for suicide compared with the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible association between antiepileptic drugs and suicidality has been studied using&#xD;
      different data sources such as the UK GPRD, the UK THIN, the US HealthCore Integrated&#xD;
      Research Database (HIRD), Danish patient registries, Swedish patient registries, and data&#xD;
      from clinical trials. The investigators applied different study designs such as cohort,&#xD;
      matched case-control, case-crossover studies as well as a meta-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The published effects of antiepileptic drugs on suicidality covered a range between odds&#xD;
      ratio (OR) 0.24 (95% CI: 0.03-2.17) for pregabalin and OR 6.42 (95% CI: 1.24-33.36) for&#xD;
      levetiracetam. The effects of individual AEDs differed considerably within studies and&#xD;
      between studies. The same holds for different indications. Arana et al found the lowest OR in&#xD;
      patients with epilepsy only (OR 0.59; 95% CI: 0.35 - 0.98) and the highest OR in patients&#xD;
      with depression only (OR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.24 - 2.19). The authors compared current use of AEDs&#xD;
      with no use of AEDs in different indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the complexity of the present issue, adequate adjustment for the numerous potential&#xD;
      confounders such as socioeconomic aspects, various comorbidities, and concomitantly&#xD;
      prescribed medication, is an analytic challenge. Further to this, the availability of a&#xD;
      sufficiently large number of patients for investigation is another issue.&#xD;
