    <textblock>
      There is currently no published algorithm for secondary prevention prognosis of CHD that is&#xD;
      representative of the England GP-registered population and that includes both symptomatic and&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients (as identified through primary care). In this paper the investigators&#xD;
      will exploit routinely collected information in clinical practice to model CHD prognosis&#xD;
      based on a large contemporary open cohort of stable CAD patients. Although the investigators&#xD;
      model is based on data from GP practices in England only, the investigators believe that this&#xD;
      population is sufficiently heterogeneous in terms of ethnic mix, socioeconomic background,&#xD;
      predisposing characteristics and lifestyles to generate a prognostic model with good&#xD;
      generalizing power to the wider population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the research questions the investigators will try to answer is whether established risk&#xD;
      factors for primary care prevention (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes) are also&#xD;
      reliable for risk-stratification of patients who have already developed CAD. Similarly, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine whether strong predictors of adverse outcomes in ACS patients in&#xD;
      the short term, such as admission SBP and heart rate, are also associated with their long&#xD;
      term prognosis.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To use routinely collected primary care and clinical audit (MINAP) data for patients in&#xD;
           England to develop and validate prognostic models for people with stable CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify key prognostic factors for progression to MI or fatal CHD and compare their&#xD;
           strength among clinically important subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the risk distribution to specific time horizons overall and within&#xD;
           clinically important subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To use estimates derived from the model to inform subsequent decision models relating to&#xD;
           e.g. selection of patients for CABG or second-line anti-platelet agents (e.g.&#xD;
           clopidogrel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of primary interest is fatal CHD &amp; non-fatal MI. As a secondary outcome we will&#xD;
      model all cause mortality. Incidence for these endpoints will be estimated over a period of&#xD;
      up to 5 years depending on the quality and availability of follow-up in the cohort. We may&#xD;
      cautiously extend to other endpoints, including CVD and endpoints that reflect symptomatic&#xD;
      status (e.g. nitrate use).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to follow the reporting guidelines set out in the forthcoming work led by Atman and&#xD;
      Moons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be extracted from the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked&#xD;
      bespoke studies and electronic records) study. CALIBER is a collection of public health data&#xD;
      repositories, linking the national myocardial infarction register to the rich longitudinal&#xD;
      primary care record, secondary care data sources and to highly phenotyped cohorts in the UCL&#xD;
      genetics consortium. Currently, the CALIBER dataset is composed by linkage of several&#xD;
      datasets:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General Practice Research Database (GPRD)7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP)8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)9&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible general practices were defined as practices that meet standards for acceptable&#xD;
      levels of data recording (i.e. audits demonstrated that &quot;at least 95% of relevant patient&#xD;
      encounters are recorded and data meet quality standards for epidemiological research&quot;7), and&#xD;
      have consented to linkage with HES and MINAP (approximately 200 practices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define incident cases we will exclude patients who have not been observed during the year&#xD;
      prior to their CAD diagnosis date. For prevalent cases we will remove this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our startpoint population is defined as patients aged 18 years or over diagnosed with CAD,&#xD;
      under which we include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients diagnosed with stable angina&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients with ACS (STEMI, NSTEMI &amp; unstable angina) who survived &gt; 4 weeks. Patients&#xD;
           with a CAD diagnosis who received revascularization during follow-up will enter the&#xD;
           cohort after the procedure (given post-procedure survival &gt;4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will cautiously define broader as well as more specific startpoint populations so as to&#xD;
      fully exploit the information quantity and richness in the CALIBER data. Thus, we will extend&#xD;
      our analysis to prevalent CAD cases and to incident cohorts with one of the four CAD subtypes&#xD;
      (stable angina, unstable angina, STEMI and NSTEMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study start date will be defined as 1st January 2000, in order to include only those&#xD;
      patients for whom cause-specific mortality data is potentially available (first linked 1st&#xD;
      January 2001). The study period will end on 20th October, 2009, the last date of linkage with&#xD;
      ONS mortality data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient we will determine the right censor date, which will be the earliest of the&#xD;
      following dates: date of developing the outcome of interest, the end of study period (20&#xD;
      October 2009), date of non-coronary death, date of leaving the practice, or last practice&#xD;
      data collection date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses anonymised dataset from the GPRD, MINAP and HES. The study protocol was&#xD;
      evaluated and approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) of the&#xD;
      Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (ISAC protocol Nos 07-008 and&#xD;
      10-106). The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration No TBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanatory factors considered Initially, we will consider a wide range of risk factors and&#xD;
      biomarkers that have been implicated in coronary artery syndromes and are broadly available&#xD;
      at/around the time of a clinical review, including Framingham (&quot;standard&quot;) risk factors (age,&#xD;
      smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes). Because, typically, risk factors&#xD;
      are not measured concurrently but over a few days around the time of diagnosis we will define&#xD;
      rules to select 'baseline' measurements and handle conflicts in overlapping values between&#xD;
      GPRD and MINAP (where these arise).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our selection will be drawn from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. demographic, including age at diagnosis, ethnicity and the index of multiple deprivation&#xD;
           (IMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. lifestyle, including smoking and alcohol consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. blood pressure-related, including SBP, DBP, prescription of anti-hypertensives,&#xD;
           diagnosed hypertension, pulse rate and pulse pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. lipids-related, including total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides and prescription of&#xD;
           statins&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. diabetes-related, including diagnosis of type I or II diabetes, diabetes medication,&#xD;
           fasting plasma glucose, Hb1Ac and BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. biomarkers, including creatinine and haemoglobin&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Secondary prevention medications (aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors&#xD;
           and beta-blockers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Previous interventions (PCI and CABG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. CVD severity, including angiographic findings (normal/abnormal left ventricular&#xD;
           function), CV-coexisting conditions (stroke, peripheral artery disease) previous MI and&#xD;
           consultation frequency (within the last year)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Non-CV co-morbidities, major chapters included in the Charlson index&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. For ACS patients we will also consider information specifically recorded in MINAP in&#xD;
           relation to the hospital episode (acute pulse rate, acute SBP and DBP and&#xD;
           beta-troponin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of missing values&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where possible, repeated measurements will be used to replace missing data in the baseline&#xD;
      record. The approach will be based on a set of rules for transferring measurements between&#xD;
      different consultations and reconciling measurements from different sources that we will&#xD;
      develop for the CALIBER project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining missing values will be replaced with predicted values under the multiple&#xD;
      imputation framework, as implemented in the R package 'mice' (version 2). This version of&#xD;
      'mice' can handle both missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify suitable models for imputing each variable we will take the following approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compute the correlation matrix to select strong predictors for the missing data in each&#xD;
           variable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess missing data patterns, proportion and covariate distributions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify the strength of association with outcome of interest (fitting a Cox model with&#xD;
           all variables)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify a suitable imputation model and simplify it where possible (but always include&#xD;
           standard risk factors and any other predictors we expect to include in the prognostic&#xD;
           model based on their clinical importance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decide the order in which the variables would be imputed (e.g. in order of decreasing&#xD;
           missingness, correlation and/or predictive power).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All our imputation models will include the outcome of interest (CHD death or non-fatal MI) as&#xD;
      previously described 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imputation will form part of variable selection and model estimation as described later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variable selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will select our final model based on a combination of approaches including statistical&#xD;
      performance and clinical feasibility. Our aim is to arrive at a generalizable, efficiently&#xD;
      estimable model that, at the same time, is sensitive enough to capture much of the&#xD;
      heterogeneity in the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess statistical performance in CoxPH models with the outcome(s) of interest. Sex&#xD;
      will be included as an adjusted or stratifying variable depending on whether or not the&#xD;
      proportional hazards (PH) assumption is satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that patients from different practices differ in their underlying risk (e.g.&#xD;
      due to regional variations in case-mix). Hence, we will test the PH assumption with respect&#xD;
      to sex-specific baseline hazards of the GP practices in the data. If the PH assumption is&#xD;
      violated we will estimate Cox models within each practice and combine coefficients by random&#xD;
      effects meta-analysis. If the PH assumption is satisfied we will assume the same baseline&#xD;
      hazard across practices and indicate the clustered patients (in the same GP practice) in the&#xD;
      model to estimate robust variances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will choose the timescale for the Cox models based on preliminary analysis exploring two&#xD;
      alternatives, age-at-risk or time to event/censoring. Our choice will be based largely on the&#xD;
      age-spread of diagnosis and cases in the cohort and which timescale is more likely to have&#xD;
      fewer PH violations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In step 1 we will explore univariate associations between each candidate predictor and the&#xD;
      primary endpoint in terms of the strength and shape of association and evaluate plausible&#xD;
      interactions with age, time and sex. Where the shape differs significantly from linearity we&#xD;
      will consider more flexible modelling, such as using restricted-cubic splines. Proportional&#xD;
      hazards will be assessed by examining Schoenfield residuals. Variables with low statistical&#xD;
      significance will not be considered further unless there are strong clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In step 2 we will follow a data-driven approach to identify important variables among those&#xD;
      retained from step 1 in a multivariate context. For this we will use stepwise regression, as&#xD;
      implemented in the fastbw function in the 'rms' R package (ref), forcing into all candidate&#xD;
      models the standard risk factors. We will apply the algorithm separately for each panel of&#xD;
      candidate predictors, e.g. blood pressure variables, CVD severity etc so as to ensure that at&#xD;
      least 1 predictor from each group is represented in the final model. As a general rule p&gt;0.1&#xD;
      and lack of strong association in the univariate setting will be considered evidence for&#xD;
      exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steps above will be coupled with multiple imputation, as previously recommended11, using&#xD;
      an efficient and unbiased approach among the options proposed for the problem at hand. Final&#xD;
      selection will be based on assessing several candidate models with similar statistical&#xD;
      performance using other criteria, such as the proportion of non-imputed data, measurement&#xD;
      reliability, clinical feasibility and clinicians' advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once variables to be included in the model have been selected we will update imputation&#xD;
      models (where necessary) to include these variables. Not doing so could bias associations to&#xD;
      null12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of coefficients and risks needs to incorporate three types of uncertainty:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncertainty due to imputation of missing data (dealt with by incorporating&#xD;
           between-imputation variation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters (dealt with by cross-validation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity to data sample (dealt with by bootstrapping the data)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform 10-fold cross-validation the data will be randomly divided into 10 subgroups. The&#xD;
      risks for individuals in subgroup q will be estimated by fitting the Cox model to all&#xD;
      subgroups except subgroup q. Repeating this for each subgroup q=1,..,10 yields predicted&#xD;
      risks for all individuals. As a sensitivity analysis we will repeat the cross-validation&#xD;
      procedure splitting by GP-practice instead of randomly across all practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation will proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All predictors selected to be in the final model that have missing data will be imputed&#xD;
           based on the imputation models selected in earlier steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CoxPH models will be fitted (with cross-validation) for the endpoint of interest&#xD;
           treating non-CHD deaths as censored observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CoxPH models will be fitted (with cross-validation) for non-CHD treating MI and fatal&#xD;
           CHD as censored observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Risks will be estimated for each individual adjusting for non-CHD mortality based on the&#xD;
           cause-specific Cox models and the formula described by Kalbfleisch &amp; Prentice13.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Standard errors will be obtained by repeating steps 2 to 4 on a suitable number (200) of&#xD;
           bootstrap samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The procedure will be repeated from step 1 for another 4 rounds of imputation to obtain&#xD;
           the between imputation variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Estimates will be combined using Rubin's rules. Evaluation Most standard methods for&#xD;
           model evaluation assume absolute risks (not adjusted for competing risks). Because we&#xD;
           are dealing with cumulative incidences (i.e. risks adjusted for non-CVD mortality) we&#xD;
           will modify evaluation approaches accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calibration will be checked by grouping predictions into deciles and computing the&#xD;
                mean risk within each decile against the competing risks-adjusted Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
                (i.e. cumulative incidence) for that risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Discrimination will be checked overall and in an age-specific manner using a&#xD;
                formulation of the C-index that allows adjusting for competing risks14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we will compare performance (where possible) with other published risk algorithms,&#xD;
      such as GRACE15 and REACH3 that refer to similar starting populations and outcomes. To do&#xD;
      this, we will fit models using the set of covariates included in the published algorithms and&#xD;
      compare them with our proposed new model. Because no clinically meaningful risk thresholds&#xD;
      exist for secondary CHD prevention as yet we will use metrics that do not require risk&#xD;
      stratification. Possible examples are the continuous NRI16 and the Brier score.&#xD;
