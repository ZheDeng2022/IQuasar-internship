  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV associated neurological disorders (HAND), are a major problem even in ART treated people.&#xD;
      HAND results from chronic inflammation which is largely attributed to expansion and&#xD;
      activation of monocytes. These activated monocytes, some of which also carry virus to the&#xD;
      brain, invade the CNS and release cytokines / chemokines resulting in further recruitment of&#xD;
      monocytes, as well as release viral proteins which injure neurons and cause activation of&#xD;
      other brain cells. Persistent monocyte/macrophage activation is thus a potential critical&#xD;
      target for adjunctive therapy to treat or prevent HAND. The investigators therefore propose&#xD;
      to study the effects of a statin drug (Atorvastatin), which has anti-inflammatory functions,&#xD;
      on the monocyte activation status in ART treated HIV+ individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators objectives are based on the hypothesis that Atorvastatin treatment will&#xD;
      reduce the inflammatory and activated phenotype and function of monocytes which have been&#xD;
      linked to HIV associated neuropathogenesis and occur in HIV infected subjects despite ART. In&#xD;
      this study the investigators propose to&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) define the effect of Atorvastatin on monocyte activation in HIV infected / ART treated&#xD;
      subjects in a double blind, placebo controlled crossover study&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Week 0 in Percentage of Blood Monocytes Expressing Surface Marker CD16 at 12 Weeks, as a Result of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Whole blood drawn from participants were stained with fluorochrome tagged antibodies to the surface markers. Stained whole blood cells were then acquired on a flow cytometer and analyzed using the Flowjo software to determine the change in percentage of monocytes expressing the specific marker (CD16) at 12 wk versus 0wk within each Period.&#xD;
Data is shown as fold change over 12 weeks, in percent positive monocytes expressing surface markers.&#xD;
Change in primary outcome measures in each treatment arm is expressed as fold change (at week 12 versus week 0). For eg. outcome measure CD14+CD16+ in atorvastatin arm shows a mean value of 1.14. This means at 12 weeks there is an increase of 0.14 fold in the percent monocyte population expressing CD14+CD16+ marker, versus 0 week. Similarly in the placebo group. If fold change in atorvastatin group is smaller than in placebo group, then the treatment had no effect.</description>

    <description>Monocyte specific inflammatory soluble factor MCP-1 was measured by Luminex in plasma of HIV+/HAART+ subjects at baseline and at 12 weeks following treatment (atorvastatin or placebo).&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Week 0 in Percentage of Blood Monocytes Expressing Surface Marker CD163 at 12 Weeks, as a Result of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Whole blood drawn from participants were stained with fluorochrome tagged antibodies to the surface marker CD163. Stained whole blood cells were then acquired on a flow cytometer and analyzed using the Flowjo software to determine the change in percentage of monocytes expressing the specific marker (CD163) at 12 wk versus 0wk within each Period.&#xD;
Data in each treatment arm is shown as 'mean difference' at 12 weeks versus 0 week, in percent positive monocytes expressing surface marker CD163.&#xD;
Data is expressed as the difference of the mean values at week 12 and week 0. The negative values mean that the mean values at 12 week were lower than the mean values at 0 week.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Chronic HIV infected individuals on HAART (with no changes in treatment within 4 weeks of study entry), were recruited using the Penn CFAR Clinical Core database. Subject were consented by the study nurse coordinating the project. Of 46 screened subjects, 11 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants that met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to 12weeks of atorvastatin (or placebo) in the first period followed by a 4week washout and then in the second period on placebo (or atorvastatin) for 12 weeks followed by washout (4weeks). Therefore each subject served as their own control.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Week 0 in Percentage of Blood Monocytes Expressing Surface Marker CD16 at 12 Weeks, as a Result of Treatment.</title>
        <description>Whole blood drawn from participants were stained with fluorochrome tagged antibodies to the surface markers. Stained whole blood cells were then acquired on a flow cytometer and analyzed using the Flowjo software to determine the change in percentage of monocytes expressing the specific marker (CD16) at 12 wk versus 0wk within each Period.&#xD;
Data is shown as fold change over 12 weeks, in percent positive monocytes expressing surface markers.&#xD;
Change in primary outcome measures in each treatment arm is expressed as fold change (at week 12 versus week 0). For eg. outcome measure CD14+CD16+ in atorvastatin arm shows a mean value of 1.14. This means at 12 weeks there is an increase of 0.14 fold in the percent monocyte population expressing CD14+CD16+ marker, versus 0 week. Similarly in the placebo group. If fold change in atorvastatin group is smaller than in placebo group, then the treatment had no effect.</description>
