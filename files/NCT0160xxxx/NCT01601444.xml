      Early detection of pleural effusion (PLE) would improve the treatment. However, preclinical&#xD;
      detection of pleural effusion is often not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic examination, widely used for detecting pleural effusion ,is not suitable for&#xD;
      prolonged monitoring of patients at high risk of developing PLE especially ambulatory or at&#xD;
      home (1-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently available methods for monitoring and early detection such as the measurement of&#xD;
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or measurement by double indicator thermodilution, are not&#xD;
      reliable enough and may themselves lead to complications(2-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yu C-M et al.(9) recently reported successful prediction of CPE by a surgically implanted&#xD;
      impedance plethysmograph integrated into a pacemaker . The system was shown to be&#xD;
      sufficiently sensitive for cardiogenic pulmonary edema preceding. However this method is&#xD;
      invasive and not suitable for wide use (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, these methods are seldom employed for the detection of PLE (3-7). Thus, a safe and&#xD;
      accurate technique for early detection and monitoring of PlEf would be of great clinical&#xD;
      value. The changes in the blood and extravascular fluid content in the lungs in humans and&#xD;
      animals can be easily monitored using a noninvasive and totally safe procedure based on&#xD;
      impedance plethysmography (5-12-). This method is based on the fact that the impedance of the&#xD;
      lungs decreases with the increase in the fluid and free ions content in them (8,13,).&#xD;
      However, it proved to be unsuitable for preclinical stage monitoring of PLE (2-8) for several&#xD;
      reasons, mainly the low sensitivity of the existing impedance plethysmographs. This is due to&#xD;
      the high skin-electrode contact resistance (13,14), which is of an order of magnitude high&#xD;
      erthan the impedance of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cleaning the skin of fats with alcohol and moistening it with electrode paste, the&#xD;
      value of the skin electrode contact resistance is approximately 400- 500 ohm (11-13).&#xD;
      Therefore, for two measuring electrodes (front and back of the chest), this value must be&#xD;
      800-1000 ohm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total transthoracic impedance (TTI) consists of internal thoracic impedance (ITI) and skin&#xD;
      contact impedance. The TTI may vary from 920 to 1230 ohm in different individuals (11-13).&#xD;
      However, change of TTI in PLE was reported by others to vary in the range of 2-16 ohm (7-9,&#xD;
      11-18), which is approximately1% of TTI and 1.5% of skin contact impedance. Monitors used in&#xD;
      previous works were not sensitive enough to detect the relatively small changes in pulmonary&#xD;
      impedance(2-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, during prolonged monitoring, the skin-electrode contact impedance may also&#xD;
      change (13,14) due to penetration of the ions from sweat into the electrode paste and drying&#xD;
      of the paste. It may significantly exceed the change in the impedance of the lung caused by&#xD;
      the development of cardiogenic pulmonary edema (2-7). Kubicek et al. (10) attempted to&#xD;
      develop a method in which a tetrapolar electrode system is used to overcome this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, because this system measures the impedance of the entire chest, a large part of the&#xD;
      electrical field is concentrated in the surface tissues, and this considerably reduces the&#xD;
      sensitivity of the method (10,11). Furthermore, Kubicek's electrodes may be burdensome and&#xD;
      for critically ill patients when prolonged monitoring is required. The main disadvantage of&#xD;
      this and other more sensitive methods is surgical implantation of the electrodes (10,13) A&#xD;
      new impedance monitor, model RS- 207 EDEMA GUARD MONITOR (R. S. Medical Monitoring,&#xD;
      Jerusalem, Israel), has been developed (15). The monitor design has also solved the problem&#xD;
      of the drift skin-to-electrode electrical resistance and its drift during prolonged&#xD;
      monitoring by separating ITI from skin-to-electrode electrical resistance. The result of the&#xD;
      above mentioned actions is a value of Internal Thoracic Electrical Resistance (Impedance) -&#xD;
      ITI. The method of ITI estimation that completely described by Rabinovich (15) Unlike the&#xD;
      existing impedance monitors, the new monitor measures only ITI, which roughly equals lung&#xD;
      impedance, by automatically calculating skin electrode impedance and subtracting it from TTI.&#xD;
      According to the published data, ITI ranges from 40 to 100 ohm in individuals without CPE&#xD;
      and, on average, decreases to 30 ohm, i.e., by30% to 75% during CPE (11-12,16-21). These&#xD;
      results showed much higher sensitivity compared with the 1.5% changes found using TTI&#xD;
      methods. This is an average 35- fold increase (range, 20- to 50-fold intraindividual&#xD;
      constitutional differences) of impedance plethysmograph sensitivity compared with the method&#xD;
      without substraction of skin electrode resistance (2-8). This monitor was succefully used for&#xD;
      early detection of pulmonary edema however there was no any expearence on pleural fluid&#xD;
      detection.(11,12,16-20.) The aim of the present study is to evaluate the suitability of the&#xD;
      RS-207 in monitoring PlEf at clinical and preclinical stage. The tests will be considered&#xD;
      successful if ITI will be low or decreased parallel to or before the appearance of clinical&#xD;
      signs and radiograph findings compatible with PlEf, and then demonstrably increased during&#xD;
      their resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerations and purpose Previous study based on measurements of ITI in early diagnosis of&#xD;
      pulmonary edema showed suitability of the RS-207.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no any study that deals with early diagnosis of pleural effusion by this simple&#xD;
      nonexpencive method which can be used in ICU and ambulatory Measuring ITI, the main component&#xD;
      of which is lung impedance, is a noninvasive and safe method. PLE will be diagnosed in&#xD;
      accordance with well-accepted clinical signs(dyspnea, cyanosis, pulmonary rales,&#xD;
      crepitations, arterial hypoxemia) and roentgenological criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consideration of the study : evaluation of the suitability of the RS-205 monitor in&#xD;
      detecting the PLE at preclinical stage before the appearance of clinical signs for assessment&#xD;
      of early treatment and then to demonstrate increased of ITI during their resolution.&#xD;
