  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) is the provision of nutrients via the intravenous route. Parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition associated metabolic bone disease (MBD) was first described in children in the&#xD;
      1980s. Since then, there has been little to no research into the underlying relationship and&#xD;
      as a result, little evidence on which to base clinical care. In adults, MBD is associated&#xD;
      with increased fractures. At the Hospital for Sick children in Toronto, an intestinal failure&#xD;
      program has been set up since 2003. This is the only intestinal failure program in Canada and&#xD;
      receives country wide referrals. Most of the patients have short bowel syndrome (SBS) and&#xD;
      require PN for prolonged periods, or for life. About 90% of these patients have MBD, and some&#xD;
      have had bone fractures. An understanding of the etiology of MBD would provide information to&#xD;
      guide care, and prevent this condition. Funding for this area of research however is&#xD;
      challenging because intestinal failure requiring long term PN is a rare condition, accounting&#xD;
      for approximately 200 - 300 children in all of Canada. The goal of this study therefore is to&#xD;
      gather pilot data on markers of MBD in children on long term PN, and to compare these markers&#xD;
      to age and gender matched control patients who are fed by mouth or feeding tube. The&#xD;
      information gathered from this study will help us begin to understand what is actually&#xD;
      happening in the bones of children on long term PN and will form the basis for future studies&#xD;
      and improved clinical care.&#xD;
