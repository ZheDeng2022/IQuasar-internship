      Since uncontrolled observational studies first linked fructose to the epidemic of obesity&#xD;
      almost a decade ago, it has become a focus of intense concern regarding its role in the&#xD;
      obesity epidemic. Despite the uncertainties in the evidence,the recommendations of&#xD;
      international health organizations have cautioned against moderate to high intakes&#xD;
      fructose-containing sugars, especially those from sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs). To&#xD;
      improve the evidence on which nutrition recommendations are based, the investigators propose&#xD;
      to study of the effect of fructose-containing sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs)on body weight,&#xD;
      by undertaking a systematic synthesis of the data taken from all available clinical studies&#xD;
      in humans. This technique has the strength of allowing all of the available data to be pooled&#xD;
      together and differences to be explored in groups of different study participants (healthy&#xD;
      humans of different sex, weight, and age and in those with diseases which predispose to&#xD;
      disturbances in metabolism, such as diabetes) with dietary fructose in different forms,&#xD;
      doses, and with differing durations of exposure. The findings generated by this proposed&#xD;
      knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of consumers through informing&#xD;
      recommendations for the general public, as well as those at risk of diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Fructose has become a focus of intense concern regarding its links to the obesity&#xD;
      epidemic. There have been dozens of editorials, commentaries, and letters in the scientific&#xD;
      literature and numerous pieces in the lay and social media calling for efforts to restrict&#xD;
      its intake and even regulate it like tobacco or alcohol. Uncontrolled observational studies&#xD;
      which have linked increasing fructose intake with increasing obesity rates since the 1970s&#xD;
      and animal models of fructose overfeeding at levels of exposure far beyond actual population&#xD;
      levels of intake have been used to underpin this debate. Evidence from observational studies&#xD;
      and controlled feeding trials also suggest a positive association between the consumption of&#xD;
      fructose-containing sugar-sweetened beverages, in which high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is&#xD;
      the main sweetener, and increased energy consumption and weight gain, but not all&#xD;
      meta-analyses have supported this conclusion. Despite the limitations in extrapolating from&#xD;
      these data and their inconsistency with data from controlled trials in humans (the highest&#xD;
      level of evidence used in evidence based medicine), the American Heart Association (AHA) have&#xD;
      taken a risk reduction approach to added fructose-containing sugars, especially those from&#xD;
      sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs), setting highly restrictive upper thresholds for their&#xD;
      intake to achieve and maintain healthy body-weights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To improve the evidence on which recommendations and public health policy are&#xD;
      based, we propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of&#xD;
      fructose-containing SSBs on body weight in controlled feeding trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms, supplemented by&#xD;
      manual, hand searches of bibliographies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: We will include controlled feeding trials investigating the effect of&#xD;
      fructose-containing (fructose, sucrose, and HFCS) SSBs in isocaloric exchange for other&#xD;
      carbohydrate sources (isocaloric trials) or hypercaloric exchange for beverages containing a&#xD;
      non-nutritive sweetener or added to a control diet as a source of excess energy (hypercaloric&#xD;
      trials) on body weight in humans. Studies that are &lt;7-days diet duration, lack a control, or&#xD;
      do not provide viable endpoint data will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction. Two investigators will independently extract information about study design,&#xD;
      sample size, subject characteristics, fructose form, dose, reference-carbohydrate, follow-up,&#xD;
      and background diet profile. MeanÂ±SEM values will be extracted for body weight. Standard&#xD;
      computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data. The&#xD;
      quality/validity of each study will be assessed using the Heyland Methodological Quality&#xD;
      Score (MQS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ouctomes: Body weight change will be the only ouctome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis. Meta-analyses will be conducted using the Generic Inverse Variance method&#xD;
      applying random effects models expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95%&#xD;
      CIs. Paired analyses will be applied for crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be assessed by&#xD;
      the Q statistic and quantified by I2. Sensitivity analyses and a priori subgroup analyses&#xD;
      will be undertaken to explore sources of heterogeneity including the effect of underlying&#xD;
      disease status, sugar type (fructose, sucrose, HFCS), reference carbohydrate (comparator),&#xD;
      fructose form, dose, follow-up, study design, baseline measurements, and study quality on the&#xD;
      effect of fructose. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional&#xD;
      post hoc subgroup analyses (e.g. age, sex, level of feeding control, energy balance and&#xD;
      composition of the background diet, etc.). Meta-regression analyses will assess the&#xD;
      significance of subgroups analyses. Publication bias will be investigated by inspection of&#xD;
      funnel plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific&#xD;
      communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for&#xD;
      future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among&#xD;
      opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary findings: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of dietary fructose on body weight in controlled feeding trials (Sievenpiper et al.&#xD;
      Ann Intern Med. 2012;156:291-304). We identified 31 isocaloric trials (n=635), in which&#xD;
      fructose was exchanged for the same amount of carbohydrate in the diet, and 10 hypercaloric&#xD;
      trials (n=119), in which the diet was supplemented with excess energy from high-dose&#xD;
      fructose. Whereas there was no effect of fructose under isocaloric trial conditions, fructose&#xD;
      under hypercaloric trial conditions (+104-250-g/day, +18-97% energy) significantly and&#xD;
      consistently increased weight (MD=0.53-kg or 1.17-lb [95%CI: 0.26 to 0.79-kg or 0.57 to&#xD;
      1.74-lb]). In both analyses, fructose behaved no differently than sucrose or HFCS, where&#xD;
      these sugars were the comparators, and fructose in fluid (beverage) form did not increase&#xD;
      body weight in the isocaloric trials. We concluded that the available trials did not support&#xD;
      a body weight raising-effect of fructose in isocaloric exchange for other carbohydrate. There&#xD;
      was, however, consistent evidence for a modest body weight raising-effect of fructose at&#xD;
      extreme doses providing excess energy, where the effect of energy appeared to be dominant.&#xD;
      The implications of our findings for &quot;real world&quot; dietary advice was complicated by the fact&#xD;
      that sucrose and HFCS are the primary fructose-containing sweeteners in the US diet. The&#xD;
      proposed systematic review and meta-analysis will address this limitation directly by&#xD;
      investigating the effect of all fructose-containing (fructose, sucrose, and HFCS) SSBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects&#xD;
      of dietary fructose on overweight and obesity, strengthening the evidence-base for&#xD;
      recommendations and improving health outcomes through informing consumers and guiding future&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
