  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are commonly prescribed to lower cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary&#xD;
      prevention. Despite their well known efficacy, statin withdrawal is a common event. Even a&#xD;
      short term statin withdrawal can have dramatic consequences on atherosclerotic plaque&#xD;
      stability, owing to a rebound in cholesterol levels and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of a short term statin withdrawal on endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and&#xD;
      monocyte/macrophage polarization is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will explore the effects of a 5-day statin withdrawal on EPC&#xD;
      and monocyte/macrophage polarization, together with other inflammatory biomarkers in type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients. The investigators hypothesize that statin withdrawal determines a&#xD;
      reduction in EPC levels and an inflammatory cell polarization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to continue their habitual statin regimen or to withdraw statin.&#xD;
      At baseline and 5 days later, blood samples will be collected for experimental measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Statins are commonly prescribed to lower cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary&#xD;
      prevention. Despite their well known efficacy with relatively low NNTs, statin withdrawal is&#xD;
      a common event for several reasons. Patients often stop statin therapies for long or short&#xD;
      periods of time. Even a short term statin withdrawal can have dramatic consequences on&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque stability, owing to a rebound in cholesterol levels and inflammation.&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated worsening of inflammation and endothelial function after a&#xD;
      short-term statin withdrawal. This may be even more dramatic in patients who are at increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular disease, such as diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial integrity is accomplished through the contribution of circulating endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells (EPC) which repair the damaged endothelial layer and contribute to&#xD;
      cardiovascular health in general. EPC are stimulated by statins, but there is no data on the&#xD;
      effect of statin withdrawal on EPCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One important aspect of inflammation is the pro- versus anti-inflammatory polarization of&#xD;
      circulating monocyte/macrophage (MM) cells. Schematically, MM can exist in 2 different states&#xD;
      of activation: the classically activated pro-inflammatory cells (M1) and the alternatively&#xD;
      activated anti-inflammatory cells (M2). The balance between these 2 (M1/M2 ratio) reflects&#xD;
      the state of MM polarization. The effects of statin withdrawal on MM polarization is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will explore the effects of a 5-day statin withdrawal on EPC and&#xD;
      monocyte/macrophage polarization, together with other inflammatory biomarkers (namely high&#xD;
      sensitive C-reactive protein) in type 2 diabetic patients. We hypothesise that statin&#xD;
      withdrawal determines a reduction in EPC levels and an inflammatory cell polarization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to continue their habitual statin regimen or to withdraw statin.&#xD;
      At baseline and 5 days later, blood samples will be collected for experimental measures (EPC,&#xD;
      M1, M2 and hsCRP).&#xD;
