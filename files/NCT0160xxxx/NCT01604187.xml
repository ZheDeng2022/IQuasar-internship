  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is generally considered an invasive procedure that causes remarkable pain to the&#xD;
      patient. The pain associated with the procedure is not caused by the insertion of the scope&#xD;
      but from inflating of the colon in order to do the inspection. It has been shown that&#xD;
      colonoscopy can be performed successfully without sedation (Leung, 2010), but many patients&#xD;
      feel discomfort during the procedure. Factors predicting a painful colonoscopy are&#xD;
      female-gender, degree of patient nervousness and the technical difficulty of the colonoscopy&#xD;
      (Ylinen et al. 2009). Also age under 40, previous abdominal surgery and use of sedation are&#xD;
      associated with painful colonoscopy ( Seip et al. 2009). Most often sedation and/or analgesia&#xD;
      are achieved by administering a benzodiazepine or a combination of a benzodiazepine and an&#xD;
      opioid (Fanti et al. 2009, Maskelar et al. 2009,), dexmedetomidine (Dere et al. 2009) or by&#xD;
      using non-pharmacologic methods (Amer-Cuenca et al. 2011). Tramadol as monotherapy did not&#xD;
      significantly decrease pain intensity or endoscopist's evaluation of colonoscopy (Grossi et&#xD;
      al. 2004). Currently, intravenous midazolam is the drug used most commonly to introduce some&#xD;
      sedation for colonoscopy. Intravenous sedation definitely increases the cost of procedure;&#xD;
      drug administration, need for pulse oximetry monitoring and the need for follow-up after the&#xD;
      procedure make colonoscopy sometimes expensive and troublesome. It has also been shown, that&#xD;
      low-dose midazolam neither relieves discomfort nor makes patients forget it (Elphick et al.&#xD;
      2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl is a short-acting opioid widely used in anesthesia management. Transmucosal&#xD;
      sublingual formulation of fentanyl has been developed to further improve the management of&#xD;
      pain. When administered as a sublingual fast-dissolving tablet (Abstral®) that is placed&#xD;
      under the tongue, the effects is fast and predictable. Its active ingredient is absorbed by&#xD;
      the body through the mucous membrane. After administration of buccal fentanyl maximum plasma&#xD;
      drug concentration was measured after 25 minutes (Darwish et al. 2011). Plasma fentanyl&#xD;
      concentrations versus time following buccal and sublingual administration are very similar&#xD;
      (Darwish et al. 2008). Abstral® sublingual tablets should be administered directly under the&#xD;
      tongue at the deepest part. Sublingual administration is an easy and non-invasive method of&#xD;
      pain treatment for the patient coming to colonoscopy done as an office based procedure. Other&#xD;
      advantages compared to invasive methods are improved comfort of patients and no need for&#xD;
      intravenous access because of pain relief. Before, it has been used in the management of&#xD;
      breakthrough pain in cancer patients. Sublingual fentanyl is shown to be effective and&#xD;
      well-tolerated for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain (Uberall et al. 2011). The use&#xD;
      of transmucosal tablet for colonoscopy patients is a quite new approach.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of fentanyl transmucosal tablet to&#xD;
      placebo in patients having colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic drug absorbed very rapidly through the oral mucosa and more&#xD;
      slowly through the gastrointestinal tract. Orally administered fentanyl undergoes pronounced&#xD;
      hepatic and intestinal first pass effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstral® is a quick dissolving sublingual tablet formulation. Rapid absorption of fentanyl&#xD;
      occurs over about 30 minutes following administration of Abstral®. The bioavailability of&#xD;
      Abstral® has not been studied but is estimated to be about 70%. Mean maximal plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of fentanyl range from 0.2 to 1.3 ng/ml (after administration of 100 to 800 µg&#xD;
      Abstral®) and are reached within 22.5 to 240 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl is metabolised primarily via CYP3A4 to a number of pharmacologically inactive&#xD;
      metabolites, including norfentanyl. Within 72 hours of intravenous fentanyl administration&#xD;
      around 75% of the dose is excreted into the urine, mostly as metabolites, with less than 10%&#xD;
      as unchanged drug. About 9% of the dose is recovered in the faeces, primarily as metabolites.&#xD;
      Total plasma clearance of fentanyl is about 0.5 l/h/kg. After Abstral® administration, the&#xD;
      main elimination half-life of fentanyl is about 7 hours (range 3-12.5 hours) and the terminal&#xD;
      half-life is about 20 hours (range 11.5-25 hours). Impaired hepatic or renal function could&#xD;
      cause increased serum concentrations. Elderly, cachectic or generally impaired patients may&#xD;
      have a lower fentanyl clearance, which could cause a longer terminal half-life for the&#xD;
      compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled double-blind study. A total of 200 patients will be included.&#xD;
      The patients are recruited from 18-85 year old male or female patients undergoing&#xD;
      colonoscopy. In view of previous studies (Amer-Cuenca et al. 2011) it can be calculated that&#xD;
      87 patients will be needed per group to demonstrate a 30% decrease in the worst experienced&#xD;
      pain at a level of significance P = 0.05 and power of 90%. Because of possible dropouts, 100&#xD;
      patients will be recruited to both groups. Pain will be assessed by numeral rating scale&#xD;
      (NRS). For the calculation of the sample size, coefficient of variation is assumed to be 70%&#xD;
      in both groups.&#xD;

    <description>Anxiety will be measured using NRS (0 = no anxiety, 10=maximal anxiety). Pain will be monitored by using numercal rating scale NRS (0-10), sedation by using NRS (0-10, 0= not sedated at all, 10=no response) . Nurse's and surgeon's satisfaction with the procedure will be evaluated using NRS (0-10). Adverse effects of opioids will be evaluated by patients using NRS (0-10)) for the following items: drowsiness (alert / very drowsy), pleasantness (very unpleasant / very pleasant feeling) and nausea/vomiting (no nausea / very strong nausea). In addition, all other adverse effects will be recorded.</description>

The patients will be interviewed by telephone on the first day after the procedure approximately 24 hours later and.</description>
