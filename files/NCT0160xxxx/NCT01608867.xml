  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1 dose escalation study of OMP-54F28 in subjects with a solid&#xD;
      tumor for which there is no remaining standard curative therapy. Subjects will be assessed&#xD;
      for safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, and efficacy. No formal interim&#xD;
      analyses will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment, subjects will undergo screening to determine study eligibility. Upon&#xD;
      enrollment, subjects will receive OMP-54F28 until disease progression. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive Vitamin D3 daily and calcium carbonate twice daily from Day 0 through 30 days&#xD;
      following the discontinuation of OMP-54F28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects&#xD;
      will be dosed at 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg administered IV once every 3 weeks. No dose&#xD;
      escalation or reduction will be allowed within a dose cohort. Intermediate doses (i.e., doses&#xD;
      between the dose levels listed above) may also be tested upon agreement with the&#xD;
      investigators and the study sponsor. In addition, alternate dosing schedule cohorts of&#xD;
      OMP-54F28 (eg. every 4 week or every 6 week dosing) can be studied upon agreement with the&#xD;
      investigators and the study sponsor. These alternative less frequent dosing schedules may be&#xD;
      evaluated if emerging data suggest that once every 3 week dosing results in tolerability&#xD;
      concerns. The first 2 subjects enrolled in a cohort will not be treated on the same day. The&#xD;
      dose may be administered at any time during the day. Three subjects will be treated at each&#xD;
      dose level if no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed. If 1 of 3 subjects experiences&#xD;
      a DLT, that dose level will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 or more subjects experience a&#xD;
      DLT, no further subjects will be dosed at that level and 3 additional subjects will be added&#xD;
      to the preceding dose cohort unless 6 subjects have already been treated at that dose level.&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed for DLTs from Days 0-28. Dose escalation for newly enrolled&#xD;
      subjects, if appropriate, will occur after all subjects in a cohort have completed their Day&#xD;
      28 DLT assessment. Subjects who have a &gt;2-fold increase of their fasting β-CTX or a decline&#xD;
      of &gt;3% in their bone mineral density (BMD) from screening or a T-score decline to &lt;-2.5 in&#xD;
      the total femur or L1-L4 DEXA scan measurement will be started on zoledronic acid. Subjects&#xD;
      with stable disease or a response at Day 56 will be allowed to continue to receive OMP-54F28&#xD;
      until disease progression. An additional 6 subjects will be enrolled in an expansion cohort&#xD;
      at the highest dose level that results in &lt;2 of the 6 subjects experiencing a Grade 3 (not&#xD;
      including a Grade 3 infusion reaction that resolves in 24 hours) or Grade 4 adverse event&#xD;
      (DLT). Tumors of particular interest for inclusion in the expansion cohort include sarcomas,&#xD;
      basal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, desmoid tumors and prostate cancer given the known&#xD;
      importance of the Wnt pathway in these malignancies.&#xD;
