  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of HMB plus amino acids in older men with prostate cancer starting androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT). The investigators hypothesize that the use of this nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation will decrease the loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs when men start&#xD;
      ADT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that older patients experience age-related loss of muscle mass and&#xD;
      function (sarcopenia), presumably due to an imbalance of protein synthesis versus protein&#xD;
      breakdown. In addition, studies have shown that men who start on ADT experience increased&#xD;
      muscle protein breakdown and decreased synthesis. β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), a leucine&#xD;
      metabolite, has been shown to slow protein breakdown. When HMB is given with arginine and&#xD;
      lysine (which support protein synthesis) in randomized trials, researchers have shown that&#xD;
      elderly men and women who receive this nutritional supplementation experience improvement in&#xD;
      fat-free mass, strength, functionality and protein synthesis when compared with controls. In&#xD;
      addition, patients with advanced cancer who experienced weight loss of at least 5% have also&#xD;
      been shown to benefit from HMB, with supplementation resulting in a significant increase of&#xD;
      fat-free mass when compared to controls. Thus, it seems reasonable that older men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer starting on ADT who experience lean muscle loss as a result of aging and ADT,&#xD;
      may achieve some benefit from supplementation with HMB as well. Use of HMB in men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer has not been reported.&#xD;
