    <textblock>
      The goal of the Phase I part of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose of vemurafenib and Aldesleukin (interleukin-2) that can be given in combination with&#xD;
      interferon alfa-2b in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. The safety of this&#xD;
      combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Phase II is to learn if this study drug combination can help to control advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 4 groups of 6 participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the Phase I portion of the study and up to 53 participants will be enrolled in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of vemurafenib and aldesleukin you&#xD;
      receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose levels of vemurafenib and aldesleukin. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose of vemurafenib or aldesleukin than the group before it, if no intolerable side&#xD;
      effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable doses of vemurafenib and&#xD;
      aldesleukin are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive vemurafenib and aldesleukin at&#xD;
      the highest doses that were tolerated in the Phase I portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level interferon alfa-2b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take vemurafenib by mouth twice a day (1 time in the morning and 1 time in the&#xD;
      evening) every day of each study cycle. Vemurafenib can be taken with or without food. If you&#xD;
      miss a scheduled dose of vemurafenib, do not try to &quot;make up&quot; the dose by taking 2 doses at&#xD;
      the next scheduled dosing time. Continue taking the study drug as scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive aldesleukin by vein over 96 hours on Days 1-4 of each study cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To receive aldesleukin, you will have a central venous catheter (CVC) inserted, if you do not&#xD;
      already have one. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be place into a large vein while&#xD;
      you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more&#xD;
      detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive interferon alfa-2b as an injection under your skin on Days 1-5 of each study&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given other drugs to help lower the risk of side effects. The study staff will&#xD;
      tell you about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (+/- 3 days) of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may have&#xD;
           had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your skin will be checked for non-melanoma skin cancers on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (+/- 3 days) and&#xD;
      then every 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, some of this blood will be used to check your liver and kidney&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each cycle (Day 21), you will have a physical exam, including measurement of&#xD;
      your weight. Any tumor that can be felt with the hands will be measured with measuring tape&#xD;
      during the physical exam to see if it has changed size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 21 (+/- 7 days) of every 2 cycles, you will have a chest x-ray and a CT or MRI scan to&#xD;
      check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anytime the doctor thinks it is needed, photos of any skin lesions you have will be taken.&#xD;
      Your private areas will be covered (as much as possible), and a picture of your face will not&#xD;
      be taken unless there are lesions on your face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may take the study drug combination for as long as the doctor thinks you are benefitting.&#xD;
      You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable&#xD;
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days after you stop taking the study drug combination, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may have&#xD;
           had.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vBlood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â° If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT or MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Every 3 months for up to 3 years, you will be contacted by phone or during a clinic&#xD;
      visit to see how you are doing. The phone call should last about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Vemurafenib, interferon alfa-2b, and Aldesleukin are FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available to treat metastatic cancer. Giving these drugs in&#xD;
      combination is investigational. The study doctor will tell you how the study drugs are&#xD;
      designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 71 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             cutaneous lesion it must be at least 10 mm by caliper measure. If it is a visceral or&#xD;
             nodal or soft tissue lesion, it must be clearly measurable &gt; 20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan. Bone lesions are not considered measurable.&#xD;
&#xD;

             priority will be eligible. Phase II: the patient may have been treated with cytotoxic&#xD;
             drugs or targeted therapies for metastatic disease but not with IL-2, interferon and&#xD;
             BRAF inhibitor drugs. Adjuvant interferon will be permitted. Prior radiation therapy&#xD;
             for metastatic melanoma is permitted provided the patient has unirradiated metastatic&#xD;
             sites for response evaluation and has fully recovered from its toxicity. Prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy is permitted provided the patient has a 21 day wash out period and the&#xD;
             patient has fully recovered from its toxicity.&#xD;

             myocardial disease with corrected QT interval (QTC) interval &gt; 480 on baseline ECG or&#xD;
             history of rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females of child-bearing potential (non-childbearing is defined as greater than one&#xD;
