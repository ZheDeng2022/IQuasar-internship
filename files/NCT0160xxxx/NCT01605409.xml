  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest ist associated with a very poor prognosis. Even though resuscitation&#xD;
      algorithms and postcardiac arrest care have been improved there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      measures leading to a higher survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (ECPB - artificial heart and lung outside the patients body)&#xD;
      is a method which has shown good results in case reports and animal studies for cardiac&#xD;
      arrest care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed as comparison between the new treatment option of ECPB versus the&#xD;
      standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of our study is to determine the feasibility of ECPB installed in an emergency department&#xD;
      to improve the rate of patients restoration of spontaneous circulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Out of hospital cardiac arrest is associated with a poor prognosis. Overall&#xD;
      survival varies between 3% and 16% respectively. Measures to improve the chance of survival&#xD;
      are urgently needed. If return of spontaneous circulation under competent cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation (CPR) measures is not achieved within the first 25 minutes the chance of&#xD;
      survival decreases even further. Emergency Cardiopulmonary Bypass (ECPB) would be such a&#xD;
      treatment option for these heavily compromised patients, as it has shown considerably good&#xD;
      results used as resuscitation device for cardiac arrest in animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: This study will be performed as single center (university hospital)&#xD;
      randomized, controlled and prospective pilot study comprising a highly experienced emergency&#xD;
      department treating about 200 to 300 cardiac arrest patients a year. Two groups will be&#xD;
      analyzed, a 'Standard ACLS´ group and an 'ECPB´ group. Each group will comprise 20 patients.&#xD;
      Eligible are adult patients with witnessed out of hospital cardiac arrest, with presumed&#xD;
      cardiac cause and without return of spontaneous circulation after a minimum of 15 minutes of&#xD;
      advanced cardiac life support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the 'Standard ACLS´ group will be resuscitated until return of spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation or termination of efforts. The 'ECPB´ group will receive ongoing cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation during transport to the emergency department where ECPB will be installed.&#xD;
      Necessary diagnostic examinations and therapeutic interventions for both groups will be&#xD;
      performed according to guidelines for post resuscitation care and good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure is the rate of sustained restoration of spontaneous circulation&#xD;
      according to Utstein criteria. Secondary outcome measures are 24 hours survival, survival to&#xD;
      ICU discharge, survival to hospital discharge, rate of best neurological recovery (cerebral&#xD;
      performance category score 1 or 2) within 6 months after cardiac arrest and modified Rankin&#xD;
      score at 6 months after cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the 'Standard ACLS´ group receive standard treatment without any potential&#xD;
      additional risks. The 'ECPB´ group receives standard advanced cardiac life support as well&#xD;
      and has the predicted advantage of the extracorporeal oxygenation at the emergency department&#xD;
      and coronary intervention even before return of spontaneous circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study: To compare current standard therapy for patients after out of hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest (cardiopulmonary resuscitation until return of spontaneous circulation or&#xD;
      termination of efforts) with a new concept of transportation with ongoing cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      reanimation and installation of ECPB at the Emergency Department to improve survival.&#xD;

CPR during transportation will be performed by EMS personnel according to ERC guidelines.&#xD;
At the ED cannulation will be performed percutaneously if feasible. The femoral artery will be cannulated with a 17-19 - Fr and the femoral vein will be cannulated simultaneously with heparin coated 19-25 - Fr catheter or a smart cannula. An antegrade 8 - Fr cannula will be placed to supply perfusion for the cannulated leg if feasible. The procedures will be performed ultrasound-guided and the size of the cannulae will be adapted according to vessel size. Correct placement of the venous cannulae will be verified via ultrasound. Cardiopulmonary bypass will be performed by using the Lifebridge(Sorin®) or the Cardiohelp(Maquet®) ECMO device, according to protocol.</description>

Cannulae and tubing in use will be heparin coated. ECMO flow will be set to 70ml/kgBW/min. Anticoagulation will achieved with unfractionated heparin and monitored using ACT.</description>

Transportation:&#xD;
Transport will be initiated as soon as the patient achieves ROSC in the field and transportation is feasible. All patients will be admitted to the ED at the Vienna general hospital.&#xD;
Standard Post resuscitation Management:&#xD;
After admission to the ED post resuscitation care and standardized intensive care treatment will be provided according to Utstein protocol and current standards for good clinical practice and according to ILCOR recommendations. A crossover to the ECPB group is possible, if indicated by good clinical practice. If so, it will be counted as treatment failure in the standard ACLS group.&#xD;
If no ROSC can be achieved and the patient dies in the field pathological results will be obtained if feasible.</description>
