  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and potential effectiveness of a new&#xD;
      treatment for advanced and recurrent melanoma involving the combination of Ipilimumab and&#xD;
      IFN-α2b before surgery and to test for biomarker studies in blood and/or tumor to better&#xD;
      understand this disease, how best to treat it and what patients should be treated with this&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant therapy allows new insights into melanoma and its biological and immunologic&#xD;
      response to therapeutic interventions, such as ipilimumab. Neoadjuvant ipilimumab therapy for&#xD;
      high-risk melanoma patients with bulky regional stage IIIB-C lymphadenopathy may result in&#xD;
      improved clinical outcome in this group of patients that are more likely to respond to&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic interventions and without increased morbidity. Through the design of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant trials in which it is possible to obtain biopsy samples, a greater understanding&#xD;
      of the dynamic interaction between tumors and the immune system is possible. This should lead&#xD;
      to the identification of new targets for the treatment of melanoma and aid in the development&#xD;
      of new combinations that may have greater efficacy and acceptable toxicity, to build on the&#xD;
      clinical, immunologic, and molecular effect of this therapy for patients with melanoma.&#xD;
