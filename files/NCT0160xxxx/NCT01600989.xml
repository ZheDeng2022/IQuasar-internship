      Introduction: Evidence suggests that sepsis and septic shock severely impair mitochondria and&#xD;
      that the resulting mitochondrial dysfunction is related to the severity and outcome of the&#xD;
      resulting organ dysfunction. In sepsis mitochondrial abnormalities - biochemical and&#xD;
      ultrastructural - have been recognized in multiple organs, including liver, kidney, skeletal&#xD;
      and heart muscle tissue and blood cells. Circulating immune cells play an important role in&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of sepsis. Stimulation of the immune system alters the energy&#xD;
      requirements of immune cells; down-regulation of immune-cell activity has been associated&#xD;
      with prolonged sepsis and unfavourable outcome. The aim of the project is to comprehensively&#xD;
      investigate changes in mitochondrial function of immune cells in patients with severe sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock. The following main hypotheses will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe sepsis and septic shock leads to increased energy requirements of immune cells&#xD;
           and to an increase in mitochondrial enzyme activities and energy production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes of mitochondrial function in human immune cells are associated with alterations&#xD;
           in clinical and laboratory markers of severity of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prolonged sepsis and unfavourable outcome is associated with down regulation of&#xD;
           mitochondrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 30 adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe&#xD;
      sepsis or septic shock will be included in the study; 30 healthy volunteers serve as&#xD;
      controls. Patients with any type of chronic infectious, inflammatory or autoimmune diseases,&#xD;
      after transplantations or receiving immunosuppressive agents are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected baseline characteristics include patient demographics, diagnosis and severity of&#xD;
      illness scores at the time of admission. Daily collected follow up data include clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters of organ dysfunction, use of vasopressors/inotropes, use of&#xD;
      antibiotics, use of steroids and results of microbiological cultures/stains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative identification and isolation of monocytes, B cells and CD4 T cells will be performed&#xD;
      daily from ICU admission to discharge using an antibody-antigen mediated immunomagnetic cell&#xD;
      isolation procedure that depletes all blood cells except the specific target cells.&#xD;
      Mitochondrial function of immune cells will be assessed by measurement of mitochondrial&#xD;
      complex activity for complexes I to IV by a standard titration protocol. Additionally, the&#xD;
      levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α) will&#xD;
      be assessed throughout the stay in the ICU. For comparison mitochondrial function of of&#xD;
      monocytes, B cells and CD4 T cells and cytokine levels will be measured in a group of 10&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan: Changes in mitochondrial function of immune cells over time compared to a&#xD;
      healthy control group and during the course of severe sepsis and septic shock is the main&#xD;
      outcome parameter of this study. Assessed predictors are determined by the severity of the&#xD;
      underlying septic condition and include clinical and laboratory evidence for dysfunction of&#xD;
      vital organ systems and changes in levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that sepsis and septic shock severely impair mitochondria and that the&#xD;
      resulting mitochondrial dysfunction is related to the severity and outcome of the resulting&#xD;
      organ dysfunction. In sepsis mitochondrial abnormalities - biochemical and ultrastructural -&#xD;
      have been recognized in multiple organs, including liver, kidney, skeletal and heart muscle&#xD;
      tissue and blood cells. A systematic review on mitochondrial function assessed as oxygen&#xD;
      consumption, state 3 and state 4 respiration, respiratory enzyme activity, or tissue ATP&#xD;
      levels and turnover rates showed decreased function especially in sepsis models lasting more&#xD;
      than 16h . Depleted levels of reduced glutathione, an important intra-mitochondrial&#xD;
      antioxidant, in combination with increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and&#xD;
      reactive nitrogen species (RNS) inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation. This&#xD;
      acquired intrinsic derangement in cellular energy metabolism contributes to reduced&#xD;
      activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain enzyme complexes and impaired ATP&#xD;
      biosynthesis and contributes to the organ dysfunction in sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating immune cells play an important role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Stimulation&#xD;
      of the immune system alters the energy requirements of immune cells; down-regulation of&#xD;
      immune-cell activity has been associated with prolonged sepsis. Immune cell activation&#xD;
      mandates an increase in energy requirements, thus a reduced production of ATP due to impaired&#xD;
      mitochondrial function may be a factor in modulating the immune response in sepsis.&#xD;
      Alterations in mitochondrial function and energetic failure have been reported in peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells and seem to be associated with the modulation of the immune response&#xD;
      to sepsis. Macrophages incubated with endotoxin/interferon-γ show a decrease in oxygen&#xD;
      consumption and inhibition of mitochondrial I complex. Different mechanisms for alteration of&#xD;
      mitochondrial function in these cells have been proposed, including increases in NO&#xD;
      production and nitration of mitochondrial proteins [14], elevation of IL-10 [15] or&#xD;
      prostaglandin levels. In human neutrophils intact mitochondrial function plays an important&#xD;
      role in chemotaxis and phagocytosis, impairment of these mechanisms leads to a decreased&#xD;
      defence ability to microbial challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIF-1α is a transcription factor that acts as a key regulatory factor in the evolution of&#xD;
      oxygen homeostasis. Under normoxic conditions HIF-1α is continuously synthesized and degraded&#xD;
      after hydroxylation by dioxygenases that utilize oxygen, Fe and α-ketoglutarate as&#xD;
      substrates. During hypoxia, the low availability of oxygen limits the reaction; HIF-1α is no&#xD;
      longer degraded and rapidly accumulates and triggers the transcription of genes involved in&#xD;
      oxygen homeostasis such as glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters, vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF mediates also a&#xD;
      decrease in mRNA levels of the respiratory chain proteins, preparing the cell to produce ATP&#xD;
      mainly from glycolysis and not from oxidative phosphorylation, thereby optimizing cell&#xD;
      energetics and homeostasis for survival and function during hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent published reports have linked inflammation and endotoxin stimulation to HIF-1α&#xD;
      activation. HIF-1α has been shown to be up-regulated and stabilized in LPS-treated&#xD;
      macrophages and monocytes under normoxic conditions. HIF-1α levels were shown to be decreased&#xD;
      in macrophages deficient in TLR4 after LPS stimulation, suggesting that LPS stimulation of&#xD;
      HIF-1α is mediated by TLR4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on mitochondrial function of human immune cells in severe sepsis is limited and the&#xD;
      potential correlation of mitochondrial energy requirements and production and the severity of&#xD;
      the patient's condition and outcome are not well established. The immunologic reaction in the&#xD;
      context of severe sepsis and septic shock consists of an interdependent, highly complex&#xD;
      system that involves different types of immune cells and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      involved in a time-dependent process. Simple in-vitro studies assessing mitochondrial&#xD;
      function of a single type of immune cells and single cytokines just a one point in time&#xD;
      during the course of the septic process might not be an appropriate model to mirror the&#xD;
      complex interactions of the immune system. Serial measurements of mitochondrial function of&#xD;
      different key-player cells and specific pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis&#xD;
      markers parallel with other clinical and laboratory markers of sepsis may offer a more&#xD;
      in-depth evaluation and understanding of this deleterious disease pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to comprehensively investigate changes in mitochondrial function&#xD;
      and morphology of immune cells in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. We plan to&#xD;
      assess changes in mitochondrial function of monocytes, B cells and CD4+ T cells in&#xD;
      correlation to levels of various cytokines and to classic clinical and laboratory parameters&#xD;
      of severity of sepsis and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital&#xD;
      due to severe sepsis or septic shock will be included in the study after obtaining written&#xD;
      informed consent of the patient or the patient's next of kin. Patients with any type of&#xD;
      chronic infectious, inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, after transplantations or receiving&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls: 30 healthy volunteers Assessment of mitochondrial function of&#xD;
      monocytes/granulocytes will be performed by measurement of mitochondrial complex activity&#xD;
      using a standard titration protocol to measure activation of complex I to IV. To measure&#xD;
      serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF standard commercial kits will be used.&#xD;
