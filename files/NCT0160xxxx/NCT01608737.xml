      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different treatment regimens with BI 201335&#xD;
           (high dose given for 12 weeks or low dose given for 24 weeks both in combination with&#xD;
           Pegylated interferon-a and Ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) as compared to PegIFN/RBV alone in&#xD;
           treatment-naïve (TN) chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the efficacy and the safety of BI 201335 high dose given for 12 weeks in&#xD;
           combination with PegIFN/RBV given for 24 to 48 weeks as compared to PegIFN/RBV alone in&#xD;
           chronic GT-1 hepatitis C virus infected relapser patients who failed a prior PegIFN/RBV&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
