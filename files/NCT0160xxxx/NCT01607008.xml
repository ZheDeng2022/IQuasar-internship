    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is one of most common cancers in America, affecting 1 in 6 men. External beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy is one of the common methods to treat prostate cancer. Although&#xD;
      radiotherapy is effective, side effects to the adjacent normal organs limit the therapeutic&#xD;
      ratio. Those side effects are usually associated with the radiation damage of the normal&#xD;
      tissue surrounding prostate, e.g. bladder, urethra and rectum etc. Both effectiveness and the&#xD;
      side effects of radiation treatment are often accessed after whole course of radiotherapy,&#xD;
      which makes the early intervention difficult. The current research project is a feasibility&#xD;
      study of utilizing advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to access&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment response of prostate cancer during and right after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many advanced MRI techniques, e.g. spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted (DWI), dynamic&#xD;
      contrast enhanced (DCE) perfusion weighted images, have been used in radiology departments&#xD;
      for diagnostic purpose. This research project is to study the feasibility of using advanced&#xD;
      MRI sequences to monitor tissue response during and after radiotherapy. The tissue changes&#xD;
      revealed from MRI can provide physicians early information on possible tumor recurrence and&#xD;
      normal tissue toxicity, therefore, the early intervention may be possible to spare normal&#xD;
      tissue and cure the patient. The project is designed to combine several different advanced&#xD;
      MRI imaging techniques systematically to study tissue changes during radiotherapy, which has&#xD;
      not been seen elsewhere to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important goal of this research project is to study the feasibility of associating&#xD;
      functional MRI with radiation treatment dose distribution. Tissue response during radiation&#xD;
      treatment depends on dose. The functional MRI can provide more information than simple&#xD;
      anatomic information. Mapping the functional MRI spatially and associating them with 3D dose&#xD;
      distribution in radiation treatment planning system is one important step to quantitative&#xD;
      assess the relationship between radiation treatment and tissue changes due to the radiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and will undergo external beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be recruited in this study. Three MR scans of each patient under the study&#xD;
      will be performed at different time points. Each MR scan will include several advanced MR&#xD;
      imaging sequences (including but not limited to MR spectroscopy, diffusion and perfusion&#xD;
      imaging, which are used in routine clinical radiology settings) in addition to typical T1 and&#xD;
      T2 weighted MR imaging. The MR scans will be conducted at Radiation Oncology department with&#xD;
      the position similar to the treatment position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first MR scan will happen prior to the radiation treatment during the scheduled patient&#xD;
      simulation for baseline information. The T1- and T2-weighted MRI will be used for delineation&#xD;
      of prostate gland as a part of routine treatment planning process. Additional functional MR&#xD;
      (DWI/ADC. DCE, etc) images will be used as baseline of this study. The second MR scan with&#xD;
      the same sequences will happen in the mid course of radiation treatment. And the third MR&#xD;
      scan with the same sequences will happen at end of radiation treatment. Because the&#xD;
      participated patients will come to radiation oncology department daily for their routine&#xD;
      radiation treatment there will be no additional visits required for patients. The first scan&#xD;
      will happen during the same day when patients undergo CT and MRI simulation for treatment&#xD;
      planning as part of their standard cares. Two extra MRI scans will be performed as part of&#xD;
      this research protocol. The second and third scans will happen on one of treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is anticipated that the advanced MRI techniques will eventually play an important&#xD;
      role in the early intervention of radiation treatment and patient management of radiotherapy&#xD;
      of prostate cancer at JHH, no modification of the radiation treatment and patient management&#xD;
      will be based on the imaging information acquired during this feasibility study. All&#xD;
      participated patients will undergo the routine radiation treatment as all other prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients managed in our department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging data acquired will be systematically processed and analyzed along with&#xD;
      correlating to radiation treatment dose distribution. All MRI data from three different scans&#xD;
      need to be registered to each other and then register to planning CT. The anatomical,&#xD;
      functional changes of tumor and normal tissues during radiation treatment will be accessed&#xD;
      and correlated to radiation dose. After radiotherapy, all enrolled patients will be followed&#xD;
      up the same way as normal post treatment management. The short term or long term tumor&#xD;
      response and normal tissue side effects will also be collected under routine clinical follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following MRI based biomarker will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADC map&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dynamic contrast imaging (DCE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other MRI modalities as they are developed For example, tumor size measurement, MRI&#xD;
           parameters of choline peak in spectroscopy, ADC values, and DCE map, tumor and normal&#xD;
           tissue doses will be recorded for each scans. A multi-parametric analysis will be&#xD;
           performed to seek correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new software package will be developed to help overlay the functional MRI data on top of 3D&#xD;
      radiation dose distribution. The region of interests and the correlations between MRI data&#xD;
      and dose will be easier to identified using under the new software. Further detail&#xD;
      quantitative analysis can then be focused on those identified regions of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After first scan, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI data will be processed by iCAD&#xD;
           package to get pharmacokinetic parameters e.g. Ktrans and Ve.. A Ktrans vs Ve map will&#xD;
           be generated. All MRI data including T1, T2, ADC map, DEC map, spectroscopy will be&#xD;
           resampled to same resolution and registered to each other. The treatment target,&#xD;
           prostate in this case, along with surrounding normal organs (rectum, urethral and&#xD;
           bladder) will be delineated based on anatomical MRI images. Within prostate gland,&#xD;
           different part of regions, cancerous or healthy regions based on functional MRI will be&#xD;
           defined too.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second and third sets of MRI scan data will be processed the same way as the Step 1 and&#xD;
           registered to baseline scan. Same anatomical structures and same regions within prostate&#xD;
           will be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test Hypothesis one, the MRI signal from the second and third scan will be compared&#xD;
           to the baseline scan on each individual MRI sequence data and on combined all data in a&#xD;
           multiparametric approach.The signal changes within different organs and different&#xD;
           regions of prostate will be analyzed. A statistical significant (p&lt;0.05) signal&#xD;
           intensity changes within certain regions of interest can be defined as observation of&#xD;
           signal changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After kinetic and other MRI data analysis are done independently without the knowledge&#xD;
           of the radiation dose, all registered MRI data will be imported into radiation treatment&#xD;
           planning system. Some special software will be developed to change the some MRI data&#xD;
           format to a recognized format for planning system. Within the treatment planning system,&#xD;
           the MRI data will be co-registered to planning CT. The 3D dose distribution can then&#xD;
           overlap on MRI data. The dosimetric information like maximum dose, mean dose of each&#xD;
           organ or region of interest defined in previous steps will be calculated. The dose&#xD;
           parameters will be calculated from stationary planning CT. There is potential dose&#xD;
           uncertainty due to motion of prostate and rectum. However, given that external beam&#xD;
           radiotherapy of prostate usually lasts 6-8 weeks with many fractionated treatments and&#xD;
           image guided patient treatment ability in our clinic, the systematic organ motion is&#xD;
           very small. Besides, most of the literature data on dose dependent tumor control and&#xD;
           toxicity were derived from planning CT without considering organ motion. Therefore, we&#xD;
           will not consider the effect of organ motion and use the dose parameters from stationary&#xD;
           planning CT in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The correlation between the dosimetric parameters and the signal changes will be&#xD;
           analyzed to test the Hypothesis two.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Routine follow up data on tumor response (e.g PSA value) and normal tissue toxicity&#xD;
           assessment will be collected. Although with the limited sample size of this pilot study,&#xD;
           the direct link between MRI signal changes and treatment outcome may not be obtained.&#xD;
           Any information, trend gathered from the correlation can be used to design next phase&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
