      In this prospective study, the investigators will implement a systematic screening program&#xD;
      and 3-year follow-up in a cohort of asymptomatic BMPR2 mutation carriers. This study is&#xD;
      designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine predictive factors (biological, functional, radiological and hemodynamic) of&#xD;
           development of PAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  monitor these subjects' clinical, functional, biological, echocardiographic and&#xD;
           hemodynamic characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the risk of occurrence of PAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  screen patients with PAH at an early stage of disease and offer them an early management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  constitute a collection of biological samples (0, 12, 24 months follow-up) of&#xD;
           asymptomatic BMPR2 mutation carriers.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by remodeling of small pulmonary arteries&#xD;
      leading to a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance resulting to right heart&#xD;
      failure and ultimately death. The disease is diagnosed when symptomatic, demonstrating the&#xD;
      existence of an already advanced form of the disease. Indeed, there is no simple tool&#xD;
      allowing an early diagnosis of PAH and the disease is usually diagnosed in advanced stages.&#xD;
      Diagnostic confirmation of PAH is based on the elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressures&#xD;
      measured during right heart catheterization. Despite the development of specific treatment in&#xD;
      recent years, PAH remains a disease with poor prognosis, for which no cure is possible, apart&#xD;
      from lung transplantation in selected cases. However recent studies have shown that specific&#xD;
      drug therapy in early disease stages could improve the prognosis of this life threatening&#xD;
      disease. This is why it seems important to establish early diagnosis of PAH, especially in&#xD;
      high-risk populations such as asymptomatic carriers of BMPR2 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein&#xD;
      Receptor 2) mutations. PAH due to BMPR2 mutations is an autosomal dominant disease with&#xD;
      incomplete penetrance. Even if there are no accurate data in the literature, it is estimated&#xD;
      that 20% of patients with BMPR2 mutations develop PAH in the course of their life. The&#xD;
      implementation of a genetic counseling in the National Reference Center for Severe Pulmonary&#xD;
      Hypertension (BICETRE Hospital) allowed us to propose systematic assessment of BMPR2&#xD;
      mutations in patients with idiopathic or familial PAH. In 2012 we identified 130 PAH patients&#xD;
      carriers of a BMPR2 mutation. This approach has enabled the detection of families at risk for&#xD;
      PAH and to offer genetic counseling to the asymptomatic relatives with BMPR2 mutation.&#xD;
      However, data on the evolution of asymptomatic carriers of BMPR2 mutation are lacking.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is no available consensus or guideline on how to follow this population.&#xD;
      To date, it is not possible to differentiate asymptomatic subjects carrying BMPR2 mutations&#xD;
      that will develop PAH from those who will never develop this disease. However, given the high&#xD;
      risk of these subjects to develop PAH (risk of 20% against 25/million in the general&#xD;
      population), and the limited knowledge of characteristics of this population, it seems&#xD;
      essential to offer a prospective follow-up to this population at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study to is follow prospectively for 3 years a cohort of&#xD;
      asymptomatic carriers of BMPR2 mutation to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine predictive factors (biological, functional, radiological and hemodynamic) of&#xD;
           development of PAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  monitor these subjects' clinical, functional, biological, echocardiographic and&#xD;
           hemodynamic characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the risk of occurrence of PAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  screen patients with PAH at an early stage of disease and offer them an early management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  constitute a collection of biological samples (0, 12, 24 months follow-up) of&#xD;
           asymptomatic BMPR2 mutation carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of subjects at inclusion after informed consent (Ethics Committee approval&#xD;
      obtained since 2011):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical evaluation: dyspnea assessed by NYHA functional class (I-IV), signs of right&#xD;
           heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest radiograph, electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right heart catheterization (in a subset of volunteers): measurement of mean pulmonary&#xD;
           artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) and cardiac output (CO) at&#xD;
           rest and during exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography: measurement of the velocity of tricuspid regurgitation (VIT),&#xD;
           measurement of TAPSE and Tei index, pericardial effusion, dilatation and hypertrophy of&#xD;
           the right ventricle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress Test: VO2 peak and VO2 specific, VE minute ventilation, VD / VT dead space,&#xD;
           ventilatory reserve, alveolar-arterial gradient, pulse oxygen, PaO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function tests: measurement of DLCO and DLNO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measuring end systolic diastolic volumes of the right&#xD;
           ventricle, right ventricular mass, septal curvature, diameter of the pulmonary arteries,&#xD;
           surface of the right atrium&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biology: Determination of plasma NT-proBNP, uric acid, serum sodium, creatinine, PDGF,&#xD;
           ET-1, ET-3, CRPus, IL-6, soluble c-kit, CXCL12, progenitors and circulating fibrocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated as outpatients scheduled to the National Reference Center for&#xD;
      Severe Pulmonary Hypertension 12, 24 and 36 months after inclusion or if symptoms appear&#xD;
      (dyspnoea, right heart failure, malaise or syncope).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these consultations, the assessment will include: clinical evaluation, chest&#xD;
      radiograph, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, stress testing, pulmonary function tests,&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging, and biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm the suspicion of PAH and assess their severity, right heart catheterization at&#xD;
      rest and during exercise will be offered according to a decision algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right heart catheterization will be performed if one of the following abnormalities is found:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dyspnea, malaise or unexplained syncope&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tricuspid regurgitation velocity ≥ 2.8 m / s&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease of the specific peak VO2 ≥ 20% as compared to the gold standard&#xD;
&#xD;
      If diagnosis of PAH is confirmed, patients will be treated according to the recently updated&#xD;
      recommendations of the European Respiratory Society and European Society of Cardiology.&#xD;
