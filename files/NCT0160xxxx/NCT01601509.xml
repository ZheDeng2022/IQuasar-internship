      Nasal resistance presents considerable variations during night[8]. Additionally, Oral and&#xD;
      oro-nasal breathing epochs exhibit strong correlation with the number of apnoea/hypopnoeas&#xD;
      [7].The hypothesis that the present study aims to test is whether the pharmacological&#xD;
      prevention of increased nasal resistance during night could alter breathing route pattern and&#xD;
      lead to a decrease in the number of apnoea/hypopnoeas in OSA patients with normal nasal&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasal obstruction impairs sleep quality and may predispose to snoring and obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnoea (OSA) [1]. Indeed, in healthy subjects, experimental nasal occlusion has been shown to&#xD;
      elicit obstructive apnoeas [2]. Additionally, in patients with OSA nasal obstruction is&#xD;
      considered a risk factor for the development of OSA [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the relationship between nasal obstruction and OSA, the therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      improving nasal airway patency on OSA severity remains a point of conjecture [4]. In fact,&#xD;
      administration of intranasal corticosteroids has been shown to improve sleepiness and reduce&#xD;
      the apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) in patients with OSA and rhinitis [5], whereas in OSA&#xD;
      patients with nasal obstruction the use of topical decongestants, external nasal dilators and&#xD;
      nasal surgery has provided equivocal results [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present authors have demonstrated a strong correlation between apnoea-hypopnoea index and&#xD;
      oral/oro-nasal breathing epochs in patients with OSA and normal nasal resistance [7].&#xD;
      Additionally, Kohler et al [8] have shown that nasal resistance may increase during sleep&#xD;
      reflecting substantial variability. Therefore, it is plausible to hypothesize that OSA&#xD;
      patients presenting with normal nasal resistance when they are awake may demonstrate&#xD;
      increased nocturnal nasal resistance during sleep that may predispose to oral/oro-nasal&#xD;
      breathing and elicit apnoea/hypopnoeas. Prevention of nocturnal nasal obstruction in such OSA&#xD;
      patients may decrease oral/oro-nasal breathing and eventually be beneficial for OSA by&#xD;
      decreasing apnoea/hypopnoeas. Thus, the present study aims to investigate whether the&#xD;
      pharmacological prevention of nasal obstruction could alter breathing route pattern and lead&#xD;
      to a decrease in the number of apnoea/hypopnoeas in OSA patients with normal nasal&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include two nasal treatment options. Firstly, a combination of a nasal&#xD;
      decongestant (tramazoline) with a nasal corticosteroid (dexamethazone). Tramazoline&#xD;
      (imidazoline derivative) is a nasal decongestant, which attains its maximal effect between 30&#xD;
      and 210 min after application [9], while nasal dexamethasone can attenuate nasal inflammation&#xD;
      associated with OSA [10]. Secondly, sodium chloride (0.9% solution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA patients (AHI&gt;10 events/h) with normal nasal resistance measured in seated and supine&#xD;
      position with active anterior and posterior rhinomanometry (&lt;3.0 cmH20•L-1•s) will be&#xD;
      recruited. Exclusion criteria will be considered: 1) recent surgery involving the upper&#xD;
      airways, 2) central apnoeas more than three per hour or five percent of total apnoeas, 3)&#xD;
      total sleep time during polysomnographies less than three hours, 4) current treatment with&#xD;
      nasal decongestants and topical steroids, and 5) upper or lower respiratory tract disease,&#xD;
      including a history of nasal allergy, and 6) smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design will be used (Figure 1).&#xD;
      Every patient will undergo four assessments which will take place 24-48 hours after each&#xD;
      treatment arm. Every assessment will consist of an overnight polysomnography with concomitant&#xD;
      measurement of breathing route pattern (oral, nasal, oro-nasal breathing epochs) as&#xD;
      previously described [7], along with a nasal resistance measurement. After baseline&#xD;
      assessment and randomization patients of the first group will undergo a one-week therapy with&#xD;
      nasal tramazoline and dexamethazone, while the patients of the second group will undergo a&#xD;
      one-week therapy with nasal placebo (sodium chloride, 0.9% solution). The second assessment&#xD;
      will take place at the end of this one week regimen. A washout period of two weeks will&#xD;
      follow. Subsequently, the third assessment will take place and next the patients of the first&#xD;
      group will undergo a one-week therapy with nasal placebo (sodium chloride, 0.9% solution),&#xD;
      while the patients of the second group will undergo a one-week therapy with nasal tramazoline&#xD;
      and dexamethazone. Fourth assessment will then follow.&#xD;
