    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 in&#xD;
      treating older patients with advanced solid malignancies. Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The primary objective is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of AUY922 (Hsp90&#xD;
      inhibitor AUY922) as a single agent when administered intravenously (IV) on a once-weekly&#xD;
      schedule to adult patients 75 years of age or older with advanced solid tumors whose disease&#xD;
      has progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of treatment with AUY922. II. To characterize&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetic profiles of AUY922, including the parent drug and any potential&#xD;
      metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the efficacy of AUY922 in elderly patients with measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate of effect of geriatric-focused assessment of comorbidity and functional&#xD;
      status on the toxicity and response to AUY922.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the ethical constraints to enrollment of elderly patients in phase I trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the effect of therapy with AUY922 on the number of circulating tumor cells&#xD;
      (CTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess changes HSP70 induction as a measure of pharmacodynamic effect in pre- and&#xD;
      post-AUY922 samples in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) to explore age-related&#xD;
      differences in HSP90 inhibition by AUY922 compared with the previous phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess changes in cellular response markers of apoptosis in pre- and post-AUY922&#xD;
      dosing in peripheral blood including measurement of M30 and M65 to explore age-related&#xD;
      differences in pharmacodynamics compared to patients enrolled in the previous phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine associations between pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the relationship between geriatric-focused assessment of comorbidity and&#xD;
      functional ability and toxicity and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.&#xD;
