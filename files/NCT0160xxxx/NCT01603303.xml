  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used to try to stop breast cancer from forming or returning&#xD;
      after treatment in women who are in menopause and who had breast cancer that was sensitive to&#xD;
      the hormone estrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to learn if it is possible to prevent some AI side effects,&#xD;
      particularly problems with vaginal dryness and pain during sexual activity. Researchers also&#xD;
      want to compare 2 new vaginal moisturizers to see if using them regularly helps women avoid&#xD;
      vaginal dryness. Researchers want to see if preventing these side effects will decrease the&#xD;
      number of women who stop taking AIs due to the side effects they cause.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice)&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 study groups. You will have a 1 in 3 chance of being assigned to Group 1 and a 2&#xD;
      out of 3 chance of being assigned to Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women enrolled in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a set of 8 or 9 brief questionnaires at the start of the study and 6&#xD;
           and 12 months afterwards. The questionnaires should take about 45 to 50 minutes to fill&#xD;
           out each time. The questionnaires will be mailed to you with a postage paid return&#xD;
           envelope. They include questions about your background and medical history, any symptoms&#xD;
           that you may have while taking AIs such as hot flashes, muscle pain, and stiffness.&#xD;
           There are also questions about how much exercise you are getting, sexual function and&#xD;
           satisfaction, your satisfaction with the treatment you are receiving as part of this&#xD;
           study, and if you are continuing to take your AI medication and how often you are taking&#xD;
           it. If the study staff does not receive your questionnaires within 2 weeks of mailing&#xD;
           them, you will receive reminder phone calls once a week for up to 3 weeks unless you&#xD;
           tell the study staff that you are leaving the study. If you do not contact the study&#xD;
           staff or you do not mail in your questionnaires after 6 weeks, you will no longer be a&#xD;
           part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Along with your questionnaires, you will also be mailed a kit approved by the Food and&#xD;
           Drug Administration (FDA) to test your vaginal pH at home and will be provided a postage&#xD;
           paid return envelope to mail it back to the study doctor. The kit includes a small&#xD;
           plastic stick that you put into your vagina for a moment to test your vaginal fluid. The&#xD;
           end of the stick turns different colors, depending on the pH in your vagina. The vagina&#xD;
           becomes less acidic after menopause, which may increase the risk of vaginal infections.&#xD;
           Sometimes vaginal moisturizers can correct this problem by restoring a pH similar to&#xD;
           what it was before menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also receive a detailed written handout about ways to keep your bones stronger&#xD;
           during treatment with AIs and ways to prevent AI side effects such as muscle aches,&#xD;
           stiffness, sexual problems, and hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 women only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a password to use an interactive, internet-based website called&#xD;
           Tendrils: Sexual Renewal after Cancer (https://www.tendrilssexandcancer.com/) before,&#xD;
           during and after treatment with AIs. You will also be given a printed guide for the&#xD;
           website with a timeline for when you should read certain sections and suggestions for&#xD;
           trying some of the &quot;exercises&quot; to improve sexual communication, increase affection, and&#xD;
           prevent vaginal dryness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A counselor will also schedule times to call you for up to 30 minutes during Weeks 2, 4,&#xD;
           6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 of the study to ask how you are doing, if you have been&#xD;
           able to avoid side effects from the AIs, and if you need any help using the information&#xD;
           in your handout or the website. About 1 of 5 counseling phone calls will be&#xD;
           audio-recorded so that researchers can make sure the counselor is covering the topics&#xD;
           scheduled for each session. These recordings will usually only be heard by the&#xD;
           counselor, the Study Chair, and another MD Anderson faculty member (Andrea Bradford,&#xD;
           PhD) who will help with supervising and rating the counselor. Once a tape has been rated&#xD;
           (usually within one month of the counseling session), it will be erased. The tape may&#xD;
           also be reviewed by other health authorities or the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of&#xD;
           MD Anderson to check that the research is being done safely and correctly. If either of&#xD;
           these 2 groups review the tapes, the will be destroyed right after they are reviewed.&#xD;
           Tapes will only be labelled by your study number, but the counselor may call you by name&#xD;
           during the session. All information will be held in strict confidentiality by research&#xD;
           staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to get a 6-month supply of 1 of&#xD;
           2 vaginal moisturizers (Luvena or Hyalo-Gyn) to use 2 or 3 times a week. Researchers&#xD;
           want to know if one works better than the other for women on AIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a 6-month supply of a water-based vaginal lubricant to use during&#xD;
           sexual activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also be given a vaginal dilator, which is used to help women to relax their&#xD;
           pelvic floor muscles and to increase blood flow into the vaginal walls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All of the materials that you need for the study, including handouts, instructions on&#xD;
           using the web site, instructions on using the vaginal moisturizer, vaginal lubricant,&#xD;
           and vaginal dilator, as well as the supply of those products, will be mailed to you in a&#xD;
           study kit as soon as you complete your baseline questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of your questionnaires and other study records will be identified only with a study&#xD;
      number and will not include your name, address, or MD Anderson patient number. A list linking&#xD;
      your study number to your identity will be kept either in a locked file cabinet or encrypted&#xD;
      on a secure computer. Only the study chair and research staff will be able to see the list.&#xD;
      Once all data has been analyzed (May 2015 is the estimated date of completion), these lists&#xD;
      will be destroyed. Questionnaires or computer files that identify data only by study number&#xD;
      may be kept for up to 10 years to satisfy government rules for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active study participation will be over after you complete the questionnaires at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are not required to use the vaginal dilator, the moisturizer, or the lubricant in order&#xD;
      to take part in this study, but you will be asked if these products were helpful to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 168 women will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center or at MD Anderson Cooper Cancer Center.&#xD;
