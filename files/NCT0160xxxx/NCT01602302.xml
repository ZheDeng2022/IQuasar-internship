    <textblock>
      biological DMARDs may be stopped in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients treated with a&#xD;
      combination of synthetic DMARD plus bDMARDs which are in persistent clinical remission. The&#xD;
      research question of this study is, whether musculoskeletal sonography is a useful biomarker&#xD;
      predicting a disease flare after cessation of bDMARD therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory joint disease. It is usually&#xD;
      treated with synthetic and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Up to 35%&#xD;
      of patients can achieve clinical remission by the combination these therapies; however, there&#xD;
      is considerable uncertainty regarding the management of patients once this clinical state is&#xD;
      achieved. The discontinuation of biological agents in patients with persistent clinical&#xD;
      remission may be beneficial for the patients and the health care system reducing the risks of&#xD;
      long term adverse events and saving costs, respectively. Up to 60% of patients were reported&#xD;
      to flare after cessation of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) therapy despite&#xD;
      continuation of synthetic DMARDs and up to now there exist no validated biomarkers that&#xD;
      predict which patients will suffer a flare and which patients will remain in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonography is more and more used as a biomarker in RA. Subclinical inflammation was&#xD;
      previously associated with an increased risk for short term clinical relapse and structural&#xD;
      deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this prospective study is that ultrasound verified subclinical inflammation&#xD;
      at the time of bDMARD withdrawal predicts a disease flare at week 16. The investigators plan&#xD;
      to recruit RA-patients with persistent clinical remission according to SDAI and no current&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy. At baseline, bDMARD is stopped, synthetic DMARDs are continued.&#xD;
      Patients undergo 9 study visits within 52 weeks. Ultrasound examinations of 14 joints as well&#xD;
      as clinical and laboratory assessments with calculation of SDAI scores are performed at each&#xD;
      visit. Patients are considered to have a disease flare if disease status changes from&#xD;
      remission to active disease according to clinical scores. Patients with a flare of the&#xD;
      disease are excluded from the active phase of the study and are treated according to current&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
