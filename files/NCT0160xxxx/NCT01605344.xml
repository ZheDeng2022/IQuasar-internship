    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile of irinotecan and SN-38. To further evaluate the safety of atorvastatin in&#xD;
      combination with FOLFIRI. To further evaluate the safety and of irinotecan in combination&#xD;
      with atorvastatin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, crossover study to address the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic effects of atorvastatin on irinotecan metabolism in patients receiving their&#xD;
      first cycle of FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil + leucovorin + irinotecan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle of FOLFIRI is defined as 28 days, with a dose of FOLFIRI administered on day 1 and&#xD;
      day 15. Patients will be recruited from the UNC Lineberger Cancer Center, referred by their&#xD;
      primary oncologist for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). After obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent, the patient will be randomized to either ARM A or ARM B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected on day 1 and 15 of FOLFIRI prior to treatment with irinotecan&#xD;
      (baseline), immediately following the end of the irinotecan infusion, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, and 24 hours following the end of the irinotecan infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A subjects will receive atorvastatin 20 mg orally once daily given for two weeks starting&#xD;
      on Day -14 during PERIOD ONE. ARM A will then receive no statin during PERIOD TWO. Patients&#xD;
      will receive FOLFIRI infusion on day 1 and day 15. Blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline and periodically through 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B subjects will receive no atorvastatin during PERIOD ONE. ARM B subjects will receive&#xD;
      atorvastatin 20 mg orally once daily for two weeks during PERIOD TWO (starting on Day 2).&#xD;
      Patients will receive FOLFIRI infusion on day 1 and day 15. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      at baseline and periodically through 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA extraction and genetic analysis of UGT1A1 polymorphisms will be performed in&#xD;
      collaboration with Dr. Federico Innocenti and those patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28&#xD;
      allele will be excluded due to their altered irinotecan metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed until Day 1 of Cycle 2 of FOLFIRI. Patients removed from study for&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the&#xD;
      event(s).&#xD;
