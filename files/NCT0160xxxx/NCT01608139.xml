      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of curcumin, vorinostat, and sorafenib that can be given to patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin is the active ingredient in the spice, turmeric. It is a natural anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      compound and has shown anti-tumor activity in the laboratory and in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vorinostat is designed to cause chemical changes in different kinds of proteins that are&#xD;
      attached to DNA (the genetic material of cells), which may slow the growth of cancer cells or&#xD;
      cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib is designed to block the ability of important proteins to activate in cancer cells.&#xD;
      These proteins, when active, are in part responsible for the abnormal growth and behavior of&#xD;
      cancer cells. Blocking their activity may slow the growth of the cancer cells or cause the&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of the study drug combination (curcumin, vorinostat, and sorafenib) based on when you&#xD;
      joined this study. Up to 9 dose levels of the study drug combination will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level of the study drug&#xD;
      combination. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of the study&#xD;
      drug combination. Each new group will receive a higher dose of the study drug combination&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of the study drug combination that you receive may be lowered if you experience any&#xD;
      intolerable side effects. You will not receive any doses of the study drug combination higher&#xD;
      than the dose level that you are first assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, a study drug &quot;cycle&quot; is 28 days long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will begin taking curcumin 1 time daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 3 of Cycle 1, you will being taking vorinostat 1 time daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 5 of Cycle 1, you will begin taking sorafenib 1-2 times daily depending on&#xD;
      the dose level you are assigned to. From this day forward, you will continue to take the&#xD;
      study drug combination every day of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin is a powder that comes in a paper packet, and you will take it by mouth with a full&#xD;
      glass of water (8 oz.). Vorinostat and sorafenib are capsules that you will take by mouth.&#xD;
      Vorinostat should be taken with food. Sorafenib should be taken without food. The capsules&#xD;
      should be swallowed whole. You should not break, chew, or open the capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed within 7 days before the first dose of&#xD;
      the study drug combination (Day 1 of Cycle 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital&#xD;
           signs (blood pressure, breathing rate, heart rate, and temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (a performance status).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an echocardiogram (ECHO) to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon)&#xD;
           pregnancy test. In order to continue your participation in this study, the pregnancy&#xD;
           test must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week while you are receiving the study drug combination, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will&#xD;
      be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you begin each cycle, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every 2 cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or PET scan to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease. If the study doctor thinks it is more appropriate for you, additional types of&#xD;
           scans not listed in this consent form may need to be performed. The study doctor will&#xD;
           discuss these scans with you, and you may be asked to sign a separate consent form that&#xD;
           will explain the details and risks of those scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for as long as the study doctor thinks you are benefitting from the&#xD;
      study drugs. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, you experience&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, or the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of the study drug combination, you will come back to the&#xD;
      hospital for an end-of-study visit and the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or&#xD;
           PET scan to check the status of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is more&#xD;
           appropriate for you, additional types of scans not listed in this consent form may need&#xD;
           to be performed. The study doctor will discuss these scans with you, and you may be&#xD;
           asked to sign a separate consent form that will explain the details and risks of those&#xD;
           scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Curcumin is a commercially available substance, which is&#xD;
      commonly used as a food additive. Curcumin is not FDA approved for the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      solid cancer. At this time, curcumin is only being used in research. Vorinostat is FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma. Sorafenib is FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of liver and renal cancer. At this&#xD;
      time, the combination of curcumin, vorinostat, and sorafenib is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 96 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
