  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even with the benefits of HIV therapy, there is a possibility that HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      develop metabolic complications once they initiate treatment, which may also ultimately put&#xD;
      them at a risk for impending heart disease in the next decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main mechanism through which the main HIV drugs are thought to cause these metabolic&#xD;
      changes and organ toxicities is mitochondrial toxicity. Most of studies that have been done,&#xD;
      have taken place in the West, but few, if any, have been done in South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively identify early changes between the two&#xD;
      different drugs, Stavudine and Tenofovir, to assess their virological response, molecular,&#xD;
      biochemical and clinical picture, and the possible associated change in cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors, this, in the South African setting, and make recommendations to modify the current&#xD;
      National AIDS role out programme&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a major improvement in the survival of HIV-infected individuals with the role&#xD;
      out highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) in the public health sector by the South&#xD;
      African Government in 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the unparalleled benefits of HAART, there is an increasing recognition that adverse&#xD;
      events remain an important source of morbidity and even mortality. Knowledge of the adverse&#xD;
      effects of different therapeutic regimes and understanding genetic factors that modulate the&#xD;
      risk of toxicity, are important in the management of HIV/AIDS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two regimens offered in the public sector, these contain a triple drug course, with&#xD;
      either a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), a non-nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI). With adherence to treatment, it&#xD;
      is possible to convert HIV from a fatal infection to a chronic and manageable illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But, unfortunately, these therapeutic regimens are associated with the development of&#xD;
      metabolic complications, such as dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance. Occasionally frank&#xD;
      diabetes, and altered fat distribution, such as peripheral lipoatrophy and centripetal fat&#xD;
      accumulation. There is a growing concern that these complications may lead to an increase in&#xD;
      the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease in these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first regime which contains stavudine, which is a NRTI. It is cheap and easy to&#xD;
      administer in the short term but however is associated with more side effects, with&#xD;
      relatively higher rates of long term risks of lipoatrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. It is&#xD;
      also associated with an asymptomatic or a sometimes fatal lactic acidosis, it is also&#xD;
      associated with complications such as myopathies and pancreatitis. However, some studies have&#xD;
      suggested that reducing the d4T dose improves the toxicity profile while maintaining&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenofovir on the other hand, is a nucleotide analogue, it was approved in 2001 in the United&#xD;
      States, and it use has grown since its approval. It is commonly used in initial therapy. It&#xD;
      has shown to have a favourable lipid and mt DNA profile when compared to stavudine, but&#xD;
      however it had no difference in virological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical practice is moving increasingly towards the use of regimes that combine high levels&#xD;
      of tolerability and efficacy. HIV-infected individuals develop a pattern similar to that of&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome once they initiate treatment, ultimately putting them at a risk for&#xD;
      impending cardiovascular disease in the next decades. Most studies have been done in the&#xD;
      West, but there is no data on patients from third world countries including South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This purpose of this study is to prospectively identify differences between the two different&#xD;
      NRTIs, Stavudine, a nucleoside analogue (in different doses), and Tenofovir, a nucleotide&#xD;
      analogue, to assess their virological response, molecular, biochemical and clinical pictures,&#xD;
      and the possible associated change in cardiovascular risk factors, this, in the South African&#xD;
      setting, and make recommendations to modify the current National AIDS role out programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if there are any molecular differences (before and after starting&#xD;
           treatment) between the regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the biochemical differences (before and after starting treatment) between&#xD;
           the three regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine clinical differences in patients in all three arms of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the outcome of immune reconstitution by monitoring T-cell subsets changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine virological response by monitoring the viral load changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine which of the three treatment arms results in better adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine if there are any changes in cardiovascular risk factors after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a randomised controlled study comparing two NRTIs, a nucleoside analogue&#xD;
      Stavudine (standard dose, and low dose), and a nucleotide analogue Tenofovir, each combined&#xD;
      with Lamivudine and Efavirenz in HIV-infected treatment-naïve patients to be conducted&#xD;
      concurrently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the virologic response, molecular, biochemical and clinical&#xD;
      differences between all treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At entry, all participants will be enrolled into either Arm A, B or C after randomization.&#xD;

      participants had a minimum of four study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:90 participants randomized (1:1:1) to either Arm A (30 participants), Arm B (30&#xD;
      participants) and Arm C (30 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:HIV-infected, treatment-naïve patients, at least 18 years of age, with CD4+ cell&#xD;
      count &lt;200 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, participants will be randomized (as described above) to one of the following&#xD;
      treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;

          4. The following laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 750/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 7.0 g/dL&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of normal renal function within 45 days prior to study entry as determined by&#xD;
             an estimated creatinine clearance of ≥60 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
             {[140 - age (yr)] x [weight (kg)] ÷ [72 x serum Cr (mg/dL)]} (X 0.85 in females.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants of reproductive age (defined as girls who have reached menarche or women&#xD;
             who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e. who have&#xD;
             had menses within the preceding 24 months), or who have not undergone surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (e.g. hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingotomy) must have&#xD;
             a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 45 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants of reproductive potential, must be willing to abstain from participation&#xD;
             in a conception process (e.g. active attempt to become pregnant or in vitro&#xD;
             fertilization). If participants are sexual active, that could lead to pregnancy, they&#xD;
             must use at least one reliable form of contraception listed below while receiving&#xD;
             protocol-specified medications and for 6 weeks after stopping the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male or female condoms with or without a spermicidal agent (condoms are&#xD;
                  recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method&#xD;
                  effective for preventing HIV transmission).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide&#xD;

               -  IUD&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal-based contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Possible interactions of study drugs with estrogen-based contraceptives: LPV/RTV&#xD;
                  decrease plasma levels of ethinyl estradiol; therefore, estrogen-based&#xD;
                  contraceptives are not reliable for women receiving LPV/RTV and an alternative&#xD;
                  contraception method must be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Participants who are not of reproductive potential (girls who have not&#xD;
                  reached menarche, women who have been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive&#xD;
                  months) girls and women who are not participating in sexual activity that could&#xD;
                  lead to pregnancy, or women who have undergone surgical sterilization, (e.g.&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingotomy) are eligible without&#xD;
                  requiring the use of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability and willingness of participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Intent to remain in current geographical area of residence for the duration of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willingness to attend study visits as required by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Receipt of any antiretrovirals (including for purposes of occupational or sexual post&#xD;
             exposure prophylaxis), except for SD Nevirapine taken within six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of systemic cancer chemotherapy, systemic investigational agents, immunomodulators&#xD;
             (growth factors, systemic corticosteroids, HIV vaccines, immune globulin,&#xD;
             interleukins, interferons) or rifampin within 30 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Breastfeeding or pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Allergy to study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any condition, including active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until&#xD;
             participant either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, for at least 30 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Involuntary incarceration in a correctional facility, for legal reasons or in a&#xD;
             medical facility for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious&#xD;
             disease) illness.&#xD;
