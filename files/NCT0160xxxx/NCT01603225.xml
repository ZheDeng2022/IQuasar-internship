  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) can improve certain mental abilities, such as speech, language and other efforts at&#xD;
      communication in individuals with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research, battery powered device is used to deliver very weak electrical current to&#xD;
      the surface of the scalp while participants are involved in tasks aimed at training or&#xD;
      measuring communicative efforts, speech, language or related cognitive functions. Our aim is&#xD;
      to find out whether tDCS will improve these mental abilities.&#xD;

      Participants in the study will be asked to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grant permission for the researchers to view medical/psychological and/or educational&#xD;
           and/or speech records associated with the diagnosis of low-functioning autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a questionnaire and provide a health history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete evaluations by our study team to assess the diagnosis and gain a clearer&#xD;
           understanding of the participant's current functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give permission to audio and video-tape test sessions for later scoring and observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give permission to audio or video-tape in the classroom or home environment using&#xD;
           non-intrusive audio-visual recording devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete several tasks and training interventions that involve such things as learning&#xD;
           new words or pictures, saying words out loud, or naming objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in an eye tracking study while completing a task on the computer which&#xD;
           involves wearing a headband, attached by a velcro fastener, which contains a magnetic&#xD;
           sensor. This equipment allows us to track the position of the head in order to record&#xD;
           more accurate measurements. It is used with eye tracking equipment which measures the&#xD;
           gaze on a set point on a computer screen. The equipment poses no risk and is&#xD;
           non-invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in computerized tasks while monitoring brain responses that are a direct&#xD;
           result of a thought or perception. In order to monitor these responses, electrodes would&#xD;
           be placed over various points on your scalp. The electrodes will record the on-going&#xD;
           activity of the brain; it does not produce or introduce any electrical activity. The&#xD;
           equipment poses no risk and is non-invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wear electrodes that will be placed on the scalp with a large rubberized band. These&#xD;
           electrodes will administer very weak electrical current (tDCS) from a battery powered&#xD;
           device for 20 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental sessions will last about 1 hour and participants may be asked to have more&#xD;
      than one testing session in a day or to return for additional sessions.&#xD;

        The experimental group will consist of adults with autism (n=40). Participants will be&#xD;
        18-79 years of age, diagnosed with autism by independent clinicians and confirmed by formal&#xD;
        assessment (e.g., CDI, ADOS, Bayley, Sensory Profile), and with receptive and expressive&#xD;
        vocabulary levels of â‰¥ 3 years age-equivalent, as assessed by standardized measures.&#xD;
        Additionally, the Autism Diagnostic Interview will be administered to caregivers in order&#xD;
        to appropriately identify specific areas (regarding speech, language and cognition) in&#xD;
        which participants are experiencing the most difficulty.&#xD;
