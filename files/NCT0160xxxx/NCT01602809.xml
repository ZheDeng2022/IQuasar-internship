      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Small blood vessels (microvessels) in many different organs are affected by diseases such&#xD;
      as diabetes and atherosclerosis. These microvessels may also be abnormal in people who have&#xD;
      sickle cell disease. Stiffness of the red blood cells leads to problems in the microvessels&#xD;
      of the heart and kidneys. However, these problems may not be detected until these organs are&#xD;
      severely affected. Researchers want to study problems with microvessels in people with and&#xD;
      without sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how microvessels in the heart and other organs are affected by sickle cell&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have about 3 to 4 hours of testing for the study. Participants&#xD;
           with sickle cell disease who are having a pain crisis at the time they enter the study&#xD;
           may be asked to have the testing again when the crisis is over. The repeat testing will&#xD;
           occur at least 4 weeks after the pain crisis ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws to check kidney and liver function, and other blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure of blood flow in the brachial (upper arm) artery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound scans of arm muscles to study blood flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound scans after taking vasodilators to increase blood flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will also have a magnetic resonance imaging scan. It will show blood&#xD;
           flow in the heart. This scan will involve another dose of a vasodilator.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is the most common genetic disease affecting African-Americans. It is&#xD;
      characterized by an abnormal hemoglobin S, which polymerizes when deoxygenated leading to red&#xD;
      cell rigidity and microvascular flow obstruction. Recurrent episodes of ischemia and a&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory state lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury in multiple vital organ&#xD;
      systems. Endothelial dysfunction has been demonstrated in patients with sickle cell disease&#xD;
      and new therapies are targeted specifically towards the endothelium. Contrast ultrasound is a&#xD;
      non-invasive technique that has been used to assess microvascular flow in coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, diabetes, and other disease states. We propose to use this technique in sickle cell&#xD;
      patients to compare their myocardial and skeletal muscle flow with that of normal controls,&#xD;
      to detect changes during pain crisis, and to compare flow abnormalities with cardiac&#xD;
      functional abnormalities.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult subject age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For SCD groups, must have confirmed diagnosis of sickle cell disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Atrial fibrillation or other irregular rhythm that would preclude adequate image&#xD;
             acquisition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a contraindication for the ultrasound contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known obstructive coronary or peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SCD subjects at steady-state must not have acute pain crisis requiring intravenous&#xD;
             analgesics within the prior 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SCD subjects in crisis must be within 72 hours of hospital admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with contraindications to MRI scanning will complete all other procedures but&#xD;
             will not undergo the MRI scan. Subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
             of &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) will not receive gadolinium as per 2011 NHLBI gadolinium&#xD;
             administration policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a contraindication to regadenson&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that in the clinical opinion of the investigators renders study&#xD;
             procedures inadvisable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of acute chest syndrome is not an exclusion criteria for this protocol. Subjects&#xD;
        may be concurrently enrolled in any other protocols with the exception of investigational&#xD;
        new drug studies.&#xD;
