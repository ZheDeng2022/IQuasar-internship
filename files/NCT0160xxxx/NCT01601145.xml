      The aim of the present research protocol was to evaluate the effect of probiotics daily used,&#xD;
      on the plaque acidogenicity of children. The null hypothesis was that the plaque&#xD;
      acidogenicity would remain unchanged and not associate with the use of probiotics. Moreover,&#xD;
      the in situ study will be carried out to investigate the plaque formation as biofilm in&#xD;
      demineralised enamel specimens following the regular consumption of a probiotic product&#xD;
      compared to a control group. Metabolic of the biofilm formed on of the enamel specimens&#xD;
      resulting from the consumption will be evaluated over a period of 8 weeks.&#xD;

      Prior to the start of the study, demographic, ethnic and prognostic data will be collected&#xD;
      (screening phase). A medical history will be taken, with documentation of previous and&#xD;
      concomitant treatment and a clinical examination of the oral cavity (dental status, oral&#xD;
      mucosa) will be performed by the investigator. If the test subject meets all the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria without fulfilling any of the exclusion criteria, he/she will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      clinical trial and given a test subject identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All test subjects will receive a patient diary in the screening phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout phase I (1 week):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test subjects will use only the fluoride-containing toothpaste provided by the sponsor&#xD;
      for daily oral hygiene. A soft toothbrush will likewise be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test subjects will also receive a patient diary which will inform them that during the&#xD;
      treatment phase they may not use any fluoride containing oral hygiene products (tooth-paste,&#xD;
      mouthwashes, gels etc.) other than the study tooth-paste, drink any fluoride-containing&#xD;
      mineral water or black tea, or eat any fish meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase I (6 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following washout phase I, the test subjects start the first treatment phase. Plaque pH&#xD;
      measurements at 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are instructed about oral hygiene and about the consumption of the study&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase II (1 week after):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test subjects will use only the fluoride-containing toothpaste provided by the sponsor&#xD;
      for daily oral hygiene. A soft toothbrush will likewise be provided. Plaque pH measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MATERIALS AND METHODS 1.1 Clinical parameters DMFT index, gingival index&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Investigation of saliva factors Saliva factors pH and flow rate will be measured&#xD;
           during the screening phase on three days, each time in the morning. The mean of the&#xD;
           three measurements will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Dentobuff® test kit (Vivadent, Liechtenstein) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Teeth brushing technique Test subjects are required to clean their teeth three times&#xD;
           a day with the fluoride-containing toothpaste and a soft toothbrush. During that time, a&#xD;
           fresh, damp gauze (soaked in water) will be placed in the container each day in order to&#xD;
           provide a moist atmosphere for the appliances. The specimens should not be allowed to&#xD;
           dry out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The enamel specimens themselves are likewise carefully cleaned with the soft toothbrush&#xD;
           except the last day of every period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Randomization Using a computer program (Excel 2003 for Mac OsX), the randomization&#xD;
           will carried out on an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5 Application of the study product The subjects are not allowed to chew the lozenges.&#xD;
           They are allowed to swallow the lozenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.6 Plaque-pH evaluation At the end of each phase plaque acidogenicity will be assessed&#xD;
           using the MicroTouch technique after a previous sucrose challenge. Evaluations of pH&#xD;
           will be carried out at on each specimen. The pH will be measured in quintuplicate at 6&#xD;
           different time points: at baseline (before sucrose rinse) and 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min&#xD;
           after a 1-min rinse with 10 ml 10% sucrose, using active movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An iridium touch microelectrode (diameter 0.1 mm; Beetrode® NMPH-1, World Precision&#xD;
           Instruments, Sarasota, Fla., USA, with a porous glass reference electrode (MERE 1, World&#xD;
           Precision Instruments) will be used. A salt bridge will be created in a KCl (3 M)&#xD;
           solution between the reference electrode and a finger of the subject. Before each&#xD;
           session of pH evaluation, the electrode will be calibrated using buffer solution at pH&#xD;
           7.00 and 4.00.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 2.1 Planned Analysis Descriptive&#xD;
           summary statistics will be computed for all parameters documented in the case report&#xD;
           form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative parameters will be described by seven-point scales with mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, median, quartiles, minimum and maximum. Absolute and relative frequencies will be&#xD;
      given for qualitative variables. All descriptions will be done separately for treatment&#xD;
      groups and visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full statistical analysis including details such as methods of dealing with outliers,&#xD;
      missing values, data under prohibited concomitant medication, prohibited nutrition or other&#xD;
      possible irregularities will be fixed in a more detailed statistical analysis plan, which&#xD;
      will be updated during a blind review of the data before applying the randomisation code to&#xD;
      the data for the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure that the database accurately reflects the data reported in the CRF, a&#xD;
      double data entry procedure (data entered by different staff in two separate data files) will&#xD;
      be used. In addition to an electronic comparison of these two data files a validation of the&#xD;
      data will check ranges, consistency and plausibility. Unclear data will undergo a data&#xD;
      cleaning process (&quot;queries&quot;). Any changes applied to data in the database during data&#xD;
      cleaning will be recorded in a special log file. The database will be frozen on completion of&#xD;
      data cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate validated software (e.g. SAS, SPSS) will be used for the data processing and&#xD;
      statistical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmative statistical testing For confirmative statistical testing an analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) model will be used as a global test, including the treatment sequences as &quot;between&#xD;
      subject factors&quot; and the treatment conditions as &quot;within subject factors&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full analysis will be described in detail in a specific statistical analysis plan before&#xD;
      unblinding the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjustment of type I error due to multiple testing is not necessary due to a prior ordering&#xD;
      of the hypotheses. Hypothesis testing has to be stopped if a null-hypothesis may not be&#xD;
      rejected at the 5% error level α. This procedure maintains a constant global level of α = 5%.&#xD;
