    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of three&#xD;
      interventions on weight loss at 12 months. The investigators propose to test the impact of&#xD;
      integrating an effective automated Internet weight control program into primary care by&#xD;
      recruiting patients and randomizing them to one of three conditions: A) Brief physician&#xD;
      counseling plus usual care, B) Brief physician counseling plus referral and access to the&#xD;
      Internet weight control program and, C) Brief physician counseling plus referral and access&#xD;
      to the Internet weight control program plus brief follow-up email notes of support and&#xD;
      accountability from Primary Care Physicians. The investigators hypothesize that an online&#xD;
      program for weight control can be more effective by enhancing online follow-up with PCPs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year, roughly 700 of the 750 million visits that overweight and obese patients make&#xD;
      with primary care providers (PCPs) occur without any weight counseling. The main reasons for&#xD;
      this are that PCPs are poorly trained to help their patients lose weight and that there are&#xD;
      no consistently effective interventions for primary care settings. Though in-person and&#xD;
      telephone-based weight control programs have been difficult to disseminate in primary care,&#xD;
      online weight control programs are increasingly effective and may lend themselves to be used&#xD;
      in these settings. Given the growing number of effective online programs, for obesity and for&#xD;
      other conditions seen in primary care (e.g., depression, insomnia) it is important to&#xD;
      understand whether these programs can be effective when integrated into primary care and&#xD;
      whether they are enhanced by provider involvement. Research on the 5 A's model of primary&#xD;
      care behavior change suggests that the most effective, yet least used feature of primary care&#xD;
      interventions is arranging follow-up, where providers hold patients accountable to adhering&#xD;
      to treatments and achieving specific outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5 A's model provides a useful framework for integrating behavior change interventions&#xD;
      into primary care. In this model, providers ASK about weight, ADVISE patients to lose weight,&#xD;
      ASSESS readiness to change, ASSIST the patient in making changes and ARRANGE follow-up.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, though PCPs are uniquely positioned to ARRANGE follow-up, given their&#xD;
      long-term relationship with the patient, and studies show that ARRANGING follow-up may be the&#xD;
      most effective of the 5 A's, it is the least often used. In a study of 481 encounters with&#xD;
      overweight patients, Pollak (Consultant) and colleagues observed that PCPs ARRANGED follow-up&#xD;
      in only 5% of visits, though it was the only one of the 5 A's associated with future weight&#xD;
      loss. Kottke and colleagues similarly observed that primary care smoking cessation&#xD;
      interventions that included more &quot;reinforcing sessions&quot; with PCPs were the most effective.&#xD;
      This is consistent with conclusions by Whitlock and colleagues that &quot;Simply notifying&#xD;
      patients that follow-up will occur seems to be a powerful motivating factor&quot;. These findings&#xD;
      have been extended to online interventions, where two meta-analyses concluded that the impact&#xD;
      of online interventions for depression and anxiety is enhanced by follow-up that includes&#xD;
      being accountable to and supported by a human being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have created a simple method for integrating an Internet weight control&#xD;
      program into primary care settings, by allowing PCPs to monitor their patients' adherence and&#xD;
      outcomes and email them pre-written, tailored follow-up messages. PCPs in the investigators'&#xD;
      pilot work believed that this would help to overcome key barriers to helping their patients&#xD;
      lose weight.&#xD;
