  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) is a life-long, chronic condition affecting an individuals' ability to&#xD;
      regulate glucose levels in the blood. Diabetes can cause many severe complications if not&#xD;
      treated properly. Hyperglycemia is a regular effect of uncontrolled diabetes and can lead to&#xD;
      complications such as cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, diabetic retinopathy and&#xD;
      inability to maintain a healthy body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is now the leading cause of death worldwide, affecting millions&#xD;
      of people in both developed and non-developed countries. The buildup of cholesterol in the&#xD;
      bloodstream may cause the excess to be deposited in the coronary arteries of the heart and&#xD;
      the carotid arteries of the brain. The cholesterol deposits are a factor of the plaques that&#xD;
      cause blockage of the arteries which can in turn lead to heart disease and stroke. By&#xD;
      lowering the blood levels of cholesterol, risks of heart disease, strokes and heart attacks&#xD;
      are reduced. Medications such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates are useful in the&#xD;
      prevention of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pravastatin is a member of the drug class of statins, also known as HMG-CoA reductase&#xD;
      inhibitors, and is shown as an adjunctive therapy to diet. It is known to reduce the amount&#xD;
      of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood. In addition, pravastatin is indicated&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, revascularization and cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      in hypercholesterolemic patients who do not have clinically apparent coronary heart disease.&#xD;
      The recommended starting dose for adults is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not reach&#xD;
      the LDL-C goal with 40 mg, it is recommended to use an 80 mg dose. For persons with&#xD;
      significant renal impairment the recommended dose is 10 mg. Children aged 8-13 years have a&#xD;
      recommended starting dose of 20 mg daily. Adolescents aged 14 to 18 years have a recommended&#xD;
      starting dose of 40 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression is known as the most common mental disorder and most prevalent type of mood&#xD;
      disorder today. It can be seen as a state of mood, a symptom, a syndrome or as a clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis. Depression is a common disorder, affecting about 121 million people worldwide.&#xD;
      Depression is more likely to co-occur with medical illnesses such as stroke, heart disease,&#xD;
      cancer and diabetes. Up to one-quarter of people with diabetes are estimated to experience&#xD;
      depression which is two times more than those who do not suffer from diabetes. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that major depression mainly occurs in 2¬4 percent of people in the community, in 5-10&#xD;
      percent of primary care patients and 10-14 percent of medical inpatients. Also, recent&#xD;
      studies have estimated that the symptoms continue over a 6 month to one year period in&#xD;
      patients with major depression. The severity of the symptoms and the incidence of medical&#xD;
      illness are expected to predict the persistence of depression. Depression can be treated&#xD;
      effectively by a variety of antidepressants and/or psychotherapies. If treated appropriately,&#xD;
      over 80 percent of people who suffer from depression can be helped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paroxetine is an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)&#xD;
      antidepressant. It was the first antidepressant that was formally approved in the United&#xD;
      States for the treatment of panic attacks, major depression, post¬traumatic stress disorder,&#xD;
      social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
      disorder. Paroxetine has a well-established safety profile and it shares the common side&#xD;
      effects and contraindications of other SSRI's which include nausea and somnolence and is&#xD;
      associated with weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to conduct a retrospective cohort study to assess the risk of new onset&#xD;
      diabetes among patients undergoing treatment with Pravastatin or other statins, and&#xD;
      Paroxetine or other SSRI's. This study will compare the risk of co administration of two drug&#xD;
      classes versus the use of each agent alone. In addition, the risk among patients prescribed&#xD;
      Paroxetine and fibrates in combination, relative to the use of Paroxetine singly, will be&#xD;
      examined to determine whether any interaction found between Paroxetine and statins extends to&#xD;
      other drugs indicated for hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first primary objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes&#xD;
      (T2DM) among patients newly exposed to pravastatin in combination with paroxetine, or other&#xD;
      SSRIs, compared to those newly exposed to pravastatin alone. The second primary objective is&#xD;
      to estimate the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) among patients newly exposed to&#xD;
      paroxetine in combination with pravastatin, other statins, or fibrates, compared to those&#xD;
      newly exposed to paroxetine alone.&#xD;

        Data will be ascertained from the Thomson-Reuters Marketscan database, which contains&#xD;
        administrative healthcare data among an insured population in the US between 2000 and 2009.&#xD;
        The MarketScan® Databases capture person-specific clinical utilization, expenditures, and&#xD;
        enrollment across inpatient, outpatient, and prescription drug from a selection of large&#xD;
        employers, health plans, and government and public organizations (MarketScan Users manual).&#xD;
        The MarketScan Databases link paid claims and encounter data to detailed patient&#xD;
        information across sites and types of providers, and over time. The annual medical&#xD;
        databases include private sector health data from approximately 100 payers. Historically,&#xD;
        more than 500 million claim records are available in the MarketScan Databases. These data&#xD;
        represent the medical experience of insured employees and their dependents for active&#xD;
        employees, early retirees, COBRA continues and Medicare-eligible retirees with&#xD;
        employer-provided Medicare supplemental&#xD;
