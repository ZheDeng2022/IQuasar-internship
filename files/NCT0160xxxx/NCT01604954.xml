      Weight management is a critical issue in developed countries where the prevalence of obesity&#xD;
      is always increasing. While the mismatch of energy intake and energy expenditure is&#xD;
      recognized as a leading cause of obesity, knowledge related to the determinants of healthy&#xD;
      eating patterns are still an important issue to further address. Various nutrition-education&#xD;
      campaigns have been implemented as a way to increase knowledge about healthy foods and&#xD;
      facilitate the adoption of better eating behaviors. There is currently social and politic&#xD;
      pressure on health authorities to increase availability of nutrition information as a way to&#xD;
      tackle the obesity epidemic. Does nutrition information on food labels really contribute to&#xD;
      improving dietary intake among the population and to helping them to better manage their body&#xD;
      weight? Some evidence suggests that describing foods as healthy might have unintended&#xD;
      enhancement effects on the acute amount of food and calories consumed. A better understanding&#xD;
      of how and why nutrient and calorie labels influence acute and chronic intake is thus needed.&#xD;
      This study investigate how providing nutritional information on food labels influences intake&#xD;
      and eating-related variables over a 10-day period among women characterized by varying levels&#xD;
      of adiposity. As it has never been investigated before, the present research will provide&#xD;
      important knowledge on the long-term impacts of different food labeling strategies on the&#xD;
      regulation of food intake. It will also help to determine whether weight status could&#xD;
      influence the effects of perceptions about foods on intake, so that the investigators can&#xD;
      identify individuals who mostly tend to overeat in specific situations. Consumer advocacy&#xD;
      organizations are urging government to adopt policies regarding food labeling. Such research&#xD;
      is thus of great relevance for the promotion of healthy body weight at the population level,&#xD;
      as it will clearly contribute to assess how food labels should be used by health governing&#xD;
      bodies in the context of the obesity epidemic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Much effort has been invested to educate Canadians about the importance of healthy eating and&#xD;
      active living. Various food labeling strategies are currently used (e.g. nutrient-content&#xD;
      claims approved by Health Canada), or strongly suggested (e.g. calorie information on&#xD;
      restaurant menus), as tools to increase knowledge about healthy food choices and to help&#xD;
      consumers make more so-called healthier choices. Does nutrition information on food labels&#xD;
      really contribute to improve dietary intakes among the population? Some evidence does suggest&#xD;
      that food labeling could influence consumer's choices and purchases. But, consumers remain&#xD;
      confused about what healthy eating should be, and about how many calories they should be&#xD;
      eating per day. Data suggest that only 50% of them truly understand and use food labels.&#xD;
      Results regarding the impact of food labeling on intake are less convincing. We have recently&#xD;
      shown that perceiving a snack food as healthy increased intake of that food by 35% in female&#xD;
      students. Health halos promoted by nutrition information may lead consumers to draw&#xD;
      misleading inferences from food labels. Considering current public pressure on health&#xD;
      authorities to increased availability of nutrition information as a way to attack the obesity&#xD;
      epidemic, long-term impact of food labeling strategies on food intake regulation represents a&#xD;
      critical key issue that have not been yet investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of the present research proposal is to investigate how providing&#xD;
      nutritional information on food labels influences intake and eating-related variables over a&#xD;
      10-day period among women. We will more specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the impact of 1) nutrient quality and 2) calorie content food labels vs. &quot;no&#xD;
           label&quot; condition on mean ad libitum intake and appetite sensations before/after meals&#xD;
           over a 10-day period in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine how body weight (normal versus obesity) influences the impact of the nutrient&#xD;
           quality and calorie content food labels on mean ad libitum intake and appetite&#xD;
           sensations over a 10-day period in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Verify whether types of food labels influence attitudes towards meals offered (i.e.&#xD;
           perceived healthiness, appropriateness, palatability) over a 10-day period in women.&#xD;
