  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that some painkillers (NSAID drugs) slow bone healing but the knowledge is&#xD;
      based only on experimental studies with animals whose results are automatically translated&#xD;
      for humans. The purpose is to examine whether these drugs slow bone healing and what&#xD;
      relationship there is between different bone examinations, scan for osteoporosis, bone marker&#xD;
      laboratory tests, radiological controls and histology of newly formed bone under a&#xD;
      microscope.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most popular painkillers in the world is known as NSAID (non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs). Many studies with animals have been made which show a clear&#xD;
      tendency for delayed bone healing by taking NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that an early intake of NSAIDs prevents ectopic ossification in patients,&#xD;
      receiving total hip prosthesis. However, cases of prosthetic loosening and instability after&#xD;
      10 years were almost exclusively observed in the group of patients who received NSAIDs&#xD;
      postoperatively. However, very few clinical studies still show this tendency. In this study&#xD;
      we include patients with fresh fracture in the wrist; Colles fracture. The fracture may seem&#xD;
      unstable when there is a lack of bone healing. These fractures are very common in the&#xD;
      orthopaedic clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is no dislocation of the fragments, newly formed bone can be weaker as&#xD;
      demonstrated by DEXA scanning (bone mineral density measurement). Histological examination of&#xD;
      the healing bone can give a definitive answer whether the bone was affected or not. Thus, the&#xD;
      possibilities of studying NSAIDs affect on bone healing in humans and the clinical&#xD;
      significance are very positive.&#xD;
