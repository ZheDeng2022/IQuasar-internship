  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to assess the effect of a range of single oral doses of YF476&#xD;
      on pentagastrin-induced gastric acid output in healthy volunteers&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for the study was as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the pre-clinical studies, the original target disease for YF476 was&#xD;
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), not only because of the excellent anti-secretory&#xD;
      activity of YF476 but also because of its potential for increasing gastric emptying. But loss&#xD;
      of the anti-secretory effect of YF476 in healthy subjects after repeated dosing excludes its&#xD;
      use as an anti-secretory agent in patients with GORD. However, there is some evidence from&#xD;
      within our repeated-dose studies in healthy subjects that gastrin receptors are blocked&#xD;
      despite loss of the anti-secretory activity of YF476. Further evidence that repeated doses of&#xD;
      YF476 cause sustained blockade of gastrin receptors comes from several types of study in&#xD;
      animals. First, in the 13-week toxicology studies, all dose levels of YF476 reduced the ECL&#xD;
      population, unlike other anti-secretory agents, histamine H2-antagonists and proton-pump&#xD;
      inhibitors, which increase the ECL population. Second, YF476 at doses of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg&#xD;
      subcutaneously twice daily for 14 days in rats abolished the increase in gastric output&#xD;
      induced by pentagastrin on Days 1, 7 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol describes a study in healthy subjects using inhibition of pentagastrin-induced&#xD;
      gastric acid output as a surrogate marker of efficacy of YF476. Pentagastrin has been used&#xD;
      for many years to test gastric function in healthy subjects and patients. Intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of 0.6 micrograms/kg/hour is a submaximal and well-tolerated dose.&#xD;
