  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about what is the best treatment to prevent blood clots in&#xD;
      patients in intensive care units (ICU's). The investigators know that patients who are in&#xD;
      ICU's have a higher than normal risk of getting blood clots in the veins of their arms or&#xD;
      legs. This can be very dangerous as the clot may move into the lungs. To prevent this, the&#xD;
      standard treatment is to give low dose heparin subcutaneously 3 times a day (usually 5000&#xD;
      units at each dose). In this study the investigators are randomizing patients to receive&#xD;
      either standard of care or low dose intravenous heparin in a continuous infusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Macro- and micro-thrombosis both contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      surgical intensive care unit. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and preventable cause of&#xD;
      death in critically ill patients, with a mortality rate of up to 10%. Up to 95% of cases of&#xD;
      PE originate from deep venous thrombosis (DVT). There are multiple pharmacologic and&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic methods of DVT prophylaxis.The current standard of care in&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at the University of Colorado&#xD;
      Hospital is low-dose subcutaneous heparin (SCH). However, there is little evidence that this&#xD;
      is the optimal prophylactic treatment. In fact, a database search of ICD-9 diagnoses made in&#xD;
      2005 suggests that the incidence of DVT in SICU patients, the majority who receive&#xD;
      subcutaneous heparin, is approximately 7%. Surgical ICU patients are at high risk of&#xD;
      developing DVT during their hospital stay and likely need more aggressive anticoagulation.&#xD;
      Intravenous heparin, given at a low dose and titrated to a measurable endpoint PTT (partial&#xD;
      thromboplastin time), may offer several benefits over the current standard of care,&#xD;
      subcutaneous heparin. This method of treatment would offer more aggressive anticoagulation&#xD;
      and allow dosage to be adjusted frequently based on each patient's changing coagulation&#xD;
      status.&#xD;

    <description>In the first 70 patients, screening for DVT by ultrasound will occur on study days 0 and 5. After day 5 and for all remaining subjects, DVT will be diagnosed according to standard of care by the attending physician. Incidences of new DVT will be recorded daily until the patient is discharged from the hospital, or for a maximum of 28 days. DVT diagnosis will also be collected at 6 months from the primary care physician's office or the patient's household.</description>

          <description>Treatment: titrated to a PTT of 40-45. low dose intravenous heparin (LDIVH): The LDIVH (experimental) group will receive a continuous heparin drip titrated to a prothrombin time (PTT) of 40-45. LDIVH subjects will have PTT tested within 24 hours prior to initiation of LDIVH. In addition, these subjects would continue to have a PTT tested every 6 hours until the PTT value falls between 40-45. All LDIVH subjects will have PTT values measured at least daily. This will continue until ICU discharge or a maximum of 28 days.&#xD;
