  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the present study is to evaluate cryoablation(cooling of the tissue) as&#xD;
      standard therapy of common atrial flutter,focusing on efficacy, feasibility, procedure time,&#xD;
      and patient content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cryoablation, performed only by operators&#xD;
      experienced in cryothermic ablation is effective and safe in the treatment of atrial flutter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial flutter (AFL), a common atrial tachyarrhythmia may cause significant symptoms and&#xD;
      serious adverse effects including embolic stroke, myocardial ischemia and congestive heart&#xD;
      failure. Currently, radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)&#xD;
      is considered first-line therapy for treatment of CTI-dependent AFL. However, RF ablation of&#xD;
      the CTI is associated with significant pain during lesion delivery. Furthermore, RF ablation&#xD;
      can potentially injure cardiac structures adjacent to the CTI such as the AV node, tricuspid&#xD;
      valve and right coronary artery. RF ablation can also lead to steam pops, cardiac tamponade&#xD;
      and fatal complications have also been reported in association with CTI-ablation. Ablation&#xD;
      using cryothermal energy (Cryo) has several potential advantages over RF ablation including&#xD;
      greater catheter stability due to adherence to myocardial tissue during applications, reduced&#xD;
      risk of thrombus formation, systemic embolization, and lower risk of myocardial perforation&#xD;
      due to preservation of tissue architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have in a prospective randomized, single centre study (CRAFT) investigated&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of RF versus Cryo for atrial flutter, and showed that cryoablation is as&#xD;
      effective as RF ablation in the short and long term. The patients perceived significantly&#xD;
      less pain and required significantly lower doses of analgesia and sedation during&#xD;
      cryoablation compared to RF ablation. The study was powered for non-inferiority with 75&#xD;
      patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study is to expand the findings from the CRAFT study in a larger&#xD;
      cohort of patients, letting only operators experienced in cryothermic CTI ablation use Cryo&#xD;
      as standard therapy focusing on efficacy, feasibility, procedure time, and patient content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform an ablation within the study, the electrophysiologist must have a previous&#xD;
      experience of a minimum of 25 cryoablations of atrial flutter.&#xD;
