      In Phase I (N=40), we developed a treatment protocol for smoking cessation and relapse&#xD;
      prevention that used virtual quit-smoking Twitter groups and Twitter-enabled interactive peer&#xD;
      messaging. We tested and refined this protocol using two quit-smoking Twitter groups. In&#xD;
      Phase II (N=160), we conducted a two-arm (test vs. control) randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      the treatment protocol created in Phase I. In Phase III (N=80) we ran additional quit-smoking&#xD;
      Twitter groups and tested various interventions to increase engagement in the intervention,&#xD;
      e.g., peer leaders. This research provided crucial data about the viability and methodology&#xD;
      to be used in a larger randomized controlled trial that would directly measure smoking&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Smoking relapse rates remain high, innovative strategies are needed to lower them, and&#xD;
      web-based social networking may help like Twitter. This developmental research examined&#xD;
      whether providing virtual (web-based) social support to smokers, through Twitter-enabled&#xD;
      interactive peer texting, could help smokers quit and avoid relapses. Twitter is a free&#xD;
      social networking and micro-blogging service, one of the most advanced and novel technologies&#xD;
      available today that can provide social support to smokers, and it provides free texting to&#xD;
      groups. It is global and has many features that are associated with treatment success&#xD;
      including interactive, multi-way, live messaging and mobile accessibility, because the&#xD;
      messages go instantly to mobile phones and to the web. It can provide an innovative way to&#xD;
      reach smokers who might otherwise not seek treatment, and it can be extended to other health&#xD;
      domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II which took place from June 2012 through 2013, we conducted a two-condition&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (Aim 2). All participants in this trial (N=160) received 8 weeks&#xD;
      of free nicotine patches, referral to the NCI's online Smokefree.gov Quit Guide, and&#xD;
      instruction to set a quit date within 1 week of study start. Participants were also randomly&#xD;
      assigned at the individual level to one of two conditions: (1) a virtual quit-smoking Twitter&#xD;
      group condition where the group members were instructed to use Twitter-enabled interactive&#xD;
      peer messaging to help them quit and stay quit, or (2) a control group condition where the&#xD;
      group members were not given this instruction or a Twitter group. In total, there were 4&#xD;
      Twitter groups and 4 control groups with 20 smokers randomly assigned to each group (i.e.,&#xD;
      N=80 test, N=80 control). The primary outcome was self-reported 7-day point prevalence&#xD;
      abstinence that was sustained at 7, 30 and 60 days after the quit date. Participants' tweets,&#xD;
      their virtual and face-to-face social networks, and several other possible mediating and&#xD;
      moderating variables were also analyzed.&#xD;
