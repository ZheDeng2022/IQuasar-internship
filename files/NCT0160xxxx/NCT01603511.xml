      The study will compare the rewarming effectiveness of heat donation through the head or the&#xD;
      torso during rewarming of mildly hypothermic subjects. Warming will be accomplished through&#xD;
      either forced-air warming or using a charcoal heater; both units are commonly used for&#xD;
      warming. The investigators hypothesize that head warming will be as, or more, effective&#xD;
      compared to&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dr. Gordon Giesbrecht is studying/comparing the effectiveness of heat donation through the&#xD;
      head or the torso in rewarming a mildly hypothermic individual. A rigid forced-air warming&#xD;
      cover for the head or the torso will be used to rewarm the hypothermic individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to participate in three experimental trials, separated by at least 48&#xD;
      hours. Each trial will last about 4 hours (1 hour for setup, 1 hour for cooling, and 2 hours&#xD;
      for rewarming and removal of instrumentation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each of the three trials, subjects will undergo immersion to the level of the sternal&#xD;
      notch in a tank of 8˚C water for up to 60 minutes. They will then exit the water, be dried&#xD;
      off and lie in a hooded sleeping bag with the head inside the hood where one of the three&#xD;
      warming procedures will be administered for 60 minutes or until core temperature returns to&#xD;
      normal values ( ̴ 36.5-37˚C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Spontaneous rewarming (Shivering Only) - In this control condition, no external heat will&#xD;
      be provided and you will rewarm spontaneously with the heat produced from shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Head Warming (Head): Either of these rewarming methods will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forced-Air Warming to the Head (FAW-H) - A modified rigid forced-air warming cover will&#xD;
           be placed over your head. Warm air ( ̴43˚C) will blow into the cover through an inlet on&#xD;
           top of the cover and will escape from the bottom of the cover. You will be breathing&#xD;
           warm air (̴ 43˚C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Charcoal Heater to the Head (CH-H) - A charcoal heater will be placed on right side of&#xD;
           your face/head with ducts wrapping around the dorsum of the head, anteriorly over the&#xD;
           forehead, nose, chin and the neck, not covering the eyes or the mouth. You will be&#xD;
           breathing ambient air (̴ 22˚C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Torso Warming - Either of these rewarming methods will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forced-Air Warming to the Torso (FAW-T) - A specially designed portable rigid forced-air&#xD;
           cover (PORIFAC) will be placed over your torso and the upper thighs. Warm air (̴ 43˚C)&#xD;
           will blow into the cover through an inlet above the abdomen and will escape from the&#xD;
           bottom of the cover. Participant will be breathing ambient air (̴ 22˚C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Charcoal Heater to the Torso (CH-T) - The charcoal heater will be placed on your&#xD;
           anterior chest with a towel in between. The flexible ducts will be applied to the areas&#xD;
           of high heat transfer i.e. over the shoulders, neck, and then anteriorly under the&#xD;
           axillae to cross over the lower anterior chest. You will be breathing ambient air at&#xD;
           room temperature (~22˚C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 60 minutes of warming, subjects will be placed in a warm water bath (40-42˚C) until&#xD;
      they are comfortable and core temperature returns to normal values (̴ 36.5-37˚C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures include rate of core cooling, afterdrop amount, rate of rewarming, skin heat&#xD;
      flux, oxygen consumption and shivering intensity.&#xD;
