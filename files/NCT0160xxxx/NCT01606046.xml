      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of vapocoolant spray and topical&#xD;
      lidocaine 2.5% + prilocaine 2.5% cream (EMLA) on reducing pain during needle&#xD;
      electromyography.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was conducted on patients with patients that underwent needle EMGs in the lower&#xD;
      extremity between July and August 2011 at the university hospital. The patients were divided&#xD;
      into a total of three groups by random assignment: a control group that did not receive&#xD;
      pretreatment, a group that received ethyl chloride vapocoolant spray and a group that&#xD;
      received topical anesthetic cream (EMLA cream®).The patients with spray group, they were&#xD;
      sprayed with ethyl chloride vapocoolant spray for 5 seconds from a distance of 30 cm just&#xD;
      before the needle EMG, and patients with EMLA cream, they received an application of topical&#xD;
      anesthetic cream on the needle electrode insertion site 60 minutes before the needle EMG. The&#xD;
      37-mm monopolar needle electrode was vertically inserted into the medial head of the&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscle in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the degree of pain for each group, patients were asked to indicate their level of&#xD;
      pain on a 100 mm VAS (0, no pain; 100, worst intolerable pain) after the needle EMG in the&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both experimental groups, a 5-point Likert scale was used to evaluate patient satisfaction&#xD;
      with the pain reduction method used and their willingness to use the same analgesic method in&#xD;
      another EMG.&#xD;
