      The investigators aim to assess the procedure time and miss rate of polyps when performing&#xD;
      polypectomy in the colon on the way up* and down** or only on the way down**.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (* advancing the scope to the cecum, ** pulling back the scope after intubation of the&#xD;
      cecum). Our hypothesis is that using the strategy to remove all visible polyps firstly on the&#xD;
      way up and secondly on the way down is less time consuming and misses less polyps as with the&#xD;
      strategy to remove polyps only on the way down.&#xD;

      Patients with a referral for a complete colonoscopy were included in the study. Polyps were&#xD;
      removed upon insertion and withdrawal of the colonoscope in Group A or only upon withdrawal&#xD;
      of the instrument in Group B according to a computer-generated randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following inclusion criteria were used: referral for a complete colonoscopy and age of 18&#xD;
      years and older. All patients with polyps detected during colonoscopy were included. In order&#xD;
      to compare the time required for the entire endoscopy between the two treatment groups, we&#xD;
      only included patients with polyps of up to 10 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exclusion criteria were applied: colonoscopy due to bleeding, high likelihood&#xD;
      of colonic stenosis or severe inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hereditary&#xD;
      colonic polyp disease (FAP or HNPCC), contraindications for polypectomy, such as&#xD;
      coagulopathy, use of anti-clotting medication (anticoagulation, high-dose heparin aspirin,&#xD;
      NSAIDs), polyps &gt;10 mm in diameter (that cannot be removed through the biopsy channel and&#xD;
      have to be removed by basket or polyp grasper; the use of these devices necessitates removal&#xD;
      and consecutive re-insertion of the endoscope, making a comparison of the time intervals&#xD;
      between the two groups impossible), suboptimal bowel preparation (presence of significant&#xD;
      amounts of fecal remnants that could not be removed by flushing of the colon over the&#xD;
      colonoscope and that did not allow clear visualization of the mucosa), and missing signed&#xD;
      informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization was done as soon as the first polyp was detected. When no polyps were&#xD;
      detected, the case was regarded as screening failure and excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed into the following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Removal of all visible polyps upon insertion and withdrawal of the instrument Group&#xD;
      B: Removal of all visible polyps upon withdrawal of the colonoscope only One day after&#xD;
      colonoscopy, patients were asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating the tolerance of the&#xD;
      ileo-colonoscopy (on a visual scale from 1 to 4 where 1 stands for no discomfort, 2 for minor&#xD;
      discomfort, 3 for moderate discomfort, and 4 for severe discomfort associated with the&#xD;
      endoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colon preparation was performed using 3 liters of PEG-based standard lavage fluids (Fordtran&#xD;
      Streuli Â®, Streuli Pharma, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures were performed by senior endoscopists (SW, SRV, HF, NW, PB) with at least 5&#xD;
      years of experience in colonoscopy and performing at least 200 colonoscopies per year. All&#xD;
      endoscopists participating in this trial underwent a specific study training headed by SW.&#xD;
      Polyp size was measured using an opened biopsy forceps (Boston Scientific Radial JawTM 4,&#xD;
      Reference No 1332, diameter of opened jaws 9mm). All endoscopists had comparable numbers of&#xD;
      procedures in both approaches to polypectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication consisted mostly of propofol (60-400 mg) or a combination of midazolam (2.5-5&#xD;
      mg) and/or meperidine (25-50 mg) intravenously. Examinations were performed in left lateral&#xD;
      decubitus or supine position. Colonic insufflation was performed with room air. All&#xD;
      polypectomies in the study groups were performed using the same techniques as in the standard&#xD;
      care of non-study patients, using snare loops, hot biopsy forceps, with and without&#xD;
      submucosal injection of saline/epinephrine. Polyps larger than 3 mm were removed by snare,&#xD;
      polyps smaller than 4 mm were removed by cold biopsy. There were no differences upon&#xD;
      insertion or withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group A, the endoscopist removed all visible polyps instantly regardless whether advancing&#xD;
      the instrument to the cecum or pulling back. In Group B, the endoscopist advanced the&#xD;
      endoscope to the cecum without removing polyps. Upon withdrawal, all visible polyps were&#xD;
      removed successively by standard techniques. In both groups, the endoscopists were instructed&#xD;
      to focus on rapid introduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments After the endoscopy, the physician completed the data capture sheet evaluating&#xD;
      the following criteria: patient demographics, patient history, time intervals required for&#xD;
      the procedure, number of polyps detected upon insertion, number of polyps removed upon&#xD;
      insertion, number of polyps removed upon withdrawal, overall technical ease (score from 1 to&#xD;
      4 where 1 stands for no technical problems, 2 for minor, 3 for moderate, and 4 for major&#xD;
      technical difficulties), presence of technical problems (difficult visualization of the&#xD;
      polyps, difficult removal of polyps, and difficult retrieval of polyps, all answered&#xD;
      categorically with &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;), patient tolerance (completed by patients), and&#xD;
      characterization of every polyp (location, size, time of removal and additional comments).&#xD;
