  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim is a retrospective chart review seeking to determine any differences in the main&#xD;
      clinical and outcome variables as well as general outcome data such as functional recovery,&#xD;
      readmission rates, somatic growth and mortality. An n size of 150 to 200 for each of the 2&#xD;
      groups will give us excellent power to detect potential differences.&#xD;

      The Fontan procedure is indicated as final-stage treatment for pediatric cardiac patients&#xD;
      with single ventricle physiology. This procedure, whose aim is to provide for total&#xD;
      cavopulmonary disconnect and perfusion of the pulmonary arteries via systemic veins, is&#xD;
      performed via two differing techniques: intra-atrial, so-called lateral tunnel technique,&#xD;
      employing PTFE graft material and internal atrial baffle, versus the extracardiac technique,&#xD;
      using larger PTFE tubing and externally constructed baffle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is persistent debate regarding the optimal technique to use, centered around the&#xD;
      following main issues: 1) need for use of cardiopulmonary bypass and attendant consequences,&#xD;
      2) rates of thrombosis and embolism, 3) incidence of postoperative protein-losing enteropathy&#xD;
      (PLE), 4) incidence of arrhythmias, and 5) baffle patency rates. A handful of small- to&#xD;
      medium-sized studies has addressed the above issues, but, importantly, has not used patient&#xD;
      data from the same institution. Here at CHOA, there are an estimated 200+ lateral tunnel, and&#xD;
      have been up to 125 to 150 extracardiac Fontan procedures, performed in the last 15 years&#xD;
      (1.1.1980-3.31.2005). Data from these cases would be potentially very helpful in answering&#xD;
      all of these questions.&#xD;
