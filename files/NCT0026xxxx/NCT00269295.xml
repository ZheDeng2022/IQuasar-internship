    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a new vaccine for typhoid fever is&#xD;
      safe and effective. This study will also look at what effects (good and bad) this new&#xD;
      vaccine, Ty800, has on the volunteers. The study will determine the highest dose of Ty800&#xD;
      that can be given without causing severe side effects. About 54 healthy males and females,&#xD;
      ages 18-45 inclusive, in the Cincinnati metropolitan area will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      They will be in the study for approximately 7 months, which includes a one month screening&#xD;
      period, study product administration on Day 0, a 10-day hospital stay, an outpatient period&#xD;
      on Days 9-28 with 4 follow-up visits, and safety follow-up phone calls at 2 and 6 months&#xD;
      after hospital discharge. Researchers hope that this trial will help produce a vaccine that&#xD;
      combines a high level of durable protective immunity with simplicity of administration and&#xD;
      minimal reaction to the vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever is a generalized infection of the reticuloendothelial system (spleen, liver,&#xD;
      and bone marrow), gut-associated lymphoid tissue and gall bladder caused by Salmonella&#xD;
      enterica serovar Typhi (S typhi). Humans are the only known natural host and reservoir for S&#xD;
      typhi. Typhoid bacilli are transmitted by the fecal-oral route by contaminated drinking water&#xD;
      or food. The ideal typhoid vaccine would combine high levels of durable protective immunity&#xD;
      with simplicity of administration and minimal reactogenicity. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety of Ty800 oral typhoid vaccine when administered as a single&#xD;
      dose over a range of doses (5 x 10^7, 5 x 10^8, and 5 x 10^9 cfu) in healthy adult subjects&#xD;
      compared to placebo. The primary endpoint is safety of Ty800 at the dose levels administered&#xD;
      compared to placebo as determined by absence of bacteremia, absence of the diagnosis of&#xD;
      typhoid fever as confirmed by a positive blood culture for the Ty800 vaccine organism, and by&#xD;
      verifying that the null phoP/phoQ phenotype is retained by the isolated shed vaccine&#xD;
      organism. Safety variables will be assessed by the reported incidence of adverse events (AE),&#xD;
      blood cultures, and changes in vital signs, physical examination, and routine laboratory&#xD;
      parameters over time at each vaccine dose level compared to placebo. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      of this study are: to evaluate the immunogenicity of a single oral dose administration of&#xD;
      Ty800 over a range of doses in healthy adult subjects; to evaluate the Ty800 vaccine dose&#xD;
      response by comparing the immunogenicity profiles of each dose level; and to evaluate the&#xD;
      shedding profile of Ty800 by determining the quantity and duration of shedding for each dose&#xD;
      level. The tertiary objectives of this study include: evaluating, in a substudy, single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes, e.g., IL-8 and interferon gamma, that may&#xD;
      influence the immune response or persistent shedding of the vaccine organism and evaluating&#xD;
      the induction of memory B cells in the vaccinated subjects. This study is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation, inpatient phase I/II clinical trial. Three&#xD;
      dose levels of Ty800 a vaccine will be evaluated and compared to placebo. Prior to&#xD;
      randomization and administration of study vaccine, subjects will undergo screening&#xD;
      evaluations. Healthy subjects meeting study eligibility criteria will be admitted to an&#xD;
      inpatient facility with appropriate isolation containment the day prior to randomization, and&#xD;
      they will remain in the unit for approximately 10 consecutive days. Three cohorts of 18&#xD;
      volunteers, representing 3 escalating doses of Ty800 typhoid vaccine will be challenged. In&#xD;
      each cohort, 12 volunteers will receive Ty800 as a single oral dose, and 6 volunteers will&#xD;
      receive placebo. Dose escalation will occur in a stepwise fashion and will be dependent upon&#xD;
      the assessment of safety parameters and by meeting criteria for advancement to the next dose.&#xD;
      Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 7 months.&#xD;
