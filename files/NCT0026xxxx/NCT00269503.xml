  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is a major cause of disability in the United States. The lifetime prevalence of low&#xD;
      back pain is estimated at 60-90%. Back pain has conservatively been estimated to involve&#xD;
      total direct and indirect costs of over $25 billion annually in lost wages, treatment, and&#xD;
      related issues. These losses clearly extend to the active duty population cared for by&#xD;
      military health care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chiropractic medicine is characterized by the use of a number of physical manipulations and&#xD;
      mobilization techniques, which can be used singly or in combination to treat a variety of&#xD;
      medical conditions. Although basic clinical practice guidelines for Chiropractic have been&#xD;
      developed, few studies have rigorously compared techniques and their outcomes for specific&#xD;
      conditions. Fewer still have sought to correlate treatment modality with both anatomical&#xD;
      effect and clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the military, Chiropractic care is available only to active duty personnel and&#xD;
      only at a limited number of medical treatment facilities. At National Naval Medical Center,&#xD;
      it is a well-established treatment option, where the full array of techniques is employed,&#xD;
      primarily for painful conditions, and most often for back pain. This study seeks to clarify&#xD;
      the mechanisms of action and efficacy of one specific treatment option, prone distraction,&#xD;
      for the relief of subacute sciatica due to radiographically confirmed herniated disc, and to&#xD;
      compare it to side-posture manipulation and standard medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prone lumbar distraction utilizes a specialized table with motorized continual motion&#xD;
      distraction. This table has multiple mechanical articulations that can be used to place&#xD;
      patients in a wide variety of positions. Patients being treated with continuous motion&#xD;
      distraction are placed prone with the table positioned for maximum comfort and centralization&#xD;
      of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side posture manipulation is a widely practiced, standard chiropractic technique, which has&#xD;
      been shown to provide considerable clinical improvement for patients with sciatica. Low-&#xD;
      grade oscillatory stresses are performed within the physiological range of normal joint&#xD;
      motion. The hip, pelvis and lumbar spine are rotated forward with manual pressure while a&#xD;
      counter rotation of the chest and thoracic spine is applied.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active Duty military personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18-45 (age is limited to 45 years due to the natural aging and degeneration of&#xD;
             the discs; the less hydration the disc maintain, the less likely manipulation will be&#xD;
             successful).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have subacute low back pain (more than three months duration but less than six months&#xD;
             duration), with radicular component (sciatica) rated at a minimum level of 4 on the&#xD;
             Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of the Brief Pain Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a confirmed herniated disc, as noted on MRI, which correlates with the clinical&#xD;
             findings (sciatica)&#xD;
&#xD;
        In this study, a &quot;herniated disc&quot; refers to any localized displacement of disc material,&#xD;
        including nucleus, cartilage, fragmented apophyseal bone, or fragmented anular tissue,&#xD;
        which results in back and leg pain. &quot;Herniated Disc&quot; also will include disc extrusions and&#xD;
        disc bulges (protrusions) only when with associated annular tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In this study, &quot;sciatica&quot; refers to pain in the lower extremity/ies that follows the course&#xD;
        of the sciatic nerve&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a primary bone disease, cancer, infection, spondylolysis or&#xD;
             spondylolisthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior spine surgery, including rhizotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another conflicting research study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot commit to a trial lasting up to eight weeks or cannot come for&#xD;
             bi-weekly treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are going through a course of physical therapy or chiropractic treatment&#xD;
             or at the time of planned enrollment or are being currently being managed and/or&#xD;
             treated for any pain condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have an unstable medical or psychiatric condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are planning or have been advised to have spine surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindications to either prone distraction or side posture manipulation will&#xD;
             disqualify potential subjects from any participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a pacemaker.&#xD;
