  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are conducting a research study on a&#xD;
      Chinese herbal medicine known as &quot;Jin Fu Kang&quot;. We want to see if this can help patients with&#xD;
      advanced lung cancer. Jin Fu Kang might reduce the growth of cancer or improve quality of&#xD;
      life. You are eligible for this trial because your cancer has progressed after prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy and your doctor has recommended further chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer that has been confirmed and that has spread is called advanced cancer. There is&#xD;
      no known permanent cure for advanced lung cancer, but chemotherapy may temporarily shrink the&#xD;
      cancer and improve the quality of patients' lives.&#xD;

      Jin Fu Kang is a herbal medicine specially developed in China for the treatment of lung&#xD;
      cancer. It is based on a traditional medicine that is widely used and appears to be safe.&#xD;
      Although clinical trials in China suggest that Jin Fu Kang may be of benefit, it has never&#xD;
      been researched in patients with lung cancer in the United States. As such, its risks and&#xD;
      benefits are not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific aims are to determine the toxicity of Jin Fu Kang/docetaxel combination&#xD;
      treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, to determine whether Jin Fu Kang&#xD;
      alters the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and to provide preliminary efficacy and survival&#xD;
      data for Jin Fu Kang/docetaxel combination treatment in patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
