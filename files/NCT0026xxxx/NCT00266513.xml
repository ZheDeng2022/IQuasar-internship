      This study investigates gene abnormalities in Primary Immune Deficiency(PID) with a goal of&#xD;
      improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific disorders include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. X linked hyper IgM Syndrome which is caused by an abnormality in the CD40L gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NEMO associated immune deficiency which is caused by an abnormality in a gene called&#xD;
           NEMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) which has an unknown genetic basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other disorders of immunoglobulin production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Better characterize the clinical features of CD40 L deficiency and NEMO associated&#xD;
           immune deficiency and other related primary immune deficiency syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the frequency of CD40 L and Nemo abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine whether particular abnormalities in these genes are associated with more of&#xD;
           less severe illness or with specific symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore the basic mechanism by which these altered genes cause immune dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identify other genes causing low immune globulin levels and related primary immune&#xD;
           deficient states.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to study the genetics and pathophysiology of Hyper-IgM syndrome,&#xD;
      NEMO associated immune deficiency, patients with related primary immune deficiency disorders,&#xD;
      and the blood relatives of immunodeficient patients. Patients will undergo evaluations that&#xD;
      include history/physical, blood sampling, genetic testing, and possible tissue sampling.&#xD;
      Among the aims of this protocol are to better understand genetic factors that lead to defects&#xD;
      in host defense, and to use modern and evolving methods in molecular and cellular biology to&#xD;
      elucidate the pathogenesis of these diseases. A better understanding of primary&#xD;
      immunodeficiency could allow for the rational development of novel therapies for such&#xD;
      diseases and to benefit future patients, but it might not benefit current patients directly.&#xD;
      Routine follow-up may occur every six months - with evaluation and blood sampling. Under some&#xD;
      circumstances, we may provide treatment that relates to the immune deficiency. These&#xD;
      treatments will follow standard medical practice.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must have a known or suspected immune defect with hyper-IgM syndrome and/or&#xD;
        disorders of immunoglobulin production. There will be no limit on age, sex, race, or&#xD;
        disability. Normal volunteers must be healthy adults between the age of 18 and 70 years.&#xD;
        All study participants enrolled on to this study must agree to allow PI to store research&#xD;
        samples. Refusal to let PI store samples may lead to withdrawal fro this specific study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of an acquired abnormality, which leads to immune defects, such as HIV,&#xD;
        chemotherapy, and malignancy are general exclusion criteria. Refusal to let us store&#xD;
        samples may lead to withdrawal from this specific study. Other factors, which are in the&#xD;
        judgment of the Principal Investigator PI that may interfere with patient evaluation or&#xD;
        determine to pose an added risk for study participants are also criteria for exclusion.&#xD;
