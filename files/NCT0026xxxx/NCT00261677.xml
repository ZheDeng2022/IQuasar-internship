  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of once- weekly dosing&#xD;
      of PROCRITÂ® (a glycoprotein that stimulates red blood cell production) versus placebo in the&#xD;
      treatment of anemia in children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, and to assess its effect&#xD;
      on the quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROCRIT® (epoetin alfa) is an analogue of erythropoetin, a hormone secreted by kidneys known&#xD;
      to stimulate red blood cell production. PROCRIT® is approved to be given three times per week&#xD;
      to treat anemia in adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Once per week dosing in&#xD;
      adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy is investigational and is not approved by the&#xD;
      FDA. The use of PROCRIT® in children with cancer is investigational and is not approved by&#xD;
      the FDA. (Please note: Since completion of this study, once weekly dosing on PROCRIT® in&#xD;
      adult cancer patients was approved by FDA in June 2004 and use of PROCRIT® in children with&#xD;
      cancer was approved by FDA in October 2005). The use of PROCRIT® to improve quality of life&#xD;
      is investigational and not approved by the FDA. This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly&#xD;
      dosing of PROCRIT® or placebo on anemia in children with cancer undergoing myelosuppressive&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and to assess its effect on the quality of life. Patients are randomized into a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to receive either PROCRIT® or placebo administered intravenously. Randomization is&#xD;
      stratified by cancer type, with one stratum for children diagnosed with a malignant solid&#xD;
      tumor or Hodgkin's Disease, and the second stratum for children diagnosed with Acute&#xD;
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). The initial dose of study&#xD;
      medication is 600 Units/kg for a maximum dose of 40,000 Units intravenously (IV) weekly, or&#xD;
      placebo, up to 16 weeks. The study medication is adjusted to 900 Units/kg, for a maximum dose&#xD;
      of 60,000 Units IV weekly, if the hemoglobin does not increase by at least 1 g/dL by Study&#xD;
      Week 4/5. Patients were seen and evaluated based on the patient's scheduled chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen. Patients who received chemotherapy weekly, every two weeks, or every four weeks&#xD;
      (4-week group), scheduled study visits occurred every four weeks. The study investigated&#xD;
      effectiveness of once weekly dosing of PROCRIT® on anemia and quality of life in children&#xD;
      with cancer undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The primary measure of effectiveness is&#xD;
      the change in the patient-reported Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL Inventory)&#xD;
      from baseline to the last assessment. Other measures of effectiveness include differences in&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels, transfusion requirements, and quality of life outcomes. Safety is assessed&#xD;
      by comparing the incidence and severity of adverse experiences in the PROCRIT® group versus&#xD;
      the placebo group. Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, iron profile, and serum chemistry),&#xD;
      physical examinations, and vital sign measurements are also assessed. 600 to 900 Units/kg&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) of either PROCRIT® or placebo. Initial dose is 600 Units/kg (maximum dose&#xD;
      40,000 Units IV weekly) up to 16 weeks. If the hemoglobin does not increase by &gt;= 1 g/dL at&#xD;
      Week 4/5, dose is adjusted to 900 Units/kg (maximum dose 60,000 Units IV weekly).&#xD;
