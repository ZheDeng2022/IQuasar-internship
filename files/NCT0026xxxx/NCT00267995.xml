      The Ross procedure has become the surgery of choice for aortic valve replacement in children.&#xD;
      This consists of taking a child's own pulmonary valve (the autograft) and replacing the&#xD;
      child's diseased aortic valve with the autograft. At times, this can involve either enlarging&#xD;
      or reducing the diameter of the aortic annulus to make the valve fit properly. The patient's&#xD;
      own pulmonary valve is then replaced, most typically with a human heart valve (a homograft).&#xD;
      There has been some concern in the literature that as time goes on, the autograft will dilate&#xD;
      and the patient will develop progressive aortic insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1994, we have performed almost 50 Ross procedures in children and young adults.&#xD;
      Contrary to many reports from the literature, we have not recognized a problem with autograft&#xD;
      enlargement and progressive aortic insufficiency. One thing that we have done differently&#xD;
      from other centers is that we have modified the insertion technique of the autograft into the&#xD;
      native aortic root. This involves a second buttressing suture layer. Not only does this have&#xD;
      the immediate effect of reducing bleeding complications, we postulate that it has the&#xD;
      long-term effect of stabilizing the autograft and preventing aortic root dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that this proximal buttressing technique for the Ross procedure has a two-fold&#xD;
      benefit. Firstly, it reduces the amount of bleeding in the postoperative period. Secondly, it&#xD;
      prevents late autograft root dilatation.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective chart review examining our experience with the Ross procedure. There&#xD;
      will be a treatment and control group. The treatment group will be children who have had the&#xD;
      Ross procedure with the proximal buttressing technique. The control or comparisons group&#xD;
      would be Ross procedure patients who did not receive the proximal buttressing technique. All&#xD;
      children's charts reviewed will be of patients who had their surgery at Children's Healthcare&#xD;
      of Atlanta between December 1994 and August 2003; only information available up until October&#xD;
      10, 2003 will be used for this study. We will review approximately 75 charts for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the study would be to examine basic information regarding bleeding&#xD;
      incidence. The following information will be collected on both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of chest tube bleeding within the first 24 hours, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients who required re-exploration for bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from cardiopulmonary bypass removal to time leaving the operating room (indicator&#xD;
           of the need to &quot;dry up&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of the study would be to review the echocardiograms on these patients. The&#xD;
      pulmonary valve size before the Ross procedure would be measured on the preoperative&#xD;
      transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiogram. This would then be compared with&#xD;
      postoperative studies in the Operating Room by transesophageal echocardiography. The&#xD;
      pre-discharge echocardiogram and follow-up echocardiograms (which are a routine for these&#xD;
      patients and, therefore, would not be necessary to add to the study protocol) would be&#xD;
      reviewed. Autograft root diameters would be measured. The diameters would be at the level of&#xD;
      the valve leaflets, at the level of the commissures and at the sinotubular ridge. These would&#xD;
      be compared against published Z values for these patients by age, weight and body surface&#xD;
      area. At the same time, any degree of aortic insufficiency or left ventricular outflow tract&#xD;
      obstruction would be noted and recorded. One non-invasive cardiologist will review all old&#xD;
      echocardiograms.&#xD;
