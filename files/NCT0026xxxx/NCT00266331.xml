    <textblock>
      This study is for the patient with breast cancer. To take part in this study, external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy needs to be part of the treatment plan. Reduced glutathione, an ingredient&#xD;
      of RayGelâ„¢, has been helpful in decreasing some radiation therapy side effects to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced glutathione plays a vital role in both making DNA and cell repair. This study will&#xD;
      measure if RayGel decreases skin reaction in breast cancer patients treated with external&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy.&#xD;

      RayGel versus Placebo- An Alternative for Skin Care during External Beam Radiation Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      RayGel is a formulation of reduced glutathione and anthocyanins extracts from various&#xD;
      blue/purple flowering plants. Glutathione has been studied in a variety of ways in&#xD;
      conjunction with therapies directed at cancer. It is a functional molecule, which plays a&#xD;
      significant role in maintenance of normal cellular metabolism and regulation. Reduced&#xD;
      glutathione plays an essential role in DNA synthesis and repair, as well as leukotriene and&#xD;
      prostaglandin metabolism. Studies have looked at using glutathione to reduce the complication&#xD;
      of chemotherapy such as bone pain with Taxol, and urinary effects with cyclophosphamide, and&#xD;
      neurotoxicity with cisplatin. It has shown efficacy in these arenas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External beam radiation is a standard part of breast conservation treatment. It reduces rates&#xD;
      of loco regional recurrence significantly. Skin reaction of varying degrees occurs in&#xD;
      everyone under going treatment. Occasionally, it can be so severe that the treatment schedule&#xD;
      must be altered to allow healing. We would like to study the effect that topical RayGel may&#xD;
      have on reducing the reaction of skin during external beam radiation therapy of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ineligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post mastectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous irradiation of the same breast&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Younger than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Hypersensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective blinded randomized study. Enroll 150 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - RayGel topical cream is applied in a thin layer to the area exposed to radiation&#xD;
      60-90 minutes prior to radiotherapy, standard skin care between treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B - Placebo topical cream is applied in a thin layer to the area exposed to radiation&#xD;
      60-90 minutes prior to radiotherapy, standard skin care between treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients with bright erythema reaction will use skin products at the discretion&#xD;
      of the radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be consented prior to start of therapy. Digital photos of the radiation area&#xD;
      would be taken at start, ~ 5 weeks and evaluated by the radiation oncologist using the 0-6&#xD;
      Skin Reaction Scale. (0-no changes to 6-ulceration, hemorrhage or necrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly skin assessments and documentation of changes would be performed by the radiation&#xD;
      oncology nurse and radiation oncologist, using the, 0-6 Skin Reaction Scale. Also weekly&#xD;
      assessment of patient comfort, using Legacy's patient subjective pain rating, (0 no pain to&#xD;
      10 severe pain). Patients will keep track of their own pain and the time of application of&#xD;
      the study gel. They will do this daily and write it on the calendar provided to them. A 5&#xD;
      question survey related to their comfort will be completed by the study nurse at the last&#xD;
      visit. Outcomes would be measured by degree of skin reaction, discomfort, and cosmetic&#xD;
      outcome. Breaks in treatment schedule, secondary to skin changes would be recorded.&#xD;
