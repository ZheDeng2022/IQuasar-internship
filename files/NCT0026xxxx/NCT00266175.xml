  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative stenoses of the pulmonary artery vascular system seldom occur alone; they are&#xD;
      frequently found in connection with congenital heart defects or malformation syndromes. The&#xD;
      resulting increase of afterload represents a serious pressure load for the right ventricle.&#xD;
      Depending on the number and severity of the stenoses, gradual functional right ventricular&#xD;
      failure is to be expected. Due to limited clinical experience, there has not yet been a&#xD;
      consensus concerning the indications for the different therapeutic strategies (balloon&#xD;
      dilatation, stent implantation, surgical dilatation techniques). Up to now, only few&#xD;
      investigators in few centres use stents as therapy. Therefore, systematic multicenter&#xD;
      investigations assessing larger groups of patients undergoing this procedure are not yet&#xD;
      available. The same applies to other novel dilatation techniques, such as the use of the&#xD;
      &quot;cutting balloon&quot; as therapy for rigid valve stenoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing and analysing different invasive forms of treatment (balloon dilatation, stent&#xD;
      implantation and surgery), we expect to achieve an optimisation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, the outcomes of different strategies as practiced now in German cardiological&#xD;
      centers will be compared and the main factors influencing the results will be determined. On&#xD;
      the basis of a standardized investigation before and one year after the intervention, these&#xD;
      comparisons with respect to the reduction of stenosis and corresponding changes of right&#xD;
      ventricular functional and anatomical changes are carried out correcting for known&#xD;
      confounders. The assessment of the different included invasive and non-invasive diagnostical&#xD;
      procedures with respect to their ability to detect pathological findings and their changes as&#xD;
      result of the treatment is an important secondary target of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For patients with untreated peripheral pulmonary stenoses, the course of disease is&#xD;
      characterised by a chronic pressure load of the right ventricle. In the medium to long term&#xD;
      this can lead to right heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia unresponsive to therapy. The&#xD;
      probability of these events as well as the time of their occurrence depends on the severity&#xD;
      of the stenoses, the duration of stress and a possible additional volume load. Within the&#xD;
      scope of the prospective study introduced here, we intend to characterise the stenoses with&#xD;
      respect to degree and type and to document the treatment success in terms of decrease of&#xD;
      afterload of the right ventricle. In this context, imaging and catheter-based methods as well&#xD;
      as respective functional analyses are to be used to provide evidence of a reduction or&#xD;
      neutralisation of the pulmonary artery stenoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the following questions, or corresponding objectives, can be identified as the&#xD;
      base for the conduct of this clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morphological and functional categorisation of the angiostenoses and standardisation of&#xD;
           the diagnostic procedures. For this purpose, the quantitative criteria for both the&#xD;
           morphological degree of stenosis (lumen constriction) and the functional degree of&#xD;
           stenosis (pressure gradient) are established by means of cardiac catheterisation and&#xD;
           angiography. Non-invasive imaging methods, which have as yet been restricted primarily&#xD;
           to echocardiography, are complemented by the method of spin angiography. Compared to&#xD;
           conventional angiography, this has the advantage of being less invasive and not&#xD;
           involving radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the strength of past experience, the implantation of stents can be viewed as a very&#xD;
           promising approach to a treatment with lasting effectiveness of pulmonary artery&#xD;
           stenoses. The stents have the advantage of high radial forces that can be offset against&#xD;
           the elastic recoil of the vessels occurring after sole dilatation. Furthermore,&#xD;
           constrictions that are caused by either kinking of vessels or their compression by&#xD;
           neighbouring structures can be dilated sufficiently by the use of stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With respect to the interconnectedness of all the projects of the Competence Network for&#xD;
           Congenital Heart Defects, one essential aspect is the standardisation of diagnostic&#xD;
           methods of evaluating right ventricular function. The data obtained during the study are&#xD;
           to provide the basis for the development of diagnostic guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concerning evaluation, particular attention is paid to the patients' self-assessment&#xD;
           with respect to their exercise tolerance. In this context, it is a matter of interest to&#xD;
           what degree the patients' subjective maximum stress and therefore their quality of life&#xD;
           correlate with the objective measurement parameters. The anticipated results are of&#xD;
           direct clinical significance for the patients, as they aim at medium to long-term relief&#xD;
           of the right ventricle, which may effect a decrease in morbidity and therefore an&#xD;
           improvement of the quality of life. This is of particular importance with regard to the&#xD;
           fact that there will be a continuously increasing number of patients with congenital&#xD;
           heart defects reaching adulthood.&#xD;
