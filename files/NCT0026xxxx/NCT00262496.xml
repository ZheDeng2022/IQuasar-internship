  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether Botulinum-A toxin injected in the bladder&#xD;
      muscle will help prevent the frequency and degree of urinary incontinence in Spinal Cord&#xD;
      Injured and Multiple Sclerosis patients. The proposed mechanism would be that the Toxin would&#xD;
      allow the bladder to hold more urine at a lower pressure as determined by Urodynamics. The&#xD;
      research will answer the question whether the dosages 300 units vs 400 units are either&#xD;
      equally vs not equally effective in helping urinary incontinece and bladder storage.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT The major aim of the present study is to use a double blind&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial design to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of two&#xD;
      different doses, 300 and 400 Units of Botulinum Toxin Type-A for the treatment of detrusor&#xD;
      hyperreflexia (Neurogenic Bladder Overactivity). While also improving bladder capacity in&#xD;
      spinal cord injured patients with refractory symptoms who have failed anticholinergic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN Inclusion Criteria: Male and female subjects 18-80 years of age with&#xD;
      suprasacral SCI refractory NBOA incontinence, and/or impaired detrusor compliance associated&#xD;
      with a small bladder capacity will be eligible. Subjects will be recruited on the basis of&#xD;
      incontinence symptoms and adverse urodynamic parameters including impaired bladder compliance&#xD;
      less than 50ml/cm, H20 and bladder (cystometric) capacity less than 300 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Allergy to Botulinum Toxin Type-A, pregnancy, breast-feeding women,&#xD;
      active medical or psychiatric disorders, active urinary tract infection, coagulopathy,&#xD;
      myasthenia gravis, upper urinary tract changes unrelated to lower tract dysfunction, and&#xD;
      aminoglycoside use during the last three months. Furthermore, subjects with radiation&#xD;
      cystitis (by history), vesico-ureteral reflux (by videofluoroscopy), bladder calculi (by&#xD;
      cystoscopy) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will include history and physical examination, urine analysis, urine culture and&#xD;
      sensitivity, 24-hour voiding diary for 3 consecutive days, urine pregnancy test in female&#xD;
      subjects of reproductive age, validated questionnaires, multichannel videourodynamics (UDS),&#xD;
      post-void residual volume at the time of UDS, and renal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY One week after the pre-intervention evaluation, endoscopic injection of Botulinum&#xD;
      Toxin Type-A (300 Units or 400 Units) into the detrusor muscle will be performed. During the&#xD;
      24 month duration of the study, participants will take and record their regular bladder&#xD;
      medications as Dr. Gousse (or one of his assistants) decide necessary to control their&#xD;
      urinary symptoms. Subjects will be scheduled to return at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after the first&#xD;
      injection session, and every 3 months thereafter. At the 2-week visit we will assess untoward&#xD;
      effects. At the 6-week visit and every subsequent visit a focused physical examination will&#xD;
      be carried out, along with validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with initial success, as defined by 50% improvement (voiding diary) in&#xD;
      diminished leakage, improved cystometric capacity by greater than 100 ml, improved compliance&#xD;
      by 15 ml/cm H20, 50% improvement in questionnaire scores, but who lose the initial&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit will be considered candidates for re-injection every 6 months. Patients&#xD;
      who continue to maintain therapeutic benefit pass 6 months after initial injection will not&#xD;
      be re-injected and will be re-evaluated at every 3 months thereafter prior to possible&#xD;
      re-injection. Pregnancy testing will be obtained prior to each injection session in&#xD;
      appropriate female subjects in their reproductive years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the type of variable being analyzed different statistical techniques will be&#xD;
      used for these comparisons including paired sample t-tests, Wilcoxon's signed rank tests,&#xD;
      McNemar's tests, and Cochran's Q tests. Cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses will&#xD;
      be performed to compare 300 vs. 400 Unit groups with respect to each of the variables&#xD;
      ascertained at each time point, and also with respect to changes over time for the major&#xD;
      study end points.&#xD;
