  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve survival and to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in some groups of patients following myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. This study is designed to test whether early initiation (≤7 days) of an ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), would reduce cardiovascular events. The&#xD;
      trial was a double-blind, placebo controlled study of 2,553 patients randomly assigned to&#xD;
      quinapril, target dose 40 mg daily or placebo, followed up to 43 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The IMAGINE study is a double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, randomized,&#xD;
      multi-centre international study conducted in patients who have undergone CABG. The research&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the ethics committee of all participating institutions, and all&#xD;
      patients gave written informed consent. The data were collected and analysed by an&#xD;
      independent clinical research organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were screened for eligibility and randomized in hospital within seven days&#xD;
      post-CABG, except for France where randomization could occur within ten days post-CABG.&#xD;
      Starting November 6, 2001, given the increasing evidence of benefit of ACE inhibitors in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and renal disease,14 all patients requiring insulin or with type II&#xD;
      diabetes and micro-albuminuria were no longer eligible for the study. Those already in the&#xD;
      trial were treated according to the clinical judgement of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of patients screened in 57 sites in Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium or France, 2 553&#xD;
      patients (approximately 5 percent of patients screened) were randomized post-operatively to&#xD;
      quinapril either 10 or 20 mg, or to placebo. Randomization was done centrally, was&#xD;
      un-stratified, block-based, and computer generated. If tolerated, patients were up-titrated&#xD;
      to 40 mg of quinapril or its placebo equivalent within hospital, or if not tolerated, later&#xD;
      post-hospital discharge. Patients were followed for twenty-four months at which time they&#xD;
      were invited to continue until 43 months of follow-up, or withdrawn if they did not wish to&#xD;
      extend their participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original primary endpoint consisted of time to first occurrence of any of the composite&#xD;
      of cardiovascular death or resuscitated cardiac arrest, nonfatal myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      coronary revascularization, unstable angina requiring hospitalization and documented angina&#xD;
      not requiring hospitalization. On January 14, 2003, the Steering Committee concluded that the&#xD;
      required number of endpoints would likely not be reached without modification of the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. Stroke and congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization were thus added to&#xD;
      the primary endpoint and sample-size was increased to 2 500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints included, 1) time to first occurrence of the following composite of&#xD;
      cardiovascular death or resuscitated cardiac arrest, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary&#xD;
      revascularization or stroke; 2) incidence of any of the above mentioned secondary endpoints;&#xD;
      3) time to first occurrence of the composite primary endpoint with the addition of the&#xD;
      following: transient ischemic attack, and any cardiovascular event requiring hospitalization;&#xD;
      4) incidence of any secondary endpoints included in #3; and 5) time to occurrence of death&#xD;
      from any cause. All endpoints were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an endpoint committee,&#xD;
      based on pre-defined definitions for each endpoint.&#xD;
