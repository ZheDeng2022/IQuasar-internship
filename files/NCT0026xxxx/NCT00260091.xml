    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized prospective clinical trial is to determine whether an&#xD;
      infertility treatment that moves quickly to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is more cost&#xD;
      effective than the usual treatment strategy which includes various combinations of&#xD;
      infertility drugs and intrauterine insemination (IUI) prior to utilizing In Vitro&#xD;
      Fertilization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, adverse events, and&#xD;
      particularly cost and cost-effectiveness of two alternative infertility treatment strategies&#xD;
      for patients who would otherwise be candidates for ovulation induction and IUI as their&#xD;
      initial treatment. The two therapies compared are conventional treatment and fast track to&#xD;
      IVF. Conventional therapy is a cost-conscious progressive treatment strategy that begins with&#xD;
      the least invasive form of ovulation induction, clomiphene/IUI. It then progresses to FSH/IUI&#xD;
      and, if pregnancy is not achieved, to IVF. The fast track to IVF strategy begins with&#xD;
      clomiphene/IUI; if pregnancy does not result, these patients bypass FSH/IUI and move directly&#xD;
      to IVF. We hypothesize that the fast track to IVF therapy results in a higher pregnancy rate,&#xD;
      lower rates of medical complications during treatment, lower rates of pregnancy&#xD;
      complications, and costs no more than conventional infertility treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare the number of deliveries per initiated cycle, the proportion of women with&#xD;
      a clinically recognized intrauterine pregnancy, and the time to clinical pregnancy between&#xD;
      fast track to IVF and the conventional treatment arms of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the frequency of infertility treatment complications between the fast track&#xD;
      to IVF arm and the conventional treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To compare the occurrence of pregnancy complications between the fast track to IVF arm&#xD;
      and the conventional treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To evaluate the costs and cost effectiveness of the two alternative treatment&#xD;
      strategies by comparing the direct and indirect medical costs between the fast track to IVF&#xD;
      and conventional treatment arms of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a collaborative study between Boston IVF, Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates,&#xD;
      Harvard School of Public Health, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim&#xD;
      Health Care, and Tufts Health Plan.&#xD;

             defined as failure to conceive a recognized pregnancy after one year (or 12 menstrual&#xD;
             cycles) of unprotected intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male partner has a normal semen analysis with a sperm concentration of &gt;15 million&#xD;
             total motile sperm, &gt;1% normal forms by strict criteria, or &gt;5 million total motile&#xD;

             and fallopian tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A laparoscopy that demonstrated pelvic adhesions or endometriosis for which the pelvis&#xD;
             could not be restored to normal by surgery or endometriosis was not ablated or&#xD;
             excised. All patients with stages III and IV endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or more prior ectopic pregnancies in which one or both tubes were rendered&#xD;
             nonfunctional; two or more ectopic pregnancies, even if tubes are patent.&#xD;

             total motile sperm, &lt;1% normal forms by strict criteria, or &lt;5 million total motile&#xD;
             sperm on IUI prep). Couples using donor semen will be excluded.&#xD;
