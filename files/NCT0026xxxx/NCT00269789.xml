  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness (onset of effect, time to loss of&#xD;
      effect, and overall efficacy) of methylphenidate given as an OROSÂ® (methylphenidate HCl)&#xD;
      formulation, compared to immediate-release RitalinÂ® and placebo for the treatment of&#xD;
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children using standardized attention and&#xD;
      behavior scales, and other assessments. Both OROSÂ® Methylphenidate HCl and RitalinÂ® contain&#xD;
      the central nervous system stimulant, methylphenidate HCl.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) represents the most common neurobehavioral&#xD;
      disorder in children, affecting 3% to 5% of the school-age population. This is a&#xD;
      double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled, active-controlled, crossover&#xD;
      trial in children with ADHD, to compare the safety and effectiveness (onset of effect, time&#xD;
      to loss of effect and overall efficacy) of OROS® Methylphenidate HCl with standard&#xD;
      immediate-release Ritalin® and placebo. During this study, patients receive each of the three&#xD;
      treatments (OROS® Methylphenidate HCl 18, 36 or 54 milligrams per day, Ritalin® 5, 10 or 15&#xD;
      milligrams three times per day, or placebo) for 7 days, and are assigned to one of three&#xD;
      dosage levels depending upon their prestudy methylphenidate dose and regimen. The total study&#xD;
      participation for each patient will be 21 days. Since ADHD is manifested in a variety of&#xD;
      settings and can affect attention and behavior, this study assesses efficacy in home,&#xD;
      community school, and laboratory school settings using numerous assessments designed to&#xD;
      evaluate various aspects of the disorder. These assessments are completed by a variety of&#xD;
      raters, including the parents/caregivers, community school teachers, laboratory school&#xD;
      teachers and the laboratory school counselor. The primary measure of effectiveness is the&#xD;
      community school teacher's rating on the IOWA Conners Inattention/Overactivity subscale.&#xD;
      Additional measures of effectiveness include IOWA Conners (Inattention/Overactivity and&#xD;
      Oppositional/Defiance subscale) ratings, SKAMP attention and deportment ratings, peer&#xD;
      interaction and other behavioral ratings, global assessments, accuracy and productivity of&#xD;
      independent assigned academic seatwork, and assessments of positive and negative social&#xD;
      behaviors, classroom rule violations and disruptive behaviors. Safety evaluations include the&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events, vital signs, sleep quality, appetite, and the presence/severity&#xD;
      of tics (hard-to-control, repeated twitching of any parts of the body or hard-to-control&#xD;
      repeating of sounds or words). Patients will be given oral doses of: OROS® (methylphenidate&#xD;
      HCl) either 1, 2 or 3 of the 18 milligram tablets once daily, Ritalin® 5, 10, or 15 mg&#xD;
      (encapsulated/single capsule) three times per day, or placebo. There are three treatment&#xD;
      groups, each group dosing for 7 days for a total of 21 days on study.&#xD;
