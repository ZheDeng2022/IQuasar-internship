  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TE Registry is a multi-institutional bioinformatics database for the collection of data&#xD;
      relevant to TE. Participating HTRS affiliated study centers may enroll patients and enter&#xD;
      data in the TE Registry by completing enrollment and data entry forms and transmitting them&#xD;
      to the study center. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the&#xD;
      epidemiology, pathophysiology, and outcome of patients suffering from thromboembolism (TE)&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial objectives of the registry are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of known prothrombotic risk&#xD;
           factors in persons with TE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the frequency and nature of complications associated with TE and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the phenotypes and complications seen in persons with multiple molecular risk&#xD;
           factors for TE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and complications seen in patients&#xD;
           with and without known risk factors for TE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hereditary defects that predispose to thromboembolism (TE) and its complications afflict 5-8%&#xD;
      of the U.S population. Annually, ~60,000 Americans die from TE and half of the survivors&#xD;
      suffer long-term morbidity. Despite these staggering statistics, little is known about the&#xD;
      clinical characteristics or epidemiology of the inherited risk factors for TE. Less is known&#xD;
      regarding the acquired risk factors or the phenotype of TE in persons with multiple risk&#xD;
      factors, yet preliminary data suggest that as many as 10% of patients may have multiple risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from several studies, primarily involving adult subjects, shows that in a population of&#xD;
      consecutively studied thrombosis patients, that one of the five most common inherited&#xD;
      predispositions will occur in ~33.8%. Antithrombin (AT) is the least common (~1.9%) of these,&#xD;
      while Factor V Leiden (FVL) is the most common (~18.8%). Most children who suffer from TE&#xD;
      have indwelling catheters to assist therapy of underlying medical conditions, or are sick&#xD;
      neonates. Thus, the contribution of molecular risk factors in children is largely unknown,&#xD;
      with the exception of sparse retrospective data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TE Registry may help clearly define the clinical phenotype, epidemiology, and&#xD;
      complications seen in patients with TE associated with known molecular risk factors.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be enrolled at the time of their FIRST thromboembolic event. Ideally,&#xD;
             patients should be enrolled within three months of the diagnosis of an eligible event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deep Venous, Arterial, or Intra-Cardiac Thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary Thromboembolism AND:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have evidence of Venous Thrombosis on imaging studies -OR-&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have elevated Quantitative or Semi-Quantitative D-dimer level (as defined by&#xD;
                  local laboratory technology/normal ranges)&#xD;
