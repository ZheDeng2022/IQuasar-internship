      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of OROSÂ®&#xD;
      Methylphenidate HCl (a central nervous system stimulant) in children with attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) represents the most common neurobehavioral&#xD;
      disorder in children, affecting 3% to 5% of the school-age population. Behavioral&#xD;
      pediatricians, child psychiatrists, and child neurologists indicate that referrals for ADHD&#xD;
      may constitute up to 50% of their practices. This is a multicenter, open-label,&#xD;
      non-randomized, single-treatment study in children 6 to 13 years of age with ADHD who have&#xD;
      successfully completed specific earlier ALZA studies. Part I of this study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of OROS® (methylphenidate HCl) for a period of one year in children&#xD;
      with ADHD. Part II of this study continues the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      OROS® (methylphenidate HCl) in children with ADHD who have completed one year in Part I of&#xD;
      the study. During Part I of the study, patients will be assigned to treatment with OROS®&#xD;
      (methylphenidate HCl) 18, 36, or 54 milligrams once daily, as determined by the results from&#xD;
      their participation in earlier ALZA studies. Patients continuing in Part II of the study&#xD;
      continue to receive a daily dose as determined from the dosing at the end of Part I. Doses&#xD;
      can be titrated up or down, as considered appropriate by the medical personnel at the study&#xD;
      site, with a maximum once-daily dose of 54 milligrams. Effectiveness is determined by&#xD;
      standardized measurements of attention, behavior, and hyperactivity including: the IOWA&#xD;
      (Inattention Overactivity with Aggression) Conners Rating Scale, Inattention/Overactivity&#xD;
      (I/O) and Oppositional/Defiance (O/D) subscales; Peer Interaction assessment; Global&#xD;
      evaluation of effectiveness of therapy; and the Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations include the incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, vital signs, sleep quality, appetite, and the presence/severity of tics&#xD;
      (hard-to-control, repeated twitching of any parts of the body or hard-to-control repeating of&#xD;
      sounds or words).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be summarized and no formal hypotheses will be tested. Part I: A daily morning oral&#xD;
      dose of 18, 36, or 54 milligrams of OROS® (methylphenidate HCl) for up to 12 months. Part II:&#xD;
      Continuation for up to 15 months of the same daily dose taken at the end of Part I. Total&#xD;
      treatment duration to approximately 27 months.&#xD;
