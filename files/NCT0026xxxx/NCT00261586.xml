  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare several analgesics given in approved daily doses in&#xD;
      combination with a daily cardioprotective dose of aspirin (81 mg), to study their bleeding&#xD;
      properties and their effects on the stomach in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      The purpose of this randomized, multiple-dose, single-blind, parallel-group study is to&#xD;
      examine in healthy volunteers the effects of analgesics given in approved daily doses in&#xD;
      addition to daily cardio-protective doses of aspirin (81 mg) on the stomach. All subjects are&#xD;
      examined endoscopically before receiving study medication, and at the end of treatment on Day&#xD;
      9. Each subject takes 81 mg of aspirin daily plus one of the following treatments to be taken&#xD;
      daily on Days 1 through 8: four doses of acetaminophen 1000 mg, three doses of ibuprofen 400&#xD;
      mg, two doses of naproxen sodium (440 mg in the morning and 220 mg in the evening), four&#xD;
      doses of aspirin 650 mg, two doses of celecoxib 200 mg, one dose of rofecoxib 25 mg, or no&#xD;
      additional study medication. On Day 9, one dose of aspirin 81 mg and only one dose of the&#xD;
      assigned treatment drug are taken prior to having an endoscopy. The primary endpoints of the&#xD;
      study are the effects of the analgesics on the inhibition of COX-1 activity by aspirin, and&#xD;
      any injury to the stomach mucosa, as determined by direct endoscopic observation. Safety&#xD;
      assessments consist of routine monitoring for adverse events, as well as endoscopic&#xD;
      examination of gastric mucosa for erosions and ulcerations occurring during the treatment&#xD;
      phase. The study hypothesis is that the effects of acetaminophen on the stomach do not differ&#xD;
      from the effects of ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, celecoxib, or rofecoxib. 81 mg aspirin and&#xD;
      1of 7 treatments for 8 days: acetaminophen 1000mg 4xday, ibuprofen 400mg 3xday, naproxen&#xD;
      440mg morning and 220mg evening, no additional study medication, aspirin 650mg 4xday,&#xD;
      celecoxib 200mg 2xday,rofecoxib 25mg 1xday. On Day 9, 1 dose aspirin &amp; 1 dose study drug&#xD;
      before endoscopy.&#xD;
