    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given&#xD;
      together with temozolomide in treating patients with malignant gliomas. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as vorinostat and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vorinostat may&#xD;
      also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Vorinostat may help temozolomide work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the&#xD;
      drug. Giving vorinostat together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic&#xD;
      acid [SAHA]) in combination with temozolomide in patients with malignant gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the safety profile of vorinostat (SAHA) in combination with temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of vorinostat (SAHA) in combination with&#xD;
      temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine efficacy of vorinostat (SAHA) in combination with temozolomide as measured&#xD;
      by objective response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the association of response to treatment to the molecular phenotype of the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the effects of vorinostat (SAHA) on histone acetylation status in peripheral&#xD;
      mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a 2-part, dose-escalation study of vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I: Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-7&#xD;
      and 15-21 OR QD or BID on days 1-7. Patients also receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in course 2, some patients may receive a higher dose of&#xD;
      temozolomide. Treatment may continue beyond 13 courses at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Patients receive vorinostat and temozolomide as in part 1*.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Note: *Beginning in course 2, all patients receive a higher dose of temozolomide.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

          -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SPECIFIC FOR PATIENTS IN PART I OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with either stable disease after radiation therapy or with progression are&#xD;
             eligible (except if they have progressed on temozolomide; patients who have received&#xD;
             prior treatment with temozolomide and have stable disease are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recurrent disease may have had treatment for any number of prior&#xD;
             relapses; relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation&#xD;
             +/- chemo if that was used as initial therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 28 days from any&#xD;
             investigational agent, 28 days from prior cytotoxic therapy except 23 days from last&#xD;
             dose of temozolomide for patients taking the standard 5 days every 28 day regimen of&#xD;
             temozolomide, 14 days from vincristine, 42 days from nitrosoureas, 21 days from&#xD;
             procarbazine administration, and 7 days for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon,&#xD;
             tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count); any&#xD;
             questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the&#xD;
             study chair&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be&#xD;
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They have recovered from the effects of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Residual disease following resection is not mandated for eligibility into the&#xD;
                  study; to best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a CT/MRI&#xD;
                  should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or&#xD;
                  at least 4 weeks post-operatively, within 14 days prior to registration; if the&#xD;
                  96-hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be&#xD;
                  repeated; if the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and&#xD;
                  registration, a new baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for at&#xD;
                  least 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation&#xD;
             necrosis based upon either positron emission tomography (PET) or thallium scanning, MR&#xD;
             spectroscopy or surgical documentation of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SPECIFIC FOR PATIENTS IN PART II OF THE STUDY&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The only prior therapy permitted for patients in part 2 of the study is concomitant&#xD;
             temozolomide with radiation therapy or radiation therapy alone; patients that are&#xD;
             stable on adjuvant temozolomide may also participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recurrent disease and prior chemotherapies (except concurrent or&#xD;
             adjuvant temozolomide) will not be included in this part of the study&#xD;
