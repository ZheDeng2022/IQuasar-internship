      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of lapaquistat acetate, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), to lower cholesterol in subjects with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
      undergoing lipid-lowering treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization, CHD is now the leading cause of death worldwide.&#xD;
      In 2001, CHD caused 7.2 million deaths and estimates for 2020 indicate that annual CHD deaths&#xD;
      will increase to 11.1 million. These statistics suggest that improved options are needed to&#xD;
      treat hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The balance among cholesterol synthesis, dietary intake, and degradation is normally adequate&#xD;
      to maintain healthy cholesterol plasma levels. However, in patients with&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol leads to atherosclerotic&#xD;
      deposition of cholesterol in the arterial walls. Consequently, in this population it has been&#xD;
      established that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentrations&#xD;
      effectively reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The National Cholesterol&#xD;
      Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III has therefore identified control of low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol as essential in the prevention and management of CHD. Additional&#xD;
      lipid risk factors designated by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel&#xD;
      III include elevated triglycerides, elevated non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (atherogenic lipoproteins), and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.&#xD;
      Lipoproteins rich in triglycerides, such as very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, appear&#xD;
      to contribute to atherosclerosis, whereas the apparent protective effect of high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol, which is likely related to high-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol-facilitated transport of cholesterol away from atherosclerotic deposits, may be&#xD;
      limited at low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial dietary and lifestyle measures taken to control dyslipidemia are often inadequate,&#xD;
      and most patients require pharmacologic intervention. Currently, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl&#xD;
      coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are the first-line monotherapies most often&#xD;
      prescribed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, after diet and therapeutic&#xD;
      lifestyle change. However, with statin monotherapy, many patients fail to reach National&#xD;
      Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommended levels of low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. As a result, the statin dosage must be increased or an&#xD;
      additional treatment added to achieve treatment goals. Increasing the statin dosage may&#xD;
      result in decreased tolerability and potential safety concerns, contributing to the high&#xD;
      discontinuation rates of statins and their prescription at low and often ineffective doses.&#xD;
      Further, although the effectiveness of increasing the dose varies among the statins, in&#xD;
      general, doubling of the dose above the minimum effective dose has been found to decrease&#xD;
      serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by only an additional 6 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Takeda Global Research and Development Center, Inc. is developing an orally active squalene&#xD;
      synthase inhibitor, TAK-475 (lapaquistat acetate) for the treatment of dyslipidemia.&#xD;
      Lapaquistat acetate inhibits the biosynthesis of cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme&#xD;
      squalene synthase, which catalyzes the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to squalene-a&#xD;
      precursor in the final steps of cholesterol production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of lapaquistat acetate coadministered with ongoing&#xD;
      lipid-lowering therapy in treating subjects with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
      The effect on LDL-C and other lipid parameters, as well as the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      lapaquistat acetate compared to a placebo will be evaluated during a 12-week double-blind&#xD;
      treatment period. The long-term safety of lapaquistat acetate treatment in this population&#xD;
      will be evaluated during an open-label extension period. Study Participation is anticipated&#xD;
      to be up to 3 years.&#xD;
