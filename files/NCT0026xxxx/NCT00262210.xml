      * AIMS OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test if steroid-free chemotherapeutic regimens decrease the risk of HBV reactivation&#xD;
           and hepatitis development in HBsAg (+) carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the efficacy of steroid-free chemotherapeutic regimens with that of&#xD;
           steroid-containing regimens in terms of lymphoma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the change of activity of HBV and other hepatotropic viruses during the course&#xD;
           of chemotherapy.&#xD;

      * TREATMENT PLANS FOR FIRST-LINE AND SECOND LINE CHEMOTHERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First-line Chemotherapy 1.1 PACE and ACE Treatment Scheme of PACE and ACE*&#xD;
           Cyclophosphamide 650 mg/m2, i.v. Day 1 Epirubicin 60 mg/m2, i.v. Day 1 Etoposide 55&#xD;
           mg/m2/d, i.v. Day 1-3 Prednisolone 60 mg/m2/d, p.o. Day 1-7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For ACE, prednisolone is omitted. 1.2 Courses will be repeated every 21 days. 1.3&#xD;
                For patients with CR, give at least 2 additional courses for a minimum of 6&#xD;
                courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 For patients with PR or SD, may change to second-line chemotherapy if no further&#xD;
           tumor shrinkage between two consecutive courses.Local radiotherapy is allowed for&#xD;
           residual localized tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5 For patients with PD, change to second-line chemotherapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second-line Chemotherapy : For patients who have failed steroid-containing or steroid-&#xD;
           free chemotherapy, respective steroid-containing and steroid-free salvage chemotherapy&#xD;
           should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 VIMP and VIM Treatment Scheme of VIMP and VIM* VP-16 100 mg/m2/d, i.v. Day 1,3,5&#xD;
      Ifosfamide 1 gm/m2/d, i.v. Day 1-5 MTX 30 mg/m2/d, i.v. Day 1,5 Prednisolone 60 mg/m2/d, P.O.&#xD;
      Day 1-7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For VIM, prednisolone is omitted. Repeated every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesna for urinary tract protection is needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesna 100 mg/m2 is bolus injected immediately before the infusion of first-day ifosfamide,&#xD;
      and then 500mg/m2/day is infused for 5 day with ifosfamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Infusional CDE + P (ICDE + P) and Infusional CDE (ICDE) Treatment Scheme of ICDE+P and&#xD;
      ICDE* Cyclophosphamide 187.5 mg/m2/d, continuous i.v. infusion Day 1-4 Epirubicin 20 mg/m2/d,&#xD;
      continuous i.v. infusion Day 1-4 Etoposide 60 mg/m2/d, continuous i.v. infusion Day 1,4&#xD;
      Prednisolone 60 mg/m2/d, P.O. Day 1-7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For ICDE, prednisolone is omitted. Repeated every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cyclophosphamide and epirubicin can be mixed in a 500ml of 5% D/W, and infused&#xD;
                together. Etoposide is dissolved in another 500ml of 5% D/W, and infused in a&#xD;
                separate line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 DOSE MODIFICATION 3.1 Hematological Toxicity*&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration is postponed one week if there is no full hematological recovery (AGC &gt;&#xD;
      2,000/mm3 and Platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 ) from prior course at scheduled treatment day. Full&#xD;
      doses will be given as soon as the hematological recovery is documented. If after another one&#xD;
      week, i.e. two weeks after the due day, recovery is still incomplete, the treatment may be&#xD;
      started and the dosage of the drugs be reduced according to the following schedule for all&#xD;
      regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGC*/mm3Platelet/mm3 1,500-2,00075,000-100,000 1,000-1,49950,000-74,999 &lt;1,000&lt;50,000&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide 80% 60% ** Epirubicin 80% 60% ** VP-16 80% 60% ** Ifosfamide 80% 60% ** MTX&#xD;
      80% 60% **&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF) are allowed to be used for patients with prolonged&#xD;
           myelosuppression, but should not influence the schedule of dose- modification as&#xD;
           illustrated above.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Postpone for another week. If the counts remain AGC &lt; 1000 or Platelet &lt; 50,000,&#xD;
                growth factors may be used at this juncture, i.e. 2 weeks after due day. Patients&#xD;
                should be off study if still AGC &lt; 1,000 or Platelet &lt; 50,000, 3 weeks after the&#xD;
                due day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Hepatotoxicity For patients with normal or abnormal prechemotherapy serum ALT, hepatitis&#xD;
      or hepatitis flare-up is defined as a threefold or greater increase in serum ALT level that&#xD;
      exceeds 100 IU/L. The hepatitis or hepatitis flare-up is attributed to reactivation of&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B when there is a sudden elevation (&gt; 10-fold) in serum HBV DNA level or&#xD;
      reappearance of HBV DNA or HBeAg in the serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since serum HBV DNA data is not readily available in most hospitals, all patients with&#xD;
      hepatitis or hepatitis flare-up are considered as HBV reactivation until proved otherwise.&#xD;
      Cross-over to steroid-free arm for subsequent treatment is not allowed in this study. For&#xD;
      patients with only minor hepatic dysfunction (Total Bilirubin &lt;3.0 mg/dl and ALT &lt;200&#xD;
      I.U./L), full-dose chemotherapy is recommended on the scheduled treatment date without delay.&#xD;
      For patients with more severe hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin ≧ 3.0 mg/dl or ALT ≧ 200&#xD;
      I.U./L), subsequent course is postponed for 1 week and the dosage modified as followings if&#xD;
      the values remain abnormal after 1 week:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Bilirubin (mg/dl) &lt;3.0 3.0 - 4.9 5.0 - 7.5 &gt;7.5 ALT (I.U./L) &lt;200 200 - 399 400 - 800&#xD;
      &gt;800 Epirubicin 100% 75% 50% *&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wait until recovery with serum levels below these values. Patients will be off study if&#xD;
           Bil &gt; 7.5 or ALT &gt; 800, 3 weeks after the due day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Gastrointestinal Toxicity In case of severe (≧ ECOG grade III) anorexia, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis or abdominal pain, all therapy should be delayed until&#xD;
      improvement of symptoms to ≦ GrII.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be off study if ≧ GrIII toxicity persists ≧ 3 weeks after due day. Patients are&#xD;
      allowed to use H3-blockers in the subsequent courses for severe nausea and vomiting. If&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicity is still ≧ Gr II during the next course, doses of cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      epirubicin and VP-16 should be reduced by 25% in the subsequent courses. If no further&#xD;
      episodes of severe reaction, the doses can be escalated back to 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Cardiotoxicity In case of ECOG grade II cardiotoxicity, epirubicin should be reduced by&#xD;
      50%. If cardiotoxicity resolved, the dose may be carefully escalated i.e., increase 10-25% of&#xD;
      dose each time, in the subsequent courses. If severe (≧ ECOG grade III) cardiotoxicity&#xD;
      develops, epirubicin should be discontinued and should not be used again in the subsequent&#xD;
      courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be made based on the&#xD;
      guideline that requires the greatest reduction of doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are still under or have completed protocol treatments (1st-line or 2nd-line)&#xD;
      should be continuously followed-up for all study end points. Patients are removed from study&#xD;
      if they have major violation of the protocol due to the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Refuse treatment. 4.2 Unable to receive due treatments either because of severe toxicity&#xD;
      or other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Inadvertent cross-over to opposite arms (steroid-containing or steroid-free) of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
