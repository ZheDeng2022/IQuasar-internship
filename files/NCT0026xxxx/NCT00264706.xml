  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this trial are: 1) to evaluate the safety of NONA-L-ARGININE in ex&#xD;
      vivo application to saphenous vein segments prior to grafting; and, 2) to obtain preliminary&#xD;
      data on the biological effects of NONA-L-ARGININE, as compared to placebo, in the prevention&#xD;
      of neointimal hyperplasia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LT-1951 is an aqueous solution of NONA-L-ARGININE. The drug efficiently penetrates into&#xD;
      vascular tissues like the saphenous vein and supplies the tissue with a sustained reservoir&#xD;
      of L-arginine, the substrate for production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide (NO) is an&#xD;
      important vasoactive and cell signaling compound implicated in suppression of neointimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia. NO limits neointimal hyperplasia by inhibiting monocyte chemotaxis and&#xD;
      adherence, platelet adherence and aggregation, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dramatic reduction of neointimal hyperplasia following treatment with LT-1951 has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in preclinical vein to artery interposition studies in several animal models.&#xD;
      Marked improvement following a single ex vivo application of LT-1951 in interposition grafts&#xD;
      demonstrated that the beneficial effect of the drug is not dependent upon continued treatment&#xD;
      of the grafted tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PATENT trial, saphenous vein grafts are harvested in the usual manner from the&#xD;
      patient's leg and are bathed in LT-1951 or placebo ex vivo (at normal pressure and&#xD;
      temperature) before being rinsed and implanted into the patient. Because LT-1951 is applied&#xD;
      only to the graft, there is minimal systemic exposure and risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in this study will receive treatment with both NONA-L-ARGININE and vehicle&#xD;
      control. This within-patient, placebo-controlled, study will be double-blinded and&#xD;
      randomized. For each patient, one of the comparable vein grafts will receive treatment with&#xD;
      placebo, while the other will receive treatment with NONA-L-ARGININE. Any third vein graft&#xD;
      used in the procedure will be treated as per the first vein graft, while any fourth vein&#xD;
      graft will be treated as per the second vein graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort of 20 patients will be the primary safety subgroup. This subgroup will be&#xD;
      evaluated in combination with a second cohort of 30-80 patients for assessment of efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints. During follow-up, all patients will have clinical visits at 6 weeks, which will&#xD;
      include Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA). Patients will undergo Intravascular&#xD;
      Ultrasound-coronary angiography (IVUS-angio) at 12 months and optional CTA at 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject must be 35-85 years of age and able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Coronary artery disease requiring bypass grafting using at least two saphenous vein&#xD;
