  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for transcutaneous vaccination is based on the unique ability of cutaneous&#xD;
      immune cells, especially Langerhans cells (LCs), to present antigens to the immune system.&#xD;
      DCs can be found at high densities in the epidermis and the dermis of human skin, a fraction&#xD;
      of which are the epidermal LCs. It is known that strong and efficient immune responses can be&#xD;
      induced by targeting vaccines to skin APCs (Glenn 2003, Partidos 2003), e.g. by epicutaneous&#xD;
      application of smallpox vaccine on scarified skin. Several obstacles however prevent vaccines&#xD;
      from attaining sufficiently high and free concentrations in these target skin DCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial we aim at testing the safety and immunogenicity of this new&#xD;
      transcutaneous route of vaccine administration, first with a licensed, well-known, safe and&#xD;
      highly immunogenic vaccine i.e. Tetagrip® vaccine, which is licensed for subcutaneous (s.c.)&#xD;
      and intra-muscular routes (i.m), and to compare the induced vaccine-specific immune responses&#xD;
      to those induced with the conventional (i.m) injection. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      transcutaneous application of Tetagrip® in the commercially available standard preparation of&#xD;
      0.5 ml should be capable to induce at least similar antibody and CD4 and/or CD8 T cell&#xD;
      responses to both the tetanus and the flu vaccinal antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I, open label, randomized study is designed to evaluate and to compare the safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of a transcutaneous mode of Tetanus / Influenza vaccination to the&#xD;
      conventional i.m. route of vaccine administration in two cohorts: The cohort I constituted of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and the cohort II of HIV-infected patients in whom the virus is stably&#xD;
      controlled by antiretroviral therapy, ensuring an immune competence and a capacity to respond&#xD;
      to vaccines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to translate our current knowledge about vaccinology, immunology of&#xD;
      the skin and on transcutaneous penetration of epicutaneously applied active compounds, into&#xD;
      the development of more efficient and well tolerated vaccines, and to progress toward an&#xD;
      easy-to-apply patch system for transcutaneous application of vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To that purpose we aim at testing the safety and immunogenicity of a new transcutaneous route&#xD;
      of vaccine administration. We propose to test this new route first with a well-known, safe&#xD;
      and highly immunogenic vaccine i.e. anti-influenza and tetanus vaccine which is licensed for&#xD;
      sub-cutaneous and intra-muscular routes, and to compare the vaccine-specific immune responses&#xD;
      induced after transcutaneous administration to the conventional intramuscular (i.m)&#xD;
      injection. Seasonal vaccination against influenza is recommended for all individuals at risk&#xD;
      for severe flu, including persons above 60 years of age or suffering from chronic diseases&#xD;
      and for medical personal. It is also highly recommended at any age to prevent influenza. In&#xD;
      addition vaccination against tetanus is mandatory in childhood and requires recall injections&#xD;
      every 5 years to protect against the lethal disease caused by the tetanus toxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the transcutaneous application of a licensed anti-influenza-tetanus&#xD;
      vaccine in the commercially available standard preparation of 0.5 ml should be capable to&#xD;
      induce at least similar antibody and CD4 and/or CD8 T cell responses to both the tetanus and&#xD;
      the flu vaccinal antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tetagrip® vaccine is an approved and commercially available vaccine manufactured by&#xD;
      Sanofi-Pasteur, administered in one injection for preventive vaccination of adults against&#xD;
      tetanus and influenza. The Tetagrip® vaccine therefore represents a safe and approved test&#xD;
      vaccine to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the mode of administration under&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goal of this strategy is to improve the efficacy of vaccines that are currently&#xD;
      encountering major obstacles such as the HIV vaccines, and to develop a non invasive mode of&#xD;
      vaccine administration. Results from this study will help establish a standardized study&#xD;
      protocol for the application of HIV-vaccines in future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This Phase I, open label, randomized on the vaccine administration route study&#xD;
      is designed to evaluate and to compare the safety and immunogenicity of a transcutaneous mode&#xD;
      of Tetanus / Influenza vaccination to the conventional i.m. route of vaccine administration&#xD;
      in two cohorts: The cohort I constituted of healthy volunteers and the cohort II of&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients in whom the virus is stably controlled by antiretroviral therapy,&#xD;
      ensuring an immune competence and a capacity to respond to vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multisite trial and is being conducted in Germany in two clinical centers:&#xD;

      Cohort I:&#xD;
