  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this retrospective study of valve replacement is to document&#xD;
      long-term survival and occurrence of valve related complications such as described in the&#xD;
      literature; anticoagulant related bleeding event , thromboembolic events, subacute bacterial&#xD;
      endocarditis (SBE), structural failure or deterioration , valve thrombosis, explantation and&#xD;
      reimplantation with reason, death and death cause, and cerebrovascular accidents either&#xD;
      permanent or transient in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary to this is the presumption that mechanical valves have a superior &quot;life expectancy&#xD;
      &quot; to bio-prosthetic valves. We plan to look at the time of freedom from re-implantation from&#xD;
      different types of valves, factoring in patient age, size ,defect and risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information learned from this study may benefit future patients who undergo the Ross&#xD;
      procedure by increasing our knowledge of safer and/or more effective techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both Aortic and Mitral valves utilizing bio-prosthetic and/or mechanical valves have been&#xD;
      placed in adults since the 1960s.The replacement of these valves in children and adolescents&#xD;
      began some 10 years after the first adult valve replacement. The majority of valves replaced&#xD;
      in the pediatric cohort are due to either stenosis (narrowing) or incompetancy of the native&#xD;
      valve. Valvular stenosis in the pediatric patient is normally of congenital etiology,&#xD;
      however, a small percentage can be acquired from an infectious process. Stenosis of a valve&#xD;
      impedes blood flow through the native valve orifice. Ventricular enlargement, hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability and /or other major organ congestion can ensue if left untreated. Dependant upon&#xD;
      the severity of the stenosis and the onset of the dysfunction, intervention may be required&#xD;
      at any age (newborn to adult). In order for patients to have adequate blood flow to the&#xD;
      systemic circulation (the body), the diseased valve must be replaced. Children with native&#xD;
      valve stenosis experience failure to thrive, frequent pneumonia, difficulty breathing and&#xD;
      generally poor physical development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the stenosis is of a critical nature greatly affecting hemodynamics, infants require&#xD;
      intervention in the first few days of life. In these patients, initially many of the stenotic&#xD;
      valves can be opened in the heart catheterization lab with a procedure called a&#xD;
      valvuloplasty. While this procedure does open the valve leaflet apparatus, close&#xD;
      approximation of the leaflets is not achieved and a residual insufficiency or regurgitation&#xD;
      is present. Most infant hearts can handle minimal resurgent volumes from the resulting&#xD;
      cardiac chamber enlargement. It will be necessary to surgically replace the incompetent valve&#xD;
      with a prosthetic valve as the child grows. If valvuloplasty is unsuccessful, surgical&#xD;
      intervention is required to relive the valvular Stenosis and improve hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart valve insufficiency creates a resurgence of blood back into either the left atrium or&#xD;
      ventricle causing increased cardiac workload and dilation of the respective chamber of the&#xD;
      heart. Incompetence of the Aortic valve will eventually cause congestive heart failure and/or&#xD;
      sudden death from arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial surgery is dependant on the size of the ventricle and any other concomitant&#xD;
      defects the child may have. A ventricle that is too small to support circulation will not be&#xD;
      changed by placement of a valve. These patients require staged surgeries for single ventricle&#xD;
      palliative repairs. Two examples of congenital cardiac defects include aortic stenosis and&#xD;
      cleft mitral valve. If the aortic valve is stenosed and both ventricles are of adequate size,&#xD;
      a Ross procedure can be done, The Ross procedure uses the patient's resected native pulmonary&#xD;
      valve and main pulmonary artery in place of the aortic valve and outflow tract. A&#xD;
      cryo-preserved homograft is then placed in the native pulmonary artery position. This&#xD;
      homograft can be implanted with or without a valve dependant upon the patient's size and/or&#xD;
      native valve orifice. Mitral valve anomalies occur frequently in patients with&#xD;
      Atrioventricular septal defects. With this congenital defect the mitral valve may be&#xD;
      dysplastic, or has a cleft in the anterior valve leaflet. This affects the competency of the&#xD;
      valve, allowing regurgitation of blood flow into the left atrium. This increased blood volume&#xD;
      in the left atrium will eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension. Because of this risk ,&#xD;
      repair of Atrioventricular septal defect is normally done between the ages of six and twelve&#xD;
      months. Repair of the mitral valve is done at that time, with the knowledge that mitral valve&#xD;
      replacement will be likely in the child's future. Repair of a heart valve in a patient of any&#xD;
      age is always preferable to replacement; in children this is especially true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability of replacement valves in infant sizes are limited to bio-prosthetic or&#xD;
      homograft. Cryo-preserved homografts are made from either porcine and cadaver valves. These&#xD;
      are generally used for pediatric patients under the age of two years. Historically homografts&#xD;
      develop a significant amount of stenosis/calcification at the suture site. In addition, as&#xD;
      the child grows the homograft size remains fixed. Both problems require further replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantation of mechanical valves in the older children and young adults is considered as a&#xD;
      treatment alternative. However, mechanical valves have inherent complications secondary to&#xD;
      the requirement of long-term anticoagulant therapy (blood thinners) and the risk of&#xD;
      thromboembolic events. Structural malfunctions of the valve and growth of the patient result&#xD;
      in the need for replacement of mechanical valves. Additionally, patient compliance and dosing&#xD;
      management can be difficult to control.&#xD;
