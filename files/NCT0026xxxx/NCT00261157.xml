  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test a two-way video system mounted on top of a robot. After&#xD;
      surgery the act of seeing and evaluating patients in the hospital is called standard&#xD;
      &quot;rounding&quot;. This research study will allow doctors to see and speak with their patients using&#xD;
      the two-way video system - &quot;telerounding&quot;, during their stay at the hospital. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the safety of telerounding during a patients hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that post-operative morbidity and the time to identification of&#xD;
      post-operative morbidity will not vary with this new method of rounding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Department of Urology and the University of California, Davis has made a major commitment&#xD;
      to the development of novel applications of advanced telecommunications to the practice of&#xD;
      modern health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine has become an increasingly important although underutilized component of modern&#xD;
      healthcare. To date, telemedicine has been limited to physician education in the form of&#xD;
      video conferencing for seminars, and to providing specialist consultation in rural medical&#xD;
      clinics. However, given the recent technological advances in wireless Internet capabilities&#xD;
      and the decreasing cost of these services, we see alternate capabilities for this technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As is well known, the act of seeing patients at the bedside while they are hospitalized is&#xD;
      called &quot;rounding.&quot; For patients that have undergone an elective minimally invasive surgical&#xD;
      procedure, such as laparoscopy, hospital stays have become brief events. In fact, the&#xD;
      convalescence from these procedures is measured in days rather than weeks. For most&#xD;
      individuals, the hospitalization is necessary to allow for the delivery of IV fluids, to&#xD;
      check serum chemistries and blood counts while waiting for bowel function to return. To this&#xD;
      end, the physician bedside visit is in large part an opportunity to relay information&#xD;
      regarding the progress of recovery based on objective laboratory and vital sign measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a video-conferencing system that allows physicians to see and speak with&#xD;
      their patients from a remote location (telerounding). In a randomized trial of telerounds&#xD;
      versus standard rounds conducted while I was a Urology Fellow at Johns Hopkins, we examined&#xD;
      the impact of this form of post-operative management on elements of patient satisfaction with&#xD;
      their hospitalization. We found that patients managed with the telerounding system gave&#xD;
      higher ratings for their hospitalization than those managed by standard bedside rounds. One&#xD;
      such application is the use of teleconferencing as a primary mode of post-operative care&#xD;
      management (telerounding). In a prior study we performed at Johns Hopkins, patients expressed&#xD;
      higher ratings of satisfaction when the telerounding system was added to usual post-operative&#xD;
      care. However, that project was not designed to address the issue of patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to assess if there is a difference in patient outcomes when&#xD;
      post-operative patients are managed with &quot;standard rounding&quot; versus &quot;telerounding&quot;. Our&#xD;
      primary outcome measure is time to recognition of post-operative morbidity. The telerounding&#xD;
      system will consist of a wireless Internet-based videoconferencing device mounted on a&#xD;
      remotely controlled service robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, randomized trial. The study population will consist of&#xD;
      patients scheduled for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo their scheduled surgery and receive the usual perioperative and&#xD;
      immediate post-operative care delivered by the recovery room staff. Once transferred to the&#xD;
      patient floor, intervention patients will communicate with their attending physician on a&#xD;
      daily basis via the teleconferencing system. Intervention patients will not be seen at the&#xD;
      bedside by their attending surgeon. The hospital and resident staff will provide routine&#xD;
      daily bedside care. Patients may remove themselves from the study at any time by requesting a&#xD;
      bedside visit by the attending physician. The intervention will conclude with either the&#xD;
      hospital discharge or identification of a major post-operative morbidity. Intervention arm&#xD;
      participants will then participate in a series of focus groups. These sessions will serve as&#xD;
      the basis for a detailed qualitative analysis of patient perceptions of this technology and&#xD;
      its role in future health care.&#xD;
