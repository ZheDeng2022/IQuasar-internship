      The purpose of this study is to is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OROS® oxybutynin&#xD;
      chloride in patients being treated for urge urinary incontinence. Oxybutynin is an&#xD;
      antispasmodic, anticholinergic medication for the treatment of the symptoms of overactive&#xD;
      bladder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence refers to the involuntary loss of urine in sufficient amounts to be&#xD;
      considered a social or health problem. It is under-reported and under-treated as patients are&#xD;
      often ashamed and embarrassed to discuss their condition and clinicians may also fail to ask&#xD;
      patients about incontinence. This is a multi-center, open-label study including dose&#xD;
      conversion and dose determination to evaluate the safety of OROS® oxybutynin chloride at a&#xD;
      clinically acceptable dose. There are three study periods: Run-in, Dose&#xD;
      Conversion/Determination, and Maintenance. During the 1-week Run-in Period, baseline&#xD;
      incontinence, urinary frequency, and health related quality-of-life data are collected.&#xD;
      During the Dose Conversion/Determination Period, any previous urge urinary incontinence&#xD;
      medications are discontinued and each patient is started on OROS® oxybutynin chloride. The&#xD;
      dose is titrated to a clinically acceptable dose in 5-mg increments at 7 ± 3 day intervals to&#xD;
      a possible maximum dose of 30 mg/day. The clinically acceptable dose is defined as either the&#xD;
      minimum effective dose (i.e., the dose at which the patient has no incontinent episodes for&#xD;
      the last 2 days of the dosing interval) or the dose providing the best balance between&#xD;
      symptomatic improvement and side effects. Patients taking immediate-release oxybutynin at&#xD;
      enrollment started dose titration on OROS® oxybutynin chloride at a dose equal to their&#xD;
      immediate-release oxybutynin dose; all others started at 5 mg per day OROS® (oxybutynin&#xD;
      chloride). After the clinically acceptable dose is established, the patient continues for an&#xD;
      additional week at that dose to confirm that it is appropriate. Then the patient enters the&#xD;
      12-week Maintenance Period that evaluates whether the urge urinary incontinence reduction&#xD;
      that is achieved by the beginning of maintenance has persisted. The primary outcome of the&#xD;
      study is an evaluation of the safety of OROS® oxybutynin chloride. Safety assessments include&#xD;
      the incidence of adverse events, physical examination and medical history, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, urinalysis, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and the Physician's&#xD;
      Anticholinergic Effects Assessment (P-ACEA), an assessment completed by the physician if&#xD;
      severe or intolerable anticholinergic effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OROS® oxybutynin chloride (5 mg and 10 mg systems): One to five systems taken orally per day&#xD;
      (5 mg per day to a maximum of 30 mg per day) as a single morning dose. The duration of the&#xD;
      Maintenance Period of the study is 12 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with non-neurogenic urge urinary incontinence, neurogenic urge urinary&#xD;
             incontinence, or mixed urge urinary incontinence with a clinically significant urge&#xD;
             component&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently taking medications for urge urinary incontinence (that are listed&#xD;
             in the protocol) including immediate-release oxybutynin chloride, or patients not&#xD;
             currently taking medication for urge urinary incontinence who have had at least 6 urge&#xD;
             urinary incontinence episodes during the 1-week Run-in Period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able to differentiate incontinent episodes associated with urgency&#xD;
             from incontinent episodes not associated with urgency when recording incontinent&#xD;
             episodes in the diary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are in good general health prior to study participation, without&#xD;
             significant bacteria or fewer than 10 WBC/hpf on urinalysis, or a negative urine&#xD;
             culture&#xD;

             clinically significant medical problems or other organ abnormality or pathology for&#xD;
             whom, administration of oxybutynin chloride would present undue risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients who have had prostate surgery less than six months before study&#xD;
