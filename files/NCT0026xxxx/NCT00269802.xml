    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OROSÂ® Methylphenidate&#xD;
      HCl as compared with placebo and standard immediate-release RitalinÂ® (taken three time per&#xD;
      day) for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children. Both OROSÂ®&#xD;
      Methylphenidate HCl and RitalinÂ® contain the central nervous system stimulant,&#xD;
      methylphenidate HCl.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) represents the most common neurobehavioral&#xD;
      disorder in children, affecting 3% to 5% of the school-age population. Behavioral&#xD;
      pediatricians, child psychiatrists, and child neurologists indicate that referrals for ADHD&#xD;
      may constitute up to 50% of their practices. This is a multicenter, double-blind,&#xD;
      double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled, active-controlled, three-treatment, parallel&#xD;
      group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OROS® (methylphenidate HCl) with standard&#xD;
      immediate-release Ritalin® (three times a day), and placebo, in children with ADHD. Patients&#xD;
      are assigned to one of three treatments, depending upon their prestudy titrated therapeutic&#xD;
      dose and regimen, and are treated for 28 days. Patients will be given OROS® (methylphenidate&#xD;
      HCl), 18, 36 or 54 milligrams once daily, or Ritalin® 5, 10, or 15 milligrams&#xD;
      (encapsulated/single capsule) three times a day, or placebo. Efficacy is evaluated in the&#xD;
      community setting by teachers, parents and investigators using standardized attention and&#xD;
      behavior scales and other assessments. The primary measure of effectiveness is the teacher's&#xD;
      rating on study Day 27 on the IOWA Conners Inattention/Overactivity subscale. Additional&#xD;
      measures of effectiveness include the IOWA Conners Oppositional/Defiance subscale ratings,&#xD;
      peer interaction and other behavioral ratings, SNAP-IV ratings, global assessments of&#xD;
      efficacy, investigator Clinical Global Impression (CGI), home situation and the parent&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire. Safety evaluations include the incidence of adverse events,&#xD;
      physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, sleep quality, appetite, and&#xD;
      the presence/severity of tics (hard-to-control, repeated twitching of any parts of the body&#xD;
      or hard-to-control repeating of sounds or words). Patients will be given orally for 28 days:&#xD;
      OROS® (methylphenidate HCl), 1, 2, or 3 of the 18 milligram tablets once daily, or Ritalin®&#xD;
      5, 10, or 15 milligrams (encapsulated/single capsule) three times daily, or placebo&#xD;
