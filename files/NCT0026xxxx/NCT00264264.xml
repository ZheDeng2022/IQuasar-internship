  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemostasis at the arterial puncture site after percutaneous coronary interventions is&#xD;
      achieved by either placement of a puncture closure device or by delaying sheath removal for&#xD;
      hours to allow normalization of heparin induced anticoagulation. Both of these methods are&#xD;
      far from ideal. Delayed sheath removal poses a risk of recurrent bleeding, hematoma formation&#xD;
      and results in decreased patient mobility while the safety of closure devices has been called&#xD;
      into question by several recent reports. Due to the lack of definitive data, the arterial&#xD;
      access site management varies considerably between physicians and among institutions. The&#xD;
      proposed study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of arterial closure devices to achieve&#xD;
      hemostasis compared with immediate sheath removal after protamine administration followed by&#xD;
      direct compression after percutaneous coronary intervention procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most common procedure performed for&#xD;
      obstructive coronary artery disease with more than one million procedures performed annually&#xD;
      in United States alone1. Despite major advances in technology and operative expertise, the&#xD;
      optimum management of arterial access site after PCI procedures remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional practice of arterial access site management involves delaying of sheath&#xD;
      removal for several hours to allow normalization of heparin induced anticoagulation. This&#xD;
      delayed sheath removal poses a risk of recurrent bleeding and hematoma formation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, delayed sheath removal results in decreased patient mobility, increased patient&#xD;
      discomfort and requires frequent monitoring with an impact on nursing resources. The risks&#xD;
      associated with delayed sheath removal may be further increased by concomitant administration&#xD;
      of potent anti platelet therapy now routinely used in patients undergoing PCI2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial puncture closure devices (APCD) were developed to obtain immediate arterial access&#xD;
      site hemostasis after closed vascular procedures with an aim towards early patient&#xD;
      mobilization. Although the efficacy of APCD have been documented in several small studies but&#xD;
      limited information is available regarding their safety in diverse patient populations. A&#xD;
      recent meta analysis has shown increased vascular complication rate associated with the use&#xD;
      of these devices bringing the safety of their routine use into question3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to lack of definitive data, the arterial access site management varies considerably&#xD;
      between physicians and among institutions. APCD are routinely used by some centers4 while&#xD;
      others continue to delay arterial sheath removal for several hours after the procedure5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate sheath removal followed by direct compression though routinely practiced after&#xD;
      coronary angiographic procedures is not used after PCI procedures due to the intra procedural&#xD;
      administration of heparin resulting in prolonged anticoagulation. Reversal of heparin with&#xD;
      protamine may allow immediate sheath removal resulting in early patient ambulation and&#xD;
      decreased access site vascular complications. The safety and efficacy of intravenous&#xD;
      protamine administration for reversal of heparin is well established by its routine use in&#xD;
      cardiovascular surgery for several decades6 and recent reports showing safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      this method for early sheath removal after PCI procedures7-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of immediate sheath&#xD;
      removal followed by direct compression as compared to the use of APCD to achieve hemostasis&#xD;
      after PCI.&#xD;
