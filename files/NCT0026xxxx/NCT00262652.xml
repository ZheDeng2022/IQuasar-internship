    <textblock>
      Sodium pyruvate in sodium chloride solution will be delivered by nebulization to the lungs.&#xD;
      It is believed that this administration will produce bronchodilation in asthmatics as&#xD;
      determined by improvement in FEV1. FEV1 is a measure of lung function, and will be determined&#xD;
      after administration of sodium pyruvate. The study is a blinded, so subjects may receive&#xD;
      either the sodium pyruvate or a sodium chloride placebo. The primary endpoint will be the&#xD;
      improvement of FEV1 after 15 minutes in subjects receiving sodium pyruvate compared to the&#xD;
      FEV1 of subjects receiving the sodium chloride placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sodium Pyruvate, an intermediate metabolite, has been investigated as a therapeutic agent to&#xD;
      reduce reactive oxygen species in the lung. Evaluation of FEV1 as a safety parameter and&#xD;
      sequela of reactive oxygen species reduction identified inhaled Sodium Pyruvate as a&#xD;
      potential bronchodilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of lung diseases are typically characterized by marked inflammation at the site of&#xD;
      the lung injury. This inflammatory process leads to further destruction of surrounding&#xD;
      healthy lung tissue, and a continuation and expansion of the sites of inflammation. This&#xD;
      inflammatory process results in the production of reactive oxygen species, including&#xD;
      superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, at the site of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitric oxide is a known bronchodilator, as well as a vasodilator. It has been used&#xD;
      successfully used to treat patients with various pulmonary disorders. 1 When endogenous&#xD;
      nitric oxide is exposed to oxygen radicals, however, it is converted to the toxic oxidant&#xD;
      nitrogen dioxide, and its bronchodilating effect is mitigated. Conversely, nitrogen dioxide&#xD;
      is a known deep lung irritant. Its adverse consequences include the following: pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammation; reduced levels of lung antioxidants 2; impairment of respiratory defense&#xD;
      mechanisms leading to increased susceptibility to respiratory pathogens 3 and increased&#xD;
      incidence and severity of respiratory infections; reduced lung function, and increased asthma&#xD;
      and COPD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anions, are known to compromise lung function&#xD;
      by increasing bronchoconstriction. As a result of the increasing inflammation and the&#xD;
      production of reactive oxygen species, and the decrease in nitric oxide that is believed to&#xD;
      occur with the interstitial lung diseases, healthy tissue is damaged and lung function is&#xD;
      compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our present understanding of the disease process involved with these lung diseases,&#xD;
      it appears that an intervention in the inflammatory process that would result in a reduction&#xD;
      in reactive oxygen species and a subsequent increase in nitric oxide could be an effective&#xD;
      way to intervene in the disease process. This intervention would prevent the further spread&#xD;
      of inflammation and lung damage caused by the production of reactive oxygen species, such as&#xD;
      superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, and increase lung function by increasing&#xD;
      bronchodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium pyruvate is a reactive oxygen species antagonist that has been shown to neutralize&#xD;
      oxygen radicals, specifically lowering the overproduction of superoxide anions, regulate the&#xD;
      production and level of other inflammatory mediators, and increase the synthesis of nitric&#xD;
      oxide. 4 Sodium pyruvate also increases cellular levels of glutathione, a major cellular&#xD;
      antioxidant, which is reduced dramatically in antigen-induced lung disease patients. 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pilot studies in mild asthmatic subjects, it was demonstrated that inhalation of low doses&#xD;
      (0.5 mM) of nebulized sodium pyruvate decreased expired hydrogen peroxide by 30% at four&#xD;
      hours compared to inhalation of a nebulized saline control. These subjects also experienced&#xD;
      increased pulmonary function as determined by FEV1 (+12.8%) and PEF (+34.5%) measurements&#xD;
      after four hours (referenced in Cellular Sciences IND #50,089). It is theorized that the&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species antagonist properties of sodium pyruvate reduced the production of&#xD;
      oxygen radicals, including hydrogen peroxide, and increased the levels of nitric oxide.&#xD;
      Together, this led to reduced inflammation and lung damage, and increased lung function&#xD;
      through improved bronchodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, it is believed that inhalation of sodium pyruvate will reduce the lung damage&#xD;
      resulting from the increase in reactive oxygen species associated with the inflammation&#xD;
      component of the disease, and will enhances the availability of nitric oxide to produce&#xD;
      bronchodilation by enhancing its synthesis and protecting it from destruction by reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Clinical Protocol Hypothesis: Sodium Pyruvate delivered by nebulization to the&#xD;
      lungs produces bronchodilation in asthmatics as measured by FEV1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intent: Provide support for further drug development of nebulized Sodium Pyruvate as a&#xD;
      therapeutic agent in asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 52 completed subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment 1: 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate in 0.9% saline solution, (5ml) (Cellular Sciences, CA)&#xD;
      nebulized via a Pari LC Plus(R) reusable nebulizer powered by a ProNeb(R) compressor&#xD;
      (Midlothian, VA) Treatment 2: Saline 0.9%, (5ml) (Baxter) nebulized using the same nebulizer&#xD;
      system as above A randomization algorithm using random permuted blocks (4-8 subjects) will be&#xD;
      used to generate treatment order assignments. An unblinded statistician will generate this&#xD;
      list of treatment order assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment and Selection The large cohort of potential subjects who have previously&#xD;
      participated in asthma studies through our clinical research laboratory will be apprised of&#xD;
      the study. Patients attending the UCLA Asthma and Cough Center will also be informed of the&#xD;
      study. Advertisements will be sent by regular mail and by e-mail to physicians participating&#xD;
      in the UCLA Healthcare System and to local pulmonologists practicing throughout the Los&#xD;
      Angeles area. Local Allergists who collaborate with us in common clinical trial protocols&#xD;
      will be informed of the study by personalized letter and e-mail. Advertisements will be&#xD;
      placed in the classified and/or health sections of local newspapers. A description of the&#xD;
      study will be posted on internet sites featuring clinical research trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited until a total of 52 complete the study. Assuming a 5% drop-out and&#xD;
      non-compliance rate, we expect a total of 55 subjects recruited Patient Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
