    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abciximab, an&#xD;
      anti-platelet therapy, versus placebo in patients with unstable angina who are not responding&#xD;
      to standard medical therapy and who are eligible for coronary angioplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      abciximab, an anti-platelet therapy, in patients with unstable angina who are not responding&#xD;
      to standard medical therapy and who are eligible for coronary angioplasty. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes of the study include any of the following within 30 days: the number of deaths from&#xD;
      any cause, myocardial infarctions or the number of recurrent ischemic events requiring urgent&#xD;
      intervention (such as a coronary artery bypass surgery, repeat coronary angioplasty, coronary&#xD;
      stent placement, or intra-aortic balloon pump). Please see attached results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with abciximab or matching placebo.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory angina as evidenced by at least one episode of ischemia&#xD;
             (chest pain and/or ST-T changes) despite bed rest and at least 2 hours of treatment&#xD;
             with oral or intravenous nitrates and intravenous heparin, or persistent newly&#xD;
             developed negative T-waves occurring or continuing after at least 2 hours of treatment&#xD;
             with oral or intravenous nitrates and intravenous heparin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having clinical signs and symptoms of angina at rest or minimal exertion with dynamic&#xD;
             ST-segment and/or T-wave changes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having an episode of chest pain within 48 hours prior to the start of study agent&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having a culprit lesion in a single native coronary vessel suitable for angioplasty on&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction, unless CK has returned to less&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Having features of ongoing ischemia that would require immediate intervention, or had&#xD;
             a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within the past 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having an unprotected occlusion of the main left coronary artery &gt; 50%, a culprit&#xD;
             lesion located in a venous or arterial bypass graft, or recent bleeding or a condition&#xD;
             associated with increased bleeding risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving concurrent administration of oral anticoagulants at the time of study entry,&#xD;
             administration of intravenous dextran (prior to or planned for use during&#xD;
             angioplasty), or planned administration of thrombolytic agent prior to or during&#xD;
             angioplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having persistent hypertension at admission despite treatment, or a platelet count&#xD;
             less than 100,000 per millimeter cubed&#xD;
