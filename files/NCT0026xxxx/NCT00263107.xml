  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telerounding is the use of wireless remote video-confrencing to assess hospitalized patients.&#xD;
      Physicians thus rely on all ususal data collected during bedside rounds with the exeption of&#xD;
      a direct physical exam. The intention of this study is to determine if post-operative&#xD;
      morbidity can be identified in an accurate and timely manner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Design: Two hundred seventy patients were recruited from three sites into a prospective&#xD;
      multi-center randomized trial. Participating institutions were the University of California,&#xD;
      Davis Medical Center (Sacramento CA), Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore MD) and Sentara&#xD;
      Health (Norfolk VA). Internal Review Board approval was granted at each institution&#xD;
      independently. The study population consisted of patients scheduled for urologic surgery,&#xD;
      over age 18, and able to read and understand English. Patients undergoing the following&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedures were offered participation: nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy,&#xD;
      nephroureterectomy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, partial ureterectomy, and radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy. Patients had an expected hospital stay of 24 to 72 hours. Eligible patients&#xD;
      who were unable to provide consent or who do not wish to participate in the study received&#xD;
      the standard of care provided at each institution. A total of two hundred seventy patients&#xD;
      consented to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: A stratified block scheme was used for randomization. Participating patients&#xD;
      were randomized to either: standard daily bedside rounding by the attending surgeon (control&#xD;
      arm), or daily telerounding only by the attending surgeon (intervention arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was differences in rates of attending&#xD;
      surgeon-identified complications between standard rounds and telerounds. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures included differences in length of stay and patient reported satisfaction&#xD;
      with their hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: Consenting patients had their scheduled surgery and received the standard&#xD;
      peri-operative and immediate post-operative care. All patients were managed with a rapid&#xD;
      recovery protocol. This included: liquid diet beginning twelve hours after surgery with&#xD;
      immediate advancement as tolerated; complete blood count, serum electrolytes, BUN and&#xD;
      creatnine in the recovery room and each morning until discharge; and usual nursing data&#xD;
      recorded each shift. These data points included oral temperature, blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, fluid intake, fluid output, and pain scale Once transferred to the patient&#xD;
      floor, all patients communicated with their attending physician on a daily basis. The visit,&#xD;
      either at the bedside or via telerounds followed a set scripting. The visit was conducted&#xD;
      between the patient and the attending without other staff present. The focus of the visit was&#xD;
      review of objective data (vital signs, fluid balances and laboratory values), subjective data&#xD;
      (cursory abdominal exam if at the bedside and evaluation of drain effluent) and a discussion&#xD;
      of the anticipated goals for the day. Visit duration was timed. Intervention patients could&#xD;
      remove themselves from the study at any time by requesting a bedside visit by the attending&#xD;
      physician. Telerounding concluded with either the hospital discharge or identification of a&#xD;
      major post-operative complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions: A major complication was defined as an event that required transfer to a&#xD;
      monitored setting. Minor complications included events that delay discharge greater than 24&#xD;
      hours beyond the expected length of stay. For example (but not limited to): post-operative&#xD;
      ileus, drop in hematocrit, prolonged drain output or fever Event monitoring: Identification&#xD;
      of complications was recorded prospectively. Usual resident-level bedside rounds were&#xD;
      maintained throughout the study. The resident team and the attending surgeon recorded&#xD;
      identified events independently, thus allowing for evaluation of concordance. This dual&#xD;
      rounding design served as a minimally acceptable standard as stipulated by the various&#xD;
      internal review boards. As a precondition of IRB approval, identification of an event&#xD;
      required notification of the attending surgeon in a timely fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument: We utilized a validated 21-item questionnaire to evaluate patient ratings of&#xD;
      their hospital care. Items regarding postoperative care were designed using an extensively&#xD;
      tested and validated response scale (1, poor to 5, excellent). Item stems were modified from&#xD;
      Patient Judgments of Hospital Quality to make them more salient to the postoperative&#xD;
      experience. Five items asked patients to rate their baseline health status as well as their&#xD;
      health status during the hospitalization. Seven items asked patients to evaluate aspects of&#xD;
      the care they received while an in-patient. Nine items asked those randomized to the&#xD;
      telerounding arm to evaluate the telecommunications system and to indicate their level of&#xD;
      interest in having this system incorporated into usual post-operative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device: The telerounding robot is a 60-inch tall wheel driven device. The robot consists of&#xD;
      the motor base unit, Pentium III CPU, high definition digital camera, flat screen monitor and&#xD;
      microphone. Data to and from the robot is transferred over a high-speed wireless network and&#xD;
      integrated with proprietary software. The physician connects remotely to the robot via a base&#xD;
      station. The base station consists of a Pentium III desktop computer, high definition digital&#xD;
      camera, flat screen monitor, microphone and joystick controller. Each of the institutions&#xD;
      used identical technology. Prior testing of the system demonstrated imperceptible video and&#xD;
      audio delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Plan: The primary endpoint of the study is patient morbidity. The expected rate of&#xD;
      complication (major and minor) after a laparoscopic urologic procedure is 16%. Based on our&#xD;
      power calculation, a total of 270 patients (135 in each arm) were required to detect a 1%&#xD;
      difference in complication at the 0.05 alpha level and the 0.8 beta level. Continuous&#xD;
      variables were compared using student T-test. Proportions were compared using chi-square&#xD;
      analysis. Logistic regression was reserved for adjustments based on observed statistical&#xD;
      differences in baseline demographic data.&#xD;
