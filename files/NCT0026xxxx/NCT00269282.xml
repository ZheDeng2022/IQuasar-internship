      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of two home-based asthma&#xD;
      interventions in increasing adherence to daily asthma controller medication.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity,&#xD;
      including excess risk of emergency department (ED) care, hospitalization, and death from&#xD;
      asthma, compared to white adolescents. Research by this group and others has documented that&#xD;
      non-adherence with asthma treatment regimens is common among high-risk, inner city families&#xD;
      with asthma, and that this poor adherence with prescribed therapies plays a significant&#xD;
      contributing role in asthma morbidity. Inner-city adolescents with asthma are at particular&#xD;
      risk of non-adherence, yet this population remains understudied. While asthma self-management&#xD;
      training has shown promise in achieving some improvement in adherence with asthma, there are&#xD;
      few intervention studies explicitly targeting adolescents, particularly those in the&#xD;
      inner-city. Urban children typically assume primary control over their asthma management&#xD;
      during late childhood/early adolescence. At the same time, adolescents' efforts to achieve&#xD;
      autonomy and peer-acceptance may result in increased health risk behaviors, including poor&#xD;
      asthma self-management. Developmentally-appropriate asthma self-management interventions are&#xD;
      needed that target the unique challenges of adolescence. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a&#xD;
      promising interventional approach that uses a client-centered, non-directive approach for&#xD;
      enhancing motivation to change health behaviors. MI techniques are developmentally consistent&#xD;
      with the needs of early adolescents. MI does not assume that health will be the most&#xD;
      important factor motivating the teen, but rather acknowledges and incorporates other&#xD;
      motivators that are within the context of the teen's life, thus this intervention strategy&#xD;
      has the flexibility to adapt to the unique life circumstances and stressors faced by urban&#xD;
      adolescents. We propose to evaluate the relative effectiveness of a MI-focused&#xD;
      self-management intervention (MI+SM) compared to a self-management (SM) intervention&#xD;
      containing asthma education and self-monitoring strategies in a sample of 226 children age&#xD;
      10-15 years treated for asthma in the ED. Our primary hypothesis is that the MI+SM, as&#xD;
      compared to SM alone, will result in greater improvement in medication adherence at 3- and&#xD;
      6-months post-randomization, as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include self-reported medication adherence, symptoms free days, urgent health care&#xD;
      utilization for asthma, and caregiver/adolescent quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1) Self-Management (SM; Standard Care Group) or 2)&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing plus Self-Management Training (MI+SM; Intervention Group). The&#xD;
      duration of the intervention condition will be 5 home visits over 2 months. Follow-up&#xD;
      measures will be collected from families at 3- and 6-months post-randomization.&#xD;
