  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eisenmenger's syndrome presents as a severe clinical picture of polymorbidity that&#xD;
      constitutes a great burden at the individual as well as the familial and social level. The&#xD;
      combination of critically increased pulmonary vascular resistance, progressive pressure load&#xD;
      of the right ventricle and disturbance of pulmonary gas exchange result in long-term&#xD;
      polymorbidity. The objective of this study is to look into the effects of medium-term&#xD;
      pulmonary pressure-lowering treatment with oral bosentan in patients with congenital heart&#xD;
      defects and clinically relevant pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), taking advantage of&#xD;
      extensive diagnostic procedures.&#xD;

      Eisenmenger's syndrome presents as a severe clinical picture of polymorbidity that&#xD;
      constitutes a great burden at the individual as well as the familial and social level. The&#xD;
      combination of critically increased pulmonary vascular resistance, progressive pressure load&#xD;
      of the right ventricle and disturbance of pulmonary gas exchange result in long-term&#xD;
      polymorbidity. While the patient's ability to care for him-/ herself gets lost over time, the&#xD;
      financial burden due to the need for medical consultations and hospital stays increases. This&#xD;
      is distressing to both the patient and the family. Usually, death results from cardiac&#xD;
      decompensation in the presence of gradually increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and&#xD;
      hypoxic lesion of organs including the myocardium (Hopkins, AJC 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying pulmonary hypertension, novel&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches have been developed during the past few years. These include a)&#xD;
      inhibition of the NO-cGMP-degrading type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) and b) antagonising the&#xD;
      endothelin system (Krum, Curr Opin Investig Drugs 2003). The goal is a dilatation of the&#xD;
      abnormally constricted pulmonary arterial vessels by relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle&#xD;
      cells with a reversal of pulmonary vascular remodelling (Ghofrani, Pneumologie 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific drugs affecting pulmonary vascular resistance have been studied. Intravenous&#xD;
      prostacyclin has major disadvantages: high cost, tachyphylaxis, risk of infection and rebound&#xD;
      hypertension upon discontinuation. Inhalative pulmonary vasodilators, in particular iloprost,&#xD;
      may be effective in primary pulmonary hypertension (Olschewski, Ann Int Med 1996; Hoeper,&#xD;
      Pneumologie 2001), but administration is time-consuming, and due to its mode of application&#xD;
      its effects are intermittent, lasting only about 75 minutes (Hoeper, JACC 2000). Considering&#xD;
      this, oral treatments appear preferable, because of easy administration and, hence, better&#xD;
      patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bosentan (Tracleer®) is a non-selective endothelin receptor antagonist with dual binding (ETA&#xD;
      and ETB) and complete blocking of endothelin-1. It is the first drug of this class that was&#xD;
      approved for the lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance. Significant effects on&#xD;
      haemodynamics and exercise tolerance were demonstrated for both monotherapy (Galie, J Am Coll&#xD;
      Cardiol 2003; Rubin, N Engl J Med 2002) and add-on treatment with inhalational and parenteral&#xD;
      prostanoids (Hoeper, Eur Respir J 2003). In children with at least 10 kg body weight,&#xD;
      bosentan significantly improved pulomary haemodynamics, while pharmacokinetics was found to&#xD;
      be comparable to that in adults (Bars, Clin Pharmacol Ther 2003). Good long-term tolerability&#xD;
      and effectiveness over a period of one year were demonstrated (Sitbon, Chest 2003). Moreover,&#xD;
      in animal models of increased pulmonary blood flow activation of the endothelin system was&#xD;
      absent under bosentan treatment and both haemodynamic and morphological changes were&#xD;
      prevented. Available data suggest that the effects of bosentan are not limited to primary&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension. Further studies are required to prove its effectiveness in pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension of various aetiologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to look into the effects of medium-term pulmonary&#xD;
      pressure-lowering treatment with oral bosentan in patients with congenital heart defects and&#xD;
      clinically relevant pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), taking advantage of extensive&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures. The data obtained are supposed to contribute to the development of&#xD;
      guidelines for the treatment of PAH caused by congenital heart defects. The data will be&#xD;
      further evaluated in terms of health economics (network subproject &quot;Health Economics&quot;,&#xD;
      project manager: Prof. Dr. med. Karl W. Lauterbach).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bosentan specifically improves the pulomonary vascular damage caused by&#xD;
           hypercirculation. As an immediate effect, it blocks vasoconstriction, and on the long&#xD;
           run, it reverts pulmonary vascular remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome, this results in a decrease in pulmonary&#xD;
           vascular resistance and a normalization of pulmonary vascular responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This is followed by an increase in lung perfusion and systemic oxygen supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient benefits from an improvement in his/her clinical condition and exercise&#xD;
           tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These hypotheses will be tested by comparing findings of the following examinations before&#xD;
      and immediately after the 24-week treatment with bosentan: clinical examination, ECG,&#xD;
      echocardiography, CPX, MRT, cardiac catheterization with pulmonary artery manometry, and&#xD;
      laboratory tests. As a secondary objective, the degree of concordance of findings of&#xD;
      different invasive and non-invasive examinations and diagnostic procedures will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
