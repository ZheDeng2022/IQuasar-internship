      Patients undergoing surgery (thyroidectomy and hysterectomy) will postoperatively receive&#xD;
      oxycodone intravenously (IV) as pain management with morphine as an escape medicine, if there&#xD;
      is insufficient pain relief with oxycodone. Patients' pain and side effects will be&#xD;
      registered and after 24 hours they will answer a questionnaire. All included patients will be&#xD;
      genotyped accordingly to CYP2D6 and relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and&#xD;
      measures of plasma levels of oxycodone will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid with an analgesic effect in the postoperative pain&#xD;
      management comparable to morphine. Oxycodone is N-demethylated by CYP2D6 to its active&#xD;
      metabolite oxymorphone, a potent μ-receptor agonist. A genetic polymorphism divides a&#xD;
      Caucasian population into two groups: 8% with an enzyme lacking activity, poor metabolizers&#xD;
      (PM) and the rest with normal CYP2D6 activity, extensive metabolizers (EM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many different, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are responsible for interindividual&#xD;
      differences in the effect of opioids. Among these are the A118G SNP in the μ-receptor gene&#xD;
      OPRM1 and the C3435T and G2677T/A SNPs in the MDR-1 gene of P-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein is&#xD;
      responsible for the absorption, excretion and transport of many drugs including opioids over&#xD;
      the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive the first Oxycodone dosis of 5 mg iv at the end of the surgery. If&#xD;
      their pain is not sufficiently relieved they can be given maximum two times Oxycodone 5 mg iv&#xD;
      in the recovery room. If still not sufficiently pain relieved they will be given escape&#xD;
      medication (Morphine 5 mg iv) until sufficient pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further pain treatment will be by Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) with bolus doses of&#xD;
      Oxycodone 2 mg iv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 24 hours postoperatively the patients pain and side effects will be&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three blood samples will be drawn: 1. approximately 30 minutes after first Oxycodone dosis,&#xD;
      2. before leaving the recovery room a couple of hours after surgery and 3. 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery. From these samples plasma levels of Oxycodone and its metabolites will be determined&#xD;
      and the genotype of CYP2D6 and the above mentioned SNPs will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be divided into two groups: Responder and Non-responder. The Responders are&#xD;
      characterized by no use of escape medication (morphine) and satisfaction with pain management&#xD;
      in final questionnaire. The Non-responders are characterized by use of escape medicine and/or&#xD;
      dissatisfaction with pain management in final questionnaire.&#xD;
