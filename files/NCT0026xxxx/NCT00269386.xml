  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clarithromycin may be an effective therapy in Crohn's disease. It is a broad spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotic. Crohn's disease, the investigators think, is in some way related to bacteria,&#xD;
      which reside in the bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of different types of antibiotic in Crohn's disease have shown encouraging&#xD;
      results. Clarithromycin alters the bacteria in the bowel and gets into cells in the bowel&#xD;
      which may contain bacteria. There is some evidence that clarithromycin can stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system and improve the function of cells involved in killing bacteria in the bowel.&#xD;

      WHAT IS THE PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of effective cure for Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective symptomatic treatment of Crohn's disease can be achieved in approximately 60-80%&#xD;
      using corticosteroids [1] with a similar response to enteral or intravenous feeding. The&#xD;
      benefit is usually short-term however, with more than 50% relapsing within a year [2] and&#xD;
      over 90% of patients with ileocaecal disease eventually requiring at least one surgical&#xD;
      operation [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown but it is commonly believed to be due in some way to&#xD;
      bacteria: either as an unusual response to the normal intestinal flora or possibly to a&#xD;
      specific infection such as an atypical bacterium. It is typified histologically by the&#xD;
      presence of granulomata (in over 75% of cases) and closely resembles intestinal tuberculosis,&#xD;
      radiologically and histologically. A search for Mycobacteria has produced conflicting results&#xD;
      with one centre claiming that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis DNA can be detected in the&#xD;
      majority of cases [4] but with others finding Mycobacterial DNA in only about 10% [5].&#xD;
      Studies have shown that a variety of organisms including normal intestinal bacteria and&#xD;
      yeasts can be grown from Crohn's disease mesenteric lymph nodes and that the lymphocytes&#xD;
      within these lymph nodes are manufacturing antibodies that are directed against a broad range&#xD;
      of bacterial antigens so it is a more widely held view that a wide range of micro-organisms&#xD;
      invade the mucosa in Crohn's disease, possibly as a result of a breakdown in the normal&#xD;
      mucosal barrier [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED?&#xD;
&#xD;
      That clarithromycin may be an effective therapy in Crohn's disease. It is a broad spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotic that has particularly good penetration into macrophages [7] and may therefore be&#xD;
      effective at eradicating the organisms at the centre of the granulomatous reaction in Crohn's&#xD;
      disease. There is also some evidence suggesting that macrolide antibiotics can stimulate&#xD;
      macrophage proliferation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis and cytocidal activitity [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHY IS A TRIAL NEEDED NOW?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label studies have shown promising results with Clarithromycin. A study published in&#xD;
      abstract by Present's group in New York reported a response in 7/12 (58%) whose Crohn's&#xD;
      disease activity index (CDAI) fell by a mean of 130 points (range 79-130) in response to&#xD;
      clarithromycin 500 mg bd for 6 weeks [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW BEEN CARRIED OUT AND WHAT WERE THE FINDINGS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Medline search for &quot; clarithromycin and Crohn's disease&quot; yields only three responses. The&#xD;
      first is the report of an open-label study of a combination of clarithromycin 250 mg bd (or&#xD;
      azithromycin in 3 patients) and rifabutin 450 mg per day given for a mean of 18 months to 52&#xD;
      patients by the St George's Hospital group who are the major protagonists of the&#xD;
      Mycobacterium paratuberculosis hypothesis [10] . They report a response in terms of&#xD;
      &quot;significant fall in Harvey Bradshaw Index&quot; in 93% but CDAI was not reported and many of the&#xD;
      patients seem to have had rather modest elevations of Harvey Bradshaw index on entry. Ten of&#xD;
      the patients also received a quinolone antibiotic and a further 5 received clofazimine. The&#xD;
      other two are reports of clarithromycin in Mycobacterium haemophilum infection including at&#xD;
      least one in a case of apparent Crohn's disease. Review of American Gastroenterological&#xD;
      Association abstracts for the past three years yielded reference [9] and an Australian study&#xD;
      of a triple therapy regimen for Mycobacteria that consisted of rifabutin 450 mg per day,&#xD;
      clarithromycin 750 mg per day, clofazimine 2 mg per kg. Twelve patients were treated for 8-12&#xD;
      months and 10/12 achieved &quot;near complete control&quot; [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOW WILL THE RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL BE USED? This trial will establish whether clarithromycin&#xD;
      is effective in achieving remission in Crohn's disease and would be a significant advance in&#xD;
      non-steroid treatment of active Crohn's disease. If a significant positive result is observed&#xD;
      then further trials of prolonged treatment would be indicated to assess clarithromycin's&#xD;
      effect on the prevention of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT ARE THE PLANNED TRIAL INTERVENTIONS? Patients will receive either (i) Clarithromycin S/R&#xD;
      1g od or (ii) placebo tablets of identical size, colour and taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED DURATION OF THE TREATMENT PERIOD? Clarithromycin or placebo therapy will&#xD;
      continue for three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WILL HEALTH SERVICE RESEARCH ISSUES BE ADDRESSED? Not Applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY/DURATION OF FOLLOW UP? Patients will be reviewed after one,&#xD;
      two and four weeks and then monthly for the following two months of treatment. Follow up&#xD;
      thereafter will then be in the gastroenterology outpatient clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOW WILL THE OUTCOME MEASURES BE MEASURED AT FOLLOW-UP? CDAI will be calculated at baseline&#xD;
      and at each subsequent follow up from the patient's symptom scoring diary, haematocrit and&#xD;
      weight. Similarly the van Hees index will be calculated and serum CRP measured. The IBD&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire will be completed at baseline and at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also have a diary card to record the details of any other symptoms noted during&#xD;
      the trial to assess adverse effects of the trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR ALLOCATING PATIENTS TO TRIAL GROUPS?&#xD;
      Randomisation will be allocated by the pharmacy department of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED METHODS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST OTHER SOURCES OF BIAS? Controls (known&#xD;
      only to the Pharmacy Department) will receive placebo tablets which are identical in size&#xD;
      colour and taste. Patients will be stratified according to site of disease into 3 groups:&#xD;
      colonic CD only, perianal disease only and others (ileocolonic, small bowel only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED SAMPLE SIZE? 39 patients in each group (active treatment and placebo)&#xD;
      gives a 90% power of excluding a response of 60% (p2) compared to 20% (p1) for placebo at&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 [16]. The published placebo response rate in active CD being 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE PLANNED RECRUITMENT RATE? 5 patients per month&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARE THERE LIKELY TO BE ANY PROBLEMS WITH COMPLIANCE? Compliance will be assessed by the&#xD;
      number of returned tablets and assessed as good (&lt;25% returned, fair 25-50% returned and poor&#xD;
      (&gt;50% returned).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE LIKELY RATE OF LOSS TO FOLLOW UP? 100% follow up should be achievable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOW MANY CENTRES WILL BE INVOLVED? One&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED TYPE OF ANALYSIS? For the primary outcome measure the difference in&#xD;
      proportions will be calculated with associated 95% confidence intervals. Formal hypothesis&#xD;
      testing of the primary outcome will then be compared by chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables will be compared using repeated measures analysis taking into account&#xD;
      the distribution of each variable [17]&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY OF ANALYSIS? Once only on completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARE THERE ANY PLANNED SUBGROUP ANALYSES? Data from patients in each stratified group will be&#xD;
      examined separately but formal statistical analysis between the subgroups will use a test for&#xD;
      interaction (Altman DG. Practical Statistics for Medical Research. Chapman &amp; Hall. London.&#xD;
      1991). We anticipate though, that the main outcome data will be presented for all the&#xD;
      patients together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED RESEARCH COST OF THE TRIAL? To be discussed. Part funding will be&#xD;
      required for research nurse and drug trials pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IS THERE AN NHS SERVICE SUPPORT COST OF THIS TRIAL, AND IF SO WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED COST? The&#xD;
      only NHS cost would be modest, involving only the routine testing of full blood count and CRP&#xD;
      which is current practice in the monitoring of patients with relapses of inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVER WHAT PERIOD IS FUNDING REQUESTED? Funding is requested for a 2 year period to cover the&#xD;
      primary trial.&#xD;
