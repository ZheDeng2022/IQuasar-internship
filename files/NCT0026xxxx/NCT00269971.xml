  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine an effective dose of epoetin alfa to be&#xD;
      administered prior to surgery, to decrease the need for blood transfusions during hip&#xD;
      replacement. Epoetin alfa is a genetically engineered protein that stimulates red blood cell&#xD;
      production.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major surgical procedures may require blood transfusions both during and after the operation.&#xD;
      Agents that can increase the rate of red blood cell production would reduce the need for&#xD;
      blood transfusions. Epoetin alfa is a genetically engineered form of a natural hormone,&#xD;
      erythropoietin, that stimulates red blood cell production. This is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, multicenter study in patients scheduled for first time hip replacement surgery.&#xD;
      The study compares the effectiveness of 2 different doses of epoetin alfa (20,000 units or&#xD;
      40,000 units per week) for reducing the need for blood transfusions during the surgery.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: epoetin alfa&#xD;
      20,000 units per week, epoetin alfa 40,000 units per week, or placebo. Patients will be&#xD;
      treated with study medication once a week for 4 weeks before their scheduled surgery.&#xD;
      Effectiveness will be determined by the number of transfusions required during surgery. Other&#xD;
      factors that determine effectiveness will be: the level of hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying&#xD;
      component of red blood cells) and the percentage of red blood cells in the patient's blood&#xD;
      (hematocrit) prior to surgery; the number of developing red blood cells (reticulocytes); the&#xD;
      iron stores in the patient's blood prior to surgery; the patient's quality of life after the&#xD;
      surgery; and the time that elapses after surgery before the patient is discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital. Safety evaluations will include the incidence of blood clots in the deep veins, the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of other adverse events, and changes in clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      vital signs, and physical examination findings throughout the study. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that patients treated with epoetin alfa before hip replacement surgery will require fewer&#xD;
      blood transfusions during the surgery compared with patients treated with placebo, and that&#xD;
      the lower epoetin alfa dose (20,000 units per week) is as effective as the higher epoetin&#xD;
      alfa dose (40,000 units per week). Patients will receive 20,000 units or 40,000 units of&#xD;
      epoetin alfa injected under the skin once weekly for 4 weeks, or a matching placebo injection&#xD;
      containing human serum albumin.&#xD;
