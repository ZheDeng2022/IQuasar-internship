      The specific aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test hypotheses regarding the influence of cigarette tax on the consumption of cigarette and&#xD;
      other addictive goods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that the imposition of earmarked tax of cigarettes will cause decrease&#xD;
      of cigarette consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that the imposition of earmarked tax of alcohol will cause the&#xD;
      substitution of consumption of domestic and imported cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that the imposition of earmarked tax of cigarettes will cause the&#xD;
      substitution of consumption of high-priced and low-priced cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that the imposition of earmarked tax of cigarettes will cause decrease&#xD;
      of the consumption of other addictive goods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that the imposition of earmarked tax of alcohol will cause decrease of&#xD;
      alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that the imposition of earmarked tax of alcohol will cause decrease of&#xD;
      the consumption of other addictive goods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that price effect of earmarked cigarette tax on addicted smokers is&#xD;
      less than on non-addicted smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that price effect earmarked cigarette tax on heavy smokers is less&#xD;
      than on light and moderate smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that earmarked cigarette tax and alcohol tax are regressive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test hypotheses regarding the influence of information, knowledge attitude on cigarette&#xD;
      smoking and smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that exposure to anti-smoking information is negatively related to&#xD;
      cigarette smoking and positively related to smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that exposure to information on cigarette promotion is positively&#xD;
      related to cigarette smoking and negatively related to smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that people perceiving high risk of cigarette smoking are less likely&#xD;
      to smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that highly risk averse people are less likely to smoke.&#xD;
