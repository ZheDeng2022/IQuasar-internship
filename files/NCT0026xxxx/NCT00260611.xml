      The primary objective for this study is to evaluate PSA response rates (response will be&#xD;
      defined as a &gt; 50% reduction in PSA levels) in men who have failed primary chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to compare progression free survival, disease free survival, overall&#xD;
      survival, and toxicity (tolerance/safety).&#xD;

      This is a single institution phase II study of oxaliplatin and Taxotere in patients with&#xD;
      androgen independent prostate cancer previously treated with up to two cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens. During this study, the efficacy and safety of this combination will be evaluated.&#xD;
      The primary objective for this study is to evaluate PSA response rates (response will be&#xD;
      defined as a &gt; 50% reduction in PSA levels) in men who have failed primary chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to compare progression free survival, disease free survival, overall&#xD;
      survival, and toxicity (tolerance/safety). There will be up to 35 male subjects &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
      of age enrolled on this single institution study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma consistent clinically&#xD;
        and histologically with carcinoma of the prostate Confirmed androgen independent prostate&#xD;
        cancer (progression despite castrate levels of serum testosterone) Measurable or evaluable&#xD;
        disease (PSA elevation will constitute evaluable disease) 18 years of age. Because no&#xD;
        dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of oxaliplatin in patients&#xD;
        &lt; 18 years of age, they are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life expectancy of greater than 3 months. ECOG Performance status of 0-1. No more than 2&#xD;
        prior regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Androgen deprivation (castration or LHRH&#xD;
        analogue), and prior antiandrogens allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be off bicalutamide or nilutamide &gt; 42 days, megestrol or flutamide &gt; 28&#xD;
        days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent bisphosphonate therapy allowed. Patients with prior radiotherapy for treatment&#xD;
        of their bony metastases will be included if time since radiation is &gt; 4 weeks, and if PSA&#xD;
        is clearly rising.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have acceptable organ function as defined as: :WBC &gt; 2500/mm3 or ANC &gt;&#xD;
        1500/mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL, platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3; Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL,&#xD;
        SGOT/SGPT &lt; 2 x ULN (&lt; 4 x ULN if liver metastases present), PT/PTT normal; Creatinine &lt;&#xD;
        1.8 mg/dL Adequate neurologic function defined as no clinically significant peripheral&#xD;
        neuropathy, defined as any neuropathy â‰¤ grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate cardiovascular function defined as no active congestive heart failure, no&#xD;
        uncontrolled angina, no myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No other experimental treatment, cytotoxics or radiation 4 weeks prior to enrollment. May&#xD;
        not be taking other investigational drugs while on trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of&#xD;
        their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that&#xD;
        would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prior therapy with oxaliplatin is allowed. No history of allergic reactions attributed&#xD;
        to the drugs used in this study or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of intolerance or allergy to the antiemetics to be administered in conjunction&#xD;
        with the study drugs (i.e., 5 HT3 antagonists).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No concurrent other active cancer from another primary site, except squamous cell and basal&#xD;
        cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No other serious concomitant illness will be allowed, including interstitial pneumonia,&#xD;
        extensive and symptomatic fibrosis of the lung, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina,&#xD;
        symptomatic congestive heart failure, NYHA Class III or IV, serious cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
        uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or active infection.&#xD;
