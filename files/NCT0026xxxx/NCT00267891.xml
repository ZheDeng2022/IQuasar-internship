      This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine what happens in&#xD;
      the brains of adolescents when they are exposed to violent media and how imagining aggressive&#xD;
      behavior affects brain function. The study will measure physiological changes (such as the&#xD;
      amount of electricity generated by the skin, heart rate, and breathing rate) related to these&#xD;
      tasks during fMRI. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs&#xD;
      and tissues. For fMRI, the subject performs certain tasks during the MRI scanning to examine&#xD;
      changes in the brain regions that are involved with those tasks. During the scan, the subject&#xD;
      lies in a metal cylinder (the scanner), wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises that occur&#xD;
      with the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy right-handed native English-speaking males between 14 and 17 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a neurological examination and&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing that includes questions about their feelings, experiences, and&#xD;
      behavior, and tests of reading level and intelligence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo fMRI and fill out questionnaires before and after the scanning. Some&#xD;
      children are asked to play 20 minutes of video games before the test. During the scan, the&#xD;
      child views short neutral video clips and video clips of people fighting or imagine&#xD;
      self-defense situations. The child is asked to rate the video clips for their aggressive&#xD;
      content or tell how he or she feels about the imagined situations. Two small straps are&#xD;
      wrapped around the child's index and middle fingers to measure changes in the amount of&#xD;
      electricity generated by the skin, and a strap at the ring finger measures the child's heart&#xD;
      rate. A band around the child's chest records breathing rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who cannot or do not want to undergo MRI testing may be asked to view commercially&#xD;
      available video clips of people fighting and neutral video scenes, such as sports scenes.&#xD;
      They are asked to rate them on their violent content and excitement, or to rate the video&#xD;
      games they have played on their violent/nonviolent content and their popularity. In addition,&#xD;
      the children fill out questionnaires about their media use and exposure to violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating families are contacted by telephone 1 day and 2 weeks after the experiment&#xD;
      for parents to answer questions about how the child has been doing and for the children to&#xD;
      answer questions about their feelings.&#xD;

      Objective. The purpose of the protocol is to localize the prefrontal cortical regions&#xD;
      mediating aggressive behavior. Utilizing two different experimental neuropsychological tasks&#xD;
      during functional MRI, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the ventro-medial&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex in processing imagined and observed aggressive behavior. Additionally, we&#xD;
      will determine the relationship between non-frontal neural structures involved in emotional&#xD;
      expression, such as the amygdala, and the prefrontal structures involved in executive&#xD;
      functions that may modulate aggressive behavior. We will record skin conductance responses&#xD;
      (SCRs), heart rates, and respiration during the experiments to investigate autonomic changes&#xD;
      during the processing of aggressive behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. In three separate studies, normal adolescent volunteers will participate in&#xD;
      experiments dealing with processing of aggressive behavior using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI). In addition, we will conduct two pre-studies in normal adolescent&#xD;
      volunteers in order to determine appropriate stimuli for the fMRI studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The experiments we are conducting will employ within-subject, rapid event-related&#xD;
      fMRI designs to determine whether the observation and imagination of aggressive behavior&#xD;
      deactivates the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (VM-PFC) and how varying intensities of&#xD;
      imagined and observed aggressive acts may influence changes in activation patterns in the&#xD;
      VM-PFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures. The data collected will consist of fMRI activation images corresponding to&#xD;
      varying intensities of observed or imagined aggression, questionnaire results, amplitudes of&#xD;
      the skin conductance responses, heart rates, and respiration parameters. The results gained&#xD;
      from this protocol will provide further evidence for the role of the ventro-medial prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex in processing aggressive behavior, particularly in adolescents.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In all the studies, participants will consist of male adolescent healthy, native&#xD;
        English-speaking, right-handed volunteers. Participants will range in age from 14 to 17&#xD;
        years old and they will be included regardless of race.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-native English speakers and non-right handers will be excluded, as will&#xD;
        non-neurologically normal volunteers. Subjects younger than 14 and older than 17 years of&#xD;
        age will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any of the following will be excluded from MRI testing: aneurysm clip;&#xD;
        implanted neural stimulator; implanted cardiac pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear&#xD;
        implant; ocular foreign body, such as metal shavings; permanent eyeliner; insulin pump; or&#xD;
        irremovable body piercing will be excluded from the study due to the possible dangerous&#xD;
        effects of the magnet upon metal objects in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with a neurological or psychiatric history, including significant aggressive&#xD;
        behavior and drug abuse, or with a medical condition that would compromise our&#xD;
        interpretation of the fMRI results will be excluded. Adolescents with attentional,&#xD;
        cognitive, or learning difficulties or impairments cannot take part in the study. An&#xD;
        intelligence quotient less then 80 will be exclusion criteria for this study. Individuals&#xD;
        with a current or past history of post-traumatic stress disorder or other psychiatric&#xD;
        disorders or individuals with a history of physical or sexual abuse will be excluded as&#xD;
        they may be disturbed by the exposure to violent stimuli. Furthermore, we will exclude&#xD;
        adolescents who take centrally acting medications. The presence or absence of these&#xD;
        conditions will be determined by a standardized neuropsychiatric interview, questionnaires,&#xD;
        ability testing, and standard phone or in-person intake (see screening section).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adolescents who have been trained in martial arts will be excluded from our studies.&#xD;
