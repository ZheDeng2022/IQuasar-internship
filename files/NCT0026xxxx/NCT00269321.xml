  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clincal trial is to assess the relative effectiveness of three&#xD;
      conservative treatment approaches for seniors with chronic low back pain: 1) chiropractic&#xD;
      manual treatment plus home exercise, 2) supervised exercise plus home exercise and 3) home&#xD;
      exercise alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is a significant health problem for both young and geriatric individuals.&#xD;
      Of particular concern is that conditions associated with LBP, such as impaired strength and&#xD;
      flexibility, can have very serious consequences for an older individual's independence and&#xD;
      overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad, long-term objective of this research is to identify effective therapies for low&#xD;
      back pain (LBP) and to discover the best methods for enhancing health and functional capacity&#xD;
      in the elderly population. This study is a multi-methods clinical trial consisting of a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT), a cost-effectiveness study alongside the RCT, and a&#xD;
      qualitative study nested in the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial builds upon a previous study of chiropractic and exercise funded by HRSA, and&#xD;
      focuses on elderly patients with sub-acute and chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the relative clinical effectiveness the following treatments for LBP&#xD;
           patients 65 years and older in both the short-term (after 12 weeks) and long-term (after&#xD;
           52 weeks), using low back pain as the main outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. chiropractic manual treatment plus home exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. supervised rehabilitative exercise plus home exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. home exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
                SECONDARY AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the short- and long-term relative effectiveness of the three interventions&#xD;
           using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-rated outcomes: low back disability, general health status, patient&#xD;
           satisfaction, improvement, and medication use measured by self-report questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective functional performance outcomes: spinal motion, trunk strength and endurance,&#xD;
           and functional ability measured by examiners masked to treatment group assignment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost measures: direct and indirect costs of treatment measured by questionnaires, phone&#xD;
           interviews, and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe elderly LBP patients' perceptions of treatment and the issues they consider&#xD;
           when determining their satisfaction with care using qualitative methods nested within&#xD;
           the RCT.&#xD;

    <description>The number of treatments will be determined by the individual chiropractor. Chiropractic manual treatment will be limited to gentle spinal manipulation, mobilization and flexion-distraction therapy with light soft tissue massage as indicated to facilitate the manual therapy.&#xD;
Patients will attend 4, 45-minute small-group sessions at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8. At the first two sessions they will be given information about low back pain and shown exercises to perform at home. Emphasis will be placed on the importance of staying active.</description>
