  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of the &quot;LIFE-Lung&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy&quot; to identify early changes in lung tissues that show precancerous, cancer in&#xD;
      situ (just beginning and not spread) and microscopic invasive cancer lesions versus the&#xD;
      ability of the standard &quot;White Light Bronchoscopy&quot; to identify the same. This will be done as&#xD;
      a part of routine monitoring bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have had a surgical resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and with no&#xD;
      current evidence of disease (NED) will be eligible. Also eligible are patients who have had&#xD;
      head or neck squamous cell carcinoma with radical head and/or neck dissection and who are&#xD;
      currently NED. Patients with severe chronic, obstructive, pulmonary disease shown by&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing abnormalities will also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the specialized bronchoscopy, doctors will be investigating the use of imaging&#xD;
      spectroscopy. This is using an optical (visualizing) procedure to measure the light reflected&#xD;
      back from tissue. Different lesions and normal tissues reflect light differently and in&#xD;
      specific color wavelengths. By using measurements over time (different&#xD;
      examinations/bronchoscopies) very small changes can be seen. This may allow eventually for&#xD;
      very early diagnosing of precancerous or cancer in situ lesions, allowing for earlier&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      The North American Lung Cancer Study Group showed that Stage I (T1,N0,M0) non small cell lung&#xD;
      carcinoma patients who have undergone complete surgical resection have a 60-70% five-year&#xD;
      survival but have a 3.6% per year risk of developing a second lung primary cancer. Data from&#xD;
      the Mayo Clinic on patients that underwent surgical resection for sputum cytology positive&#xD;
      but radiologically occult lung cancer found that second primary lung cancers occurred at a&#xD;
      rate as high as 5% per year in this patient population. In a collective review of 1406&#xD;
      patients with occult or stage I completely resected lung carcinomas, the incidence of&#xD;
      second-primary lung cancers was 11.4% (range 3-30%). The mortality from second-primary lung&#xD;
      carcinomas in surgical patients is much higher than for the first tumor because treatment is&#xD;
      both more limited and complicated as a consequence of their prior lung resection. Second&#xD;
      NSCLC primaries are a particularly vexing treatment dilemma in patients who have undergone a&#xD;
      prior curative, surgical resection because of their limited, residual pulmonary reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White light bronchoscopy (WLB) has been shown to be a useful tool in localizing&#xD;
      radiographically occult lesions. However, Woolner et al. demonstrated that only 29% of&#xD;
      carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 69% of micro-invasive tumors are identified by experienced&#xD;
      bronchoscopists. In 1996 an endoscopic lung imaging system developed by the British Columbia&#xD;
      Cancer Research Centre in conjunction with Xillix Technologies Corp., known as the LIFE-lung&#xD;
      Fluorescence Endoscopy System was approved by the FDA. LIFE-lung bronchoscopy is performed&#xD;
      with a helium-cadmium laser using blue light @ 442 nm for illumination and allows&#xD;
      visualization of these differences in normal and abnormal tissue autofluorescence. Lam and&#xD;
      others have shown that the tissue autofluorescence spectra of areas of dysplasia and&#xD;
      carcinoma in situ differ significantly from those of normal bronchial tissues. Specifically,&#xD;
      LIFE Bronchoscopy improved sensitivity of detection of metaplasia and dysplasia by 171% over&#xD;
      current WLB. LIFE bronchoscopy's sensitivity for the detection of CIS is 500% greater than&#xD;
      that of standard WLB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence bronchoscopy using the LIFE system is identical to standard flexible&#xD;
      bronchoscopy except that it utilizes blue light (from a Helium-Cadmium light source) in&#xD;
      contrast to white light (commonly emitted from a Xenon or Halogen light source). Both&#xD;
      fluorescent and reflected light are produced when the bronchial surface is illuminated by&#xD;
      visible light, the difference is that with the LIFE-lung system, the image is reconstructed&#xD;
      from emitted fluorescent light instead of from light reflected off of the bronchial surface.&#xD;
      Emitted fluorescence and reflective light are separated by appropriate filters.&#xD;
