      -  OBJECTIVES To determine in a prospective randomized clinical trial, the effect of&#xD;
           extended lymph node dissection (R3 gastrectomy) versus conventional surgery (R0/1&#xD;
           gastrectomy) on tumor recurrence and survival in Chinese patients with advanced cancer&#xD;
           of the stomach (adenocarcinoma invasion beyond submucosa).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The major end points are disease free survival and survival.&#xD;
           The log-rank test will be used as analytic method on disease-free survival and overall&#xD;
           durvival. The follow-up time after treatment is five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous experience provides an estimation of a 20% 5-year survival rate with conventional&#xD;
      surgery for gastric cancer. Assuming that this new treatment (radical surgery) may increase&#xD;
      the 5-year survival rate to 40%, we estimate that 118 evaluable patients are required to&#xD;
      detected a significance at a of 0.05 level and power of 0.8 using a one tailed test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to enter 50 patients per year and finish accrual of patient within 2.5 years.&#xD;

      * TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized intraoperatively into arm I (conventional [R0/R1] gastrectomy) or arm&#xD;
      II (extended radical [R3] lymph node dissection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Resection of stomach, greater omentum, lesser omentum, and adjacent organ(s) when the&#xD;
      primary tumor invaded directly. A total or distal subtotal gastrectomy is decided by the&#xD;
      proximal distance from cardia to the tumor. A margin of 3 cm was required for well-defined&#xD;
      (Borrmann I or II) tumors, and of 5 cm for ill-defined (Borrmann III or IV) tumors. When a&#xD;
      total gastrectomy is performed, the distal pancreas and spleen should be preserved unless&#xD;
      there is direct invasion into these organs. The left gastric artery should not be ligated at&#xD;
      its origin but distal to its bifurcation into ascending and descending branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: The procedure are the same as in Arm I, additionally, extended lymph node dissection&#xD;
      includes dissection of the N1, N2 and N3 nodes. These groups (N) are comprised of lymph node&#xD;
      stations which depended on the location of the primary tumors (Fig. 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For N2 dissection, the left gastric artery is ligated at its origin to facilitate the&#xD;
           dissection of No.7. If a total gastrectomy is indicated, a splenectomy is essential for&#xD;
           the dissection of station No. 10, and a distal pancreatectomy for the dissection of&#xD;
           station No.11. Combined resection of these adjacent organs is not performed during a&#xD;
           distal subtotal gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the primary cancer is located at the middle or lower third of stomach, No.1 (nodes at&#xD;
           right cardiac) and 11 (nodes along the splenic artery) are excised routinely for frozen&#xD;
           section before gastric resection. If no cancer metastasis is seen in both No.1 and 11&#xD;
           lymph nodes is performed. If only No. 1 lymph nodes is positive for cancer metastasis,&#xD;
           total gastrectomy is performed instead of distal subtotal resection. If No. 11 lymph&#xD;
           nodes are positive, splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy are performed in addition to&#xD;
           the radical resection of the stomach and lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For N3 dissection: No. 12 (nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament), No. 13 (nodes at&#xD;
           retropancreatic region) and No. 14 (nodes at the root of mesentery) are dissected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who had gastric cancer recurrence after gastrectomy, chemotherapy with&#xD;
      cisplatin、 5-FU、Leucovorin will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin 20mg/m2 5-FU 450 mg/m2 Leucovorin 90 mg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above three drugs to be given in 500ml of normal saline and infused intravenously&#xD;
      simultaneously over 96 hours and repeated every 3 weeks. (21days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose modification： Delay treatment for one week (if WBC&lt;4000/dl immediately before&#xD;
      treatment). Reduce dose of subsequent cycles of 5-FU by 20% if WBC nadir &lt;1000/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delay treatment for one week (if there is oral mucositis or diarrhea immediately before&#xD;
      treatment). Reduce dose of subsequent cycles of 5-FU by 10% for grade 2 and 20% for grade 3&#xD;
      or 4 mucositis or diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stop treatment for any grade 4 non-hematological toxicity. Stop cisplatin treatment if serum&#xD;
      creatinine &gt; 2mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment： Continue treatment for patients until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * DATA AND PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT 10.1 Registration, randomization will be performed by the&#xD;
      Cancer Clinical Trial Operations Office by calling 789-9046. (47)&amp; 7852459.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control of the data will be performed by the Cancer Clinical Trial Operations Office,&#xD;
      Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be evaluated by the statistician and the study chairman before data analyzed&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Protocol Compliance: the attending physician and oncology research nurse must see each&#xD;
      patient prior to treatment and at follow up to ensure all investigations, treatment&#xD;
      procedures and data records are done and recorded according to protocol.&#xD;
