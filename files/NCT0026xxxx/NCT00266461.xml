  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI), a transient impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) motility, commonly&#xD;
      occurs in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery and contributes to postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity, including delayed enteral nutrition, increased patient discomfort, and prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization. POI appears to be have many causes, with activation of inhibitory reflexes,&#xD;
      inflammatory responses, and the effects of anesthesia and analgesics all playing roles.&#xD;
      However, there is no approved pharmacological therapy for the treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      POI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daikenchuto (TU-100) is an herbal formulation consisting of Asian ginseng, Zanthoxylum fruit&#xD;
      (Sichuan pepper), ginger, and malt sugar, which was originally described in Jin kui yao lue,&#xD;
      the classical medical textbook written in ancient China in the third century by Zhang Zhong&#xD;
      Jing. Since it was introduced to Japan, Daikenchuto has been used in the treatment of&#xD;
      abdominal pain and a feeling of coldness in the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TSUMURA Daikenchuto Extract Granules, Product Code TU-100, is a modern herbal product&#xD;
      manufactured in the dosage form of granules by Tsumura &amp; Co. The current Tsumura product,&#xD;
      TU-100, was approved for manufacture as a prescription drug in 1986 by the Japanese Ministry&#xD;
      of Health and Welfare and has been sold commercially as a prescription Kampo (a generic term&#xD;
      for the system of traditional medicine that was developed in Japan after being introduced&#xD;
      from China in the fourth century) drug in Japan for many years. The drug product proposed for&#xD;
      use in the clinical studies is identical to the drug currently sold in Japan. In addition,&#xD;
      all three botanical components and maltose syrup powder are considered as food substances and&#xD;
      are currently part of the United States food supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study evaluate the tolerability, efficacy and safety of TU-100 for the&#xD;
      treatment of postoperative ileus (POI) in patients undergoing laparotomy for large bowel&#xD;
      resection&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label study designed to evaluate the tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of TU-100 for the treatment of POI in patients undergoing laparotomy for large bowel&#xD;
      resection. It will be conducted at multiple centers in the United States. A total of 24&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study. Patient participation in the study will last for up&#xD;
      to 32 days (from Screening to postoperative day 10 [POD 10] or until the time when a&#xD;
      discharge order is written for the patient, whichever comes first), with follow-up safety&#xD;
      assessments to occur 7 and 14 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
