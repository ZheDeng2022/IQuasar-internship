      This study will examine whether family-based interpersonal psychotherapy (FB-IPT) is an&#xD;
      effective tool for helping pre-adolescent girls and boys at risk for become obese to reduce&#xD;
      weight gain. IPT is a time-limited group therapy for preventing and treating depression in&#xD;
      children. It is also effective for treating binge eating disorder in adults and has resulted&#xD;
      in weight maintenance or modest weight loss in obese adults. IPT focuses on improving how&#xD;
      people relate to one another by relating symptoms to personal problem areas and then&#xD;
      developing strategies for dealing with these problems. Girls and boys between the ages of&#xD;
      8-13 years of age who are in good general health with the exception of being overweight and&#xD;
      whose body mass index (BMI) is above the 85th percentile for their age and sex may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination, measurement of&#xD;
      their height and weight, blood and urine tests, a DEXA scan (x-ray scan that measures body&#xD;
      fat, muscle and bone mineral content), and questionnaires and an interview to obtain&#xD;
      information about the child's general health, social and psychological function, and eating&#xD;
      patterns. Parents are also screened for their health and are asked to give blood samples for&#xD;
      genetic studies and participate in a few questionnaires and interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to participate in FB-IPT or a health education program.&#xD;
      Both programs involve 12 weekly visits. At the end of the study, the body weight and mood of&#xD;
      the girls and boys in both groups are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (a parent and their child) meet individually with the therapist for 12 sessions&#xD;
      (each approximately an 45 minutes ). Girls and boys offered FB-IPT have meetings in which&#xD;
      they develop strategies for dealing with the problems girls struggle with that may lead to&#xD;
      increased eating. Girls and boys in the health education group have meetings that focus on&#xD;
      teaching teens children to live healthier lives and review topics related to developing and&#xD;
      maintaining healthy eating and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are evaluated at the end of the 12-week program and asked to return to the&#xD;
      NIH for follow-up visits at post treatment, 6 and 12 months following initiation of the&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child and parent will be compensated for their time and inconvenience with $40 for&#xD;
      completing all pre-program assessments, $40 for attending the 12 week follow-up visit, $40&#xD;
      for the 6 month follow-up visit, and $40 for the 1-year follow-up. Therefore, each child may&#xD;
      receive up to $160, and the participating parent may receive up to $160. If a child's second&#xD;
      biological parent is also willing to give a genetic sample and undergo interviews, the second&#xD;
      parent can also receive $40 for a single visit to the NIH.&#xD;

      The most prevalent disordered eating pattern described in overweight youth is loss of control&#xD;
      (LOC) eating, during which individuals experience an inability to control the amount of food&#xD;
      they are consuming. LOC eating is associated cross-sectionally with greater adiposity in&#xD;
      children and adolescents, and appears to predispose youth to gain weight or body fat above&#xD;
      that expected due to normal growth, thus likely contributing to obesity in susceptible&#xD;
      individuals. No prior studies have examined whether LOC eating can be decreased by&#xD;
      interventions in children or adolescents, or whether programs reducing LOC eating affect&#xD;
      weight gain. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), a form of psychotherapy that has been adapted&#xD;
      for the treatment of eating disorders, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing binge eating&#xD;
      episodes and inducing modest weight losses (or at least weight stabilization) among adults&#xD;
      diagnosed with binge eating disorder. In Study 1, we proposed a pilot study of the efficacy&#xD;
      of group IPT as an intervention to slow the trajectory of weight gain in 36 overweight or&#xD;
      at-risk for overweight youth who report symptoms of LOC eating. We hypothesized that&#xD;
      reductions in LOC eating among adolescents who engage in such episodes and who are at risk&#xD;
      for obesity will decrease the likelihood of inappropriate weight gain. In this pilot study,&#xD;
      changes in body composition of adolescent girls participating in a 12-week IPT group&#xD;
      intervention were compared with those of girls participating in a health education program at&#xD;
      6 month and 1 year follow-up visits. Significantly more girls who participated in IPT&#xD;
      stabilized their weight compared to girls who participated in health education. These&#xD;
      promising preliminary data were the basis for an adequately powered trial of adolescent IPT&#xD;
      for the prevention of excessive weight gain that is currently underway (NICHD Protocol&#xD;
      08-CH-0139). In Study 2, we wish to pilot an excess weight gain prevention program targeting&#xD;
      LOC eating behaviors in middle childhood youth and in their parents. In Study 2 the&#xD;
      prevention programs will be delivered in a parent-child dyadic format instead of an&#xD;
      adolescent group format. Enrolling children and their parents will also allow pilot exome&#xD;
      sequencing genetic analyses to be conducted.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good general health. A normal history and physical examination with the exception of&#xD;
             overweight will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 12 and &lt; 18 years at the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index measured at the NIH is within the 75th 97th percentile for age,&#xD;
             gender, and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to complete study procedures including the ability to participate in a group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals will be individually assessed to determine their suitability for group&#xD;
        treatment. School placement (e.g. special education) will be used as an estimate of&#xD;
        cognitive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - As assessed by the Eating Disorder Examination structured clinical interview (see&#xD;
        methods), a history of LOC eating (objective or subjective bulimic episodes, or both) or no&#xD;
        reports of LOC eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will be excluded (and referred to non-experimental treatment programs as needed)&#xD;
        for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of major illnesses: renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic&#xD;
             (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyper- or hypothyroidism), hematological problems or&#xD;
             pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiring continuous medication).&#xD;
             Nonserious medical illnesses, such as seasonal allergies, will be reviewed on a&#xD;
             case-bycase basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an obesity-related medical complication that would require a more&#xD;
             aggressive weight loss intervention approach. Such comorbidities include&#xD;
             hyperlipidemia (LDL-cholesterol &gt; 130 mg/dL), hypertension (defined by age- sexand&#xD;
             height- specific standards (115) fasting hyperglycemia (fasting glucose &gt; 126 mg/dL)&#xD;
             and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (ALT above NIH Clinical Center laboratory norms with&#xD;
             consistent radiologic findings and absence of another cause such as infectious&#xD;
             hepatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of prescription medications. Oral contraceptive use will be permitted,&#xD;
             provided the contraceptive has been used for at least two months before starting study&#xD;
             medication. Individuals taking medications for most conditions will be excluded, but&#xD;
             medication use for non-serious conditions (e.g., acne) will be considered on a caseby-&#xD;
             case basis. In particular, participants currently prescribed SSRI s, neuroleptics,&#xD;
             tricyclics, stimulants, or any medication known to affect body weight or eating will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current involvement in psychotherapy or a structured weight loss program,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight loss during the past 2 months for any reason exceeding 3% of body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or recently pregnant girls (within 1 year of delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an eating disorder or a current eating disorder (other than binge eating&#xD;
             disorder) as determined by medical history or if uncovered during the study s&#xD;
             structured clinical interviews. Subjects found to have an eating disorder other than&#xD;
             binge eating disorder at baseline will be referred to mental health specialists for&#xD;
             further evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy or breast feeding. A negative pregnancy test before starting the&#xD;
             study will be required. Because pregnancy is a state in which weight gain is expected&#xD;
             and appropriate, pregnant individuals would not be suitable for this study. Sexually&#xD;
             active females must be using an effective form of birth control. These methods include&#xD;
             total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives ( the pill ), an intrauterine device&#xD;
             (IUD), levonogestrol implants (Norplant), or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections&#xD;
             (Depo-provera shots). If one of these cannot be used, contraceptive foam with a condom&#xD;
             is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who have DSM-IV-TR major depressive disorder, psychoses, current substance&#xD;
             or alcohol abuse, conduct disorder, or a diagnosed psychiatric disorder that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder&#xD;
             completion of the study. Individuals whose parents or guardians have current substance&#xD;
             abuse or a diagnosed psychiatric disorder or other condition that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigators, would impede adherence with the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each participant will receive a written explanation of the purposes, procedures, and&#xD;
        potential hazards of the study. Communication of this information and of the participant s&#xD;
        assent, as well as the consent of the parent or guardian, will be documented in the medical&#xD;
        record. All participants will be informed of their right to withdraw from the study.&#xD;
