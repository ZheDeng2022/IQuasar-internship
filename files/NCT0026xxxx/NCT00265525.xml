  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial (RCT) is planned to evaluate a web-based intervention (CardioFit)&#xD;
      against usual care in increasing physical activity levels in patients with Coronary Artery&#xD;
      Disease (CAD). We hypothesize that compared to usual care, participants in CardioFit will; a)&#xD;
      have increased physical activity levels, b) will have a higher health-related quality of life&#xD;
      at measurement dates and, c) will have greater improvements in psychosocial predictors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most existing cardiac rehabilitation programs have little ability to expand participation&#xD;
      using traditional delivery models that emphasize supervised, facility-based programs.&#xD;
      Futhermore, facility based programs to promote physical activity behavior in patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) are limited in their impact because most patients are unwilling&#xD;
      to travel more than 30-40 minutes to participate in a program. CardioFit is an off-site, 26&#xD;
      week web-based physical activity coaching service for people with heart disease. Within the&#xD;
      CardioFit program, patients will be assigned to an on-line &quot;coach&quot; and receive customized&#xD;
      exercise programs based on their medical history, personal goals and preferences. A&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT) is planned to evaluate the effectiveness of the web-based&#xD;
      intervention at increasing physical activity levels against usual care in patients with CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is in the third phase of a three-phase research program to examine interventions&#xD;
      to promote physical activity for the secondary prevention of Cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

    <description>CardioFit is a 26-week tailored web-based physical activity coaching service for individuals with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). It has been designed to help patients develop personalized exercise programs based on their medical history, personal goals and preferences. Access to Cardio-fit is through a secured website. The cardio-fit website contains physical activity advice and heart health educational information. Each patient is assigned an on-line coach, whose role is to assist in creating safe an effective physical activity program, and to answer any questions that patients may have throughout the program.</description>
