  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if alteplase is effective in dissolving a clot in a&#xD;
      catheter in a large vein (central venous line or PICC line) or artery in infants less than 6&#xD;
      months of age.&#xD;

      Hospitalized patients with central access devices will be screened. Ninety subjects with at&#xD;
      least one occluded lumen of a central access device will be eligible. Thirty subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in each of the following age groups: 28-&lt;34 weeks CGA, 34- &lt; 40 weeks CGA, and 40&#xD;
      weeks to 66 weeks CGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be eligible if the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to provide written informed consent by the parent or legal guardian and comply&#xD;
           with study assessments for the full duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalized premature neonates (28-&lt; 34 weeks CGA), term neonates (34-&lt;40 weeks CGA)&#xD;
           and infants (40 weeks to 66 weeks CGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of a central access device. All types of permanent and temporary catheters are&#xD;
           eligible [e.g., central venous catheter (CVC), peripherally-inserted central catheter&#xD;
           (PICC), umbilical arterial catheter (UAC), or umbilical venous catheter (UVC)] except&#xD;
           hemodialysis catheters. The catheter must be properly inserted as evidenced by the&#xD;
           ability to have used the catheter at least once for its intended purpose (i.e., to&#xD;
           withdraw blood and/or infuse fluids) and documentation of correct catheter placement&#xD;
           radiographically within 48 hours of the catheter becoming non-patent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  partial or total occlusion of at least one lumen of the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CGA &gt; 66 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incorrect catheter placement (see section 3.1) or evidence of mechanical occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By clinical examination there is evidence that the catheter has migrated or become&#xD;
           dislodged. This is determined by confirming the depth to which the catheter had been&#xD;
           positioned on insertion or adjusted to after placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is evidence of mechanical obstruction of the catheter on the portion (is any) that&#xD;
           is visible from the catheter hub to the skin insertion site (e.g., kinking or twisting&#xD;
           of the catheter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occlusion due to suspected drug precipitate in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active internal bleeding, involving intracranial and retroperitoneal sites, or the&#xD;
           gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or respiratory tracts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent history (i.e., &lt; 6 months) of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or other active&#xD;
           intracranial process that could predispose to intracranial bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Superficial or surface bleeding, observed mainly at vascular puncture and access sites&#xD;
           (e.g., venous cutdowns, arterial punctures) or site of recent surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any of the following known or suspected hemorrhagic events within the preceding 7 days&#xD;
           or any other significant bleeding risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-ocular surgery&#xD;
&#xD;

           48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major surgery (excluding central line placement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organ biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Puncture of a non-compressible vessel within the previous 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with indomethacin within the previous 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Received any fibrinolytic agent within 24 hours of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known risk for embolization, including history of left heart thrombus, mitral stenosis&#xD;
           with atrial fibrillation, acute pericarditis, and subacute bacterial endocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known hypersensitivity to Alteplase or any component in the formulation of CathfloTM&#xD;
           Activase®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior enrollment in the current study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to&#xD;
           the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated or the patient has a known&#xD;
           condition for which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in another interventional investigation or trial within the previous 30&#xD;
           days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documented or suspected catheter infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombocytopenia (i.e. platelet count &lt; 20,000)&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT This is an open-label study and all subjects will receive&#xD;
      CathfloTM Activase.&#xD;
