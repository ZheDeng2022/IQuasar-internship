      To evaluate the efficacy of aerosolized cyclosporine given in addition to the standard oral&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success with lung transplantation has largely been due to the introduction of cyclosporine&#xD;
      which has proved effective in controlling lung allograft rejection. Nevertheless, acute and&#xD;
      chronic rejection are prevalent in spite of immunosuppressive drug regimens based on oral&#xD;
      cyclosporine. In fact, rejection is more common in recipients of lung allografts than those&#xD;
      who receive other solid organs. Acute rejection is treated with pulsed methylprednisolone and&#xD;
      anti-lymphocyte globulin and consequently recipients are subject to increased risk of&#xD;
      infection and drug toxicity. The hypothesis tested in the study was that delivery of&#xD;
      cyclosporine to the transplanted lung by aerosol inhalation would achieve higher&#xD;
      concentrations of cyclosporine in the graft than when it was delivered via the bloodstream&#xD;
      and that higher concentrations in the graft would prevent rejection more effectively than&#xD;
      systemic immune suppression with the same or reduced toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular rejection occured in over 90% of the patients within the first year and often&#xD;
      progressed to obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) which was the most common cause of death one&#xD;
      year after transplant. In 1988, the lung transplant group at the University of Pittsburgh&#xD;
      decided to pursue cyclosporine aerosol for the treatment for acute rejection. After animal&#xD;
      testing, initial human experiments were performed, which suggested that cyclosporine aerosol&#xD;
      decreased the prevalence of acute rejection and the development of obliterative&#xD;
      bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective double blind randomized trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      cyclosporine aerosol versus placebo aerosol as an adjuvant to oral immunosuppression with&#xD;
      tacrolimus, prednisone, and azathioprine. The hypotheses tested included: 1) acute rejection&#xD;
      would be lower in the patients receiving cyclosporine aerosol, 2) maintenance cyclosporine&#xD;
      aerosol would result in reduced incidence of OB, 3) cytokines and chemokine release would be&#xD;
      suppressed, 4) patients receiving cyclosporine aerosol would require less systemic&#xD;
      immunosuppression and 5) there would be a lower incidence of opportunistic and bacterial&#xD;
      infections as a consequence of more effective immunosuppressive therapy. Another specific aim&#xD;
      of the study was to determine the optimal dose of cyclosporine aerosol that reduced rejection&#xD;
      and/or OB and to correlate radioisotopically labeled inhalation studies with more easily&#xD;
      measurable indices that affected the deposition of aerosolized medications.&#xD;
