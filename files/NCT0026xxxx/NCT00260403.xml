      The purpose of the study is to compare photodynamic therapy to transpupillary thermotherapy&#xD;
      as a treatment method for choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration (&#xD;
      AMD). AMD is a disease affecting the macula, the central area of the retina.There are two&#xD;
      main types of AMD. Geographic atrophy ( dry) AMD and neovascular ( wet) AMD. In neovascular&#xD;
      AMD, sub-retinal neovascular membranes ( new blood vessels) develop beneath the retina. The&#xD;
      new vessels can leak causing haemorrhage that leads to significant visual loss. Photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy ( PDT) is a method for treating neovascular membranes without affecting the retina.&#xD;
      Photoactive chemicals are injected into the patient and irradiated with light as the pass&#xD;
      through the neovascular membranes. This light is strong enough to activate the chemicals,&#xD;
      that destroy the blood vessels, but not strong enough to cause damage to the overlying&#xD;
      retina. The duration of the treatment is 83s. PDT treatment is effective in predominantly&#xD;
      classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization ( CNV), but was observed to yield no visual&#xD;
      benefit in minimally classic CNV during a 2-year follow-up and as to occult CNV the effect&#xD;
      was scarce. PDT does have its drawbacks, one of which is the cost. Another is that the&#xD;
      patient become highly sensitive to strong light. Transpupillary thermotherapy ( TTT) is a&#xD;
      thermic treatment of choroidal neovascularization in AMD. Using a thermal diode laser (&#xD;
      emission 810 nm), transpupillary irradiation of the fundus through a conventinal contact lens&#xD;
      is performed. The temperature is elevated &lt; 10 degrees C during a 60s exposure to continuous&#xD;
      radiation. The laser power is adjusted to the diameter of the laser beam. In a pilot study,&#xD;
      Reichel et al. ( 1999) demonstrated that subfoveal occult CNV could be occluded and visual&#xD;
      acuity stabilized in a majority of patients treated with TTT. These results has been&#xD;
      confirmed in small series of cases with occult CNV and with minimally ( &lt;50%) classic CNV.&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized controlled study aim to compare TTT and PDT as a treatment for&#xD;
      occult and minimally classic CNV. A total of 140 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Follow up is 2 years. The patients included will be followed as to visual acutiy ( ETDRS),&#xD;
      new vessel growth ( fluorescien angiography and ICG), OCT and with a quality of life&#xD;
      questionnarie.&#xD;

      Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD) is a disease affecting the macula, the central area&#xD;
      of the retina. There are two main types of AMD. Geographic atrophy ( dry) AMD and neovascular&#xD;
      ( wet) AMD. In neovascular AMD, subretinal neovascular membranes develop beneath the retina.&#xD;
      The new vessels can leak causing haemorrhage that leads to edema, scarring and significant&#xD;
      visual loss. Sub-retinal neovasular membranes are defined as classic, occult and minimally&#xD;
      classic according to their apperance on fluorescein angiography. Trials have shown that early&#xD;
      laser photocoagulation of classic extrafoveal lesions could delay the loss of vision in a&#xD;
      small number of patients. However, most patients present with subfoveal membranes and whilst&#xD;
      photocoagulation can limit the extent of subsequent visual loss, it causes immediate loss of&#xD;
      central vision due to concurrent destruction of the overlying retina. Photodynamic theray (&#xD;
      PDT) represent a milestone in the treatment of CNV, and marks the start of a new era. Current&#xD;
      PDT operates on the basis of principal that makes use of a dye ( verteporfin) which is&#xD;
      preferentially retained in proliferating tissue such as CNV, sensitizing the endothelial&#xD;
      cells to laser rediation ( 689 nm). Endothelial cells degeneration is mediated by reactive&#xD;
      oxygen which intermediates with subsequent platelet activation, and a thrombosis, and&#xD;
      temporary or permanent occlusion of vessels is seen in the treated area ( Ghazi et al 2001.&#xD;
      The light is strong enough to activate the chemicals, causing them to emit free radicals that&#xD;
      destroy the blood vessles, but not strong enough to cause damage to the overlying retina. The&#xD;
      duration of the treatment is 83s. PDT is effective in predominantly classic subfoveal CNV,&#xD;
      but was observed to yield no visual benefit in minimally clasic CNV during a 2-year&#xD;
      follow-up. As to occult CNV PDT was effective in small lesions ( 4 disc areas or less), when&#xD;
      there was a recent disease progress and when visual acuity was less then 20/50. In the VIP (&#xD;
      Verteporfin Therapy of Subfoveal Choroidal neovascularization, 2 year resulta of Randomized&#xD;
      Clinical trial incl Lesion with Occult with no classic CNV) the primary outcome, visual&#xD;
      acuity, was similar for the verteporfin-treated and the placebo-treated eyes through the&#xD;
      month 12 examination. Between the month 12 and 24 rxminations, the treatment benefit grew so&#xD;
      that by the month 24 examination, the verteporfin-treated eyes were less likely to have&#xD;
      moderate or severe vision loss. PDT does have its drawbacks, ont is the cost. Another that&#xD;
      the patient become highly sensitive to strong light and needs to wear special sunglasses for&#xD;
      48 hrs after treatment. There has also been discussions regarding lesion size and the&#xD;
      potential of damage due to re-treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transpupillary thermotherapy ( TTT) is a thermic teratment of CNV in AMD. Using a thermal&#xD;
      diode laser ( emission 810nm), transpupillary irradiation of the fundus through a&#xD;
      conventional ( laser) contact lens is performed. The irradiation is resorbed mainly in the&#xD;
      melanin granules of RPE and choroidal melanocytes and there is little absorption in the&#xD;
      neurosensory retina. The temperatures in the layers of RPE and choriocapillaris is elevated &lt;&#xD;
      10 degrees C during a 60s exposure to continuous rediation. High rates of resportion of the&#xD;
      radiation in the endothelium of growing, newly formed vessels will result in thrombus&#xD;
      formation and delayed closure of the CNV. The power is adjusted to the diameter of the laser&#xD;
      beam. Laser power of 400 mW for a 2.0 mm spot, was found to be safe for the retina in human&#xD;
      eyes ( Conolly et al 2001). In a pilot study, Reichel et al ( 1999) demonstrated that&#xD;
      subfoveal occult CNV could be occluded and visual acuity stabilized in a majority of patients&#xD;
      treated with TTT. These results has been confirmed in small series of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized controlled study aim to compare PDT and TTT as a treatment for&#xD;
      occult and minimally classic CNV. A total of 140 patients will be included in the study, (&#xD;
      110 patients are presently included). Follow up is 2 years. The main outcome is visual acuity&#xD;
      ( ETDRS), new vessel growth ( fluorescein angiography and ICG), retinal thickness ( OCT.&#xD;
      Furtermore patients will participate in a quality of life questionnarie ( National Eye&#xD;
      Institute Visual Function Questionnarie, NEI-CFQ-25).&#xD;
