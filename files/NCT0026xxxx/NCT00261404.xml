      Phase II, open label study in which patients with metastatic melanoma (stage III or IV) who&#xD;
      have cancer which is not considered curable by surgery will receive intratumoral injections&#xD;
      of TNFerade™ plus radiation as a 4-week treatment, followed by a 3 year follow-up period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be 18 years old or older, and able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastatic melanoma (AJCC stage III or IV) who are not eligible for&#xD;
             curative surgery and who are candidates for experimental therapy. Eligible patients&#xD;
             will include those with melanoma involving the regional lymph nodes and surrounding&#xD;
             tissues as well as those with unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, nodal or soft&#xD;
             tissue metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have one or more tumor nodules accessible for direct injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastases outside the treatment field may be enrolled if the sites of&#xD;
             metastases do not limit survival expectancy to less than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be unlikely to derive significant potential benefit from other treatment&#xD;
             options and no other treatments should be anticipated during the study treatment&#xD;
             period or a period of two months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's Karnofsky performance status must be greater than or equal to 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy or experimental medications within the last four weeks prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active disease of the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline liver enzymes (AST, ALT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) greater than 3&#xD;
             times the upper limit normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal insufficiency (Serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coagulopathy (PT INR &gt;1.5 or PTT ratio &gt;1.5 in patients not receiving anticoagulants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant anemia (e.g. hematocrit &lt;28% or hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL). May have RBC&#xD;
             transfusion, or thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/μl); or leukopenia&#xD;
             (WBC &lt;3000/μl; ANC &lt;1500/μl).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with documented history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus,&#xD;
             cerebrovascular disease, stroke, or TIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of coagulopathy or known thrombophillic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of active infection of any type, including hepatitis B or C virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. It is recommended that both men and women use condoms or&#xD;
             another barrier method of birth control for at least 2 months following the last&#xD;
             administration of TNFerade™ biologic and some form of birth control for at least 1&#xD;
             year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant concurrent medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic systemic corticosteroid use, orally or parenterally administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known sensitivity to lidocaine, procaine or amide local anesthetics (used for topical&#xD;
             anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery within the last 4 weeks prior to day 1 (if patient was ambulatory within 48&#xD;
             hours of surgery, patient may be considered eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Attempted resection of the tumor to be treated, or surgery on the area to be treated,&#xD;
             with incomplete healing of surgical wound. (If the surgical wounds are completely&#xD;
             healed and lesion continues to progress, patient may be enrolled.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of clinical lymphedema in the area to be treated.&#xD;
