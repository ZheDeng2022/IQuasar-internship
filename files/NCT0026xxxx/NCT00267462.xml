  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the patients seen in our practice who are seen with&#xD;
      Hypertrophic Myopathy diagnosis in order to better understand the presenting characteristics&#xD;
      of their disease, the diagnostic testing to determine the diagnosis, the methods used to&#xD;
      follow the disease progression and management practices used in caring for these patients.&#xD;
      The objectives of this data review will be an analysis to determine if there is a methodology&#xD;
      that will foster improved diagnostic speed and accuracy, and determine the best management&#xD;
      practices based on outcomes in these patients.&#xD;

      The charts of children followed at Sibley Heart Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta&#xD;
      will be identified using the Mysis system and screening for the appropriate ICD-9 codes for&#xD;
      the types of Hypertrophic Myopathy. These codes include: 425.1, 425.4, 425.7, 425.8, and&#xD;
      425.9. Screening will also be done for known anomalies that are associated with hypertrophic&#xD;
      myopathy as seen in some syndromes and metabolic disorders.&#xD;

      laboratory results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A generalized linear model will be performed. Significance will be defined at Pâ‰¤ 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim monitoring of accumulated data will be performed. One interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed after 3 months of accrual with additional analyses being performed at the end of&#xD;
      data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be summarized for all subjects. For each patient summary statistics&#xD;
      will include the mean, standard deviation, frequency distribution, minimum, maximum and&#xD;
      range.&#xD;
