    <textblock>
      Numerous studies document the ability of tumors to shed DNA into the blood stream.&#xD;
      Circulating DNA can thus be recovered for analyses, representing a surrogate tumor material&#xD;
      to test for potential applications in disease diagnosis and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of genetic alternation is one of the most important tests for cancer patient since&#xD;
      they offen correlated with the clinical course, prognosis and chemosensitivity of primary&#xD;
      brain tumors. Currently in brain tumor patients these molecular aberrations can be analyzed&#xD;
      only on tumor tissue that was obtained at surgery or biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paucity of pathologic samples or poor fixation technique often make the tissue samples&#xD;
      unassessable for molecular aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the ability to extract tumor DNA from peripheral blood holds a great clinical&#xD;
      significance. Still, the molecular aberration evaluated on serum DNA should be correlated and&#xD;
      verified by comparison to standard evaluations performed on tumor samples. Our study aim is&#xD;
      to evaluate the feasibility of using serum DNA for routine diagnosis of tumor molecular&#xD;
      aberrations.&#xD;

      Backround:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic and epigenetic abrasions like loss of hetherozygosity and hypermethylation of gene&#xD;
      promoters are common aberration in gliomas. Detection of these aberrations serves as&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic tool. Examples: 1. oligodendrogliomas patients with combined 1p/19q&#xD;
      LOH within the tumor respond better to chemotherapy and have better prognosis, whereas LOH on&#xD;
      chromosome 10q is a marker for worse prognosis. 2. GBM patients with hypermethylation of the&#xD;
      promoter of methyl-guanine-methyl-transferase (MGMT) in the tumor respond better to&#xD;
      alkylating agent and have better prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As sample materials for diagnosis should be easily accessible by a minimally invasive&#xD;
      procedure, there has been much interest in the potential use of nucleic acid markers in the&#xD;
      blood of patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was demonstrated that LOH as well as hypermethylation could be detected in the&#xD;
      plasma/serum of patients with a variety of malignancies, suggesting that circulating&#xD;
      tumor-associated DNA in the blood of patients can be a key determinant in predicting genetic&#xD;
      and epigenetic abrasions in the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: to find whether genetic abrasions in serum DNA represent the tumor DNA in&#xD;
      patients with brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is tumor DNA can be detected in the serum of only high grade tumors or also in low grade&#xD;
      tumor?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood serum and tumor of patients are obtained anonymously, after the patient has signed a&#xD;
      consent form, prior to surgery as part of the procedure for tissue collection for the brain&#xD;
      tumor bank at Hadassah.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the tumor is stained with hematoxylin-and-eosin and Histopathologic diagnosis is&#xD;
      performed by a pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA is extracted from whole blood, serum and tumor of all patients with low grade or high&#xD;
      grade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine whether serum DNA represents the tumor DNA, LOH of 1p,19q,10q,17p,13q,&#xD;
      9p as well as methylation status of MGMT promoter will be tested in DNA samples from blood,&#xD;
      serum and tumor.&#xD;
