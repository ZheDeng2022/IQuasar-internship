      The purpose of this study is to modify and evaluate a culturally appropriate intervention&#xD;
      that is designed to improve diabetes self-care practices by enhancing the self-efficacy,&#xD;
      empowerment and diabetes knowledge among Latino adults over the age of 55 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is recognized that Latinos with diabetes experience substantially worse process and&#xD;
      outcomes of care. To address this problem, the goal of the proposed study is to modify and&#xD;
      evaluate a culturally appropriate intervention designed to improve diabetes self-care&#xD;
      practices by enhancing the self-efficacy, empowerment, and diabetes-specific knowledge among&#xD;
      Latino adults over the age of 55 years. Specific aims of the project are: 1) to modify an&#xD;
      existing empowerment intervention to improve self-care skills among Latinos with diabetes; 2)&#xD;
      to test the effect of a patient-centered culturally-tailored intervention that focuses on&#xD;
      increasing self-efficacy, knowledge about diabetes care, and self-care skills among Latinos&#xD;
      with diabetes on: a) biophysiological endpoints such as glycemic control; b) self-efficacy,&#xD;
      diabetes-specific knowledge, and self-care behaviors; c) psychosocial endpoints such as&#xD;
      quality of life; and d) total costs and cost-effectiveness of care; and 3) to test the effect&#xD;
      of the intervention on compliance with indicators of good process of diabetes care. To&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, the research team will conduct a controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial that will randomize 300 Latino adults over the age of 55 years with diabetes&#xD;
      who are cared for in 4 public clinics affiliated with the Martin Luther King/Drew University&#xD;
      Medical Center. Randomization will occur at the patient level. The primary endpoints for the&#xD;
      trial will be: 1) differences in glycemic control as reflected by mean difference in&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c over time for the intervention versus usual care control group; and 2)&#xD;
      difference in diabetes-specific quality of life over time. The trial will also measure a&#xD;
      number of important secondary endpoints both before and after exposure to the intervention:&#xD;
      self-efficacy, knowledge about diabetes, self-care behaviors, diabetes-specific symptoms,&#xD;
      quality of life, low density lipoprotein levels, blood pressure, weight, quality of care, and&#xD;
      costs. Variables that are likely to modify the effectiveness of the intervention will also be&#xD;
      examined, including acculturation, language, insurance status, and social support. These data&#xD;
      will provide the needed information to evaluate both the effectiveness and the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of the patient-centered intervention among Latino adults with diabetes. In&#xD;
      summary, by modifying and testing an empowerment intervention that focuses on the patient, we&#xD;
      hope to arm Latino adults with diabetes with the needed self-efficacy, knowledge, and&#xD;
      self-care skills to have the best possible glycemic control and process of health care&#xD;
      regardless of the resources available in their care setting.&#xD;
