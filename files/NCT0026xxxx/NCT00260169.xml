  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious illness that is difficult to diagnose and treat, especially in&#xD;
      populations that underutilize mental health services. The Latino population is one such&#xD;
      group. Accommodating patient preferences for care, provider capacities, and administrator&#xD;
      priorities is essential to the development of effective depression care interventions that&#xD;
      are sustainable in public sector systems. However, little is understood regarding the&#xD;
      depression treatment preferences of low-income Latinos who have not received quality&#xD;
      depression care and who may not feel that they can voice their opinions about their health&#xD;
      care. In addition, little is known about the preferences, capabilities, and priorities of&#xD;
      providers and administrators in primary care clinics. This study will determine ways to make&#xD;
      depression care more responsive to the needs of consumers in primary care clinics serving&#xD;
      low-income Latinos. The study will also evaluate the effectiveness of various treatments in&#xD;
      reducing depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline assessments of depression treatment preferences and resources,&#xD;
      participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive collaborative care&#xD;
      either immediately or after a waiting period. Individuals assigned to receive immediate care&#xD;
      will undergo treatment for 12 weeks. Other participants will receive treatment at a later&#xD;
      time. All participants will have the option to receive one of the following treatments: (1)&#xD;
      medication management from the Depression Care Specialist (DCS) and antidepressant medication&#xD;
      from their primary care provider (PCP); (2) cognitive-behavioral therapy from the DCS; or (3)&#xD;
      a combination of both treatments. Depression treatment outcomes and preferences will be&#xD;
      measured post-intervention. Provider and administrator preferences will also be measured&#xD;
      post-intervention and potential strategies for implementing patient-centered depression care&#xD;
      programs will be identified.&#xD;
