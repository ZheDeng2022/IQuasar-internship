  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alendronate is a safe and effective drug for treating osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.&#xD;
      However, its safety and efficacy in increasing bone mineral density in chronic peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis (PD) patients have not been investigated. Etidronate, another bisphosphonate, can&#xD;
      suppress the extent of coronary artery calcification in chronic hemodialysis patients. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that alendronate can increase bone mineral density and suppress&#xD;
      aortic and coronary artery calcification in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, randomized cross-over study. Fifty patients will be included. All&#xD;
      participants are randomly allocated to either group 1 or group 2. Each group consists of 25&#xD;
      patients. Group 1 patients receive alendronate 70 mg once weekly in the first 24 weeks of the&#xD;
      study, while group 2 patients receive the same dose of drug every week in the second 24&#xD;
      weeks. The extent of coronary artery and aortic calcification is evaluated by using&#xD;
      multidetector spiral computed tomography, whereas bone mineral density is measured by&#xD;
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Both examinations are performed at week 0, 24 and 48 for&#xD;
      each participant. Serum level of calcium should be kept within normal limits and serum level&#xD;
      of phosphorus should be kept below 6 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of Alendronate&#xD;
&#xD;
      One tablet of alendronate (70 mg per tablet) should be swallowed by each patient once every&#xD;
      week with water at least 30 minutes before breakfast, beverage or medication of the day&#xD;
      during the treatment period. Patients must not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking&#xD;
      the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Coronary Artery and Aortic Calcification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidetector spiral computerized tomography (CT) of the chest is performed at week 0, 24 and&#xD;
      48 for each participant to measure the extent of coronary and aortic calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Bone Density&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is performed at week 0, 24 and 48 for each participant to&#xD;
      measure the density of bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients characteristics such as age and sex are documented. Clinical parameters including&#xD;
      body height, body weight, duration of dialysis, calcium concentration of dialysate, and&#xD;
      medication under use are recorded. Blood pressure is measured at each clinical visit for 3&#xD;
      times after the patient has sit for at least 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Laboratory Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting serum levels of albumin, phosphorus, calcium, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), intact&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and hemoglobin level of each patient are checked at study entry&#xD;
      and once every month. Fasting serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol), and&#xD;
      hypersensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) of each patient are checked at study entry and once&#xD;
      every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record of Adverse Effects of Alendronate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse effect of alendronate is recorded every month at clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance of Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance of the patients is monitored using telephone calls once every week during the&#xD;
      treatment period with alendronate.&#xD;
