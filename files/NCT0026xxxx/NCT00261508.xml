  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an oral solution of risperidone&#xD;
      (an antipsychotic medication) versus placebo in the treatment of behavioral symptoms in&#xD;
      children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) are a group of neuropsychiatric disorders,&#xD;
      including autistic disorder, characterized by specific delays and deviance in social,&#xD;
      communicative, and cognitive development with an onset typically in the first years in life.&#xD;
      Children with PDD may show multiple, serious symptoms including hyperactivity, inattention,&#xD;
      impulsive and aggressive behavior, repetitive movements or speech patterns, sleep disorders,&#xD;
      screaming, and self-injurious behavior. Drug studies to date have suggested that different&#xD;
      behavioral symptoms of PDDs respond to neuroleptics, such as risperidone. This is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      risperidone (0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg/day) compared with placebo in the treatment of behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms in children 5 to 12 years of age with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD).&#xD;
      Patients receive study medication (risperidone or placebo) to be taken orally once a day at&#xD;
      gradually increasing doses up to a maximum of 0.06 mg/kg, adjusted at weekly intervals to&#xD;
      achieve optimal effectiveness while minimizing any intolerance to the drug. Treatment&#xD;
      continues at the optimal dose through Week 8. A parent or caregiver evaluates the child's&#xD;
      behavior and symptoms at scheduled office visits during the course of treatment. The primary&#xD;
      measure of effectiveness is the change in the Irritability Subscale of the Aberrant Behavior&#xD;
      Checklist (ABC) and other ABC subscales at end of treatment compared with baseline.&#xD;
      Additional assessments of effectiveness include: the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form&#xD;
      (N-CBRF); the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a measure of the patient's most disturbing&#xD;
      symptom; and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of the overall severity of the disorder.&#xD;
      Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study; measurement&#xD;
      of vital signs (pulse, temperature, blood pressure), body weight, and evaluation of the&#xD;
      presence and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale&#xD;
      (ESRS) at specified intervals; clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry,&#xD;
      urinalysis) before study initiation and at the end of treatment. The study hypothesis is that&#xD;
      risperidone is more effective than placebo for the treatment of behavioral symptoms in&#xD;
      children aged 5 to 12 years with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Risperidone oral&#xD;
      solution 1 mg/mL or placebo, taken orally, once daily. Days 1 - 2, dose is 0.01 mg/kg body&#xD;
      weight. Days 3 - 7 dose is 0.02 mg/kg, increasing on Days 8 - 14 to 0.04 mg/kg (maximum), and&#xD;
      0.06 mg/kg (maximum) through 8 weeks. Dosage may be adjusted at investigator's discretion.&#xD;
