  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two pain medications delivered by two different forms&#xD;
      of patient-controlled pain management systems: the Fentanyl HCl Patient-Controlled&#xD;
      Transdermal System (E-TRANS fentanyl) and the morphine intravenous pump. Fentanyl HCl and&#xD;
      morphine are narcotic pain relievers. The E-TRANS fentanyl system is a small unit worn on the&#xD;
      patient's upper outer arm or chest that uses low-intensity electrical current to deliver&#xD;
      fentanyl through the skin and into the patient's bloodstream. The patients studied will be&#xD;
      those who have just had scheduled abdominal or pelvic surgery.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to compare two pain medications delivered by two different forms&#xD;
      of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). PCA is a form of pain management that allows the&#xD;
      patient to control the amount of pain medication he or she receives. The PCA E-TRANS fentanyl&#xD;
      system is a credit card-sized unit that is worn on the patient's upper outer arm or chest. It&#xD;
      uses low-intensity electrical current to move fentanyl through the skin and into the&#xD;
      patient's bloodstream. It does not require the insertion of an intravenous (IV) needle, or&#xD;
      injection for pain management. PCA IV morphine is delivered into a vein by an IV infusion&#xD;
      pump that is specially designed to be controlled by the patient. The PCA E-TRANS fentanyl&#xD;
      system delivers a 40 microgram dose of fentanyl and the PCA IV morphine delivers a 1&#xD;
      milligram intravenous dose of morphine. The patients in this study are those scheduled for&#xD;
      non-emergent abdominal or pelvic surgery. Before surgery, patients will be taught how to use&#xD;
      both PCA devices, and randomly assigned to receive either PCA IV morphine or E-TRANS&#xD;
      fentanyl. After undergoing surgery, patients will have the PCA device applied to the skin&#xD;
      (E-TRANS fentanyl) or an IV inserted into a vein (PCA IV morphine), according to the random&#xD;
      assignment. The patient will then be allowed to control delivery of the assigned medication&#xD;
      for 72 hours. During the first 24 hours, the patient will be asked about the amount of pain&#xD;
      he or she is having. The primary measure of effectiveness is successful pain relief (defined&#xD;
      by a rating of &quot;Excellent&quot;, or &quot;Good&quot;) on the 24-hour patient global assessment of the method&#xD;
      of pain control. At 24, 48, and 72 hours, the patient will be asked a set of specific&#xD;
      questions to measure the effectiveness of the PCA. In addition, the patient's doctor, and&#xD;
      nurses, will answer questions about the PCA system. Safety will be assessed by monitoring the&#xD;
      patient's vital signs and recording any adverse events, including problems at the location on&#xD;
      the patient's body where the PCA device has been applied or inserted. The objective is to&#xD;
      establish that the Fentanyl HCl Patient-Controlled Transdermal System (E-TRANS fentanyl) is&#xD;
      as effective as intravenous (IV) PCA morphine in controlling pain after non-emergent&#xD;
      abdominal or pelvic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-TRANS fentanyl 40 mcg transdermally per patient-activated dose over 10 minutes, up to 6&#xD;
      doses per hour or a maximum of 80 doses in 24 hours; Patient controlled intravenous morphine&#xD;
      1 mg dose, up to 10 doses per hour or a maximum of 240 doses in 24 hours. Study duration is&#xD;
      72 hours.&#xD;
