  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin dependent Type I diabetics require daily insulin therapy to normalize blood glucose&#xD;
      but may have difficulty with significant glycemic excursions and hypoglycemic episodes and&#xD;
      crises. Islet cell transplantation can provide relief from daily insulin therapy, normalize&#xD;
      blood glucose and reduce or eliminate short and long-term diabetes-related complications.&#xD;
      &quot;PEG-Encapsulated Islet Allografts&quot; is a new islet transplant product under development that&#xD;
      does not require the ongoing use of immunosuppressive drugs after the implant. This study&#xD;
      will test the safety and efficacy of PEG-Encapsulated Islet Allografts in the treatment of&#xD;
      Type I diabetes and provide functional outcome measurements.&#xD;

      Allogeneic Cultured Islet Cells (human, Novocell); Encapsulated in Polyethylene Glycol;&#xD;
      Administered Subcutaneously are a combination biologic and device product in which the&#xD;
      pharmacologically active agent is human insulin that is released from the functional islet&#xD;
      cells by natural production and release, stimulated by control mechanisms in response to&#xD;
      blood glucose concentrations. The device component is a uniform and conformal polymer coating&#xD;
      around each islet. Islet cells are isolated from multiple human pancreases procured from&#xD;
      human organ donors who meet a specific human donor profile established by the UNOS and the&#xD;
      FDA's requirements for Good Tissue Practices. Because the pancreases used for islet cell&#xD;
      isolation are not intended for whole-organ transplantation, specific procurement, surgical&#xD;
      removal, packaging and shipping protocols are provided by Novocell, Inc. to the Organ&#xD;
      Procurement Organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is demonstration that encapsulated islet allografts can be implanted&#xD;
      safely in the subcutaneous tissues without the use of long-term immunosuppression. The&#xD;
      expected functional outcomes from the implantation of the encapsulated islets are significant&#xD;
      reductions in the average blood glucose daily glycemic excursions and in insulin requirements&#xD;
      as well as significant increases in C-peptide levels in response to meal challenges. The&#xD;
      ultimate expected outcome is that patients who receive these implants will have reduced&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c levels that may be associated with reduced long-term diabetic complications.&#xD;
      An important outcome should be reduction in hypoglycemic episodes and crises with&#xD;
      significantly functioning grafts without having the risks associated with hepatic portal vein&#xD;
      infusion and long-term immunosuppression.&#xD;
