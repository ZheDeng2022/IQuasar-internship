  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of the Prolong study, currently submitted for publication, show that patients&#xD;
      with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolic event who have altered D-dimer levels, measured&#xD;
      one month after anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists is stopped, have a high rate of&#xD;
      recurrences (about 14%) and a prolongation of anticoagulation is effective in reducing&#xD;
      significantly this rate. Those patients with normal D-dimer (about 60% of all patients&#xD;
      examined) have a low rate of recurrences (about 5%) and likely a prolongation of&#xD;
      anticoagulation in all these patients cannot be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with these results, the Prolong-Two study aims at assessing the predictive role for&#xD;
      recurrence of D-dimer levels measured: a) during anticoagulation, b) one month after its&#xD;
      withdrawal and c) periodically during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (including proximal deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis of a leg and/or pulmonary embolism) which are treated with vitamin K antagonists&#xD;
      for not less than 6 months are considered for the study. D-dimer assay is performed during&#xD;
      anticoagulation and patients with altered results continue the anticoagulation for 6 more&#xD;
      months. Those with normal D-dimer stop the anticoagulant treatment and are again examined one&#xD;
      month later. Anticoagulation is resumed for 6 more months in those patients with abnormal&#xD;
      D-dimer results but is permanently stopped in those with a normal assay. The latter patients&#xD;
      are examined and D-dimer assay performed again every two months to evaluate the natural&#xD;
      history of the assay after anticoagulation is stopped and the possible predictive value for&#xD;
      recurrence of a change of the assay during follow-up from normal to abnormal results.&#xD;
