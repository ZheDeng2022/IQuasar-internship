  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a disease which affects between one and two percent of all individuals aged over&#xD;
      40 years. According to recent Canadian National Institute for the Blind figures, it is the&#xD;
      second largest specific cause of blindness in this country. The most common form of glaucoma,&#xD;
      open-angle glaucoma, is incipient and typically results in a progressive loss of vision&#xD;
      without symptoms due to damage to a structure inside the eye called the optic nerve head.&#xD;
      Although the most important known risk factor for the development of open-angle glaucoma is&#xD;
      high intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball), a number of researchers have&#xD;
      shown that a sizeable proportion of patients continue to lose vision in spite of successful&#xD;
      treatment to lower their intraocular pressure. This finding suggests that there may be&#xD;
      additional risk factors involved. Ocular vasospasm (the inability of certain blood vessels to&#xD;
      dilate and increase blood flow according to the needs the eye) and vascular disease are among&#xD;
      other factors implicated but their roles have not yet been fully investigated. The Canadian&#xD;
      Glaucoma Study Group proposes to investigate the role of risk factors, including vasospasm&#xD;
      and vascular disease, involved in the progression of open-angle glaucoma. We will recruit 410&#xD;
      patients with open-angle glaucoma across 4 centres (Halifax, Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto)&#xD;
      who will be treated by experienced investigative ophthalmologists according to a uniform&#xD;
      standard protocol to ensure that all patients are managed in the same manner. The patients&#xD;
      will be followed meticulously with the most modern and accurate tests available every four&#xD;
      months for a period of 5 years to determine whether progression has taken place. Visual&#xD;
      function will be measured using two techniques called conventional perimetry and&#xD;
      blue-on-yellow perimetry, and optic nerve heads will be examined with a special scanner&#xD;
      capable of three-dimensional imaging. By defining both the ocular and systemic profiles of&#xD;
      patients who progress and do not progress, we may be able to identify which patients will&#xD;
      benefit from the standard treatment of intraocular pressure reduction, such as that&#xD;
      prescribed in the study. More importantly, we will identify the characteristics of patients&#xD;
      who do not benefit from standard treatment, so that alternative ones may be developed. Such&#xD;
      studies are clearly necessary, but have not yet been conducted. We believe that the proposed&#xD;
      study will increase our knowledge of open-angle glaucoma and reduce its impact on blindness&#xD;
      and visual disability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated intraocular pressure is the most important known risk factor for the development and&#xD;
      progression of open-angle glaucoma. While pressure reduction is beneficial in many cases, a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients continue to progress despite clinically acceptable&#xD;
      pressure levels. Many investigators have found no differences in pressure characteristics&#xD;
      between progressing and non-progressing patients, highlighting our current inability to&#xD;
      identify which patients will respond to pressure reduction. It is likely that this inability&#xD;
      stems from our poor understanding of the risk factors, both ocular and systemic, for&#xD;
      progression and the probability that glaucoma is a disease with multiple pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this application the Canadian Glaucoma Study Group proposes a multi-centre prospective&#xD;
      study with the objective of characterising the risk factors associated with the progression&#xD;
      of open-angle glaucoma. We will determine sub-groups of patients with regard to the type of&#xD;
      progression, thereby allowing us to identify the ocular and systemic profiles of patients who&#xD;
      are likely to and not likely to benefit from intraocular pressure reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) The relationship between intraocular pressure characteristics during follow-up and&#xD;
      survival rates with regard to progression of open-angle glaucoma is weak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Patients with vasospasm have a higher survival rate than patients without vasospasm with&#xD;
      the clinical management prescribed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Patients with vascular disease have a lower survival rate than patients without&#xD;
      vascular disease with the clinical management prescribed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test these hypotheses by following a total of 410 patients in 4 centres (Halifax,&#xD;
      Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto) every 4 months for a period of 5 years using a uniform&#xD;
      protocol for both the clinical management and study procedures. Clinical management will&#xD;
      involve at least 30% reduction in intraocular pressure from the baseline untreated value,&#xD;
      followed by an additional 20% or greater reduction after a progressive event. The study&#xD;
      procedures include conventional perimetry, blue-on-yellow perimetry and scanning laser&#xD;
      tomography of the optic nerve head and nerve fibre layer. We will measure finger blood flow&#xD;
      with both heat and cold provocation to assess each patient's susceptibility to vasospasm and&#xD;
      also obtain haematological, biochemical and rheological profiles to assess the presence of&#xD;
      vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression of either visual field and optic nerve head damage will be termed a progressive&#xD;
      event occurring after a predefined change from baseline. Events will be defined separately&#xD;
      for each technique based on percentiles of empirically derived values of test-retest&#xD;
      variability, allowing a degree of standardisation between techniques. Comparison of survival&#xD;
      times between groups (e.g. vasospastic and non-vasospastic) will be made with Cox's&#xD;
      survivorship analysis with a repeated measures model. Where appropriate, group comparisons&#xD;
      will be made with the group t-test or Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we can characterise more fully the risk factors for glaucomatous progression, we may be&#xD;
      able to identify the ocular and systemic profiles of patients who will benefit from our&#xD;
      current treatment of pressure reduction. More importantly, we can identify the profiles of&#xD;
      patients who respond poorly to pressure reduction so that future research efforts can lead to&#xD;
      the development and implementation of alternative therapy. We believe that this is a&#xD;
      significant study which will result in a better understanding of open-angle glaucoma and help&#xD;
      reduce its impact on blindness and visual disability.&#xD;
