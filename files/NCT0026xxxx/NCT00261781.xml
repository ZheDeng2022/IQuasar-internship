      The major aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of a home-based treadmill walking&#xD;
      program in improving walking capacity and quality of life in people with early mid-stage&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease(PD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common degenerative&#xD;
      neurological condition suffered by Australians, with more than 30,000 Australians having PD&#xD;
      at any one time (Parkinson's Australia). Hypokinesia, ie, reduced speed and amplitude of&#xD;
      movement, is a major impairment of motor control affecting walking in people with PD. Over&#xD;
      time, the development of slow, shuffling walking contributes to loss of independence and&#xD;
      falls, with devastating consequences for individuals with PD and their families(Ashburn et&#xD;
      al, 2001, Playfer 2001). Any decrease or delay in disability will reduce the personal and&#xD;
      financial costs to individuals with PD, their families, health care resources and the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of previous studies suggest exercise capacity and exercise habits are positively&#xD;
      correlated. In people with mild Parkinson's disease (Canning et al 2005), walking capacity,&#xD;
      measured as distance walked in the 6-min walk test, correlated with the amount of walking&#xD;
      (r=.64, p&lt;0.01) performed each week. Similarly, in an earlier study of people with mild to&#xD;
      moderate Parkinson's disease, regular exercise was associated with better exercise capacity&#xD;
      (Canning et al 1997). It appears, therefore, that proactive intervention aimed at developing&#xD;
      good exercise habits in sedentary individuals with early to mid-stage Parkinson's disease has&#xD;
      the potential to reduce or delay walking difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to establish the efficacy of a home-based treadmill walking program in&#xD;
      providing an early intervention which addresses the primary motor control impairment of&#xD;
      hypokinesia, while at the same time maintaining or improving exercise capacity.&#xD;
