  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implantation failure of the embryo might be the result from the environment in the uterus.&#xD;
      Proteins (cytokines) are screted by the endometrium which can result in a pro or anti&#xD;
      inflammatory environment. The aim of this study is to identify pre-implantation endometrial&#xD;
      and embryo cytokine expression profiles associated with successful and unsuccessful embryo&#xD;
      implantation in assisted reproduction cycles.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of the transferred embryo to implant remains the most important limiting factor&#xD;
      determining IVF success rates. It is hypothesed that implantation failure following IVF&#xD;
      treatment may be caused by abnormal cytokine expression by embryos and endometrium and by&#xD;
      subclinical bacterial vaginosis. Analysis of cytokine expression in the culture media of&#xD;
      embryos and in the endometrium during 'the window of implantation' offers the opportunity to&#xD;
      study the cross-talk between the embryo and endometrium and identify optimal cytokine&#xD;
      expression patterns. Increased knowledge of cytokine interaction and the impact of bacterial&#xD;
      vaginosis on cytokine expression may serve as the basis from which to develop and apply&#xD;
      treatment regimens to improve embryo selection and endometrial preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify pre-implantation endometrial and embryo cytokine&#xD;
      expression profiles associated with successful and unsuccessful implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective, mono-center, observational cohort study. Study population:&#xD;
      We will aim to include at least 160 women initiating their first or second IVF/ ICSI cycle. A&#xD;
      subgroup of forty women will be invited for endometrial secretion aspiration in a natural&#xD;
      cycle as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research purposes, transcervical aspiration of endometrial secretion will be performed.&#xD;
      An endocervical swab will be taken to assess the existence of bacterial vaginosis. A single&#xD;
      ultrasound measurement of uterine artery pulsatile resistance will be made (by pulsed&#xD;
      Doppler) and endometrium thickness will be measured. The embryo transfer and IVF/ ICSI&#xD;
      treatment will be performed as usual. The main study parameter is the cytokine profile in the&#xD;
      endometrium and from the embryo culture medium, measured with Luminex (a multiplex&#xD;
      immunoassay). Implantation rate, ultrasound measurements and bacterial vaginosis will be&#xD;
      correlated to the cytokine profile. The cytokine profile from the endometrium will be&#xD;
      compared with the cytokine profile from the supernatant of the embryo. In a reference group&#xD;
      the cytokine profile in the endometrial secretion in a natural cycle will be compared to the&#xD;
      cytokine profile in a IVF/ ICSI treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theoretical risk associated with this study might be disruption of embryo implantation.&#xD;
      However, our group has developed a technique of obtaining endometrial material at the time of&#xD;
      embryo transfer which, as we have previously shown, does not disrupt the process of&#xD;
      implantation. The burden is minimal; patients will not have to make an extra visit to the&#xD;
      hospital. The investigations are painless and will not take more than a few minutes. No side&#xD;
      effects or risks have been reported.&#xD;
