    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate user experience with the EVRAÂ® Contraceptive&#xD;
      Transdermal Patch; specifically, user satisfaction with the EVRAÂ® Patch, and if applicable,&#xD;
      user preference of the EVRAÂ® Patch compared with the previous method of contraception. The&#xD;
      study also evaluates contraceptive efficacy, safety and user compliance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EVRA is the first transdermal contraceptive patch to receive approval by Health Canada and&#xD;
      Marketing Authorization throughout the European Union. This is an open-label, single-arm,&#xD;
      multicenter clinical study with a treatment duration of 24 weeks (6 treatment cycles of 4&#xD;
      weeks). Four clinic visits are scheduled: a screening Visit 1, in which subjects are asked to&#xD;
      complete a set of questions about satisfaction with the current method of contraception, and&#xD;
      questions about overall health status. Visits 2, 3, and 4 follow after Cycles 1, 3, and 6,&#xD;
      respectively of EVRA treatment. At Visits 3 and 4, the subjects are asked to answer questions&#xD;
      about satisfaction with EVRA, and about overall health status. At Visit 4 (final study visit)&#xD;
      the subjects are asked to compare EVRA with previously used contraceptive methods. Compliance&#xD;
      is assessed at all visits by returned boxes of study medication and a review of Diary Cards&#xD;
      where subjects recorded the dates and sites of patch application, and details of any patch&#xD;
      detachment. The study will generate the first large-scale, European dataset on women's&#xD;
      experience with EVRA, including satisfaction, safety, efficacy, and compliance. These data&#xD;
      will be compared with subjects' experience with previously used methods of contraception.&#xD;
      Each EVRA patch, containing 6 mg NGMN and 600 ug EE, and delivering 150 microgram NGMN and 20&#xD;
      ug EE over 24 hours for 7 days, is worn for 1 week and replaced for 3 consecutive weeks. The&#xD;
      fourth week is patch-free. Subjects can wear EVRA on 1 of 4 areas: buttock, abdomen, upper&#xD;
      torso, or upper arm.&#xD;
