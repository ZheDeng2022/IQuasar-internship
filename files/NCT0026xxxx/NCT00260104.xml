      It would be useful to study coronary arteriovenous difference of various markers in patients&#xD;
      who are undergoing coronary angiography for suspected coronary artery disease. Environmental&#xD;
      and genetic factors may play a role in the progression of coronary artery disease. The goal&#xD;
      of this project is to establish a series of cross-sectional / case-control studies to&#xD;
      evaluate risk factors of coronary artery disease in China.&#xD;

      This study is designed to investigate the epidemiologic, genetic, laboratory and clinical&#xD;
      characterization of individuals with coronary artery disease. The study group will consist of&#xD;
      consecutive patients who are undergoing coronary angiography for suspected coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. The diagnosis of coronary artery disease will be confirmed by coronary angiography&#xD;
      performed with the Judkins technique using a quantitative coronary angiographic system.&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease will be considered to be present if there is a diameter stenosis of&#xD;
      at least 50% in at least one of the three major epicardial coronary arteries. The number of&#xD;
      diseased vessels will be determined and a classification of 1-, 2-, and 3-vessel disease will&#xD;
      be used. Coronary artery segments will be defined according to the Coronary Artery Surgery&#xD;
      Study classification. Blood samples from vein and coronary artery will be collected. We will&#xD;
      study coronary arteriovenous difference of various markers. Urinary samples will be obtained&#xD;
      the day of coronary angiography. We will explore the environmental (including family history,&#xD;
      life style, diet, physical activity, neuropsychological functioningï¼Œplasma levels of&#xD;
      oxidative stress factors, angiogenic factors, and inflammatory markers, etc.) and genetic&#xD;
      (including oxidative stress factors and inflammatory factors, etc.) risk factors. We will&#xD;
      study the association between various environmental risk factors with the clinical&#xD;
      characterization and correlation between the genetic polymorphisms and the presence of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease.&#xD;
