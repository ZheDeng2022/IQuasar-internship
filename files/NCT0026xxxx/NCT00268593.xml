  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel (Taxotere) is an approved chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of&#xD;
      androgen-independent prostate cancer. The aim of the study is to investigate whether addition&#xD;
      of the investigational drug PI-88 will increase the efficacy of docetaxel in this disease.&#xD;
      PI-88 inhibits cancer growth by inhibiting the development of new blood vessels and starving&#xD;
      the tumour of oxygen and nutrients (anti-angiogenic). Because PI-88 and docetaxel have&#xD;
      different mechanisms of action, they are expected to have increased (synergistic) activity&#xD;
      when combined.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a multi-centre, open-label randomised phase II study in patients with&#xD;
      androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC), with a lead-in combination tolerance study. The&#xD;
      aim of the lead-in phase is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PI-88&#xD;
      administered either 4 days/week or 7 days/week) in combination with fixed doses of docetaxel&#xD;
      (75 mg/m^2 every 21 days) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily). In the randomized phase II&#xD;
      component, patients will receive PI-88 at the MTD, either 4 days/week or 7 days/week, in&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel and prednisone. The patients will receive up to 10 treatment&#xD;
      cycles of the combination therapy. Response to treatment will be assessed by measuring serum&#xD;
      levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Other efficacy measures will include radiological&#xD;
      assessment, progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>Recruitment was stopped due to higher than expected febrile neutropenia rate (27%). Fifty-one SAEs were reported in 33 patients, of which 7 were related to PI-88 treatment: non-neutropenic sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pulmonary embolism, febrile dyspnoea, haematuria (x2), left middle cerebral artery infarction.&#xD;
Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported in &gt;5% of patients comprise dehydration, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea and thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
Two patients died during the study, one due to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and one due to metastatic prostate cancer.</description>

IL-6 pretreatment levels were not predictive (p = 0.5111) but post-treatment (p = 0.0008) and change (p = 0.0020) were.&#xD;
