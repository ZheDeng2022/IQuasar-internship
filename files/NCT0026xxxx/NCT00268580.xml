  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether the Emergency Department (ED) Asthma Care&#xD;
      Project (ACP) leads to improved asthma care delivery and patient outcomes in the ED setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Implementation of a multi-disciplinary asthma strategy/clinical pathway for the&#xD;
      treatment of asthma in the ED, based upon the 1999 Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines (and&#xD;
      subsequent updates), will increase adherence with published management guidelines in the ED&#xD;
      setting, reduce variations in the emergency management of acute asthma, increase utilization&#xD;
      of specialized asthma services and improve outcomes for patients following ED visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational, pre- post-intervention study will compare a stratified sample of 10&#xD;
      Ontario hospital EDs (5 intervention and 5 control sites). Chart abstractions will be&#xD;
      performed on all adult visits for acute asthma over a 3 month period before and after&#xD;
      implementation of the Ontario Hospital Associations (OHA)'s (now Ontario Lung Association's&#xD;
      (OLA's) ED Asthma Care Map. Patient and provider surveys and provider focus group post&#xD;
      intervention will also be conducted. Primary outcome measures are hospitalizations and repeat&#xD;
      ED visit rates. Secondary outcome measures include: length of stay in ED, self-reported&#xD;
      adherence with referral to specialized asthma services made during index ED visit,&#xD;
      self-reported asthma control, and use of self-management strategies (including use of action&#xD;
      plan), use of asthma management strategies promoted by the care map (such as use of objective&#xD;
      measure of airflow rates, use of steroids, education, referral to specialized asthma services&#xD;
      on discharge). Ease of implementation and barriers to implementation will also be evaluated.&#xD;
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      Study findings may be used to support implementation of a standardized ED clinical pathway&#xD;
      and related ED provider education program throughout Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of the pathway on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of the pathway on health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ease of implementation of the pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observational, pre- post-intervention study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison between intervention and control sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient and provider surveys and provider focus group post intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre- and post- intervention chart abstraction of key elements of the process of asthma&#xD;
           care in ED setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-intervention telephone survey of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-intervention self-administered survey of health care providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post-intervention focus group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The Ontario Respiratory Outcomes Research Network (ORORN) is completing a Canadian&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)-funded study on &quot;Determinants of Regional Variation in&#xD;
      Emergency Department Utilization and Hospitalizations for Asthma in Ontario&quot;. This study&#xD;
      included detailed chart abstractions on the process of care in the ED as well as detailed&#xD;
      telephone questionnaires of adults and children who presented to EDs for treatment of acute&#xD;
      asthma in a stratified sample of 14 hospitals across Ontario between March 2001 and Feb 2002.&#xD;
      Data are available on over 5,000 ED visits. It is proposed that a number of these sites be&#xD;
      approached to participate in ED ACP. A sub-set of data from these sites will provide baseline&#xD;
      (pre-intervention) data, and some or all of the intervention and control sites for the ED ACP&#xD;
      could be selected from the ORORN study sites. This would minimize (or potentially eliminate)&#xD;
      costs of primary baseline data collection, and expedite collection of post-intervention data&#xD;
      given the familiarity of sites and research personnel with the previous study instruments and&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Intervention and Control Sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five intervention (Kingston General Hospital, Belleville General Hospital, Sudbury Regional&#xD;
      Hospital, Renfrew Victoria Hospital, and Lake of the Woods District Hospital [Kenora]) and 5&#xD;
      control sites ( Prince Edward County Memorial Hospital, Lakeridge Hospital [Oshawa], St.&#xD;
      Joseph's Hospital [Hamilton], Chatham District Hospital, and Owen Sound District Hospital)&#xD;
      were selected. To ensure the sites are representative of Ontario, sites will be selected&#xD;
      based upon a sampling frame which takes into consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital/community size and location (urban/rural; geographic setting)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of care (community/academic -tertiary/quaternary setting)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization rates for asthma in adults and children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of local specialized asthma services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to quality baseline (pre-intervention) data from the ORORN ED study database&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness of site to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of other Asthma Plan of Action initiatives which might confound or be&#xD;
           confounded by this intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case identification within each ED will be performed by the method used by ORORN in a&#xD;
      previous asthma ED study. This involves reviewing ED log books of presenting complaints&#xD;
      potentially indicative of asthma OR electronically available data on disposition diagnoses of&#xD;
      asthma. Potentially eligible patients will be approached as outlined below to obtain informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ED records (log books) from participating hospitals will be reviewed by a local research&#xD;
      assistant for the preceding 24 to 72 hrs on a daily basis (Monday through Friday). Patient&#xD;
      records with a chief complaint potentially indicative of an acute asthma exacerbation will be&#xD;
      reviewed to capture all patients with a discharge diagnosis of an acute exacerbation of&#xD;
      asthma. ED records with the following complaints in the logbook will be reviewed: asthma,&#xD;
      shortness of breath, wheeze, cough, chest tightness, difficulty breathing. To be eligible the&#xD;
      disposition diagnosis on the ED sheet must be asthma. Patients with a history of asthma&#xD;
      presenting for reasons other than an acute exacerbation of asthma (such as prescription&#xD;
      renewal or unrelated complaint) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be mailed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An introductory letter (Appendix A) outlining the purpose of the study, and informing&#xD;
           them that they will be contacted by a research assistant within one week of their&#xD;
           presentation to the hospital and invited to participate in the study and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A consent form (Appendix B). The Research assistant will contact patients by telephone&#xD;
           to obtain informed consent. A telephone contact sheet (Appendix C) outlines the script&#xD;
           to be used by the research assistant when speaking to potential participants. Once&#xD;
           consent has been obtained the participant will answer a questionnaire (by telephone or&#xD;
           in person). The questionnaire will be entered into a computerized version of a paper&#xD;
           copy (Appendix D). The patient chart will then be abstracted also using a computerized&#xD;
           version of the paper copy (Appendix E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient re-presents to the ED within 14 days of first visit the research assistant&#xD;
      will contact the participant to obtain consent again. Any visit within the 14day period will&#xD;
      be considered the same episode and repeat consent will not be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Intervention Chart Abstraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention chart abstraction data will be obtained from either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the ORORN ED study database, for sites that participated in the previous ORORN study,&#xD;
           which contains data on adult and pediatric ED visits between March 2001 and February&#xD;
           2002, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. retrospective primary data collection of ED visits for asthma between March 2001 and&#xD;
           February 2002 for sites selected that did not participate in the previous ORORN ED&#xD;
           study, utilizing the ORORN chart abstraction tool (or an abbreviated audit using&#xD;
           specific components of that tool). (NOTE: If this is necessary, the research team and&#xD;
           advisory committee will need to determine an appropriate abbreviated time-period to&#xD;
           audit (eg. 3 months rather than a full 12 months) to remain within budget and meet&#xD;
           target time-lines.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Chart Abstraction Post-intervention chart abstraction data will be obtained&#xD;
      by primary data collection, using the ORORN chart abstraction tool (or an abbreviation&#xD;
      thereof).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Collection of Administrative Outcomes Hospitalization rates, readmission&#xD;
      rates, and ED repeat visit rates for asthma and asthma-related conditions (as defined by the&#xD;
      OHA Report Cards) will be obtained for each site directly or from national administrative&#xD;
      databases (CIHI, NACRS). Referral rates to local specialized services will be collected where&#xD;
      relevant and possible in small communities directly from the community resource involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention Survey of Patients Patients eligible to participate will be mailed an&#xD;
      introductory letter outlining the purpose of the study and a consent form. Subsequently,&#xD;
      potential participants will be contacted by telephone by a research associate. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, a brief (5-10 minute maximum) telephone interview will be&#xD;
      performed. A questionnaire for this purpose will be developed, including data elements from&#xD;
      the ORORN regional variation study questionnaire to enable comparisons. It will also included&#xD;
      whether the patient received education or referrals during their ED visit, whether they&#xD;
      complied with referrals, and questions regarding the impact of the patient's visit on their&#xD;
      asthma self-management skills and confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention Self-administered Survey of Health Care Providers A sample of ED health&#xD;
      care providers involved in the delivery of aspects of the clinical pathway will be contacted&#xD;
      at each site, and invited to complete a self-administered survey. A questionnaire for this&#xD;
      purpose will be developed, to include perceived change in practice, perceived change in&#xD;
      knowledge of recommended asthma management, perceived utility of the pathway, barriers to&#xD;
      pathway implementation, and recommendations for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention Site Representatives Focus Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post-intervention focus group including representatives from each participating site will&#xD;
      be convened to gain additional insight into the site specific and aggregate outcomes and&#xD;
      barriers that would be unlikely to emerge without the interaction found in a group. Aggregate&#xD;
      data will be distributed to all sites, and site specific data to individual sites. The focus&#xD;
      group will be invited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assist with interpretation of quantitative findings;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  obtain perceptions of project outcomes and impacts;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify project strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify solutions related to project implementation; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  generate new ideas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations This study has been approved by the Queen's University Health Sciences&#xD;
      and Affiliated Teaching Hospital's Research Ethics Board (REB) (Appendix F). Ethics is also&#xD;
      being sought at all participating sites. The Queen's submission will be shared with sites and&#xD;
      study coordinator will assist sites, where necessary, to facilitate the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to medical records will be sought from each institution. As this study involves&#xD;
      questionnaire data collected by interview, stress may occur as a result of perceived pressure&#xD;
      to answer specific questions. Participants will be informed during consent process that&#xD;
      participation is voluntary, they may chose to not answer specific questions, and may withdraw&#xD;
      from the study at any time without affecting their future medical care. Patient&#xD;
      confidentiality will be ensured at all times. Confidential individual identification numbers&#xD;
      will be randomly generated and sequentially by the web based data entry system, and used to&#xD;
      link the abstracted data and questionnaire data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy officers have been contacted at each of the participating sites to ensure that the&#xD;
      protocol meets the sites privacy protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
