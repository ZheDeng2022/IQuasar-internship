        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent for study by parent or guardian. Assent will be obtained from&#xD;
             all minors 11 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age older than or equal to 3 years and younger than or equal to 30 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Endoscopic findings consistent with EE (edema, furrowing, exudates, rings)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological findings to include proliferation of basal layer and peak eosinophil&#xD;
             density ≥24 per high power field (400x). This degree of tissue eosinophilia has been&#xD;
             shown to correlate well with poor-responsiveness to acid suppression therapy,&#xD;
             suggesting it is a primary eosinophilic disease and not secondary to GERD[11].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy evaluation including skin-prick testing with multiple food antigens to insure&#xD;
             elimination diet is not indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If allergic to specific foods, option to be on a minimum 3 months of elimination diet&#xD;
             without detectable resolution by repeat endoscopy with biopsies demonstrating no&#xD;
             improvement to disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled at CCHMC will be under the direct care of Dr. Putnam or any of the&#xD;
             other staff gastroenterologists at this institution who will supervise endoscopic&#xD;
             procedures. Patients may also be enrolled at institutions other than CCHMC, but the&#xD;
             diagnosis of EE must be validated by an expert pathologist in EE at CCHMC (Margaret&#xD;
             Collins, MD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  20 additional patients without EE will be enrolled as unaffected controls for purposes&#xD;
             of comparison with patients with EE. Enrollment pool will comprise patients undergoing&#xD;
             routine upper endoscopy and having no identifiable pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of poor tolerance to FP, patients unable to cooperate with use&#xD;
             of MDI, pregnant females, patients inhaling any corticosteroid for asthma, and&#xD;
             patients with concurrent or recent (within 3 months) use of systemic steroids.&#xD;
