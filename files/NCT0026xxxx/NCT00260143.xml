  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men infected with the HIV virus (the virus that causes AIDS) often lose weight even though&#xD;
      they may try to eat more food to gain weight. The reasons for this weight loss are not clear.&#xD;
      Many men with HIV have low levels of testosterone in their blood. Testosterone is a hormone&#xD;
      that is naturally produced in the bodies of both men and women and has important effects on&#xD;
      building muscle and bone mass. The purpose of this study is to find out if providing&#xD;
      additional testosterone to HIV infected men who have low testosterone can help them gain&#xD;
      weight, increase their muscle mass, and feel better. The study will also help see if&#xD;
      testosterone improves the efficiency with which your body produces and uses energy including&#xD;
      fat. The dose of testosterone being used in this study will raise testosterone levels in the&#xD;
      blood to higher than normal levels (2-3 times normal level).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose. Although the prevalence of weight loss in HIV-infected individuals has decreased in&#xD;
      the developed world with the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it&#xD;
      continues to be a significant problem worldwide, and in the USA. The pathophysiology of&#xD;
      weight loss in HIV-infected individuals is undoubtedly complex; decreased energy intake,&#xD;
      metabolic dysregulation, intercurrent opportunistic infections, gastrointestinal infections&#xD;
      and malabsorption, and hormonal abnormalities all contribute to the multifactorial origin of&#xD;
      weight loss. Although patients with HIV-infection may lose both fat and lean tissue, the loss&#xD;
      of lean body mass is an important aspect of the weight loss associated with wasting. Weight&#xD;
      loss in HIV-infected patients is a good predictor of survival, risk of hospitalization, and&#xD;
      opportunistic infections. The magnitude of depletion of nonfat tissues is an important&#xD;
      determinant of the time of death in AIDS. One correctable factor in the complex&#xD;
      pathophysiology of sarcopenia in HIV-infection is androgen deficiency. There is a high&#xD;
      prevalence of low testosterone levels in HIV-infected men. Spontaneous and&#xD;
      experimentally-induced androgen-deficiency in young men is associated with decreased muscle&#xD;
      mass and strength. Testosterone replacement increases lean body mass, muscle strength, and&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis in androgen-deficient, young men. The studies supported by this&#xD;
      grant in the previous budget period and others have demonstrated that testosterone&#xD;
      replacement of HIV-infected men with weight loss and low testosterone levels is associated&#xD;
      with an increase in fat-free mass and maximal voluntary muscle strength. Similarly,&#xD;
      testosterone replacement of older men with low testosterone levels is associated with gains&#xD;
      in fat-free mass and grip strength. However, it remains unknown whether testosterone-induced&#xD;
      increases in fat-free mass and maximal voluntary strength are associated with clinically&#xD;
      meaningful improvements in physical function and perceptions of physical function. Therefore,&#xD;
      the primary objective of this competing renewal application is to determine if testosterone&#xD;
      replacement of HIV-infected men with weight loss and low testosterone levels will improve&#xD;
      objective measures of physical function, perceptions of physical function and body image. Our&#xD;
      previous study demonstrated that testosterone replacement in HIV-infected men with low&#xD;
      testosterone levels is associated with an increase in maximal muscle strength. However,&#xD;
      testosterone effects on other important measures of muscle performance, such as power and&#xD;
      fatigability that are important determinants of physical function, are not known. A second&#xD;
      objective is to determine if testosterone replacement improves lower extremity power and&#xD;
      fatigability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms by which testosterone increases muscle mass also remain unknown. Therefore, a&#xD;
      third objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which testosterone increases muscle mass&#xD;
      and to determine its effects on energy balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of&#xD;
      HIV-infected men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimate. We estimate that approximately 50 men will be needed in each treatment&#xD;
      group to test the proposed hypotheses (total 100 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location: Subjects will be seen at the King/Drew Medical Center CRC (1720 E. 120th Street,&#xD;
      Los Angeles, CA 90059) for all their visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Subject Assignment. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either testosterone enanthate (300 mg/weekly intramuscularly) or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol. The study will consist of a screening phase, a 2-week control period,&#xD;
      a 16-week treatment phase, and a 4-month recovery phase. We have selected a 16-week treatment&#xD;
      period because the effects of testosterone on fat-free mass and muscle strength become&#xD;
      manifest within this time period in healthy hypogonadal men, eugonadal men, and in&#xD;
      HIV-infected men with weight loss.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary outcome measure is change from baseline in three important measures of physical&#xD;
      function (stair climbing power, walking speed, and lifting task). These measures were&#xD;
      selected because they are important for activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure changes in maximal voluntary muscle strength, power, and muscle fatigability&#xD;
      using the leg press exercise. This exercise was selected because it utilizes large muscle&#xD;
      groups of the lower extremity that are important for functional activities, and is&#xD;
      androgen-responsive (39).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in fat-free mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Previous studies have&#xD;
      already established that testosterone replacement increases fat-free mass. This study is&#xD;
      focused on measures of muscle performance and physical function; therefore, we have not&#xD;
      included more detailed assessment of body composition by deuterium water and sodium bromide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle volume of the non-dominant thigh will be measured by magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intramuscular concentrations of myostatin, IGF-I, and IGFBP-4 mRNA will be measured by RT-PCR&#xD;
      and protein by western blot analysis. The ubiquitin, and C3 and C9 proteasome mRNA will be&#xD;
      measured by northern analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in perceptions of physical function, and body image. In addition to using global&#xD;
      health related quality of life instruments, which have many domains that are not&#xD;
      androgen-responsive, we will focus on assessment of perceptions of physical function,&#xD;
      fatigue, and body image. These instruments have been demonstrated to be responsive to&#xD;
      androgen replacement in older men with low testosterone levels (48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total and free testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone levels will be measured as markers of&#xD;
      testosterone bioavailability. Serum LH, FSH and SHBG levels will be measured as markers of&#xD;
      androgen action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Measures. Plasma lipids, apolipoproteins, and lipoprotein particles will be measured&#xD;
      to assess testosterone effects on these markers of cardiovascular risk profile. Hemoglobin,&#xD;
      liver enzymes (ALT, AST, bilirubin, GGT, alkaline phosphatase), serum PSA, digital rectal&#xD;
      examination and AUA BPH symptom score will be monitored as safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy Expenditure.. We will measure resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry,&#xD;
      using a novel, handheld device known as the MedGem (HealtheTech, Golden Colorado) Neiman et&#xD;
      al (Neiman DC, Trone GA, Austin MD. A new handheld device for measuring resting metabolic&#xD;
      rate and oxygen consumption. J Am Diet Assoc 2003; 103(5 588-593) have validated this device&#xD;
      in 63 males adult men and women with BMI between 19 and 56 kg/m2 against Douglas bags with&#xD;
      duplicate measurements on each of two nonconsecutive days within a 14 day period. Since there&#xD;
      were no differences between tests or between days for either the MedGem or the Douglas bags,&#xD;
      the four tests for each device were pooled. The mean difference for the pooled results&#xD;
      between MedGem and Douglas bags was 7 Kcal/day (0.4%). The thermic effect of food will be&#xD;
      measured by indirect calorimetry, using the same MedGem apparatus with measurements during&#xD;
      the last 15 minutes of each of five hours after ingestion of a standardized meal. We will&#xD;
      also measure resting energy expenditure by use of the Deltatrac II device. After subjects&#xD;
      have rested in bed for at least 5 minutes, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production&#xD;
      will be measured using a ventilated canopy system for 20 minutes (Deltatrac II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rates of ATP synthesis will be measured by 31P and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#xD;
      spectroscopy. The rates of substrate oxidation in the citric acid cycle will be estimated&#xD;
      from the specific activity of 4-13C glutamate during steady state infusion of 13C-1 acetate.&#xD;
      The ratio of ATP synthesis measured by NMR spectroscopy and fuel oxidation measured by steady&#xD;
      state 13-1 acetate infusion will be used as a measure of mitochondrial coupling of oxidation&#xD;
      and phosphorylation. In addition, we will also measure mitochondrial energy coupling in&#xD;
      isolated muscle fibers obtained from biopsies of vastus lateralis directly by measuring P:O&#xD;
      ration using an oxygen electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body core temperature will be measured by obtaining rectal temperature, using a precise and&#xD;
      accurate thermo-couple thermister.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free fatty acid flux and adipose tissue lipolysis will be measured using [1-13C] palmitate&#xD;
      and[2H5] glycerol isotope infusion, respectively. Fat oxidation will be measured by the&#xD;
      release and quantitation of 1-13C-CO2 released during exhalation after infusion of the&#xD;
      [1-13C] palmitate. [2H2] glucose isotope will be used to measure insulin sensitivity. One to&#xD;
      two weeks before the second palmitate infusion, a single injection of sodium [1-13C]&#xD;
      bicarbonate (1.76 µmol/kg; 90% enriched, sterile and pyrogen free; Mass Trace) will be used&#xD;
      to calculate the acetate correction factor (ACF). The ACF accounts for 13C-label lost in&#xD;
      exchange reactions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. After 135 min of tracer equilibration,&#xD;
      breath samples will be obtained in 15-min intervals up to 150 minutes and 5 minute intervals&#xD;
      from 150 to 180 minutes. Non-esterified free fatty acid levels will be measured at baseline,&#xD;
      mid-study (day 56) and at the end of treatment by a fasting blood measurement.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive men, 18-60 years of age, with objective evidence of HIV-infection with&#xD;
             low to low-normal testosterone levels (&lt;400 ng/dL). In boys before the age of 18, the&#xD;
             hormonal and body composition changes of puberty can confound the data. We will&#xD;
             exclude men over 60 because of age-related changes in testosterone levels and body&#xD;
             composition, and increased risk of prostate disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented weight loss within the previous 6 months of between 5-15% of body weight,&#xD;
             or an actual body mass index (BMI) at screening of between 17 and 20 (= 85-95% of the&#xD;
             lower limit of ideal weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An energy intake of at least 80% of the estimated requirements. On stable and potent&#xD;

             primary care provider, a change in antiretroviral therapy is unlikely in the next 4&#xD;
             months. Stable therapy may include those not on any antiretroviral therapies and whom,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the primary care provider, will not be starting antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy in the next 4 months CD4 cell count &gt;50 /mm3, and HIV-copy number less than&#xD;
             10,000 copies/ml Testosterone levels &lt;400ng/dL Able and willing to provide informed&#xD;

             (especially the medial compartment of the thigh) along with the new appearance of&#xD;
             prominent veins. Loss of tissue in the buccal fat pad and subgluteal region provides&#xD;
             further evidence that thin extremities may be in large part due to loss of fat and not&#xD;
             just muscles.&quot;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids, except for topical application&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiac, renal, hepatic or other diseases that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may put the subject at risk if entered onto the trial or prevent&#xD;

             currently using androgenic steroids, rhGH, IGF-I or other anabolic agents or appetite&#xD;
             stimulants will be excluded. Also, excluded are drugs that affect testosterone&#xD;
             secretion or metabolism such as ketoconazole, dilantin, and phenobarbital. Patients&#xD;
             who have been on a stable dose of erythropoietin for at least 3 months will be allowed&#xD;
             to continue the drug. The changes in antiretroviral therapy except for changes within&#xD;
             the same class of drugs are not allowed. The use of corticosteroids, except for&#xD;
             topical application, is not allowed. The food supplements that might affect body&#xD;
             composition such as creatine, high dose amino-acid supplements, whey protein&#xD;
             supplements, androstenedione, DHEA, and marinol, are also not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On the Exclusion of Women. Women are not being included in this study because&#xD;
             testosterone administration in these doses will inevitably cause virilization, and is&#xD;
             ethically unacceptable.&#xD;
