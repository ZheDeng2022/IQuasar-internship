  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rising in the population for many years. It is now&#xD;
      recognized that a period of glucose intolerance precedes the clinical symptoms appearance.&#xD;
      This is due to a combination of b-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. It is estimated&#xD;
      that this pre-clinical phase of type 2diabetes may antedate the onset of overt diabetes by&#xD;
      10-12 years. Furthermore, insulin resistance is considered to be a main component of the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Recently, there has been an effort to pinpoint the pre-diabetic phase for early therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention in the individual. These studies, in patients with impaired glucose intolerance,&#xD;
      have shown to be beneficial from both lifestyle change and pharmacological intervention. It&#xD;
      is thus hypnotized that intervention in patients with insulin resistance with or without&#xD;
      glucose intolerance may prevent the progress of type 2 diabetes and it's complications. There&#xD;
      is difficulty in identifying individuals who are at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The&#xD;
      prevention strategy relies on intervention in a pre-diseased state. In the case of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, the early intervention is useful in the phase where there is insulin resistance,&#xD;
      but prior to the appearance of glucose intolerance. The diagnosis of insulin resistance is a&#xD;
      challenging one. The gold standard in diagnosing insulin resistance is the&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, but this method is not suitable for routine clinical use.&#xD;
      Thus, less invasive methods for evaluation, like homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and&#xD;
      quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), were developed. There is a correlation&#xD;
      between HOMA and QUICKI results and the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Both HOMA and&#xD;
      QUICKI allow insulin resistance diagnosis. The results from those tests correlate with&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and allow diagnosing insulin resistance, however, those&#xD;
      indexes require serum glucose, insulin measurements and quite complicated calculations. A new&#xD;
      method was suggested, non-invasive, sensitive and simple, for the identification of insulin&#xD;
      resistance. In normal individuals, in the presence of insulin, glucose is taken up by a&#xD;
      variety of cells, undergoes glycolysis and enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle or fat&#xD;
      synthesis. In either case, CO2 in produced as a by-product. This CO2 enters the circulation&#xD;
      and is discarded by the lungs. The new method is based on the assumption that 13C-glucose is&#xD;
      ingested as described and its by-product 13CO2 can be measured in the expired air. In type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and other states of insulin resistance glucose, uptake is impaired and results in&#xD;
      blunted 13CO2 production. This hypothesis was tested by Lewanczuc et al. The writers compared&#xD;
      the [13C]-glucose breath test with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, HOMA and QUICKI&#xD;
      indexes. They tested 26 patients at different stages of insulin sensitivity and reported a&#xD;
      good correlation of the glucose breath test and the other indexes. We suggest testing a&#xD;
      larger group of patients at high-risk to develop type 2 diabetes and compare the glucose&#xD;
      breath test with HOMA index.&#xD;
