  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) measurements have been shown to correlate well&#xD;
      with growth hormone action and effect, and recent data show that serum IGF-I may be related&#xD;
      to safety and efficacy of growth hormone (GH) treatment in patients. Some studies indicate&#xD;
      that high IGF-I levels are associated with increased cancer risk, and low IGF-I levels are&#xD;
      associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Studies in children also show that&#xD;
      the serum IGF-I level is correlated with the change in height score achieved (that is, the&#xD;
      higher the IGF-I level, the greater the gain in height). Pediatric endocrinologists have&#xD;
      therefore begun to use serum IGF-I levels, in addition to growth rate and weight gain, to&#xD;
      adjust the GH dose in treated children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although monitoring of serum IGF-I levels is becoming standard of care in patients begin&#xD;
      treated with GH, there are few guidelines regarding the actual logistics of adjusting GH&#xD;
      dose. As serum IGF-I level has been linked to both safety and efficacy of GH treatment, the&#xD;
      ideal practice would be to maintain serum IGF-I levels within a certain target range. The&#xD;
      overall goal of our study is to construct a mathematical model which predicts the change in&#xD;
      GH dose necessary to achieve a desired change in IGF-I level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses to be tested by our study include the following: IGF-I measurement has a role in&#xD;
      optimization of GH therapy; GH dose change to achieve IGF-I changes are predictable; and&#xD;
      gender and puberty affect the relationship between dose change and target IGF-I changes.&#xD;

      The first phase of our study, previously approved by the UCLA IRB in August 2004, involved a&#xD;
      retrospective chart review and collection of preexisting data. We analyzed charts of patients&#xD;
      who underwent non-weight-based GH dose adjustments preceded and followed by a serum IGF-I&#xD;
      level. Data collected included patient's age, gender, height, weight, linear height velocity,&#xD;
      pubertal status, GH dose, IGF-I levels, disease condition (i.e., growth hormone deficiency,&#xD;
      idiopathic short stature, small-for-gestational age) and recording of any adverse effects.&#xD;
      Based on this data collected, we performed statistical analysis of the relationship between&#xD;
      GH dose change and change in IGF-I level achieved, and have found that in prepubertal&#xD;
      children, there is a significant relationship between the GH dose change and change in&#xD;
      corresponding IGF-I level. We have subsequently constructed a mathematical prediction model&#xD;
      that allows us to determine the GH dose change necessary to achieve a desired IGF-I level,&#xD;
      and in this second phase of our study, we plan to apply this mathematical prediction model&#xD;
      prospectively for guiding GH dose adjustments in prepubertal children being treated with GH&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children being treated with GH are typically followed in the outpatient Endocrinology clinic&#xD;
      every 3-4 months, and our practitioners have routinely been obtaining serum IGF-I levels (via&#xD;
      venipuncture in the outpatient laboratory) for monitoring purposes. Validation of our GH dose&#xD;
      change/IGF-I change prediction model will require assessment of sequential serum IGF-I level&#xD;
      measurements immediately preceding a GH dose change, and again within 1-4 months following&#xD;
      the GH dose change. We plan to continue our retrospective and ongoing analysis of patients&#xD;
      who have paired values of GH dose adjustments preceded and followed by a serum IGF-I level,&#xD;
      in order that we may continue to fine-tune our prediction model for optimizing GH dose&#xD;
      adjustments.&#xD;
