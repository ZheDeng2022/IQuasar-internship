      The objective of the Transition into Primary-care Psychiatry (TIPP) project is to determine&#xD;
      how feasible it is to conduct a study to evaluate a new primary-care focused program of&#xD;
      mental health care delivery for people with chronic mental illness. This will be done by&#xD;
      comparing a primary-care based collaborative, interdisciplinary model to care-as-usual on&#xD;
      health related quality of life, client symptomatology, client's perceived need of care,&#xD;
      participant satisfaction and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TIPP service will consist, at both the London and Thunder bay sites, of: (i) a mental&#xD;
      health care nurse (B.Sc.N.) with at least several years experience as an outpatient mental&#xD;
      health service clinician, and (ii) a psychiatrist with a license to practice medicine in the&#xD;
      Province of Ontario and sensitivity to the issues of family physicians providing mental&#xD;
      health services in the community&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TIPP intervention will involve a service delivery that is a modification of the&#xD;
      Consultation Liaison in Primary-care Psychiatry (CLIPP) program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four elements will act in synthesis and enable collaboration between the primary care and&#xD;
      TIPP teams:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Co-location of mental health services staff will involve the psychiatric nurse and&#xD;
      psychiatrist visiting the family physicians' office at 1 and 3-month intervals, respectively.&#xD;
      During these visits they will review and document the client's progress. This empowers the&#xD;
      family physician as clinical manager. Treatment plans will be developed for family physicians&#xD;
      that can be easily implemented. The family physician will monitor the client's status between&#xD;
      the psychiatric nurse and psychiatrist's visits. At times of greater need, and/or impending&#xD;
      crisis, increase in contact to every 14 days, with weekly or more from the family physician,&#xD;
      and contacts with all providers adjusted to accommodate client needs. By developing linkages&#xD;
      with area mental health services the psychiatric nurse will assist the family physician in&#xD;
      co-coordinating access, while minimizing redundant use, to these services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) The TIPP nurse will select, prepare, and facilitate appropriate clients from the&#xD;
      outpatient department for transfer to the family physician. The initial transfer process&#xD;
      includes a face-to-face meeting with the client, TIPP nurse and family physician in family&#xD;
      physician's office. Warning signs and symptoms of an impending relapse will allow for an&#xD;
      opportunity for intervention to prevent or lessen the severity of a relapse. For each client&#xD;
      a &quot;relapse signature&quot; strategy will be developed by the TIPP nurse to assist the family&#xD;
      physician in detecting clients at high risk of mental illness relapse. Having obtained the&#xD;
      client's permission significant caregivers will be routinely involved in the development and&#xD;
      implementation of a clinical management plan. Standardized CLIPP based contact sheets\data&#xD;
      sheets will promote efficient and effective communication between clinical care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Client monitoring will be maintained by administrative staff support procedures&#xD;
      targeted at ensuring a high level of retention and effective client follow up. The family&#xD;
      physician will complete a Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS) (severity and change&#xD;
      scores) every 3 months in the first year then at each visit for the remainder of the project.&#xD;
      The CGIS will not add time to the clinical time with the clients. An administrative member of&#xD;
      the project receiving these scales will alert the appropriate clinical providers for clients&#xD;
      whose condition is not improving as judged by the family physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Telephone back up for the family physicians' whose clients are involved in the project&#xD;
      will be provided by a project psychiatrist and/or psychiatric nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the TIPP intervention clients will be compared to those who receive post&#xD;
      outpatient service transfer care-as-usual from their family physician. The clients in this&#xD;
      group will obtain any and all services normally available inside or outside their primary&#xD;
      care service, including re-referral to specialty mental health care. No additional services&#xD;
      will be provided for the care-as-usual group, but no usual services will be limited or&#xD;
      withheld. Design features to ensure the interests of the control group are considered include&#xD;
      outcomes assessment for both groups at 6, and 12 months, as well as at the projects end&#xD;
      point. Should significant clinical concerns be noted by the rater during the assessment a&#xD;
      systematic process will allow for the family physician to be notified so as to minimize the&#xD;
      risk of compromised care.&#xD;
