  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrous oxide analgesia is used routinely for the dental treatment of anxious or&#xD;
      uncooperative pediatric patients. In many instances it is used alone without any supplemental&#xD;
      oral premedication. A controversy exists among pediatric dentists and pediatric dental&#xD;
      departments regarding the need to apply pre-procedural fasting (PF) or other limitations on&#xD;
      children undergoing dental treatment with nitrous oxide alone.The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the association between PF and the frequency of vomiting in pediatric patients&#xD;
      receiving dental treatment with nitrous oxide analgesia.&#xD;

      Materials and methods The experimental protocol will be submitted for approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Human Subjects Ethics committee of Hadassah-Hebrew University School of Dental&#xD;
      l Medicine. Informed consent will be obtained from all parents or legal guardians of&#xD;
      participating subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects All pediatric patients attending the graduate student pediatric dental clinic of the&#xD;
      Department of Pediatric Dentistry at Hadassah Clinic in need of at least two restorative&#xD;
      treatment sessions with the use of nitrous oxide will be included. All participants must be&#xD;
      in good health (ASA I). Prior to one session subjects will be restricted and have a&#xD;
      preprocedural fasting as per the following guidelines: All subjects will be without solids&#xD;
      (including milk) for at least 4 hours prior to nitrous oxide administration and without clear&#xD;
      liquids 2 hours before treatment. On the alternative session subjects will have no&#xD;
      restrictions on their food or liquid intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey will be given to parents prior to treatment and information regarding the following&#xD;
      will be gathered:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, previous nitrous oxide experience, history of vomiting or nausea (motion sickness, foods&#xD;
      etc), last mea: what and when? The resident administering treatment will record the&#xD;
      following: Duration of inhalation administration, percentage of nitrous oxide and flow rate,&#xD;
      steady or fluctuating, occurrence of vomiting during or immediately following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of data will determine the incidence of vomiting and if any significant&#xD;
      differences between the two sessions exist.&#xD;
