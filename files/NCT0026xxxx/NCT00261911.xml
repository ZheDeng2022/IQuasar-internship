        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obese adolescent males and females in good general health with a lower limit of&#xD;
             inclusion by BMI 2 units above the U.S. weighted mean for the 95th percentile for&#xD;
             weight based on age and gender to a BMI of 44 kg/m2, ages 12 to 16 years at&#xD;
             randomization. (Efforts should be directed to obtain a study population comprising 50%&#xD;
             to 75% females and at least 30% African- Americans across the study. Each site should&#xD;
             enroll similar numbers of patients at each age within the 12 to 16 year old age&#xD;
             range.)&#xD;
&#xD;

             with the investigator, be legally competent, and provide written informed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients must exhibit sufficient comprehension of written materials to be able to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient must have at the screening and baseline visits a mean systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure &lt;=130 mm Hg, a diastolic blood pressure &lt;=85 mm Hg, and a pulse rate &lt;=95&#xD;
             beats per minute. Treated hypertensives are allowed in the study if medication has&#xD;
             been stable for at least 3 months.&#xD;

             conditions include coronary artery disease, clinically significant cardiac&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient must not have a history of asthma requiring chronic oral corticosteroid&#xD;
             therapy. A short course (&lt;7 days) of oral corticosteroid medication is permitted for&#xD;
             an acute exacerbation.&#xD;

          -  The patient must not have evidence of possible renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt;1.7&#xD;
             mg/dL) or hepatic dysfunction (ALT &gt;50 IU/L, bilirubin &gt;1.0 mg/dL). Patients must not&#xD;
             have evidence of active or chronic Hepatitis B or C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must not be using any of the following medications at any time during the&#xD;
             study: monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, phenelzine, procarbazine&#xD;
             hydrochloride, selegiline), antidepressant agents (including the use of antidepressant&#xD;
             agents for more than 2 weeks during the 90 day period prior to screening), lithium,&#xD;
             serotonin reuptake inhibitors, certain opioids (dextromethorphan, meperidine,&#xD;

             centrally acting appetite suppressants, tryptophan, sympathomimetics, serotonergic&#xD;
             anti-migraine agents (including sumatriptan succinate, dihydroergotamine, etc.) or any&#xD;
             other medication that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may pose harm to the&#xD;
             patient, obscure the effects of study medication or interfere with the process of drug&#xD;
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion (i.e., enzyme inducers or enzyme&#xD;
             inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;

             the patients must have been a participant for at least 6 months prior to screening to&#xD;
             be allowed in the study.&#xD;
