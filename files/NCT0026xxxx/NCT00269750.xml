      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of OROS® oxybutynin to that&#xD;
      of Ditropan® (immediate-release oxybutynin) for the treatment of patients with urge or mixed&#xD;
      urinary incontinence. Oxybutynin is an antispasmodic, anticholinergic medication for the&#xD;
      treatment of the symptoms of overactive bladder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ditropan® is indicated for the treatment of urge urinary incontinence, however patients tend&#xD;
      to discontinue the medication or decrease the dose due to anticholinergic side effects. OROS®&#xD;
      oxybutynin, a continuous release formulation, is expected to have fewer anticholinergic side&#xD;
      effects than Ditropan® and may provide equal or better efficacy compared to Ditropan®. This&#xD;
      is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel group, dose-escalation study comparing&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of OROS® oxybutynin to Ditropan® for the treatment of urge or mixed&#xD;
      urinary incontinence at the minimum effective dose (MED), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),&#xD;
      or the maximum allowable dose (MAD) permitted under this protocol. Patients in both treatment&#xD;
      groups begin study drug treatment at an oxybutynin dose of 5 mg per day. The dose is changed&#xD;
      in 5 mg increments at 4- to 7-day intervals, depending on the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      current dose. The maximum allowable dose for Ditropan® is 20 mg per day, which is the maximum&#xD;
      daily adult dose specified in its labeling. Because controlled delivery of oxybutynin by an&#xD;
      OROS® dosage form could potentially reduce side effects, it is believed that the drug could&#xD;
      possibly be tolerated at doses higher than 20 mg per day. Consequently, the maximum allowable&#xD;
      dose for OROS® oxybutynin is 30 mg per day, administered as a single daily dose. The primary&#xD;
      measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline in the following assessments: the&#xD;
      number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per week, the total number of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence episodes, and total void frequency (normal and incontinent). Safety evaluations&#xD;
      include the incidence of adverse events, physical examination and medical history, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, urinalysis, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and the Anticholinergic&#xD;
      Effects Assessment (ACEA) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OROS® (oxybutynin chloride) 5 mg tablets, one to six tablets per day (5 mg/day to 30 mg/day)&#xD;
      as a single morning oral dose for 11 days up to 70 days, and Ditropan (oxybutynin chloride) 5&#xD;
      mg tablets, one to four tablets per day orally (5 mg per day to 5 mg four times per day) for&#xD;
      10 daysup to 61 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with urge or mixed urinary incontinence, provided that stress urinary&#xD;
             incontinence is not the predominant manifestation of mixed urinary incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently taking immediate release oxybutynin (Ditropan®) hyoscyamine&#xD;
             (Levsin®) or propantheline (Pro-banthine®), or who have taken Ditropan in the past for&#xD;
             urge or mixed UI. (Patients who have taken Ditropan for urge or mixed urinary&#xD;
             incontinence, but who have discontinued the medication should have discontinued due to&#xD;
             anticholinergic effects and not due to failure of efficacy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able to differentiate incontinent episodes associated with urgency&#xD;
             from incontinent episodes not associated with urgency when recording incontinent&#xD;
             episodes in the diary, who have at least six urge urinary incontinence episodes per&#xD;
             week recorded on the Run-in Diary after washout of anticholinergic medications, and&#xD;
             who demonstrate that the number of urge incontinent episodes per week is greater than&#xD;
             the number of incontinent episodes not associated with urgency per week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are in good general health prior to study participation, having normal&#xD;
             blood pressure with or without hypertension medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agreeing that a medically acceptable and effective birth control method will be used&#xD;
             by the patient and partner throughout the study and for one week following the end of&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known treatable genitourinary conditions that may cause incontinence&#xD;
             (e.g., urinary tract infection, prostatitis, urinary tract obstruction, bladder tumor,&#xD;
             bladder stone, prostate cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with glaucoma or untreated narrow anterior chamber angles, obstructive bowel&#xD;
             disease or severe narrowing of the gastrointestinal tract, obstructive uropathy, or&#xD;
             myasthenia gravis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known allergy or hypersensitivity to oxybutynin or clinically&#xD;
             significant medical problems or other organ abnormality or pathology for whom,&#xD;
             administration of oxybutynin would present undue risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients with a PSA &gt; 10 ng/mL or a PSA between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL who in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator require further evaluation or treatment for prostate&#xD;
             cancer, or male patients who have had prostate surgery less than nine months before&#xD;
             study enrollment. (Prostate pathology from surgery must be benign)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose estimated creatinine clearance is less than 50 mL/min or a have&#xD;
             hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL&#xD;
