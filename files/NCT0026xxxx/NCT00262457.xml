      The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of an implanted electrical&#xD;
      stimulation system incorporating BION microstimulators for long term use to prevent tissue&#xD;
      breakdown in high risk patients.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this project was to implement the use of a gluteal stimulation system&#xD;
      incorporating BION microstimulators for pressure ulcer prevention in patients at high risk of&#xD;
      tissue breakdown as a standard clinical practice.The specific goal of this study is to&#xD;
      establish the feasibility of a system incorporating BION microstimulators for long term use.&#xD;
      This will be achieved by a two phase study. The initial phase of the study will employ&#xD;
      biomechanical testing and in-vitro evaluations to address issues of safety and system design.&#xD;
      The specific tasks to be achieved in the initial phase are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical testing to characterize the device response to traumatic loading conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-vitro testing to determine the optimal configuration of the system, specifically the&#xD;
      effects of BION orientation and placement relative to the coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of cadaveric studies to determine guidelines for the BION implantation procedure&#xD;
      required to achieve optimal function of the gluteal stimulation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the study will be a pilot clinical trail of veterans with reduced&#xD;
      mobility in order to establish clinical utility. A two-arm crossover study of wheelchair&#xD;
      users will be carried out. A total of 10 subjects will be recruited to the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to Group A or Group B. All subjects will receive BION&#xD;
      microstimulators implanted bilaterally adjacent to the motor point of the gluteus maximus.&#xD;
      Two stimulation regimes will be employed; conditioning stimulation will be applied at night&#xD;
      to increase muscle strength and fatigue resistance of the stimulated muscles while dynamic&#xD;
      stimulation will be employed during the day in order to facilitate regular weight shifting,&#xD;
      thus varying seated posture and pressure distributions at the seating interface. Subjects in&#xD;
      Group A will start using dynamic and conditioning stimulation concurrently for 6 months&#xD;
      following implantation. They will then cease using all stimulation for a further 6 months of&#xD;
      participation in the study. Group B will not activate their stimulation systems for 6 months&#xD;
      following implantation. They will then commence using dynamic and conditioning stimulation&#xD;
      for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed for a 12 month period following implantation. Tissue health&#xD;
      assessments will be carried out at three month intervals throughout their participation in&#xD;
      the study. Progressive changes in gluteal tissue health will assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Transcutaneous oxygen measurement to measure tissue blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interface pressure measurement to determine pressure distribution changes over the&#xD;
           long-term (due to muscle changes) and over the short-term (due to muscle contractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Computerized tomography (CT) to measure muscle thickness. The results of this study will&#xD;
           provide the pilot data for the development of a full-scale clinical trial of the gluteal&#xD;
           BION system.&#xD;
