    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to conduct population based surveillance for prenatally&#xD;
      diagnosed congenital defects amount residents of the five counties to: improve the&#xD;
      comprehensiveness of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) to (1)&#xD;
      better fulfill its objectives (2) allow assessment of the impact of prenatal diagnosis and&#xD;
      elective termination on the birth prevalence of congenital defects in Atlanta (3) develop a&#xD;
      registry of prenatally diagnosed defects to be used in epidemiologic and genetic studies, in&#xD;
      evaluation prevention programs and in monitoring prenatal diagnostic technology.&#xD;

      Since 1967, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has conducted surveillance&#xD;
      of birth defects in metropolitan Atlanta through review of hospital delivery and newborn&#xD;
      medical records and records from various other medical sources in the five central counties&#xD;
      of the metropolitan area (Clayton, Cobb, DeKalk, Fulton and Gwinnett, and has been expanded&#xD;
      to include prenatal records. The project was begun n the aftermath of thalidomide and rubella&#xD;
      epidemics as a kind of early-warning system for new or resurgent teratogens. The voluntary&#xD;
      participation of Atlanta hospitals was sought and obtained at the inception of the system&#xD;
      (the original system was a joint effort of the CDC, the Georgia Institute of Mental Health&#xD;
      and Emory University).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case must be diagnosed by the child's sixth birthday or within six years of the date of&#xD;
      elective termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's Healthcare is one retrospective source of medical records reviewed for discharge&#xD;
      summaries and disease indices.&#xD;
