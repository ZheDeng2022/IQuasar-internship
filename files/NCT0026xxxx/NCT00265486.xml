      During facial cooling and especially during breath hold, can mammals - and also humans -&#xD;
      elicit a so called dive reflex, causing bradycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction and&#xD;
      centralization of blood flow to brain, lungs and heart but the reflex is suppressed by&#xD;
      physical activity. The dive reflex can be elicited by breath hold alone and will be more&#xD;
      pronounced during simultaneously facial cooling, but not by stimulation of other skin&#xD;
      receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dive reflex has an oxygen conserving effect, because of intense vasoconstriction in both&#xD;
      viscera and muscles, and simultaneously with reduction in cardiac output (CO). Therefore&#xD;
      plasma lactate will rise, to compensate for the lesser regional blood flow. If one&#xD;
      hyperventilates with 100 % oxygen, then the reflex can still be elicited, but it is more&#xD;
      pronounced during asphyxia. Experienced sports divers, who has been diving for more than 7-10&#xD;
      years have reduced post apnea acidosis and oxidational stress, but probably also less&#xD;
      sensitivity for progressive hypoxia and hypercapnia, because these individuals have a more&#xD;
      pronounced dive reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) gives a reproducibly value for brain perfusion by&#xD;
      continuously non-invasive real-time sampling. A single piezo-electrical transducer sends and&#xD;
      collects ultrasound through the temporal region of the scull, where it is the thinnest.&#xD;
      Hereby can the blood flow of arteria cerebri anterior, media (MCA) and posterior and&#xD;
      basilaris be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With TCD it can be shown that the cerebral blood flow rises in MCA in healthy subjects during&#xD;
      facial cooling, with normal ventilation, when resting in a supine position without affecting&#xD;
      the systemic blood pressure. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT)-scanning&#xD;
      during normo-baric and hyperbaric pressure of professional divers breathing 100 % oxygen has&#xD;
      shown to reduce the cerebral blood flow in several regions of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But it is yet unknown how brain blood flow and metabolism are affected by an &quot;face immersion&#xD;
      dive&quot; and simultaneously prolonged physical activity, and hence a rise in lactate under&#xD;
      hyperbaric pressure (3 meters), breathing atmospheric air, similar to the circumstances for&#xD;
      trained scuba divers work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presumably it will cause a fall in brain blood flow and in time cognitive deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythropoietin (rhEPO) is a well known drug, used as doping in sports for about 15 years. So&#xD;
      far the only known enhancement in athletic achievement by rhEPO is caused by peripheral&#xD;
      improvements and especially blood capability to transport oxygen to the working muscles; this&#xD;
      has been documented by a rise in haematocrit. rhEPO has also a neuroprotective effect on&#xD;
      neurons in patients with neuron damage caused by cerebral hypoxic ischeamia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rhEPO work also on a series of cerebral mechanisms, including enhanced motor and spatial&#xD;
      learning and more. Enhanced motor learning may improve the professional divers choices during&#xD;
      work and may be also physical performance and mechanical efficiency. Intravenous injection of&#xD;
      rhEPO will increase rhEPO in cerebrospinal fluids, since rhEPO is capable of crossing blood&#xD;
      brain. All together this may indicate that rhEPO, not only works on physical performance, but&#xD;
      also has effects on the brain. rhEPO has also an effect on the condition of cancer and&#xD;
      dialysis patients, not only explained by merely increased hematocrit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will add new knowledge in the understanding of the mechanisms of clinical use of&#xD;
      rhEPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate, how brain blood flow and metabolism are affected&#xD;
      by face immersion dive and simultaneously breath hold during normo-baric and hyperbaric&#xD;
      pressure (3 m depth) when breathing atmospheric air in trained sports divers. IL-6, HSP-72,&#xD;
      lactate, ammonium and body-temperature will be measured. Brain and muscle oxygenation will be&#xD;
      measured by near-infrared spectroscopi (NIRS). Furthermore we will investigate whether a&#xD;
      small dose of rhEPO affects mentioned parameters during simulated dive in pressure chamber&#xD;
      with facial cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Brain blood flow in trained divers will be diminished during prolonged physical&#xD;
      activity during simultaneously face immersion dive and breath hold under hyperbaric pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a release of IL-6 and HSP-72. Pretreatment with a small amount of rhEPO before&#xD;
      prolonged physical activity during simulated dive has a protective effect on brain blood flow&#xD;
      and oxygenation.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      During facial cooling and especially during breath hold, can mammals - and also humans -&#xD;
      elicit a so called dive reflex, causing bradycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction and&#xD;
      centralization of blood flow to brain, lungs and heart (18 Foster et al 2005), but the reflex&#xD;
      is suppressed by physical activity. The dive reflex can be elicited by breath hold alone and&#xD;
      will be more pronounced during simultaneously facial cooling, but not by stimulation of other&#xD;
      skin receptors (19 Asmussen et al 1968).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrapleural pressure and lung volume affects the dive reflex in a way so that the less part&#xD;
      of vital capacity being used, the more pronounced bradycardia. This is explained by the fact&#xD;
      that the pulmonary stretch receptors are activated less by smaller lung volumes and thereby&#xD;
      sending a smaller vagal afferent output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dive reflex has an oxygen conserving effect, because of intense vasoconstriction in both&#xD;
      viscera and muscles, and simultaneously with reduction in cardiac output (CO). Therefore&#xD;
      plasma lactate will rise, to compensate for the lesser regional blood flow. If one&#xD;
      hyperventilates with 100 % oxygen, then the reflex can still be elicited, but it is more&#xD;
      pronounced during asphyxia. Experienced sports divers, who has been diving for more than 7-10&#xD;
      years have reduced post apnea acidosis and oxidational stress (18 Foster et al 2005), but&#xD;
      probably also less sensitivity for progressive hypoxia and hypercapnia, because these&#xD;
      individuals have a more pronounced dive reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons with sleep apnea are, like trained breath hold divers, exposed for repetitive&#xD;
      episodes of hypoxia and hypercapnia during their sleep, of up to 30 to 60 seconds, and they&#xD;
      have developed a lesser sensitivity for this. These patients does typically have chronically&#xD;
      higher activity of the sympathetic nervous system, higher peripheral resistance and blood&#xD;
      pressure (18 Foster et al 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCUBA Sports divers, who dive more than 100 times a year, especially in cold water have&#xD;
      diminished cerebral blood flow and a cognitive deficit (20 Slosman et al 2003). Age and body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) are associated to diminished cerebral blood flow and the cognitive deficit,&#xD;
      possibly because, SCUBA divers with higher BMI, have larger pools of nitrogen in their&#xD;
      adipose tissues, which then gives smaller non-symptomatic incidences of decompression&#xD;
      sickness (20 Slosman et al 2003). But is obvious to assume, that it could be caused by&#xD;
      diminished cerebral blood flow, because of the dive reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also climbing to high altitudes (between 54488 and 8848 m) is shown to give cognitive&#xD;
      deficit. Those who had the most pronounced symptoms, where very sensitive to hypoxia by&#xD;
      hyperventilation. It was suspected, that hypocapnia because of hyperventilation was causing&#xD;
      diminished cerebral blood flow (33 Hornbein TF et al 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) gives a reproducibly value for brain perfusion by&#xD;
      continuous non-invasive real-time sampling (14 Aslid et al 1982). A single piezo-electrical&#xD;
      transducer sends and collects ultrasound through the temporal region of the scull, where it&#xD;
      is the thinnest. Hereby can the blood flow of arteria cerebri anterior, media (MCA) and&#xD;
      posterior and basilaris be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With TCD it can be shown which parts of the brain, that are activated during static and&#xD;
      dynamic work (15 Colebatch et al 1991, 16 Dahl et al 1992). Also vasodilatation when CO2 is&#xD;
      high is seen as a rise in arterial blood flow, and small emboli sends a characteristic signal&#xD;
      during carotid surgery (17 Halsey et al 1986).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent functional Magnetic Resonance imaging, BOLD fMRI is it&#xD;
      shown that breath hold induced hypercapnia gives a higher cerebral blood flow in sensorimotor&#xD;
      cortex, frontal cortex, in ganglia basale, in visual cortex and in cerebellum (21 Kastrup et&#xD;
      al 1999). The largest changes are seen in cerebellum and the smallest in frontal cortex (21&#xD;
      Kastrup et al 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With TCD it can be shown that the cerebral blood flow rises in MCA in healthy subjects during&#xD;
      facial cooling, with normal ventilation, when resting in a supine position without affecting&#xD;
      the systemic blood pressure (22 Browna et al 2003). Single Photon Emission Computerized&#xD;
      Tomography (SPECT)-scanning during normo-baric and hyperbaric pressure of professional divers&#xD;
      breathing 100% oxygen has shown to reduce the cerebral blood flow in several regions of the&#xD;
      brain (23 Di Pieroa et al 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain metabolism depends on a continuously supply of glucose, which is suppressed during&#xD;
      the hypoglycemia induced by prolonged work (1 Nybo et al 2003). The brain is though capable&#xD;
      of using other substrates to a certain extent , like lactate which is absorbed in an amount&#xD;
      proportionally with the arterial concentration (2 Dalsgaard et al 2003). So it seems that the&#xD;
      brain during prolonged work is capable of having an absorption of lactate to the same amount&#xD;
      as glucose. Also it seems that lactate is being metabolized, since it is not accumulated in&#xD;
      spinal fluid or brain tissue (3 Madsen et al 1999). At rest the brain absorption of glucose&#xD;
      is balanced by a proportional oxygen absorption (approximately 1:6). When the brain is&#xD;
      activated, this equilibrium is disturbed regionally (4 Fox Raichle et al 1986) and globally&#xD;
      (5 Madsen 1995). At rest, where the concentration of lactate in serum is low, is the&#xD;
      importance of lactate for brain metabolism minimal, but during physical activity, where&#xD;
      plasma lactate rises, is the absorption increasing and it contributes to the lowering in&#xD;
      brain metabolic ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying cause for the fall in brain metabolic ratio during physical activity is not&#xD;
      known. But the excessive amount of carbohydrate (in proportion to oxygen ) can reach a level,&#xD;
      comparable to the total amount of brain glycogen (6 Dalsgaard et al 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the activated brain seems to free IL-6 and HSP-72 (7 Nybo et al 2002). On the other hand&#xD;
      only a small amount of ammonium is absorbed by the brain (8 Nybo et al 2005), which partly -&#xD;
      besides a rise in temperature (9 Nybo et al 2002) - explains, why brain autoregulation is&#xD;
      less stable during especially intense physical activity (10 Ogoh et al 2005), as known from&#xD;
      patients in coma caused by hepatic failure (11 Larsen et al 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible explanation for the fall in brain metabolic ratio during physical activity is that&#xD;
      this mechanism can be overruled in rat brain after administration of the non-specific&#xD;
      beta-blocking drug propanolol (12 Schmalbruch et al 2002), while the cardioselective drug&#xD;
      metoprolol does not have the same effect in humans (13 Dalsgaard et al 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      But it is yet unknown how brain blood flow and metabolism are affected by an &quot;face immersion&#xD;
      dive&quot; and simultaneously prolonged physical activity, and hence a rise in lactate under&#xD;
      hyperbaric pressure (3 m dybde), breathing atmospheric air, similar to the circumstances for&#xD;
      trained scuba divers work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presumably it will cause a fall in brain blood flow and in time cognitive deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythropoietin (rhEPO) is a well known drug, used as doping in sports for about 15 years (24&#xD;
      Parisotto R et al, 2001). So far the only known enhancement in athletic achievement by rhEPO&#xD;
      is caused by peripheral improvements and especially blood capability to transport oxygen to&#xD;
      the working muscles (25 A Gaudard et al, 2003); this has been documented by a rise in&#xD;
      haematocrit (25 A Gaudard et al, 2003). rhEPO has also a neuroprotective effect on neurones&#xD;
      in patients with neuron damage caused by cerebral hypoxic ischeamia (26, HH Marti 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      rhEPO work also on a series of cerebral mechanisms, including enhanced motor and spatial&#xD;
      learning, increased dopamine production and improved neural function through activation of&#xD;
      calcium-channels (26, HH Marti 2004). Enhanced motor learning may improve the professional&#xD;
      divers choices during work and may be also physical performance and mechanical efficiency.&#xD;
      Less dopamine-concentration in the brain can cause enhanced fatigue, and increased dopamine&#xD;
      production caused by treatment with rhEPO may delay fatigue during physical activity.&#xD;
      Intravenous injection of rhEPO will increase rhEPO in cerebrospinal fluids, since rhEPO is&#xD;
      capable of crossing blood brain (26, HH Marti 2004). All together this may indicate that&#xD;
      rhEPO, not only works on physical performance, but also has effects on the brain. An enhanced&#xD;
      concentration of rhEPO could improve brain function by stimulating neural function and&#xD;
      thereby induce increased release of dopamine, reduce mismatch between oxygen and glucose&#xD;
      absorption, improve voluntarily activation and increase effect through improved motor&#xD;
      learning. rhEPO has also an effect on the condition of cancer and dialysis patients, not only&#xD;
      explained by merely increased heamocrit (27, W Jelkmann, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will add new knowledge in the understanding of the mechanisms of clinical use of&#xD;
      rhEPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythropoietin (EPO) is a heamatopoietic growth factor primarily synthesized in the kidneys.&#xD;
      It stimulates erythropoiesis. New investigations has shown that EPO can be neuroprotective in&#xD;
      cerebral ischaemia, brain trauma, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and kainattoksicitet (26, HH&#xD;
      Marti 2004)). The pathophysiology is yet unknown, but may secondarily to gene induction,&#xD;
      through suppression of the inflammatory response, such as inducible nitrogen oxide synthesis&#xD;
      (iNOS) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), to suppress apoptosis. Also it may be&#xD;
      plausible, that EPO upregulates antioxidants. In rats rhEPO has increased survival after&#xD;
      circulatory shock, induced by total ischemia / reperfusion of the splanchnicus (28 F&#xD;
      Squadrito et al, 1999). Treatment with rhEPO suppressed activity of endotoxin mediated&#xD;
      increase in NO. rhEPO suppresses the production of iNOS in smooth muscle cells after&#xD;
      stimulation of the proinflammatory IL-1. These effects of rhEPO are expressed from hours to&#xD;
      days after treatment with rather high solitary doses and seems to be independently mediated&#xD;
      by the erythropoietic effect, which can only be achieved after weeks continuous treatment&#xD;
      with rhEPO (29 E Kusano et al, 1999, 30 Brines ML et al, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of this study The purpose of this study is to investigate, how brain blood flow and&#xD;
      metabolism are affected by face immersion dive and simultaneously breath hold during&#xD;
      normo-baric and hyperbaric pressure (3 m depth) when breathing atmospheric air in trained&#xD;
      sports divers. IL-6, HSP-72, lactate, ammonium and body-temperature will be measured. Brain&#xD;
      and muscle oxygenation will be measured by near-infrared spectroscopi (NIRS). Furthermore we&#xD;
      will investigate whether a small dose of rhEPO affects mentioned parameters during simulated&#xD;
      dive in pressure chamber with facial cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Brain blood flow in trained divers will be diminished during prolonged physical&#xD;
      activity during simultaneously face immersion dive and breath hold under hyperbaric pressure&#xD;
      when breathing atmospheric air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a release of IL-6 and HSP-72. Pretreatment with a small amount of rhEPO before&#xD;
      prolonged physical activity during simulated dive has a protective effect on brain blood flow&#xD;
      and oxygenation.&#xD;
