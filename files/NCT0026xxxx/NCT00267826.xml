&#xD;
           STUDY MEDICATION, DESCRIPTION, AND ALLOCATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigational Drug&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rituximab is supplied by Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG. Rituximab is registered for the&#xD;
           treatment of B cell lymphoma in Switzerland. Investigational site personnel should refer&#xD;
           to the Directions for Handling and Administration (DHA) for specific instructions on the&#xD;
           handling and administration of Rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Enrollment Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients are officially enrolled into the study and assigned a subject identification&#xD;
           number after all screening evaluations have been completed and all study inclusion&#xD;
           criteria have been met.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drug Accountability&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rituximab accountability must be maintained by the investigator. The investigator must&#xD;
           maintain accurate records demonstrating the dates and amount of Rituximab received, to&#xD;
           whom dispensed (patient-by-patient accounting), and accounts of any Rituximab&#xD;
           accidentally or deliberately destroyed. Unless otherwise notified, all vials, both used&#xD;
           and unused will be saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
           THERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once therapy (that is, dose number 1) has begun, in order for a patient to receive a&#xD;
           subsequent dose of Rituximab, the following must occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  administration of each dose of Rituximab must be separated by an interval of at&#xD;
                least 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  no clinical evidence of significant viral, bacterial, or fungal infection at the&#xD;
                time of the study visit&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the treatment course, all patients will receive Rituximab administered as a 1000&#xD;
           mg intravenous infusion, followed by a 24-week follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dosing will be according to the schedule provided unless there is evidence of clinically&#xD;
           significant infection (as determined by the investigator) or leukopenia, neutropenia or&#xD;
           thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compliance with Rituximab dosing will be monitored and recorded by investigational site&#xD;
           personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           For patients on any prescription medication, every attempt should be made to keep the&#xD;
           patient on a stable dose of that medication for at least 14 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
           of Rituximab in any treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any medication and any non-drug procedure or therapy (including topical emollients) used&#xD;
           from study entry until the patient's final study visit must be recorded in the patient's&#xD;
           CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Allowed Concomitant Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will two intravenous infusions of Rituximab either as monotherapy or in&#xD;
           combination the following classes of treatments as described below. Treatments should be&#xD;
           kept stable through the period from 14 days before baseline until Visit 13.&#xD;

           The terms &quot;relationship&quot; and &quot;severity&quot; (used throughout this section) are defined in&#xD;
           the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the time of written informed consent, the patient must be given the name and phone&#xD;
           number of investigational site personnel who can be called in the event of an emergency&#xD;
           or to report any medical symptom or untoward medical occurrence that is of concern to&#xD;
           the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           For the purposes of this study, any sign (including an abnormal laboratory result, as&#xD;
           determined by the investigator) or medical diagnosis noted by medical personnel, or&#xD;
           symptom reported by the patient that occurs prior to the start of investigational drug&#xD;
           treatment is considered to be a predosing sign/symptom. Any predosing sign/symptom&#xD;
           classified as serious will be reported to the IRB/REB/IEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the purposes of this study, any sign (including an abnormal laboratory result, as&#xD;
           determined by the investigator) or medical diagnosis noted by medical personnel, or&#xD;
           symptom reported by the patient, regardless of relationship to investigational drug,&#xD;
           that is treatment-emergent is considered to be an adverse event. 'Treatment-emergent' is&#xD;
           defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Has onset any time after the start of investigational drug treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Has worsened since the event was previously reported (this includes worsening of signs,&#xD;
           symptoms, or diagnoses that were present prior to the first dose of investigational drug&#xD;
           but then worsened any time after the start of investigational drug treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Classification of Event as Serious&#xD;
&#xD;
           As soon as a patient has given written informed consent to participate in the study, any&#xD;
           abnormal sign (including an abnormal laboratory result, as determined by the&#xD;
           investigator) or medical diagnosis noted by medical personnel, or symptom reported by&#xD;
           the patient regardless of whether or not the patient has received investigational drug&#xD;
           is to be classified by the investigator as either a serious or non-serious event using&#xD;
           the following definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious Event&#xD;
&#xD;
           Events are classified as serious if they meet any of the following criteria (in&#xD;

           investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (does not include&#xD;
           an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Any event that requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Any event that results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any congenital anomaly/birth defect diagnosed in a child of a patient who&#xD;
                participated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other medically important events that in the opinion of the investigator may&#xD;
                jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other&#xD;
                outcomes listed in the definition above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Immediate Telephone Reporting of Serious Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG must immediately be made aware of events classified as SERIOUS&#xD;
           in order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting serious events.&#xD;
           Therefore, it is the investigator's responsibility to ensure the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any serious event that occurs any time after the patient signs the informed consent form&#xD;
           for this study, regardless of whether or not the patient has undergone any study-related&#xD;
           procedures or received investigational drug, up to the patient's final study visit&#xD;
           (i.e., Visit 11), inclusive, must be reported to Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG within 24&#xD;
           hours following report of the event, regardless of severity or relationship to&#xD;
           investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When telephoning a serious event report to Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG, the investigator&#xD;
           must provide specific information regarding the patient and the event. Roche Pharma&#xD;
           (Schweiz) AG must also receive written confirmation of the above information. For deaths&#xD;
           that occur following a patient's enrollment into the study a Record of Death CRF as well&#xD;
           as a copy of the autopsy report (when/if available) must be submitted to Roche Pharma&#xD;
           (Schweiz) AG. The investigator must keep a copy of all documentation related to the&#xD;
           event in the site's study files.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator must also notify the local review committee, i.e., the Institutional&#xD;
           Review Board (IRB), Research Ethics Board (REB), as per local IRB/REB/IEC requirements.&#xD;
           Documentation of these reports will be kept in the site's study files.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any serious event that has onset after the patient's first dose of investigational drug&#xD;
           and that is unresolved at the time the patient permanently discontinues the study must&#xD;
           be followed until the event resolves or until the patient's clinical course has&#xD;
           stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reporting of Serious Events to Regulatory Agencies After receipt of a serious event&#xD;
           report Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG will notify all appropriate regulatory authorities, as&#xD;
           necessary, within the required time frames. Written safety reports submitted to&#xD;
           regulatory authorities will be completed by Roche Pharma (Schweiz) AG with the&#xD;
           assistance of the investigator and other investigational site personnel, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary endpoint is the change of EASI at Visit 7 and 24 compared to baseline via paired&#xD;
           t-Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additional Endpoints Additional endpoints are the percentage of patients reaching a PGA&#xD;
           of &quot;clear&quot; or &quot;almost clear&quot; and/or a reduction of EASI of &gt;= 50 or &gt;= 75% compared to&#xD;
           baseline at any visit after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other additional endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           the percentage of patients reaching a pruritus score of &quot;none&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; Several&#xD;
           immunological endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           Criteria for the Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with missing PGA scores at the visit being analyzed will be considered&#xD;
           treatment failures for that visit. Patients who received disallowed therapies as listed&#xD;
           prior to the visit of the course being analyzed will be considered treatment failures&#xD;
           for the course in the efficacy analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis Populations 1.1.1.1 Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety population is defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of study&#xD;
           drug and have at least 1 post-baseline assessment of the safety parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.1.2 Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
           The efficacy population will be based on the intent-to-treat principle and is defined as&#xD;
           all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographics and statistical aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
           All appropriate background data will be summarized by presenting frequency distributions&#xD;
           and/or basic summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and&#xD;
           maximum).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study question and hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the pilot character of this study no formal hypotheses are issued. We expect&#xD;
           clear improvement with Rituximab. The effect of Rituximab is of special interest,&#xD;
           because this may become a new therapeutic approach with reasonable costs and handling.&#xD;
           Our investigation should be a pilot trial for a following study enrolling a larger&#xD;
           population to elucidate the clinical use for treatment of patients with atopic&#xD;
           dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Changes in the investigated variables before and after treatment will be compared using&#xD;
           the Wilcoxon's signed ranks test. Subgroups will be compared using the Mann Whitney&#xD;
           U-test. Otherwise, the data will be analysed and presented in a desriptive manner (see&#xD;
           above).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
           All clinical adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be evaluated for safety.&#xD;
           The number of patients with at least 1 dose withheld will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.1.3 White blood cell counts, platelets&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset (CD4+ and CD8+) counts over time will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.1.4 Laboratory Abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
           Selected blood chemistry evaluations will be assessed to determine incidence of&#xD;
           laboratory abnormalities that emerge within the course. Shift tables will be used to&#xD;
           present changes in each laboratory parameter relative to the parameter's normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.1.5 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs&#xD;
&#xD;
           The incidences of abnormalities in physical examination and in vital signs,&#xD;
           respectively, will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Efficacy Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proportion of patients who achieve a PGA of &quot;almost clear&quot; or &quot;clear&quot; or a decrease&#xD;
           in EASI value &gt;=50% and &gt;=75 % without the use of disallowed therapy as defined in the&#xD;
           protocol at each scheduled visit will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The EASI at Visit 3-11 will be compared to EASI at baseline/Day1 using a paired t-test.&#xD;
           The threshold for significant changes will be p&lt;0,05.&#xD;
&#xD;
           APPENDIX 1: ECZEMA AREA AND SEVERITY INDEX (EASI) The EASI assigns proportionate body&#xD;
           surface areas to the head and neck [10%], trunk [30%], upper extremities [20%] and lower&#xD;
           extremities [40%] for children aged 7 and above. This is roughly consistent with the&#xD;
           rule of nine. The numbers are modified when used with children under the age of 7: head&#xD;
           and neck [20%], trunk [30%], upper extremities [20%] and lower extremities [30%]. The&#xD;
           area of involvement (affected by inflammation, not including dry skin) of each of the&#xD;
           four body regions is represented by a numeric coded value [0 - 6] as below (the&#xD;
           investigator is required to record the percent area on the CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Table 1. EASI: Area of involvement Area Involvement 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 no eruption &lt; 10% 10%&#xD;
           - 29% 30% - 49% 50% - 69% 70% - 89% 90% - 100%&#xD;
&#xD;
           The head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs are assessed separately for erythema (E),&#xD;
           infiltration/papulation (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L). The average&#xD;
           degree of severity of each sign in each of the four body parts, is assigned a score of&#xD;
           0-3 indicating none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) and severe (3) expression of the&#xD;
           clinical sign. Half steps are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Further practical details to aid the assessment are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The lower extremities region includes the buttocks. The trunk region includes the&#xD;
           internal/medial axillae and groin. The head/neck region comprises the face and the&#xD;
           anterior and posterior neck. The upper extremities region includes the hands and&#xD;
           external axillae.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The definitions of the scoring signs of EASI are given below:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Table 2. Scoring signs of EASI Erythema (E) 0 None&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Mild Faintly detectable erythema: very light pink 2 Moderate Dull red, clearly&#xD;
      distinguishable 3 Severe Deep / dark red Infiltration / Papulation (I) 0 None&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild Barely perceptible elevation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate Clearly perceptible elevation but not extensive&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe Marked and extensive elevation Excoriations (Ex)&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 None&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Mild Scant evidence of excoriations with no signs of deeper skin damage (erosion, crust) 2&#xD;
      Moderate Several linear marks of skin with some showing evidence of deeper skin injury&#xD;
      (erosion, crust) 3 Severe Many erosive or crusty lesions Lichenification (L) 0 None&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild Slight thickening of the skin discernible only by touch and with skin markings&#xD;
           minimally exaggerated&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate Definite thickening of the skin with skin markings exaggerated so that they&#xD;
           form a visible criss-cross pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe Thickened indurated skin with skin markings visibly portraying an exaggerated&#xD;
           criss-cross pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EASI will then be calculated according to the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 3 . EASI: Calculation of score for ages 7 years and above Head/Neck (E + I + Ex + L) x&#xD;
      Area(1) x 0.1 Trunk (E + I + Ex + L) x Area(1) x 0.3 Upper limbs (E + I + Ex + L) x Area(1) x&#xD;
      0.2 Lower limbs (E + I + Ex + L) x Area(1) x 0.4 EASI = sum of the above four body areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Where Area is defined on a Seven Point Ordinal Scale, as shown in the table 3-3.&#xD;
