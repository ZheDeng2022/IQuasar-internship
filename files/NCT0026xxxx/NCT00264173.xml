      Primary Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of valproate to lithium in Bipolar I patients suffering from a&#xD;
           manic or a mixed episode according to DSM IV TR (APA 2000) [Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
           Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) fourth edition (IV)Text Revision (TR)] and over a&#xD;
           periode of 3 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the clinical and biological safety of valproate compared to lithium.&#xD;

        The following information on clinical trials is provided for information purposes only to&#xD;
        allow patients and physicians to have an initial discussion about the trial. This&#xD;
        information is not intended to be complete information about the trial, to contain all&#xD;
        considerations that may be relevant to potential participation in the trial, or to replace&#xD;

             records, or by a relative's report of information corroborating evidence of manic&#xD;
             symptomatology for patients already known as bipolar patients. Newly diagnosed&#xD;
             patients for bipolar disorder are allowed provided that the diagnosis is based on DSM&#xD;
             IV TR[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) fourth edition&#xD;

             TR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a minimum total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)of 18 at&#xD;
             Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria on D0 (Day 0):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having completed the wash-out period of at least 1 day duration (except for&#xD;
             patients receiving no psychiatric treatment or a benzodiazepine at a dose lower than&#xD;
             the equivalence of 8 mg of lorazepam and except for patients who only received&#xD;
