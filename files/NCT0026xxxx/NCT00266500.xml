      This study will investigate how different parts of the body lose body heat and will measure&#xD;
      the heat released by specific areas such as the limbs and abdomen. Animal studies suggest&#xD;
      that dissipation of body heat may affect energy expenditure, and therefore, body weight. This&#xD;
      study will explore the relationship between obesity and heat in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people 18 years of age and older who are of normal weight or who are obese and who&#xD;
      are not taking medications for obesity-related medical conditions may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 25 kg/m2 for normal weight&#xD;
      subjects or a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 for obese subjects. All candidates must weigh less&#xD;
      than 300 pounds. Women must have a normal menstrual cycle or be postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures in a single day on an outpatient basis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests and electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA and MRI scans of the trunk and limbs to measure the amounts of muscle, bone and fat&#xD;
           in the body. For the DEXA scan, the subject lies on a table while a very small dose of&#xD;
           x-rays is passed through the body. For the MRI, the subject lies on a table that is&#xD;
           moved into a steel cylinder. A magnetic field and radio waves produce images that are&#xD;
           used to measure fat in the trunk of the body, thighs, and arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infrared photography of hands, front of thigh, and abdomen. A special camera is used to&#xD;
           measure the heat leaving the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bicycle exercise test. The subject exercises on a stationary bicycle while the heart&#xD;
           rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure and oxygen consumption are measured. The pedal&#xD;
           resistance is increased gradually until the subject can no longer exercise and then the&#xD;
           resistance is gradually decreased for cool-down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who qualify for the second part of the study undergo the following procedures&#xD;
      during a 5-day in-hospital stay:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temperature measurements. Body temperature is measured in the ear canal. Skin&#xD;
           temperature is measured with small round adhesive temperature-sensing patches placed on&#xD;
           the abdomen and limbs for up to 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of body radiowaves. A remote sensing device is used to measure microwaves&#xD;
           that are naturally released from the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infrared photography of hands, front of thigh and abdomen is done several times during&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Application of mild coolness to hands, thigh and abdomen. The subject's hand is exposed&#xD;
           to mild coolness first by immersion in cool water, then by a cool-water spray, then by a&#xD;
           cooled pad placed on the hand, and finally, with a device applied to the hand that cools&#xD;
           and has a gentle vacuum. The abdomen and thigh are similarly exposed. During each test,&#xD;
           an infrared camera records how heat is released by the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temperature effects of a &quot;meal.&quot; The subject drinks lemon-flavored sugar water to&#xD;
           measure the body's response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bicycle exercise test. The subject exercises on three different occasions. During or&#xD;
           after some of the tests, mild cooling is applied to the abdomen, front of the thigh, or&#xD;
           hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of exhaled air (indirect calorimetry). The subject wears a hood that&#xD;
           collects and analyzes exhaled air for 15- to 30-minute periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photography and videotaping. The subject is photographed and videotaped. The images do&#xD;
           not include views of any private parts, and the subject's identity is protected.&#xD;

      Animal models suggest that dissipation of body heat is an important physiological process&#xD;
      that may affect energy expenditure, and thus may possibly modulate body weight. It is&#xD;
      unknown, however, if deficient dissipation of heat can contribute to human obesity, or if&#xD;
      obesity induces deficits in heat dissipation, and the relationship between obesity and heat&#xD;
      in humans is largely unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2)) and normal weight (BMI&#xD;
      less than or equal to 25 kg/m(2)) adults to determine possible obesity-related differences&#xD;
      in: 1) regional body temperature heterogeneity (i.e., presence of localized areas of heat&#xD;
      retention), 2) the extent to which locally retained heat may be co-localized with deep fat&#xD;
      depots, 3) the effectiveness of specific body loci (e.g., the distal extremities) as&#xD;
      dissipaters of heat, and 4) the ability of approaches that alter heat dissipation to modify&#xD;
      deep-body temperature heterogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the results of this study will provide preliminary evidence for future&#xD;
      studies that attempt to facilitate weight loss in obese subjects through effective, guided&#xD;
      applications of heat management.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Good general health. Individuals taking medications for obesity-related co-morbid&#xD;
             conditions will generally be excluded, but will be considered on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
             Participants will be nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 27 kg/m(2) for normal weight subjects or BMI&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2). To maximize differences between groups,&#xD;
             overweight but not obese adults will not be studied. Body weight will be less than 300&#xD;
             pounds (136 kg), however, because DXA scanners at the Clinical Center cannot scan&#xD;
             individuals of greater size).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For women with childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at the initial&#xD;
             evaluation. Since these subjects have to undergo an X-ray screening, for safety&#xD;
             purposes pregnant women will be excluded from participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For women, a normal menstrual cycle or post menopausal status. Women with normal&#xD;
             cycles will be studied between 1-3 weeks following their last menstrual period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (Overweight Subjects):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will be excluded (and referred to treatment as needed) for the following&#xD;
        reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of major illnesses: renal (serum creatinine greater than 1.6), hepatic&#xD;
             (AST/ALT greater than 3 times upper limit of normal range used in Clinical Center&#xD;
             assays), gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyper- or&#xD;
             untreated hypothyroidism), hematological problems or pulmonary disorders (other than&#xD;
             asthma not requiring continuous medication or sleep-apnea related disorders). The&#xD;
             presence of the 'hunting' reflex will not exclude patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals who have a current substance abuse, including smoking, or a psychiatric&#xD;
             disorder or other condition that in the opinion of the investigators would impede&#xD;
             competence or compliance, or possibly hinder completion of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who regularly use prescription medications. Oral contraceptive use will be&#xD;
             permitted, provided the contraceptive has been used for at least two months before&#xD;
             starting the study. Individuals taking medications for most conditions will be&#xD;
             excluded, but medication use will be considered on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Weight change of more than 3% of body weight in the past two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Areas to be visualized by IR are deemed by the investigators to be too hirsute to&#xD;
             allow accurate measurement of underlying tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Fat depth in areas to be measured is more than 4 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Long nails that would preclude wearing snug-fitting surgical gloves.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Weight in excess of 300 lbs (136 kg) that would preclude being scanned by Clinical&#xD;
             Center DXA machines.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Individuals that regularly participate in high-intensity physical activity, as&#xD;
             determined by either self-report or analysis of the Past Year Total Physical Activity&#xD;
             Questionnaire (PYTPAQ)&#xD;
