  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of epoetin alfa versus&#xD;
      placebo, injected beneath the skin, in the treatment of patients with persistent anemia&#xD;
      caused by advanced cancer, with a below normal hematocrit of &lt;= 37%. Epoetin alfa is a&#xD;
      genetically engineered protein that stimulates red blood cell production.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced cancer frequently develop significant anemia, as determined by a blood&#xD;
      test to measure hematocrit, with a below normal hematocrit of &lt;=37%. Agents that can elevate&#xD;
      the hematocrit level in patients with advanced cancer may increase the physical strength and&#xD;
      stamina that is decreased by anemia, increase the patients' ability to persevere with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and improve their overall quality of life. Epoetin alfa is a genetically&#xD;
      engineered form of a natural hormone, erythropoietin, that is used to treat anemia by&#xD;
      stimulating red blood cell production. This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study to determine the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment with epoetin alfa in patients with persistent anemia caused by&#xD;
      advanced cancer. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
      epoetin alfa 100 units per kilogram or a comparable volume of placebo, given by injection&#xD;
      beneath the skin. Patients will be given study medication 3 times weekly for up to 8 weeks or&#xD;
      until a patient's hematocrit reaches 38% to 40%. The 8 weeks will be decreased to 4 weeks if,&#xD;
      by Week 4, a patient's hematocrit decreases by more than 15% from the start of the study. At&#xD;
      the end of the double-blind part of the study, patients who achieved a hematocrit level of 38&#xD;
      to 40%, or whose hematocrit decreased by &gt;=15% from the start of the study by Week 4, will be&#xD;
      allowed to enroll in the open-label part of the study for an additional 6 months and will&#xD;
      receive epoetin alfa at a dose adjusted to maintain a hematocrit level between 38% and 40%.&#xD;
      Within 5 to 7 days after it is documented that a patient's hematocrit has reached 38% to 40%,&#xD;
      epoetin alfa will then be given once weekly by injection beneath the skin to maintain the&#xD;
      hematocrit between 38% and 40% for the remaining time of the study. Patients will be seen by&#xD;
      a healthcare professional once weekly and by the physician once monthly. Safety evaluations&#xD;
      will include changes in laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, and the incidence of adverse events from the start of the study to the&#xD;
      end of the double-blind part of the study and to the end of the open-label part of the study.&#xD;
      Effectiveness will be assessed by blood transfusion requirements and changes in hemoglobin,&#xD;
      hematocrit, and immature red blood cell count from the start of the study to the end of&#xD;
      study, as well as the physician's global evaluation and the quality of life assessment at the&#xD;
      end of the double-blind part of the study and at the end of the open-label part of the study.&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that epoetin alfa will be well tolerated and more effective than&#xD;
      placebo in stimulating adequate production of red blood cells in patients who are anemic as a&#xD;
      result of advanced cancer. Double-blind: Epoetin alfa 100 units/kilogram (U/kg) or placebo&#xD;
      injected under the skin; given 3 times weekly for 8 weeks or until hematocrit reaches&#xD;
      38%-40%. Open-label: Epoetin alfa 100 or 150 U/kg or a higher dose injected under the skin on&#xD;
      a schedule to maintain hematocrit of 38%-40%.&#xD;
