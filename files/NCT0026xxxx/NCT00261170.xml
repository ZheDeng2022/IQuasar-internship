  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized blinded trial of whether hospitalized smokers who are randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive bupropion, an antidepressant, and cognitive-behavioral counseling, are more likely&#xD;
      to have quit smoking at the end of treatment and at 6 months compared with smokers randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive placebo and cognitive-behavioral counseling. Because depression is more&#xD;
      prevalent among smokers and because smokers who are prone to depression may become depressed&#xD;
      when they quit, the hypothesis is that the proportion of quitters who receive the active&#xD;
      drug/antidepressant will be greater than the proportion of quitters who receive the placebo&#xD;
      drug at 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred and seventy patients will be enrolled;approximately 135 will be randomized to&#xD;
      each study arm over the course of 24 months. Patients will be considered smokers if they have&#xD;
      used tobacco products during the week prior to admission and if they have smoked&gt; or = 5&#xD;
      cigarettes /day during the previous year.Smokers will be identified by review of admissions&#xD;
      and given a flyer to invite them to join the study. Interested smokers will be screened and&#xD;
      asked to fill out a Beck Depression Inventory. Patients with very high Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory Scores, i.e. &gt; or = 30, will not be enrolled because such individuals may require&#xD;
      other treatment. Each patient's physician will be contacted to verify his/her eligibility for&#xD;
      the study. Once eligibility has been ascertained, a research associate will visit the patient&#xD;
      to obtain informed consent and to enroll them in the study. Study questionnaires and a&#xD;
      Fagerstrom test for Nicotine Dependence will be completed and reviewed by a research&#xD;
      associate for completeness at the time of enrollment. The associate will put in the&#xD;
      prescription for the study drug and request the order for dispensing of the drug. The&#xD;
      research pharmacist will randomize the patient to Study Arm 1 or Study Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to Study Arm 1 will receive a standard 7-week course of sustained release&#xD;
      bupropion (150 mg/day for the first 3 days, then 150mg BID), a self-help booklet, counseling&#xD;
      on smoking cessation strategies, and follow-up phone counseling during the first 3 months&#xD;
      after randomization. Study Arm 2 participants will receive the same intervention as Study Arm&#xD;
      1, but will receive placebo instead of active bupropion therapy. Both study groups will&#xD;
      complete study questionnaires regarding their medical and smoking history and will be&#xD;
      followed one week after their hospital discharge to record their blood pressure and to&#xD;
      monitor possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since quit rates tend to decline over time, relapse prevention approaches will be included in&#xD;
      both study arms. Marlatt's theory of relapse, an extension of Bandura's social learning&#xD;
      model, will be used to augment the quitter's perception of self-efficacy. Participants will&#xD;
      be trained to resist and cope with the temptations and stresses likely to be encountered&#xD;
      after discharge from the hospital. Behavioral self-management techniques to counter known&#xD;
      relapse-triggers such as stress, the presence of other smokers, alcohol use and depression&#xD;
      will be discussed during follow-up counseling calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure saliva cotinine in all participants who give a history of smoking abstinence&#xD;
      at the end of treatment and at 6 months. Cotinine levels of &gt; or + 15 ng/mL will be&#xD;
      considered evidence of current tobacco use. Participants who are self-reported quitters, but&#xD;
      have failed to provide a saliva sample will be considered as smokers unless verification from&#xD;
      a spouse or significant other can be obtained. Participants who have died will be analyzed as&#xD;
      smokers or quitters based on prior self-report, information in medical records, or interviews&#xD;
      with next-of-kin. Others will be censored (i.e. excluded from the analysis). All cotinine&#xD;
      samples will be assayed at the University of California, San Francisco,laboratory of Dr. Neal&#xD;
      Benowitz.&#xD;
