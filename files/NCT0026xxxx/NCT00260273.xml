  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is one of society's most costly medical conditions and the most severe among&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders. One of the most important and exciting new concepts in psychiatry is&#xD;
      that detection and intervention very early in the course of schizophrenia offers what may be&#xD;
      the field's best practical hope for realizing substantive improvements in the outcome of&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Thus, we propose a five year program that&#xD;
      focuses on three interconnected major research streams: (1) an evaluation of the&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a model-driven psychological intervention in&#xD;
      preventing or delaying the onset of a psychotic illness; (2) a qualitative study of the&#xD;
      pathways to mental health at this time of very high risk; and (3) an exploration of the&#xD;
      burden to the healthcare and informal caregiver systems associated with this high risk&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      Research Stream 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and Cost Effectiveness The primary aim of Stream 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of a model-driven psychological intervention, CBT in preventing or delaying the onset of a&#xD;
      psychotic illness and to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in reducing presenting concerns in&#xD;
      a sample of help-seeking individuals who have been operationally defined to be at ultra high&#xD;
      risk of developing a psychotic illness. CBT will be compared to supportive therapy (ST). We&#xD;
      will also examine the cost-effectiveness of a preventive approach. Using a cost-consequence&#xD;
      approach, we will examine the cost-effectiveness of CBT versus supportive therapy in&#xD;
      addressing psychosis in the &quot;ultra high risk&quot; phase from the perspective of the payer (i.e.,&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care). The hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) The time of conversion will be significantly longer for those in the CBT group compared&#xD;
      to those in the ST condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) The mean level of attenuated psychotic symptoms (SOPS ratings ) will be significantly&#xD;
      lower in the CBT group compared to the ST group at the completion of the intervention and at&#xD;
      each follow up point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Levels of risk factors (measured by CMRS &amp; GHQ2) will be significantly lower in the CBT&#xD;
      group compared to the ST group at the completion of the intervention and at each follow up&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Levels of depression and anxiety (measured by CDSS, BAS, SPAI2) will be significantly&#xD;
      lower in the CBT group compared to the ST group at the completion of the intervention and at&#xD;
      each follow up point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (v) Level of social functioning (measured by SFS2) will be significantly higher in the CBT&#xD;
      group compared to the ST group at the termination of the trial and at each follow up point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi) CBT will be more cost-effective than ST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Stream 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathways to Care The aim of stream 2 is to obtain the in-depth stories of the ways in which&#xD;
      those at ultra high risk of developing a psychotic illness come to seek help from mental&#xD;
      health services. By mental health services, we include the formal system (specialty mental&#xD;
      health &amp; general medical care), lay system (friends, family, self-help), folk system&#xD;
      (alternative healers) and human social service system (clergy, teachers, police). These will&#xD;
      be sought from both the perspective of youth and from the perspective of their significant&#xD;
      others. Multiple case studies using qualitative approaches will focus on the following four&#xD;
      elements: 1) social content; 2) social support system, 3) the illness career; and, 4) the&#xD;
      treatment system (See Appendix A for detailed components within these elements of the model).&#xD;
      These case studies will be employed to further empirically develop theory relating to&#xD;
      pathways to mental health care. Theoretical Propositions: The following four theoretical&#xD;
      propositions related to pathways to mental health care were formulated based on the Network&#xD;
      Episode Model described above. The focus of this stream will be upon the evaluation,&#xD;
      refinement and elaboration of these four theoretical propositions. Multiple case study&#xD;
      methodology will be employed to further empirically develop theory relating to pathways to&#xD;
      mental health care. (i) Family content (e.g., beliefs about and experiences with the medical&#xD;
      system), structure (e.g., size, amount of support) and function (e.g., advice, support or&#xD;
      coercion) have a critical influence on the pathways to mental health care for youth at ultra&#xD;
      high risk for psychosis.(ii) The community and school content, structure and function have a&#xD;
      critical influence on the pathways to mental health care for youth at ultra high risk for&#xD;
      psychosis.(iii) Problem recognition and the illness experience as perceived by the individual&#xD;
      and significant others have a critical influence on the pathways to mental health care for&#xD;
      youth at ultra high risk for psychosis.(iv) The content, structure and function (e.g.&#xD;
      organizational constraints) of the treatment system have a critical influence on the pathways&#xD;
      to mental health care for youth at ultra high risk for psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Stream 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs of Caring in Psychosis The aim of this third research stream is to explore the burden&#xD;
      to the healthcare system and informal caregivers associated with this ultra high risk&#xD;
      population. We seek to address three primary questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) What are the key components affecting the costs of caring for the ultra high risk&#xD;
      population? These costs will be considered with respect to both the formal and informal care&#xD;
      providers (i.e., service system and family caregivers, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) What are other psychological costs of caring that informal caregivers face? (i.e.&#xD;
      modification in parental work schedules to accommodate their child's needs, impact on other&#xD;
      siblings) (iii) Over time, how do the costs of caring change in terms of the economic and&#xD;
      psychological costs?&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages 12-30 yearsÂ·&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meeting criteria for an &quot;at risk mental state&quot; based on one or more of the 3 Criteria&#xD;
             of Prodromal Symptoms (COPS criteria) with severity as determined by ratings on the&#xD;
             Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS) or the criteria for attenuated symptoms of the&#xD;
             early prodromal state defined by the presence of at least two of 9 symptoms on the&#xD;
             Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms that have been demonstrated to have&#xD;
             the best positive predictive value of developing schizophrenia (KlosterkÃ¶tter et al.,&#xD;
             2001). These criteria for the early prodromal state course are currently used in the&#xD;
             multi-site European Prediction of Psychosis Study (EPOS) (Birchwood et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meets criteria for current or lifetime axis I psychotic disorder.Â·&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meets DSM-IV criteria for an Axis 1 disorder where in the judgment of the evaluating&#xD;
             clinician the diagnostic prodromal symptoms are clearly caused by the Axis 1 disorder.&#xD;
             Note that, except for bipolar and psychotic disorders and a current major depression&#xD;
             other DSM-IV disorders will not be exclusionary (e.g. substance abuse or dependence&#xD;
             disorder, major depression, anxiety disorders, Axis II Disorders) as long as the&#xD;
             disorder does not account for the diagnosis of prodromal symptoms.Â·&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of substances where in the judgment of the evaluating clinician, the diagnostic&#xD;
             prodromal symptoms are substance-induced.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of treatment with an antipsychotic for the current presenting symptoms&#xD;
             or for any previous episode of psychotic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired intellectual functioning (IQ&lt; than 70).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past or current history of a clinically significant central nervous system disorder&#xD;
             which may confound or contribute to prodromal symptoms.&#xD;
