  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the disease is caused by a nonsense&#xD;
      mutation (premature stop codon) in the gene that makes the dystrophin protein. PTC124 has&#xD;
      been shown to partially restore dystrophin production in animals with DMD due to a nonsense&#xD;
      mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether PTC124 can safely increase&#xD;
      functional dystrophin protein in the muscles of patients with DMD due to a nonsense mutation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with DMD due to a nonsense mutation will be treated with a new&#xD;
      investigational drug called PTC124. To determine if a patient qualifies for the study&#xD;
      evaluation procedures will be performed within 21 days prior to the start of treatment; these&#xD;
      procedures include: history, physical examination, blood and urine tests to assess organ&#xD;
      function, electrocardiogram (ECG), muscle biopsy for evaluation of dystrophin protein, and&#xD;
      DMD-specific tests of muscle function (for patients who are able to perform such tests).&#xD;
      Eligible patients who elect to enroll in the study will then participate in a 28-day&#xD;
      treatment period and a 28-day follow-up period (56 days total). The first 6 patients to be&#xD;
      enrolled will take PTC124 treatment 3 times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of 4&#xD;
      mg/kg (breakfast), 4 mg/kg (lunch) and 8 mg/kg (dinner); these patients will then be observed&#xD;
      during a 28-day follow-up period without treatment. Next, 18 additional patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled to take PTC124 treatment 3 times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of 10 mg/kg&#xD;
      (breakfast), 10 mg/kg (lunch), and 20 mg/kg (dinner); these patients will then be observed&#xD;
      during a 28-day follow-up period without treatment. Subsequently, 6-12 additional patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled to take PTC124 treatment 3 times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of&#xD;
      20 mg/kg (breakfast), 20 mg/kg (lunch), and 40 mg/kg (dinner); these patients will then be&#xD;
      observed during a 28-day follow-up period without treatment. There will be a 2-night stay at&#xD;
      the clinical research center at the beginning and at the end of the 28 days of PTC124&#xD;
      treatment. To assess efficacy, patients will have an end-of-treatment biopsy and will undergo&#xD;
      DMD-specific tests of muscle function (for patients who are able to perform such tests). To&#xD;
      assess safety and pharmacokinetics, safety assessments, blood and urine tests, and ECGs will&#xD;
      be performed at prespecified timepoints during the 28-day treatment period and the 28-day&#xD;
      follow-up period. At the end of the 56 days, patients will be assessed periodically regarding&#xD;
      their general health status; these evaluations will be performed by telephone contact at&#xD;
      approximately 6-month intervals in the first 2 years and at approximately 12-month intervals&#xD;
      in subsequent years (up to 5 years total).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of DMD based on a clinical phenotype presenting by age 5, with increased&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical examination or radiographic imaging documenting the presence of EDB or TA&#xD;
             muscles in both legs&#xD;
