      The aim of this study is the implementation of Forced Oscillations Technique (FOT) in&#xD;
      newborns and small infants using a novel commercially available device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to assess the feasibility of the method, provide normative data for the&#xD;
      first months of life and describe short- and long-term changes in neonatal respiratory&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of term and preterm newborns admitted to the Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or the Well-Baby Nursery of the University Hospital of Patras,&#xD;
      Greece. It is estimated that 200 full-term and 150 preterm newborns will be enrolled during a&#xD;
      period of 36 months (March 2021 - September 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be performed using the TremoFlo N-100 via a face mask, with the infant in&#xD;
      the supine position during natural sleep. At least 3 technically acceptable measurements&#xD;
      (duration 10s each) will be obtained, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy full-term neonates: postnatal days 1, 2, 3 and at discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preterm neonates: NICU admission, postnatal days 1, 2 and 3, and on the first day of&#xD;
           each additional gestational week until discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be also measured at the age of 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Pulmonary function testing during early infancy requires sophisticated&#xD;
      equipment, specialized personnel and proper patient's preparation. As a result, lung function&#xD;
      testing in newborns and small infants is limited to few highly specialized centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The forced oscillations technique (FOT) uses complex pressure signals generated by an&#xD;
      external device at the airway opening. The pressure waves are transmitted through the airway&#xD;
      tree during tidal breathing and force the anatomical structures of the respiratory system to&#xD;
      oscillate. From subsequent pressure and flow signal analysis, the total resistance (Rrs) and&#xD;
      reactance (Xrs) of the respiratory system are calculated. The latter relates mainly to the&#xD;
      elastic properties of the lung parenchyma and the inertia of the column of air in the&#xD;
      airways. Both Rrs and Xrs depend on the frequency of oscillation; lower frequencies (range&#xD;
      5-10Hz) provide information on the mechanical properties of smaller airways and vice versa.&#xD;
      FOT measurements can be performed fast (usually in less than 30 s), at the bedside, and do&#xD;
      not require patient's cooperation. Therefore, FOT is being viewed as an attractive and&#xD;
      promising pulmonary function technique for young infants and newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the introduction of infant FOT in routine clinical practice has been limited due to&#xD;
      lack of suitable devices and normative data. Studies based on in-build FOT equipment have&#xD;
      shown that the application of the method in small infants is feasible. A recent study, in&#xD;
      which a modified commercially available device (Tremoflo C-100, THORASYS Thoracic Medical&#xD;
      Systems Inc. Montreal, Canada) was used, also supports the feasibility of the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is the implementation of FOT in newborns and small infants&#xD;
      using a novel commercially available device (Tremoflo N-100, THORASYS), specifically released&#xD;
      for this age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objectives are: a) to assess the feasibility of the method and the repeatability of FOT&#xD;
      measurements in newborns and small infants, b) to provide normative data for the first months&#xD;
      of life in relation to various parameters (e.g. gender, age, somatometrics, etc) and, c) to&#xD;
      describe short- and long-term and Rrs and Xrs changes in neonatal respiratory disease (e.g.&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Population The study population will consist of term and preterm newborns admitted to&#xD;
      the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or the Well-Baby Nursery of the University Hospital&#xD;
      of Patras, Greece. It is estimated that 200 full-term and 150 preterm newborns will be&#xD;
      enrolled during a period of 36 months (March 2021 - September 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parents of all infants will provide written informed consent prior to enrollment. The&#xD;
      study has been approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the hospital (decision no.&#xD;
      451/12.11.2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Measurements will be performed using the TremoFlo N-100, at bedside, with the&#xD;
      infant in the supine position during quiet natural sleep. The device will be calibrated&#xD;
      daily, according to manufacturer's instructions. After proper cleaning and decontamination,&#xD;
      the face mask of the device will be preheated at 37oC (to avoid awakening) and will be placed&#xD;
      on infant's face. The duration of each measurement will be predetermined at 10 s. At least 3&#xD;
      technically acceptable measurements will be performed per infant, with 30 s intervals between&#xD;
      them. The validity of each measurement will be assessed according to the coherence function&#xD;
      (automatically determined by the operating system of the device).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOT measurements will be scheduled according to the target population, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In healthy full-term neonates, measurements will be obtained on postnatal days 1, 2, 3&#xD;
           and at discharge. Parents will be asked and scheduled to repeat testing at the age of 3,&#xD;
           6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In preterm neonates without respiratory disease, measurements will be performed on NICU&#xD;
           admission, on postnatal days 1, 2 and 3, and on the first day of each additional&#xD;
           gestational week until discharge. For example, a preterm neonate with gestational age&#xD;
           331/7, will be measured at 331/7, 332/7, 333/7, 334/7, 34, 35, 36, etc. Parents of&#xD;
           preterm newborns will be also asked and scheduled to repeat testing at the age of 3, 6&#xD;
           and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) the measurements will be&#xD;
           obtained on NICU admission and at 6 and 12 hours after surfactant administration.&#xD;
           Thereafter, the same protocol with preterm neonates without respiratory disease will be&#xD;
           applied. In mechanically ventilated infants the measurements will be performed via the&#xD;
           endotracheal tube, but only if their clinical condition permits FOT testing. In such&#xD;
           cases, the device will be calibrated in advance using an endotracheal tube of the same&#xD;
           internal diameter, material and length as that positioned on the neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS AND BENEFITS The study is expected to confirm the feasibility of FOT in&#xD;
      newborns and small infants (in NICU or outpatient settings) and, most important, to reveal a&#xD;
      series of technical/practical details that may improve the applicability of the method in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Finally, the study will provide normative data for this age range, and&#xD;
      will assess Rrs and Xrs changes in various respiratory disorders of the neonatal period and&#xD;
      early infancy.&#xD;
