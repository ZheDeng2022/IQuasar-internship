  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobile health applications (mHealth app) are an opportunity offered by developing technology&#xD;
      which in widely used among youths. The evidence regarding mHealth apps suggests that the apps&#xD;
      can be safer and more feasible if are developed by healthcare team. Healthcare professionals&#xD;
      have a major role to play in developing mHealth apps of good interventions.&#xD;

      This study aims at developing the mHealth application (AST-M) and evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of AST-M app on the mean score of the asthma control test, self-efficacy scale&#xD;
      and quality of life questionaire in adolescents with asthma. This study is a theory-based,&#xD;
      single centre, assessor-blinded, 12-week, randomized parallel group study. After baseline&#xD;
      assessment participants will be randomized to either the intervention or control group in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. Adolescents will be stratified based on age of years and randomly allocated to&#xD;
      intervention (AST-M which is a user-focused mHealth app) or control group (Usual care)&#xD;
      through block randomization. The study protocol is conducted in accord with the Standard&#xD;
      Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT 2013 Statement) (Chan et&#xD;
      al., 2013), the RCT is perform by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)&#xD;
      (Moher et al., 2010) and the mHealth intervention is described according to the mERA&#xD;
      guideline (Agarwal et al., 2016). This study will be carried out in pediatric allergy and&#xD;
      immunology outpatient clinic of the university hospital which has the largest patient&#xD;
      population of asthma, located in the centre of the city. Adolescent with asthma are routinely&#xD;
      invited to the outpatient clinic once every three months.&#xD;

    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured by Asthmatic Child and Adolescent Self-Efficacy Scale (ACASES). The ACASES, which can be filled by the adolescents themselves, consists of 22 items and 3 sub-dimensions was developed for adolescents between the ages of 10-18 years. A minimum of 22 and a maximum of 110 points can be obtained on the scale. The high scores of the scale indicate that the adolescent has high self-efficacy (Schl√∂sser &amp; Havermans, 1992).</description>

    <description>Asthma control will be measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT). ACT is a 5-item questionnaire that provides information about the level of control of asthma. The lowest possible score is 5, the highest score is 25. In the evaluation, 25 points are evaluated as: &quot;full control&quot;, 24-20 points: &quot;partial control&quot;, 19 points and below: &quot;not under control&quot; (Liu et al., 2007).</description>

    <description>The quality of life will be measured by the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ). The PAQLQ is 7-point Likert type, consists of 23 items and 3 dimensions, developed for the 7-17 age range (Juniper, 1997).</description>

    <description>AST-M is designed as an adolescent-focused, interesting, creative, useful, provide unlimited and unimpeded access to information resources, mobile interfaces that can be individualized and enable self-learning, connect in-depth information enriched with much visual content and a communication channel with healthcare professional that they can consult whenever they wish. Also content of the app is based on Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986)</description>
