      STUDY HYPOTHESIS: The primary hypothesis is whether chemotherapy with Anlotinib improves&#xD;
      overall survival in advanced cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN: The study is a prospective, single-arm, observational clinical study. The study&#xD;
      will be performed on an intent-to-treat population. All the enrolled patients received&#xD;
      chemotherapy with Anlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT: Overall survival, defined as the observed length of life from entry into&#xD;
      the study to death from any cause or the date of last contact.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced (metastatic, persistent, and recurrent) cervical cancer will be&#xD;
      recruited from Zhongda Hospital. Only patients who treated with paclitaxel plus nedaplatin&#xD;
      will be included in the analysis. All patients receive paclitaxel (135-175mg /m^2) and&#xD;
      nedaplatin (100 mg/m^2) infusion on day 1, and then take Anlotinib 12mg/d orally on day 7-21,&#xD;
      every 3 weeks. Once patients reached CR or PR, Anlotinib was continued on 12mg/d maintenance&#xD;
      therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was noted.&#xD;
