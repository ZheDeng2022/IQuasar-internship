  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We implemented a previously reported algorithm based on intra-postoperative PTH measurements&#xD;
      with selected cut-off values, both to predict post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroid&#xD;
      hypocalcemia, and to guide postsurgical management. The objective of the study was to assess&#xD;
      if this strategy was useful to reduce hypocalcemia, post-surgery calcium sampling and&#xD;
      hospitalization length.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-six patients were included in the analysis. Based on their intra-operatory PTH&#xD;
      determinations, patients were classified according to their post-surgical hypoparathyroidism&#xD;
      risk and were either immediately treated with calcium and vitamin D1-25 supplementation&#xD;
      (high-risk) or assigned to clinical control and routine calcium sampling (low-risk). The&#xD;
      outcomes and overall results of these therapeutical approaches were compared with those of a&#xD;
      control group, started on treatment when TCa levels dropped below normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the high-risk subgroup (n=30) five patients showed hypocalcemia within the first 24 hours.&#xD;
      Compared with the high-risk control subgroup, the incidence of hypocalcemia fell from 100% to&#xD;
      17% (p&lt;0.001), and the median hospitalization length from 6 to 3 days (p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the low-risk subgroup (n=36) 28 patients remained normocalcemic with significantly less&#xD;
      calcium sampling (p&lt;0.001). Eight patients had hypocalcemia; 7 of them required neck&#xD;
      dissection, which was the only risk factor related to post-surgical hypoparathyroidism (RR:&#xD;
      2.1 [CI 95% 1.4-3.1], P&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the control group, overall incidence of hypocalcemia was reduced by 58 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach improved patient's safety by reducing the occurrence of hypocalcemia and the&#xD;
      length of hospitalization after thyroidectomy in pediatric patients. Preventive calcium&#xD;
      supplementation seems to be more beneficial in patients undergoing neck dissection.&#xD;

    <description>We implement an algorithm employing PTH levels post-thyroidectomy to stratify patients according to their postsurgical risk for hypoparathyroidism, and to distinctively manage them in the immediate postsurgical period. High risk patients are quickly supplemented with Calcium iv and activated 25OH vitamin D. Low risk patients are clinically controlled and calcium level were checked at 24 and 48 hs post thyroidectomy.</description>

        All patients between 2 and 19 years of age who underwent total thyroidectomy at Hospital de&#xD;
        Niños Ricardo Gutiérrez in Buenos Aires, Argentina between January 2014 and April 2020 were&#xD;
        included. Exclusion criteria were patients with known hyper or hypoparathyroidism, kidney&#xD;
        failure, and those taking medications known to affect TCa, PTH, or vitamin D levels&#xD;
        (octreotide, oral glucocorticoids, diuretics and antiepileptics), or any other condition&#xD;
        that could interfere with calcium metabolism.&#xD;
