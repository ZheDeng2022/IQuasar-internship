      To evaluate the intra- and inter-rater reliability of a test of active shoulder&#xD;

      Introduction: Obtaining the reliability of an evaluative instrument is of paramount&#xD;
      importance for its applicability in the field of clinical physiotherapy and in the sports&#xD;
      field, providing consistent and real measures. Shoulder proprioception assessments have&#xD;
      started to appear on the scientific scene in recent years and several tools, methods and&#xD;
      protocols are being studied. However, the lack of standardization of protocols and&#xD;
      application in different populations produces inconsistencies in the findings, thus hindering&#xD;
      the use of these models. Thus, standardizing the application of the test and investigating a&#xD;
      population different from what appears in the scientific scenario in relation to sports, such&#xD;
      as swimming athletes, seems to be relevant and would contribute to the use of scientific&#xD;
      evaluative models in the clinical environment. Objectives: To evaluate the intra- and&#xD;
      inter-rater reliability of a test of active shoulder proprioception with a laser pointer in&#xD;
      swimming athletes and to describe the profile of the proprioception measures characterizing&#xD;
      the sample according to the specialty within the sport and the category of the athletes.&#xD;
      Methods: Study of intra- and inter-rater reliability of the shoulder proprioception test with&#xD;
      a laser pointer, composed of 48 young male and female swimming athletes, aged between 12 and&#xD;
      20 years. It will be carried out in three stages: (1) Familiarization, (2) Test and (3)&#xD;
      Retest, all stages will take place on the same day, and stages 2 and 3 will be performed by&#xD;
      two different evaluators. To characterize the sample, descriptive statistics will be used by&#xD;
      means of central tendency and variability, for all variables collected. Relative reliability&#xD;
      will be tested by the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), with a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval. The ICC will be interpreted as values &lt;0.5 indicate low reliability, between 0.5&#xD;
      and 0.75, moderate reliability, between 0.75 and 0.9, good reliability and values&gt; 0.90&#xD;
      excellent reliability. And the absolute reliability will be verified by means of the standard&#xD;
      error of the measurement (EPM), by values of minimum detectable change (MMD), and the&#xD;
      coefficient of variation (CV).&#xD;

    <description>In the Familiarization stage (1), the TRMOPL was applied by means of a single evaluator with the aim of knowledge and understanding of the test. After five minutes, step (2) test started. In this step, the test was applied twice, by different evaluators, with an interval of five minutes between applications (inter-rater reliability). Ten minutes after the end of the tests, step (3) retest (intra-rater reliability) was started, following the same procedures as in step 2. The order of the evaluators was randomized through a draw in Excel, the order of randomization of the steps (2) and (3) was the same in order not to influence intra-rater reliability.</description>
