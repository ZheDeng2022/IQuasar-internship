  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-centre, parallel-group clinical investigation to evaluate the&#xD;
      symptomatic pain relief, consumer acceptability and in-use tolerability of the Scholl Corn&#xD;
      Foam Cushion in participants suffering from painful Heloma Durum over a 72-hour at home&#xD;
      in-use period compared to a no-treatment control group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation design will include an enrolment and randomisation visit followed by an at&#xD;
      home in-use period and a final follow up phone call. The enrolment visit will include&#xD;
      confirmation of eligibility and collection of baseline data, including baseline pain scores&#xD;
      using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), medical history, demographics, and baseline Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes (PRO) assessments. Baseline data collected will be assessed to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility before randomisation, first product application (treatment group only), initial&#xD;
      pain (VAS) Participant Perceived Questionnaires (PPQ) and PRO assessments. During the at home&#xD;
      in-use period, those participants randomised to the treatment group will reapply the product&#xD;
      daily, complete pain assessments using the VAS (morning and evening), PPQs and PROs (Day 3&#xD;
      evening only). For participants randomised to the no-treatment group, they will complete pain&#xD;
      assessments using the VAS (morning and evening) and PROs (Day 3 evening). All participants&#xD;
      will continuously record Adverse Events (AE) and changes to concomitant medication throughout&#xD;
      this period. During the follow up phone call, the participants will be contacted to establish&#xD;
      any further AEs and/or changes to concomitant medication, additionally any queries related to&#xD;
      diary entries will be made during this phone call. Participants will not need to return to&#xD;
      the site unless advised to do so by the Principal Investigator (PI) or delegate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the investigation, the Investigator will make an Assessment of Tolerance&#xD;
      for each subject based on their pain scores (VAS), PPQ responses and AEs reported.&#xD;
