  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy of local therapy for oligometastasis from&#xD;
      ER/PR-positive breast cancer. The study hypothesis is that local therapy in addition to&#xD;
      systemic therapy improves progression-free survival in comparison with systemic therapy&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with estrogen receptor/ progesterone receptor-positive oligometastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      with disease controlled after at least six months of systemic therapy will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Patients will be randomized to receive local therapy for oligometastatic sites in&#xD;
      addition to systemic therapy or systemic therapy alone. Local therapy strategies will include&#xD;
      surgery, radiotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>2-year progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be defined as the time from randomization until the date of progression or death. 2-year PFS rate will represent the probability of a patient being free of progression after 2 years of randomization and will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall-survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be calculated from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local therapy complication rate</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Local therapy complications will be registered, including the occurrence of bleeding, local infections, pneumothorax, or other events attributed to local therapy by the medical team. Acute complications will be considered as those occurring until one month after procedure, while late complication will be those occurring later than one month.</description>

    <measure>1. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 provide points for questions related to global health status, functional scales, and symptom scales, providing scores ranging from 0-100. Higher scores represent higher health status, higher functioning, and higher symptom burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire - Breast Cancer (QLQ-BR23)</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is composed of questions related to functional scales and symptom scales specific for breast cancer, providing scores ranging from 0-100. Higher scores for functional scales represent better functioning, while higher scores for symptom scales represent higher levels of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chemotherapy-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Chemotherapy-free survival will be calculated from the date of randomization until the first date of application of a new chemotherapy line.</description>
