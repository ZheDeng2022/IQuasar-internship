    <textblock>
      An intertrochanteric (ITF) trochanteric fracture of the femur is an exclusively extra&#xD;
      capsular fracture in which the fracture line extends from the greater trochanter to the&#xD;
      lesser trochanter. Its incidence has increased significantly over the past decades and is&#xD;
      expected to double in the next 25 years, with an important global economic impact . It&#xD;
      affects women in the seventh and eighth decades of life, an age group older than femoral neck&#xD;
      fractures. For this reason, the mortality of intertrochanteric fractures is twice that of the&#xD;
      femoral neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is surgical, in which the objective is the stable internal fixation and the&#xD;
      patient's early ambulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional outcomes and treatment mortality are related including factors perioperative&#xD;
      anemia and blood loss.Even so, even with these precautions, blood loss in this surgical&#xD;
      procedure appears to be greater than expected, with blood loss of the order of 2100ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood loss management and the inherent risks of anemia can be circumvented with blood&#xD;
      transfusion. However, blood transfusion is not without risks and complications, such as&#xD;
      hypersensitivity and hemolytic reactions, cardiac overload, infectious diseases. Homologous&#xD;
      transfusions are associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased costs and increased&#xD;
      patient morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, alternatives have been used to avoid the use of blood such as saline solutions, use of&#xD;
      erythropoietin and antifibrinolytic agents . Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a drug that interferes&#xD;
      with fibrinolysis, in use for more than 50 years in surgery, particularly in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only recently, TXA has sparked interest in orthopedic surgeries. Studies have shown the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of TXA at FIT, but presented different forms of administration&#xD;
      (intravenous, topical, infiltrative) . Despite promising results to contain bleeding in&#xD;
      elective orthopedic surgery and fractures, in daily practice, TXA is not very popular,&#xD;
      especially in fractures, and has not been used routinely by all doctors. Studies have not&#xD;
      been found in the literature about the topical use of TXA compared to intravenous use in FIT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An intertrochanteric (ITF) trochanteric fracture of the femur is an exclusively extra&#xD;
      capsular fracture in which the fracture line extends from the greater trochanter to the&#xD;
      lesser trochanter. Usually, it is an isolated fracture, related to osteoporosis, which occurs&#xD;
      due to low-energy trauma such as a fall during gait. It is the most common fracture of the&#xD;
      proximal femur. Its incidence has increased significantly over the past decades and is&#xD;
      expected to double in the next 25 years, with an important global economic impact . It&#xD;
      affects women in the seventh and eighth decades of life, an age group older than femoral neck&#xD;
      fractures. For this reason, the mortality of intertrochanteric fractures is twice that of the&#xD;
      femoral neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is surgical, in which the objective is the stable internal fixation and the&#xD;
      patient's early ambulation. The most used materials are plates with dynamic compression&#xD;
      screws (Dinamic Hip Screw-DHS) and intramedullary nails (specifically cephalomedullary nails&#xD;
      or Proximate femoral nail (PFN). Patients who have suffered this fracture are at high risk&#xD;
      for cardiovascular, pulmonary, infections and thrombosis. About a third of patients die in&#xD;
      the first year after the injury, approximately 50% become incapable of walking alone or&#xD;
      climbing stairs and 20% need permanent home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional outcomes and treatment mortality are related including factors perioperative&#xD;
      anemia and blood loss. In order to prevent blood loss, many strategies have been taken, such&#xD;
      as closed or percutaneous fracture reduction and surgical approach with minimally invasive&#xD;
      techniques such as fixation with short intramedullary nails (PFN). Even so, even with these&#xD;
      precautions, blood loss in this surgical procedure appears to be greater than expected, with&#xD;
      blood loss of the order of 2100ml. It was also observed that surgeons underestimate the&#xD;
      amount of blood lost in the perioperative period, having estimated a median difference of&#xD;
      1473ml between the apparent blood loss and the one that actually occurred with the use of&#xD;
      cephalomedullary nails. Blood loss in ITF is greater than in femoral neck fractures and more&#xD;
      often requires blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood loss management and the inherent risks of anemia can be circumvented with blood&#xD;
      transfusion. However, blood transfusion is not without risks and complications, such as&#xD;
      hypersensitivity and hemolytic reactions, cardiac overload, infectious diseases. Homologous&#xD;
      transfusions are associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased costs and increased&#xD;
      patient morbidity and mortality. Some surgeries may need to wait for the blood supply to be&#xD;
      replenished and patients in need of phenotyped blood find it even more difficult and may wait&#xD;
      days to weeks before finding their proper blood type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, alternatives have been used to avoid the use of blood such as saline solutions, use of&#xD;
      erythropoietin and antifibrinolytic agents . Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a drug that interferes&#xD;
      with fibrinolysis, in use for more than 50 years in surgery, particularly in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only recently, TXA has sparked interest in orthopedic surgeries. Then it has been used in&#xD;
      spine surgery, and joint replacement, without reports of complications. Despite extensive&#xD;
      studies on its use in elective orthopedic surgeries, and its high safety profile, there are&#xD;
      few studies regarding its use in orthopedic trauma surgery. Studies have shown the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of TXA at FIT, but presented different forms of administration&#xD;
      (intravenous, topical, infiltrative) . Despite promising results to contain bleeding in&#xD;
      elective orthopedic surgery and fractures, in daily practice, TXA is not very popular,&#xD;
      especially in fractures, and has not been used routinely by all doctors. Studies have not&#xD;
      been found in the literature about the topical use of TXA compared to intravenous use in FIT.&#xD;

The allocation concealment will be guaranteed by the consecutive opening of numbered, opaque sealed envelopes, after anesthetic induction, opened by the anesthetist, who will be responsible for the intravenous administration and for instructing the nurse of the room about what should be placed in a vat for topical use: saline or tranexamic acid. The orthopedic medical team and the patient will not be aware of which of these will be used intravenously or topically (double blind).

    <description>Blood loss assessment:&#xD;
Patients will be evaluated 1 day before surgery and on the first and second postoperative days with the following laboratory tests: complete blood count and coagulogram, hemoglobin, hematocrit, APTT and INR. The calculation of the estimated initial blood volume will be: Women: (height in meters x 0.3561) + (weight in Kg x 0.03308) + 0.1833 and men: (height in meters x 0.3669) + (weight in Kg x 0.03219) + 0.6041(LEVINE et al., 2014; ALMEIDA et al., 2018).&#xD;
Blood loss (PS) will be calculated in milliliters (ml), based on the hemoglobin levels adjusted for the patient's initial blood volume. PS = Estimated initial volume x (Initial hematocrit less (-) post-operative hematocrit) / (Initial hematocrit)) (GROSS, 1983).</description>

    <description>The surgical technique consists in patient in supina position with previous reduction with lower limb traction (on a traction table or manual) associated or not with the use of percutaneous reduction clamps. Longitudinal lateral incision of 3-5 cm proximal to the greater trochanter, approximately 5 cm long, will be performed. After the skin and subcutaneous incision, the fascia lata will be incised in the same direction, with exposure of the gluteal muscles and the proximal femur. The awl will be introduced at the tip of the greater trochanter and then, at the same location, an intramedullary guidewire, towards the proximal shaft, crossing the fracture. A 3 cm incision to the thigh and inferior to the initial incision with template to introduce the screw in the center of the femoral head. Then, a 2cm incision will be made at the distal end of the nail, and a hole in the femur for the distal lock in dynamic nail hole with a 4.5mm drill where a cortical screw will be inserted.</description>
