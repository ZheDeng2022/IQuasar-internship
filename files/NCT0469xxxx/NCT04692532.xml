      Approximately 26% of Americans have obesity and prediabetes. These conditions greatly&#xD;
      increase the risk for the development of type 2 diabetes. Innovative lifestyle strategies to&#xD;
      treat obesity and prediabetes are critically needed. If the aims of this application are&#xD;
      achieved, this study will be the first to show that time restricted feeding can be&#xD;
      implemented as an alternative to traditional dieting (i.e. daily calorie restriction) for&#xD;
      long-term weight management. This study will also show that time restricted feeding can be&#xD;
      used as an effective non-pharmacological therapy to improve insulin sensitivity and decrease&#xD;
      metabolic risk in this population group.&#xD;

      Background: Intermittent fasting has greatly increased in popularity over the past decade&#xD;
      owing to its ability to produce clinically significant weight loss. The most popular form of&#xD;
      intermittent fasting is time restricted feeding (TRF). TRF typically involves confining the&#xD;
      eating window to 8-10 h, and fasting for the remaining hours of the day. During the eating&#xD;
      window, individuals are not required to count calories or monitor food intake in any way.&#xD;
      Despite its growing popularity, only three human trials have examined the effect of TRF on&#xD;
      body weight. While these preliminary studies show promise for TRF as a weight loss&#xD;
      intervention, all of these previous trials are limited by short duration (2-4 months), the&#xD;
      lack of a control group, and no comparison to traditional dieting approaches (daily calorie&#xD;
      restriction (CR)). The present study will be the first long-term trial (48-weeks) to compare&#xD;
      the effect of TRF to daily CR for weight management and improved glycemic control in&#xD;
      individuals with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The present proposal will test the following hypotheses: (Hyp1) The TRF group&#xD;
      will be more adherent with the intervention versus CR, which will result in greater energy&#xD;
      restriction, weight loss and weight loss maintenance; (Hyp2) The TRF group will experience&#xD;
      greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, HbA1c and other metabolic&#xD;
      disease variables (fasting insulin, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure)&#xD;
      versus CR; (Hyp3) The TRF group will experience greater improvements in markers of&#xD;
      inflammation (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-B, IL-10, hs-CRP) and oxidative stress (8-isoprostane,&#xD;
      4-hydroxynonenal adducts, protein carbonyls, and nitrotyrosine) versus CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 48-week randomized, controlled, parallel-arm trial, divided into 2 consecutive&#xD;
      periods: (1) 24-week weight loss period; and (2) 24-week weight maintenance, will be&#xD;
      implemented. Adults with obesity (n = 300) will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) 8h-TRF (n&#xD;
      = 100) ad libitum food intake from 12pm to 8 pm, fasting from 8 pm to 12 pm daily, (2) CR (n&#xD;
      = 100), 25% energy restriction every day; or 3) control (n = 100), ad libitum food intake&#xD;
      daily with no meal timing restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: If the aims of this application are achieved, this study will be the first to&#xD;
      show that TRF can be implemented as an alternative to traditional dieting (i.e. daily calorie&#xD;
      restriction) for long-term weight management. This study will also show that TRF can be used&#xD;
      as an effective non-pharmacological therapy to improve insulin sensitivity and decrease&#xD;
      metabolic risk factors in individuals with obesity.&#xD;
