  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, comparative, randomized, controlled, single-blind, single-surgeon,&#xD;
      single-center PMCF clinical study whereby participants undergoing refractive surgery for&#xD;
      correction of ametropia will receive a transepithelial PRK (tPRK) and conventional PRK&#xD;
      treatment in the contralateral eye. To avoid bias in the clinical outcomes, the two PRK&#xD;
      treatment options are randomized to the eyes of the patients based on ocular dominance. In&#xD;
      addition, a 1:1 randomization is applied within the tPRK group to eyes with and without&#xD;
      end-treatment laser polishing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both procedures, standard PRK and tPRK, are performed in a one-step procedure. The main&#xD;
      difference between the procedures is, that in conventional PRK, the epithelium will be&#xD;
      removed using alcohol, whereas in tPRK procedures, the epithelium will be removed by laser&#xD;
      ablation.&#xD;

    <description>The amount and disturbance of photic halo side effects will be assessed by the Halo Simulator: With this software tool the particant mimics the individual vision perception by adjusting a typical night scene image with the intensity and size of halo. The simulator utilizes a numerical scale to quantify the size and intensity of halos, ranging from 0 (none), 25 (mild), 50 (moderate), 75 (severe) to 100 (very severe).</description>

    <measure>Corneal pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The epithelial healing process after photorefractive keratectomy treatment often comes along with the perception of some corneal pain. To assess the pain level, the participants will receive a self-administered pain questionnaire to fill out every day from the day of the surgery until they return for the 6-9 days follow up visit. An 11-point scale will be used to rate the self-reporting of pain, where 0 is 'None' and 10 is the highest level of 'Severe'. Higher scores indicate higher level of pain.</description>

    <description>To assess the visual perception level, the participants will receive a self-administered visual perception questionnaire to fill out every day from the day of the surgery until they return for the 6-9 days follow up visit. A 4-point scale will be used to rate the self-reporting of visual perception, with 1 = 'Clear' and 4 = 'Very Poor' vision. Higher scores indicate poorer visual perception.</description>
