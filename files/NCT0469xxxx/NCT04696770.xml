  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very high levels of stress have been reported in parents with their infants admitted to&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Review of literature shows that the symptoms are&#xD;
      consistent with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Acute Stress Disorder and many parents&#xD;
      have depression that lasts longer than a month. Skin-to-skin care offers many benefits to the&#xD;
      mother and the infant including reduction of maternal stress. However, it has been observed&#xD;
      that mothers giving skin-to-skin care for preterm infants in an NICU environment focus on the&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory monitoring and its alarms instead of focusing on the baby and &quot;being in the&#xD;
      moment&quot;. There have also been other challenges noted with maternal sleep while providing&#xD;
      skin-to-skin and parental distraction on hand-held devices while providing skin-to-skin.&#xD;
      Mindfulness offers a way to focus on being in the moment and accepting the present moment in&#xD;
      a non-judgmental and compassionate manner. Mindfulness has been shown to reduce stress in&#xD;
      parents of babies admitted to NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, they are no studies looking at Mindfulness during skin-to-skin care. This study will&#xD;
      explore the feasibility and acceptability of teaching mindfulness skills to mothers providing&#xD;
      skin-to-skin care and studying its effects on maternal stress and distraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves providing Mindfulness-based strategies during skin-to-skin care to NICU&#xD;
      mothers for four consecutive weeks. Participants will be enrolled through informed consent.&#xD;
      All participants will be given pre and post participation questionnaires to examine the&#xD;
      impact of the sessions on stress reduction, mental wellness and mindfulness quotient. The&#xD;
      participants will also be encouraged to maintain a weekly kangaroo care log. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to fill out an acceptability form at the end of the 4 weeks. The data will be&#xD;
      analyzed to study the effect of mindfulness on stress reduction and mental wellness. The&#xD;
      study will also help understand the uptake and acceptance of such a course by NICU mothers.&#xD;
      The results of this study will lead to a future randomized controlled trial looking at the&#xD;
      impact of mindfulness practise during skin-to-skin care on parental stress reduction.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) was developed to complement neonatal care for premature and low&#xD;
      birth weight infants in areas where there were fewer resources. During KMC, a baby is&#xD;
      positioned in skin-to-skin contact with the mother's (or father's) chest and each session may&#xD;
      last for 30 minutes to a few hours or longer as tolerated. A recent meta-analysis concluded&#xD;
      that KMC resulted in better thermal regulation, physiologic stability, enhance breastfeeding&#xD;
      and also reduced mortality and infection. KMC has also been shown to improve mother-infant&#xD;
      attachment and reduced maternal stress. KMC is widely practiced across the world.&#xD;
      Skin-to-Skin care has also been identified with certain challenges and concerns, especially&#xD;
      in the immediate neonatal period. There are several instances of the sudden unexpected&#xD;
      postnatal collapse of babies reported. In most instances, these episodes were associated with&#xD;
      inadequate standardization in selecting mother-baby dyads. There is a strong association with&#xD;
      the baby's position, maternal sleep while KMC and inadequate monitoring during KMC. Maternal&#xD;
      and neonatal fall while giving KMC has also reported as a concern especially associated with&#xD;
      maternal sleep while providing KMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KMC in a NICU environment has its own challenges with barriers identified in a recent&#xD;
      systematic review including, staffing issues, inadequate training available, difficulties in&#xD;
      transferring babies for KMC while attached to infusion pumps and ventilators, stress among&#xD;
      caregivers and families. It has also been observed that mothers giving KMC for preterm&#xD;
      infants in a NICU environment focus on the cardiorespiratory monitoring and its alarms&#xD;
      instead of focusing on the baby and &quot;being in the moment&quot;. There have also been other&#xD;
      challenges noted with maternal sleep while providing KMC and parental distraction on&#xD;
      hand-held devices while providing KMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of babies admitted to the NICU undergo a lot of stress. A systematic review of the&#xD;
      parental experience of having an infant in the NICU showed that parents experience anxiety&#xD;
      and stress. Symptoms of acute stress disorder in 40% of mothers&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-10 days after the birth of the premature infant has been reported in a prospective&#xD;
      observational study conducted here at the Stollery Children Hospital, Edmonton. Another study&#xD;
      evaluated symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and found that 51% of mothers and&#xD;
      33% of fathers screened positive for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness offers a way to focus on being in the moment and accepting the present moment in&#xD;
      a non-judgemental and compassionate manner. Mindfulness has been shown to reduce stress in&#xD;
      parents of babies admitted to NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is planned to explore the opportunity of teaching Mindfulness skills to&#xD;
      mothers providing KMC and studying its effects on maternal stress and distraction. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, there are no scientific studies that evaluated mindfulness during kangaroo care or&#xD;
      skin-to-skin care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the feasibility and acceptability of practicing Mindfulness while giving Kangaroo&#xD;
      mother care - &quot;Mindful Kangaroo care&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore potential benefits of Mindful Kangaroo care, such as stress reduction, change in&#xD;
      mindfulness state, variation in screening for depression and anxiety and overall satisfaction&#xD;
      with this practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a non-blinded, prospective, observational pilot randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum mothers whose baby is receiving care at the Stollery Children Hospital NICU, Royal&#xD;
      Alexandra site, are eligible to enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers would be eligible to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) if they speak, read and write English, b) if their baby is anticipated to require a NICU&#xD;
      stay of at least 4 weeks following recruitment, c) if the baby's medical condition allows for&#xD;
      skin-to-skin care at recruitment, d) if the mother is available to do regular kangaroo care&#xD;
      during the next 4 weeks after recruitment and if the mother is agreeable to receive some&#xD;
      teaching for 30-45 minutes weekly during those four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers whose baby is experiencing imminent risk of death at recruitment will be excluded.&#xD;
      Mothers who reported current mental illness issues, current or prior substance&#xD;
      abuse/addiction will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit 30 participants, 15 in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once recruited, mothers will be randomized into the mindful kangaroo care intervention group&#xD;
      or into the no intervention kangaroo care group. To ensure prior experience with skin-to-skin&#xD;
      care, data collection in both groups will begin after the mother has had at least two&#xD;
      skin-to-skin experiences with her baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindful Kangaroo Care Group (MKCG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All research team members are mindfulness practitioners and/or coaches. Some of the&#xD;
      researchers would instruct and support weekly, one-on-one, all mothers in their mindfulness&#xD;
      practices over a period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MKCG will involve four face-to-face direct coaching on Mindfulness techniques at weekly&#xD;
      intervals. The following will be the broad theme of each coaching session&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 - On the first encounter, the mothers will learn how to practice an introductory&#xD;
      mindfulness technique to develop the awareness of any sensations felt in the body while&#xD;
      holding their baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2 - On the second encounter, the mothers will learn how to practice a second mindfulness&#xD;
      technique to create positive feelings in the body while holding their baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the third and fourth weekly encounters, the mothers will have a chance to ask their&#xD;
      questions and explore further both mindfulness techniques as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group (CG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care will be offered to all mothers in the control group which includes kangaroo&#xD;
      care but does not involve any mindfulness practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following instruments will be given for the mothers to complete to study the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and effect on stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis will not be done because of the pilot study nature; a goal of recruiting a&#xD;
      convenience sample of 30 mothers is set. The 30 possible participants will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio (15 participants to each group) at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General Demographics Form: A researcher created maternal demographic data form (age,&#xD;
           educational level, number of gestations, parity, prior experience with kangaroo care&#xD;
           with other children, history of depression/anxiety, gestational age at baby's birth,&#xD;
           birth weight, delivery type and infant age at first skin-to-skin experience) to be&#xD;
           completed by the mother at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kangaroo care log: Document recording timing and duration of kangaroo care. Document&#xD;
           whether or not the intervention (mindfulness) is practiced using a single-item, 5-point&#xD;
           Likert scale (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of kangaroo care&quot;). Document how long they used&#xD;
           their phones, talk to someone and slept off while doing KMC using the same scale.&#xD;
           Document satisfaction with Kangaroo Care for each session using a single-item, 5-point&#xD;
           Likert scale (&quot;Very dissatisfied&quot; to &quot;Very satisfied&quot;) measuring mother satisfaction&#xD;
           with kangaroo care and a space to write any comments. Log to be completed by the mother&#xD;
           weekly throughout the study time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mindfulness scale: Toronto Mindfulness Scale as described above to be completed by the&#xD;
           mother once at enrollment and at the end of the four weeks. An option will be added to&#xD;
           allow the participant to express that she does not understand the statement on the&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress scale: Neonatal Unit Parental Stressor Scale as described above, to be completed&#xD;
           by the mother once at enrollment and at the end of the four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression and Anxiety scale: Patient Health Questionnaire 4, as described above, to be&#xD;
           completed by the mother once at enrollment and at the end of the four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility form: A researcher created a data form to evaluate the recruitment&#xD;
           capability, the data collection procedures and outcome measures, the resources and&#xD;
           ability to manage and implement the study and intervention, to be completed by the&#xD;
           investigators throughout the study time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability form: A researcher created a 3-point Likert scale (&quot;unacceptable&quot; to&#xD;
           &quot;acceptable&quot;) measuring mother acceptability to the different instruments (demographic&#xD;
           form and the outcome scales) and acceptability to the intervention, to be completed by&#xD;
           the mother at the end of the four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be calculated to summarize sample characteristics and will be&#xD;
      compared between groups. Appropriate statistical tests (independent and paired t-tests,&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U tests and χ2 tests) will be used to examine for&#xD;
      differences between study group demographics, for differences between groups independent&#xD;
      study variables (parent stress score, mindfulness score), and for within-group changes in&#xD;
      both scores from before to after the intervention. Given our small sample size, we are&#xD;
      primarily interested in exploring the direction of any effects. Feasibility data will be&#xD;
      analyzed by descriptive statistics where appropriate and qualitatively where appropriate.&#xD;
      Acceptability data will be evaluated using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk is minimal. Mindfulness practice trains the brain to develop attention skills. There&#xD;
      might be challenges that may arise during mindfulness meditation. Those challenges are&#xD;
      usually the same that arise during normal daily life. When they occur during mindfulness,&#xD;
      they become opportunities to develop insight. Should a mother had an overwhelming experience,&#xD;
      the people offering mindfulness instructions to her would be able to help her. Moreover, the&#xD;
      social workers on our unit are trained to respond to acute distress, they are aware of this&#xD;
      research project and are willing to support the mothers as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may or may not be a direct benefit to the mothers from taking part in this study. Some&#xD;
      people experience less stress, less anxiety, less intrusive thoughts, less confusion or less&#xD;
      foggy mind with a mindfulness practice. Some people experience more satisfaction, more&#xD;
      fulfilment, or they become more aware of their emotions, more aware of their thinking&#xD;
      process, more presence in their interactions and relationships. The information that we will&#xD;
      gather may improve the care of other mothers.&#xD;
