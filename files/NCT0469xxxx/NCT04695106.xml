  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 25% of patients referred for diagnostic coronary angiography and percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) suffer from non-valvular&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF). In this particular setting, balancing between the prevention of&#xD;
      thrombosis and the risk of bleeding remains challenging. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) prevents&#xD;
      stroke and systemic embolism, but has not been shown to prevent stent thrombosis (ST). Dual&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) reduces the incidence of recurrent ischemic events and ST, but is&#xD;
      less effective in reducing the incidence of cardioembolic stroke associated with AF. A common&#xD;
      guideline-supported practice is to combine three drugs (OAC, aspirin and clopidogrel) in a&#xD;
      triple therapy, which is associated with high annual risk (up to 25%) of major bleeding.&#xD;
      Thus, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to maintain the efficacy while improving&#xD;
      the safety of treatment in patients with AF and ACS undergoing PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, non-inferiority trial. 2230&#xD;
      patients with non-valvular AF that had undergone successful PCI due to an ACS within the&#xD;
      previous 72 hours will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive one of the two treatments: dual&#xD;
      therapy with dabigatran (150 mg twice daily or 110 mg twice daily) and ticagrelor (90 mg&#xD;
      twice daily for 1 month, followed by 60 mg twice daily up to 12 months), or standard therapy&#xD;
      according to current guidelines triple therapy with dabigatran (150 mg b.i.d. or 110 mg&#xD;
      b.i.d.) plus clopidogrel (75 mg o.d.) plus aspirin (75 mg o.d.) followed by double therapy&#xD;
      depending on the bleeding and ischaemic risk. Study treatment will be continued for 12&#xD;
      months. The primary study end-point is the first major or clinically relevant non-major&#xD;
      bleeding event (per ISTH), in a time-to-event analysis. The main secondary end-point is a&#xD;
      composite efficacy end-point of thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or&#xD;
      systemic embolism), death, or unplanned revascularization (PCI or coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting) at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that dual antithrombotic therapy including reduced dose ticagrelor and dabigatran&#xD;
      is at least non-inferior regarding bleeding risk and ischaemic protection, compared to the&#xD;
      standard triple therapy in patients with AF and after ACS, treated with PCI.&#xD;

      Health problem More than 25% of patients referred for diagnostic coronary angiography and&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) suffer from&#xD;
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). In this particular setting, balancing between the&#xD;
      prevention of thrombosis and the risk of bleeding remains challenging. Oral anticoagulation&#xD;
      (OAC) prevents stroke and systemic embolism but does not prevent stent thrombosis. Dual&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) reduces the incidence of recurrent ischemic events and stent&#xD;
      thrombosis but is less effective in reducing the incidence of cardioembolic stroke associated&#xD;
      with AF. A common guideline-supported practice is to combine all three drugs (OAC, aspirin,&#xD;
      and clopidogrel) in triple therapy, but this approach remains an expert opinion. Moreover,&#xD;
      triple therapy is associated with a high annual risk (up to 25%) of major bleeding. Thus, new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to maintain efficacy while improving treatment&#xD;
      safety in patients with AF and ACS undergoing PCI. The investigators hypothesize that dual&#xD;
      antithrombotic therapy, including reduced dose ticagrelor (study group, n=1115), is&#xD;
      non-inferior regarding bleeding risk and ischaemic protection to the standard triple therapy&#xD;
      (control group, n=1115) in patients with AF and treated with PCI due to ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study's target population is male and female patients aged ≥18 years&#xD;
      with non-valvular AF that underwent a successful PCI due to an ACS. AF may be paroxysmal,&#xD;
      persistent or permanent but must not be secondary to a reversible disorder such as myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, pulmonary embolism, recent surgery, pericarditis, or thyrotoxicosis. ACS may be&#xD;
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), or unstable angina (UA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint,&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial. Within 72 hours post PCI, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive one of the two treatments: dual therapy with ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily for one&#xD;
      month, followed by 60 mg twice daily up to 12 months) plus dabigatran (150 mg twice daily or&#xD;
      110 mg twice daily; standard of care) or triple therapy with clopidogrel (75 mg once daily)&#xD;
      plus aspirin (75 mg once daily) plus dabigatran (150 mg twice daily or 110 mg twice daily),&#xD;
      according to current guidelines. Study treatment will be continued for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints The primary study endpoint is the first major or clinically relevant non-major&#xD;
      bleeding event, as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH),&#xD;
      in a time-to-event analysis. The main secondary endpoint is a composite efficacy endpoint of&#xD;
      thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism), death, or&#xD;
      unplanned revascularization (PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The investigators expect that the off-label regimen of dual antithrombotic&#xD;
      therapy, including reduced dose ticagrelor, is at least non-inferior regarding bleeding risk&#xD;
      and ischaemic protection, to the standard triple therapy in patients with AF and after ACS,&#xD;
      treated with PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion The investigators propose a new off-label treatment regimen which is reduced dose&#xD;
      ticagrelor in patients with AF and ACS. The most scientifically valuable points of the&#xD;
      proposed project are the first-ever (i) attempt to administer the off-label potent P2Y12&#xD;
      inhibitor (ticagrelor) as a part of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with AF and ACS and&#xD;
      (ii) evaluation of the reduced dose of ticagrelor in the setting of ACS. The three most&#xD;
      innovative aspects are: (i) new treatment regimen with a reduced ticagrelor dose in ACS&#xD;
      setting, (ii) possibility to introduce the polypill containing ticagrelor and dabigatran to&#xD;
      the Polish market, and (iii) potential manufacture of the polypill containing various doses&#xD;
      of ticagrelor and dabigatran, depending on the patient's individual ischaemic and bleeding&#xD;
      risk. If successful, the proposed study will answer the burning clinical question about the&#xD;
      optimal treatment strategy in patients with AF and ACS.&#xD;

    <description>In the control group, aspirin and clopidogrel will be continued depending on the diagnosis (STEMI or NSTE-ACS) and bleeding risk. In patients with STEMI, aspirin will be discontinued after 1-6 months, according to a balance between the estimated risk of recurrent coronary events and bleeding. In patients at high bleeding risk aspirin will be discontinued after 1 month. Subsequently, all patients will be treated with clopidogrel and dabigatran up to 12 months. In the NSTE-ACS group, aspirin will be used up to 1 week (in-hospital period), extendable up to one month in patients at high ischaemic risk. Dual therapy will be continued up to 12 months with the possibility of shortening for patients at high bleeding risk.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Contraindications, in the Investigator's opinion to dabigatran, ticagrelor,&#xD;
             clopidogrel, or aspirin;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug or device within the past&#xD;
             30 days preceding the screening visit (patients participating in an observational&#xD;
             study only will not be excluded);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not willing or able to comply with the protocol requirements or&#xD;
             considered unreliable by the Investigator concerning the requirements for follow-up&#xD;
             during the study and/or compliance with study drug administration, who have a life&#xD;
             expectancy less than the expected duration of the trial due to concomitant disease, or&#xD;
             who have any condition which in the opinion of the Investigator, would not allow safe&#xD;
             participation in the study (e.g., drug addiction, alcohol abuse).&#xD;
