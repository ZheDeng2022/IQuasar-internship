    <textblock>
      RCT in which 28 children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) were enrolled and&#xD;
      equally distributed into two groups; Participants in control group were treated with&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy while experimental were given conventional physical therapy in&#xD;
      addition to trampoline exercises. Assessment was at 0, 4 and 8 week using developmental&#xD;
      coordination disorder questionnaire (DCDQ), pediatric balance scale (PBS) and peads quality&#xD;
      of life (PQL)&#xD;
