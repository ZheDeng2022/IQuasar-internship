  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) have a considerably lower life expectancy as compared with&#xD;
      the general population, primarily due to a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. KTR&#xD;
      often develop an unfavourable cardio-metabolic risk profile characterized by weight gain,&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM). In general, nutrition&#xD;
      plays a key role in both the prevention and treatment of these cardio-metabolic derangements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in KTR most RCT's with a dietary intervention, failed to show significant&#xD;
      improvement in cardio-metabolic health. This at least questions the efficacy of the diets of&#xD;
      these intervention, which relied on general or diabetes guidelines, after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. KTR not only face a high cardio-metabolic risk, but also have a high risk&#xD;
      for malnutrition and muscle mass depletion. More knowledge is required to determine the&#xD;
      optimal diet and macronutrient composition for improvement of the cardio-metabolic risk&#xD;
      factors in the context of the high malnutrition risk. In this regard, observational studies&#xD;
      point towards the needs for a higher protein intake for better patient outcomes. Therefore,&#xD;
      in this study, the investigators will examine if a high-protein, carbohydrate-reduced diet is&#xD;
      more effective than a diet in line with the Dutch Dietary Guidelines for improvement of&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic risk factors and for improvement of the body composition in KTR.&#xD;
