  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the effectiveness and safety of the use of lidocaine infusion&#xD;
      in multimodal analgesic management. A group of patients undergoing vascular surgery performed&#xD;
      with the classic technique on the aorta - with the opening of the abdominal cavity will be&#xD;
      enrolled. The population of patients qualified for this type of vascular surgery is usually&#xD;
      burdened with multiple diseases, mainly risk factors or cardiovascular diseases, which,&#xD;
      combined with hemodynamic fluctuations, large fluid shifts (including bleeding) and stress&#xD;
      for the body, affects the risk of serious cardiological complications, which in this group&#xD;
      exceeds 5% and is the highest, according to the ESC / ESA (European Society of Cardiology /&#xD;
      European Society of Anesthesiology) classification from 2014. Proper postoperative pain&#xD;
      control is therefore becoming one of the key pillars of postoperative care in this group of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the numerous disease burden of patients and the operational specifics, the use of&#xD;
      multimodal therapy in the management of pain is of particular importance, as the use of high&#xD;
      doses of opioids improves hemodynamic stability, but at the same time affects the occurrence&#xD;
      of side effects - mainly excessive sedation, respiratory disorders, hypoventilation and,&#xD;
      consequently, for hypoxia of the heart muscle. The risk of myocardial injury in non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery (MINS) is significant in the light of the available literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine used in intravenous infusion is one of the recommended components of&#xD;
      multidirectional analgesia. Its adjuvant properties make it possible to reduce the amount of&#xD;
      opioid drugs used, and thus - to reduce the frequency of their side effects. The high&#xD;
      effectiveness of such a procedure has been proven in numerous experimental and&#xD;
      epidemiological studies. Due to the low frequency of side effects associated with its use,&#xD;
      the therapy has a strong recommendation for use in relieving perioperative pain. The analysis&#xD;
      of the literature on the subject shows that there is little data assessing effectiveness of&#xD;
      lidocaine infusion in relation to the group of patients after surgery on the abdominal aorta.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All enrolled participants will be randomized, using random-number generator, to two groups -&#xD;
      group A (intervention - perioperative continuous infusion of lidocaine) and group B (without&#xD;
      intervention - perioperative continuous infusion of placebo). Study is designed as&#xD;
      double-blinded: neither patients nor perioperative care givers (surgeons, anesthetists,&#xD;
      nurses) will be aware to which group a patient has been assigned. A coordinator of&#xD;
      randomization process will be responsible to ask an anesthetist or a nurse (a person not&#xD;
      taking part in participant's perioperative care) to prepare a set containing respectively: 40&#xD;
      ml of 1% lidocaine or 40 ml of 0,9% NaCl (placebo) before surgery. Syringes will be labeled&#xD;
      &quot;Tested Drug&quot;. All data regarding patient's assignment to the respective groups will be&#xD;
      available only to the coordinator of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be performed by anesthetist experienced in vascular surgery. Every patient&#xD;
      will be premedicated with midazolam (3,75mg-15 mg orally), adjusted to his/her body weight.&#xD;
      Premedication efficacy will be assessed before induction using RASS scale (Richmond&#xD;
      Agitation-Sedation Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During induction of anaesthesia: fentanyl (0,01-0,02 mg / kg i.v.), propofol (1-2 mg/kg&#xD;
      i.v.), atrakurium (0,5 mg/kg i.v.) will be given. Depth of anaesthesia will be monitored with&#xD;
      BIS index (bi-spectral index) or entropy till the emergence. Patients scoring above 2 points&#xD;
      in APFEL scale will receive antiemetic drug - ondansetron 8 mg i.v..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring will consist of: non-invasive (NIBP) or invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring (IBP), anesthetic agent concentration monitoring (MAC, minimal alveolar&#xD;
      concentration), pulse oximetry (SpO2), capnometry (etCO2) and anesthetic depth monitoring as&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During co-induction mechanical ventilation will be performed in CMV mode (controlled&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation). Breathing frequency will be adjusted to etCO2 values. Tidal volume&#xD;
      will be set on 6-8 ml/ kg IBW (ideal body weight) and positive end-expiratory pressure set on&#xD;
      5 cm H2O. Fresh gases flow mixture will be adjusted according to SpO2 92-100% values. After&#xD;
      induction, desflurane will be used in concentrations maintaining depth of anaesthesia between&#xD;
      40-60 BIS/entropy values. In case of BIS/entropy values out of the range during anesthesia,&#xD;
      all the events and duration time will be recorded. After general anesthesia mean anesthetic&#xD;
      concentration will be counted and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants apart from medication used to perform general anaesthesia will receive 1g of&#xD;
      paracetamol i.v. before induction as preemptive analgesia and intravenous bolus of the&#xD;
      &quot;tested drug&quot; in the volume of 0,15 ml/kg IBW given over 1-2 minutes, followed by continuous&#xD;
      infusion of &quot;tested drug&quot; with ratio of 0,2 ml/kg IBW/h intraoperatively. Postoperatively&#xD;
      infusion will be continued with ratio 0,1ml/kg IBW/h for the next 24 hours. According to&#xD;
      patient's assignment syringe &quot; tested drug&quot; will contain 1% lidocaine in group A or normal&#xD;
      saline in group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Titrated doses of 0,05 mg of fentanyl i.v. will be administered as intraoperative analgesic&#xD;
      medication. Final dose of fentanyl used during general anaesthesia will be recorded and then&#xD;
      changed to the equivalent dose of morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measurements will be taken every 5 minutes to assess hemodynamic stability.&#xD;
      Initial value of patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in&#xD;
      the operating theater will be recorded. SBP within the range from 100 to 160 mmHg and MAP &gt;70&#xD;
      mmHg will be regarded as a target value (TV). In case of sudden increase in BP or HR within&#xD;
      TV values associated with painful stimulation from operating field (assessed by experienced&#xD;
      anesthetist), titrated dose of fentanyl will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain hemodynamic stability:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In case of decrease in BP or MAP below the TV limit: fluid challenge iv with balanced&#xD;
           crystalloids will be commenced, especially in case of pulseoximetry or IBP wave&#xD;
           variation. If the patient is not responding to fluid challenge, ephedrine in titrated&#xD;
           doses of 5-10 mg will be given intravenously to maximal dose of 25 mg. If still&#xD;
           ineffective, continues infusion of noradrenaline will be commenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In case of increase SBP above the limit: if painful response present, i.v. bolus of&#xD;
           fentanyl in titrated doses will be given to maximal dose of 0,2 mg to achieve BP&#xD;
           decrease to the TV. If ineffective, start re-assessment: painful stimulation present -&#xD;
           FNT iv, no painful stimulation - urapidyl in titrated doses of 5 mg iv administered to&#xD;
           the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In case of increase in SBP or MAP above the limit associated with the clamping of aorta,&#xD;
           urapidyl can be given in titrated doses as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final decision regarding maintenance of hemodynamic stability in association with clinical&#xD;
      context will be up to the anesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of hemodynamic interventions, BP values, total time out of the range and&#xD;
      intraoperative fluid therapy (total amount and type of fluids, blood products), total dose of&#xD;
      vasoactive medication will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care After the surgery, patients will be transferred to post surgical&#xD;
      high-dependency unit (HDU). Proper analgesic treatment will be continued. Infusion of &quot;tested&#xD;
      drug&quot; will be stopped 24 hours after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale will be used to assess efficiency of analgesic treatment every 4 hours,&#xD;
      with target value &lt;4 points. Analgesia in postoperative period will consist of: continues&#xD;
      infusion of opiate (morphine) rate adjusted according to titration method, metamizole 2,5g&#xD;
      i.v. BD and continues infusion of &quot;tested drug&quot; (1% lidocaine or normal saline according to&#xD;
      the assignment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of pain exceeding 4 points in VAS scale, patient will receive bolus of 3 mg of&#xD;
      morphine i.v., with reassessment after 15 minutes. If no improvement is obtained, second&#xD;
      bolus of 3 mg of morphine i.v. will be administered followed by increase in the morphine&#xD;
      infusion rate by 1 mg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any side effects in postoperative period especially associated with analgesic medication,&#xD;
      will be recorded (according to Summary Product Characteristics, 24 hours observation),&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications (death related to cardiovascular problems, non-fatal acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome; 30 days observation), incidence of post-operative delirium (POD,&#xD;
      assessment with CAM or CAM-ICU scale, Confusion Assessment Method or Confusion Assessment&#xD;
      Method in Intensive care Unit, 24 hour observation) Statistical analysis Statistical analysis&#xD;
      will be performed with the use of the StatsDirect 3.1 program. The nature of the variables is&#xD;
      verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test and the evaluation of quantile-quantile charts.&#xD;
      Quantitative variables will be presented as arithmetic mean and standard deviation (SD) or&#xD;
      median and interquartile range (IQR, interquartilerange). Qualitative variables are presented&#xD;
      in the form of absolute values and percentage. The assessment of differences between the&#xD;
      groups for quantitative variables will be performed using the Student's t-test with the&#xD;
      variance assessment or the Mann-Whitney U test. For qualitative variables, contingency tables&#xD;
      and a chi-square test will be used. The criterion of statistical significance is set at&#xD;
      p˂0,05.&#xD;
