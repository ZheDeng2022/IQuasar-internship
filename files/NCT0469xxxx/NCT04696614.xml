  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is the most effective way on reducing visceral adipose tissue (VAT), which is&#xD;
      strongly linked with obesity to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance.&#xD;
      However, the current exercise dosage for reducing VAT cannot be accurately quantified. The&#xD;
      aims of this study are to develop and test the optimal exercise dosage and sequence for&#xD;
      reducing VAT in overweight and obese community residents. Purposive sampling will be used to&#xD;
      enroll at least 206 participants aged 40-65 years and body fat more than 30% without diet&#xD;
      control from 2 community centers in southern Taiwan. The project will use the sequential&#xD;
      multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design to conduct a 16-week 2-stage (each for&#xD;
      8-weeks) adaptive exercise intervention for community residents. In the first stage,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into groups performing 8 weeks either moderate intensity of&#xD;
      aerobic exercise or interval training 3 times per week. Participants whose VAT does not&#xD;
      decrease by over 3%, measured using a body composition analyzer, compared with the baseline&#xD;
      will be 1:1 rerandomized into groups with aerobic exercise combined with resistance exercise&#xD;
      or received the exchange of first stage treatment (interval training or aerobic exercise) in&#xD;
      the second stage. Those with substantial response to the first-stage intervention (VAT&#xD;
      reduction of more than 3%) will continue to receive the same exercise treatment until 16&#xD;
      weeks. Linear mixed model, weighted and replicated regression will be used to identify the&#xD;
      optimal sequence of exercises for the greatest reduction in VAT. The findings can assist&#xD;
      clinical health workers to develop exercise prescriptions for effectively reducing VAT, and&#xD;
      help community residents reduce VAT through exercise to achieve the health promotion.&#xD;
