  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient non-adherence to treatment recommendations is common and decreases the effectiveness&#xD;
      of Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) treatment. Improving adherence towards medication intake,&#xD;
      physical activity, symptom monitoring/management might prolong life, alleviates symptoms,&#xD;
      increases quality of life, and reduces hospital admissions. The Adherence Improving&#xD;
      self-management Strategy (AIMS) is a nurse delivered intervention, integrated in routine&#xD;
      clinical care, aiming to better support patients in their treatment. AIMS has previously been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be (cost) effective amongst HIV patients. Based on the literature and&#xD;
      advisory boards with healthcare providers and CHF patients, AIMS is adapted to CHF&#xD;
      (AIMS-CHF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the AIMS intervention on adherence&#xD;
      regarding medication, physical activity, and symptom management compared to&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual in patients with chronic heart failure.&#xD;

      ◦Quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry procedures, including any&#xD;
      plans for site monitoring and auditing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the primary outcome medication adherence will be monitored electronically and data&#xD;
      will be downloaded during regular clinic visits and automatically downloaded to a protected&#xD;
      study server. The quality of electronically monitored medication adherence data depends on&#xD;
      whether the electronic monitors are used adequately. The research team will monitor adequate&#xD;
      use of these electronic monitors at the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for secondary outcomes will be collected through questionnaires and the research team&#xD;
      will follow-up on participants not completing those. Statistical analysis plans will be&#xD;
      uploaded before data collection is completed and the database is accessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ◦Data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or&#xD;
      consistency with other data fields in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of electronically monitored medication adherence data depends on whether the&#xD;
      electronic monitors are used adequately. At study exit, data will be discussed with all&#xD;
      patients. When electronic monitoring data is completely missing or suggests very low&#xD;
      adherence (depending on the sample distributions, but this could be e.g., &lt;50% of doses&#xD;
      taken) in the presence of well-controlled symptoms; and the participant self-reports poor use&#xD;
      of the electronic monitor, then a sensitivity analysis will be conducted with those&#xD;
      electronic monitoring data replaced by the participants' self-reported adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity, will be self-reported. The validity of this self-report will be examined&#xD;
      against electronic physical activity measures used by participants in the treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ◦Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of&#xD;
      registry data by comparing the data to external data sources (for example, medical records,&#xD;
      paper or electronic case report forms, or interactive voice response systems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      ◦Data dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of each variable used by the registry,&#xD;
      including the source of the variable, coding information if used (for example, World Health&#xD;
      Organization Drug Dictionary, MedDRA), and normal ranges if relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      ◦Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities, such&#xD;
      as patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for&#xD;
      adverse events, and change management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment Heart failure patients in outpatient clinic will be approached by the&#xD;
      health care professional to inform them about the study and subsequently an information&#xD;
      letter will be handed over. This letter contains information concerning the nature, purpose&#xD;
      and duration of the study as well as possible objections, risks of participation and the&#xD;
      possibility to withdrawal at any time without the need to specify the reason. Subsequently,&#xD;
      the treating physician, or the researcher, will explain all study procedures and answer any&#xD;
      questions. In case the patient is willing to participate and deemed eligible, he/she is asked&#xD;
      to sign the informed consent form, preferably in presence of their partner, family member or&#xD;
      friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be handled confidentially and will not be distributed to third parties. After&#xD;
      informed consent, each participant will be given a unique code consisting of letters (the&#xD;
      code name of the study) and a number (e.g. 001). The key linking to the patient identity will&#xD;
      be stored in a secured file and only the involved investigators will have access to this key.&#xD;
      Personal data will be handled in accordance with the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act. The&#xD;
      research data will be stored for 15 years after finalisation of the project. The data&#xD;
      required for the trail will be collected and stored in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)&#xD;
      using Castor (Castor EDC 2019.1.15 or further, Ciwit B.V., The Netherlands) and afterwards&#xD;
      exported to SPSS statistics 25 or R for the analyses. Only the involved investigators will&#xD;
      have unrestricted access to all pseudonymized data. Patients in the intervention group will&#xD;
      monitor their behaviour. For medication adherence applies each time they open the MEMS bottle&#xD;
      or push the button the date will be registered. The MEMS cap is ISO 9001 certified,&#xD;
      CE-marked, HIPPA compatible, compliant with FDA 21 CFR part 11 and GDPR compliant. Stored&#xD;
      information can be transferred at any time through the MEMS Reader to the MEMS adherence&#xD;
      software for immediate analysis and interpretation. The data transmission can be done using a&#xD;
      dedicated MEMS USB NFC reader. The data is securely transferred and stored encrypted on&#xD;
      AARDEX servers using end-to-end encryption. Data storage is secured by continuous backups and&#xD;
      data replication. The data is only accessible when logging in with the correct credentials&#xD;
      (login/email and password), and only be accessible for the HCP (direct feedback) and the&#xD;
      researcher (data analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the activity tracker applies the following; the data from the activity tracker is in the&#xD;
      possession of the patient itself, and will share these data with the HCP. During wear-time,&#xD;
      the activity tracker continuously collects data about the stepping, time of the patient. Data&#xD;
      collection and storage of the activity tracker is GDPR compliant and data is stored on secure&#xD;
      servers protected with pseudonymization and encryption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study related correspondence, signed Informed Consent forms, and source documents are to be&#xD;
      maintained by the study site and archived in a locked cabinet for a minimum of 15 years after&#xD;
      the end of this study. Source data will be entered at worksheets in the eCRF and afterwards&#xD;
      exported to SPSS statistics 25 or R for the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years&#xD;
           necessary to demonstrate an effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
           136 patients will be recruited (based on a Sample size calculation: effect size: 0.5223;&#xD;
           1-β=0.80; α=0.05, and assuming a 15% dropout).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plan for missing data to address situations where variables are reported as missing,&#xD;
           unavailable, non-reported, uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data&#xD;
           inconsistency or out-of-range results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the type of missingness (e.g., at random, completely at random) appropriate data&#xD;
      imputation procedures will be used if no alternative data sources for the missing datapoint&#xD;
      is available&#xD;
&#xD;
      ◦Statistical analysis plan describing the analytical principles and statistical techniques to&#xD;
      be employed in order to address the primary and secondary objectives, as specified in the&#xD;
      study protocol or plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variable Linear mixed-effects models will be used to assess the effects of&#xD;
      AIMS-HF versus treatment-as-usual on dosing adherence measured with MEMS. Baseline dosing&#xD;
      adherence will be used as covariate and intervention assignment as the treatment variable&#xD;
      (0/1). Mean dosing compliance will be calculated per 3-month period and included as repeated&#xD;
      time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameter(s) Regression analyses will be conducted for the secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (questionnaires), where the baseline value of the dependent variables and the treatment&#xD;
      variable (0/1) are included as the predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary study parameter(s) To explore the effects on event-free survival (time to the first&#xD;
      event) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be conducted.&#xD;

    <description>The AIMS intervention is a conversation between a patient and a trained nurse, imbedded in the usual care. It consists of structured modules with visual materials, developed based on a sound understanding of the factors that drive non-adherence and potent behaviour change techniques to modify those. These modules aim to enhance patient knowledge, motivation, self-efficacy, and skills for self-managing their treatment. As part of the intervention, patients use electronic monitors to track their own behaviour, namely a medication and a physical activity monitor. Together with the nurse they examine these results to identify adherence problems and solutions and make a plan.</description>
