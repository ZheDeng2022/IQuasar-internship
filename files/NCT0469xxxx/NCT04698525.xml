    <textblock>
      Migraine is one of the three most disabling diseases worldwide. Constituted by recurrent&#xD;
      episodes of headache, characterized by unilateral location, throbbing character, moderate or&#xD;
      severe intensity, worsening with physical activity, and association with nausea or&#xD;
      photophobia and/or phonophobia. There are two types of drug treatment: abortifacient and&#xD;
      prophylactic. The American Academy of Neurology classifies sodium valproate as level A;&#xD;
      however, some patients do not obtain a satisfactory response rate and/or have adverse&#xD;
      effects. Therefore, the search for new pharmacological treatments continues. In 2015, a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a placebo was carried out to assess Memantine's&#xD;
      efficacy in the prophylactic treatment of migraine without aura, which reported a reduction&#xD;
      of 2.3 migraine attacks per month compared to the placebo group. Memantine could be a new&#xD;
      effective treatment alternative, which is why we will compare the efficacy of Memantine&#xD;
      against sodium valproate as a prophylactic migraine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To compare the efficacy of Memantine at a rate of 20mg divided into two doses&#xD;
      a day against sodium valproate (VPA) at a rate of 1000mg divided into two doses a day&#xD;
      prophylactic treatment of migraine for three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: a prospective controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: Men and women aged 18 to 65 years with a diagnosis at least one year before the&#xD;
      study must present at least 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month and less than 15 days with&#xD;
      headache per month, which should not be receiving prophylactic treatment for migraine and&#xD;
      sign an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is calculated using the normal distribution model, where the recommended sample size is&#xD;
      196 participants. Since a pilot study will be conducted, 10% of the sample size will be taken&#xD;
      to make it representative, a sample size of 20 participants is decided for each group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Migraine is a primary headache, currently one of the three most disabling diseases globally.&#xD;
      It has an annual and lifetime prevalence of 18% and 33% in women, and 6 to 13% in men,&#xD;
      respectively, with a predominance in women (3: 1). The age of onset with the highest&#xD;
      prevalence is between 25 and 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine is described by the International Headache Society (IHS) as recurrent episodes of&#xD;
      headache lasting 4 to 72 hours, characterized by unilateral location, pulsatile character,&#xD;
      moderate or severe intensity, worsening with physical activity, and association with nausea&#xD;
      or photophobia and phonophobia. The IHS also classifies migraine based on the frequency of&#xD;
      attacks: episodic migraine when the headache occurs on less than 15 days a month, and chronic&#xD;
      migraine, when the headache occurs 15 or more days a month for three months and at least&#xD;
      eight days a month with characteristics of migraine headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subtypes of migraine concerning their clinical presentation are migraine with aura and&#xD;
      without aura.4 Up to one-third of patients present migraine aura, with visual symptoms being&#xD;
      the most frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four phases have been identified during a migraine: prodromal phase, aura, headache, and&#xD;
      postdrome. The prodromal phase is characterized by premonitory symptoms hours before the&#xD;
      headache, including difficulty concentrating, irritability, fatigue, repetitive yawning,&#xD;
      stiff neck, and photophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent episodes characterize the aura, lasting from 5min to 60min, with transient&#xD;
      unilateral visual, sensory, or other CNS symptoms that develop progressively, usually precede&#xD;
      headache and symptoms associated with migraine.4 The aura's genesis is activated by the NMDA&#xD;
      (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor and disseminated cortical depression. Disseminated cortical&#xD;
      depression is an extreme depolarization of the cell membranes of the glia and neurons that&#xD;
      produce an alteration of the ionic gradient, an increase in extracellular potassium&#xD;
      concentrations, glutamate release, and a transient increase followed by a decrease in&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain phase in migraine is due to the activation and sensitization of the&#xD;
      trigeminovascular pain pathway, which innervates intracranial structures, including the eye,&#xD;
      the dura mater, large braincases, and the venous sinuses. It has been shown to involve&#xD;
      neuronal presynaptic activation by ID serotonin receptors (5-HT 1D), resulting in the release&#xD;
      of the calcitonin gene (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide&#xD;
      (PACAP-38), which are neuroinflammatory peptides. The post-synaptic effect on the meninges&#xD;
      includes the activation of the arachidonic acid cascade, which conditions inflammation and&#xD;
      vasodilation, stimulates the nociceptive afference of pain first branch of the trigeminal&#xD;
      nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of migraine is clinical and must meet the criteria of the IHS International&#xD;
      Classification of Headaches (ICH-3), which are for migraine without aura:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least five crises that meet criteria B-D. A. Headache episodes are lasting 4 to 72 hours&#xD;
      (untreated or unsuccessfully treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. The headache has at least two of the following four characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unilateral location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pulsatile character.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pain of moderate or severe intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Made worse by or conditions the abandonment of habitual physical activity (e.g., walking&#xD;
           or climbing stairs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. At least one of the following during the headache:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Photophobia and phonophobia. D. No better explanation by another diagnosis of ICHD-III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-pharmacological treatment of migraine goes hand in hand with the pharmacological one;&#xD;
      one is to avoid the triggers of the migraine attacks and carry out the lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications. Pharmacological treatment is divided into acute (administered at the time of&#xD;
      headache) and prophylactic (administered daily to reduce the chances of migraine episodes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of prophylactic treatment is to reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of&#xD;
      migraine attacks, improve the response to acute treatment, improve functionality, and reduce&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Academy of Neurology recommends initiating prophylactic treatment in patients&#xD;
      with migraine with one or more of the following characteristics9&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recurrent migraine, which interferes with the patient's daily life and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frequent headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. That they have an inadequate response or contraindication to abortive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adverse events to abortion treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Uncommon migraine conditions: ophthalmoplegic migraine, basilar migraine, hemiplegic,&#xD;
           prolonged aura, migraine infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IHS defines the response to treatment as a decrease equal to or greater than 50% in the&#xD;
      frequency of migraine attacks compared to the baseline situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Academy of Neurology guideline for the prophylactic drug treatment of episodic&#xD;
      migraine classifies divalproex sodium, valproate sodium (VPA), topiramate, metoprolol&#xD;
      propranolol as level A (Drugs with established efficacy ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valproic acid (2-propylpentaenoic acid) was first synthesized in 1882 as an analog of valeric&#xD;
      acid, naturally found in valerian. Anyone of Valproic acid, sodium valproate, or a mixture of&#xD;
      the two (sodium valproate) has a mechanism of action characterized by increasing or improving&#xD;
      GABA neurotransmission, blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, and T-type calcium channels.&#xD;
      In 2013, Cochrane conducted the review: Valproate for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine&#xD;
      (Linda et al.), where they evaluated ten clinical trials. Two crossover clinical trials for&#xD;
      sodium valproate demonstrated a significant reduction in headache frequency than placebo (MD&#xD;
      -4.31 95% CI -8.32 to -0.30), which shows us in clinical terms an approximate reduction of&#xD;
      four headaches for every 28 days. Jensen 199413 showed that sodium valproate is superior to&#xD;
      placebo (OR 4.67; 95% CI 1.54 - 14.14), suggesting that patients are three times more likely&#xD;
      to present a reduction equal to or greater than 50% in the frequency of headaches compared to&#xD;
      placebo. The recommended dose for migraine headaches is 500-1000mg per day. The most common&#xD;
      adverse effects are asthenia, fatigue, dizziness/vertigo, nausea, tremor, and weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, interest has increased in glutamate receptor antagonists for migraine&#xD;
      prophylaxis, such as memantine. Within the pathophysiology of migraine, glutamate is&#xD;
      implicated in disseminated cortical depression, trigeminal-vascular activation. Other studies&#xD;
      corroborate its role by reporting elevated glutamate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in&#xD;
      patients with chronic migraine in the ictal period and elevated serum levels in migraine&#xD;
      patients. Besides, after experimental stimulation in the dura and the ventral-posteromedial&#xD;
      thalamic nucleus structures, elevated levels of glutamate in the trigeminal-cervical complex&#xD;
      have been evidenced. fifteen&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008 Bigal and colleagues conducted the first open clinical trial, a pilot study to&#xD;
      evaluate memantine's efficacy and safety as a prophylactic treatment in patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with refractory migraine. A sample of 28 participants who had a baseline frequency of&#xD;
      headache days of 21.8 days per month received memantine from 10mg to 20mg per day for three&#xD;
      months. A decrease in the frequency of headache days was obtained to 16.1 (P &lt;0.01).&#xD;
      Therefore, the authors concluded that memantine as a prophylactic treatment is safe and&#xD;
      effective in refractory migraines. In 2015, Noruzzadeh and colleagues conducted the first&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate memantine's efficacy&#xD;
      as a prophylactic treatment of migraine without aura With a sample of 52 participants, 25&#xD;
      with memantine (10 mg/day) and 27 with placebo. The memantine group had a more significant&#xD;
      reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks compared to placebo, which was a difference of&#xD;
      2.3 attacks per month with a P &lt;0.001.14&#xD;
