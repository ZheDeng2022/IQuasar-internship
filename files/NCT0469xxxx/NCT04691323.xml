  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to better understand factors contributing to&#xD;
      variations in hydroxyurea (HU) adherence behavior in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease (SCD). To meet this objective, the researchers will conduct a prospective&#xD;
      cohort study to determine the longitudinal relationship between HU adherence and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) overtime among AYA with SCD. The long-term goal of&#xD;
      this research is to promote medication adherence behavior and improve health outcomes in AYA&#xD;
      with SCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is the most common genetic disorder in the US, affecting about 100,000&#xD;
      Americans, and about 1 in 400 African American live births, incurring annual health care&#xD;
      costs of $335 million. SCD can lead to serious complications including unpredictable,&#xD;
      debilitating pain episodes, cardiopulmonary disease, stroke, and long-term end organ&#xD;
      damage.These complications lead to significant declines in health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQOL) and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs), culminating in early mortality,&#xD;
      particularly among AYA. Hydroxyurea, at present, is the main FDA approved medication for SCD&#xD;
      that reduces morbidity and mortality, improves HRQoL and lowers healthcare&#xD;
      utilization.However, adherence to HU remains suboptimal with only 35-50% of patients&#xD;
      achieving high adherence (â‰¥90%), particularly among AYA with SCD. Low HU adherence has been&#xD;
      associated with worse health outcomes, poor HRQOL and increased healthcare utilization. Low&#xD;
      HU adherence is multifactorial, especially in AYA with other competing priorities and&#xD;
      vulnerability in developmental and psychological factors contributing to adherence behavior.&#xD;
      The specific aim for this study is to determine the longitudinal relationship of HU adherence&#xD;
      behavior to health-related quality of life, barriers to adherence and habit formation among&#xD;
      AYA with SCD.&#xD;
