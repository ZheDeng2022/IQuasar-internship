  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasingly, the period after hospital admission is acknowledged as one of extremely high&#xD;
      risk for suicidal patients. While it might be hoped that hospitalization would address and&#xD;
      resolve suicide risk, a review of international studies shows the risk of suicide is up to&#xD;
      200 times higher among individuals recently discharged from hospitals vs. the general&#xD;
      population. In response, some health care systems use an &quot;urgent care&quot; or &quot;next-day&#xD;
      appointment&quot; (NDA) clinics for follow-up. NDAs serve as short-term crisis intervention at a&#xD;
      specific appointment time and location so patients do not &quot;fall through the cracks&quot; in the&#xD;
      care transition. Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) is a&#xD;
      potentially effective intervention to reduce short term suicidal risk in this transition from&#xD;
      inpatient to outpatient treatment. To this end, this study has the following study aims: (1)&#xD;
      Evaluate whether CAMS for suicidal NDA patients results in less suicidal behavior than TAU,&#xD;
      (2) Evaluate whether CAMS for suicidal NDA patients results in less suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      intent as well as improved mental health markers than TAU, and (3) Evaluate whether CAMS for&#xD;
      suicidal NDA patients is more satisfactory to patients than TAU.&#xD;

      care transition. Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) is a promising&#xD;
      outpatient treatment framework that merits rigorous study as a potentially effective&#xD;
      intervention to reduce short term suicidal risk in the transition from inpatient to&#xD;
      outpatient treatment. Pilot data suggest that CAMS decreases suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      psychological distress while increasing hope, patient satisfaction, and retention more than&#xD;
      NDA treatment as usual (TAU). CAMS in the NDA clinic has the potential to fill three key&#xD;
      targets highlighted in the 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention: (1) prevent&#xD;
      suicidal behavior, (2) increase clinician confidence and willingness to see suicidal&#xD;
      patients, and (3) are sufficiently feasible, trainable, adaptable, and flexible to scale up&#xD;
      across health systems. To this end, this study has the following study aims: (1) Evaluate&#xD;
      whether CAMS for suicidal NDA patients results in less suicidal behavior than TAU, (2)&#xD;
      Evaluate whether CAMS for suicidal NDA patients results in less suicidal ideation and intent&#xD;
      as well as improved mental health markers than TAU, and (3) Evaluate whether CAMS for&#xD;
      suicidal NDA patients is more satisfactory to patients than TAU.&#xD;

    <description>CAMS is a suicide-focused intervention that stabilizes the suicidal patient and identifies, targets, and treats patient-defined &quot;suicidal drivers&quot;-the problems (e.g., trauma, financial issues, relationship loss) that compel a patient to consider suicide. CAMS is theoretically agnostic, patient-centered, and can be used across different suicidal populations and clinical settings.</description>
