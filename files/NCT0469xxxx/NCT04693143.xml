  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral Nutrition (PN) is prescribed to children with a non functioning gut. Timing of&#xD;
      initiation of PN for critically ill children is a hotly issue. Therefore investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine the optimal timing of initiation of PN among these children.This is a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial will be conducted at a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit(PICU) in tertiary care&#xD;
      hospital. 140 participants will be randomized to receive either early or late PN. The 1st&#xD;
      group gives PN on the 1st day of PICU admissions while the 2nd group gives late PN on the 7th&#xD;
      day. Under-nutrition children, early PN will start on the 1st day while late PN begins on 4th&#xD;
      day of admission. The outcomes are assessment of mechanical ventilation duration, PICU length&#xD;
      stay, and mortality.&#xD;

      Participants and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center; open-label randomized controlled trial will be performed at a&#xD;
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in tertiary care hospital . On admission, patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated through history, clinical examination, and investigation.Basic investigations&#xD;
      will include complete blood count, serum electrolytes, blood gas analysis, serum creatinine&#xD;
      and liver function tests. The severity of the clinical condition upon admission will be&#xD;
      determined by calculation of pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) score and&#xD;
      Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) at the end of the first 24 hours. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either early or late parenteral nutrition. Early parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      will be given in the 1st 24 hours of admission while late parenteral nutrition will be&#xD;
      initiated on 7th day of admission. Randomization will be performed by using computer&#xD;
      generated random numbers.The patients and the treating physicians will be not blinded to the&#xD;
      type of parenteral fluids given. For children with moderate/severe under-nutrition, early&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition will start on the 1st day while late parenteral nutrition will on 4th&#xD;
      day of admission. This difference in timing of feeding is based on the fact that malnourished&#xD;
      children have limited energy reserves and insufficient nutrition for 6 days might be too long&#xD;
      a period compared with the case of well-nourished children. Parenteral nutrition consists of&#xD;
      glucose, protein, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus), trace&#xD;
      elements, water soluble vitamins, and amino acid solutions.Lipid emulsions will be given .&#xD;
      The nutritional status of patients will be carefully assessed. The admission weight and&#xD;
      length/height will be recorded and a patient will be deemed to have under-nutrition if weight&#xD;
      for length z-score is ≤ -2 SD. For children &gt; 36 months, weight/age z-score ≤ -2 SD is used ,&#xD;
      instead, to define under-nutrition because measuring the height is difficult for critically&#xD;
      ill children.&#xD;
