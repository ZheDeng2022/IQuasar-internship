  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a study to adapt an evidence-based caregiver training program to&#xD;
      improve access in order to better serve the TSC community. The proposed adapted caregiver&#xD;
      training program is based on a targeted behavioral intervention called JASPER (Joint&#xD;
      attention, symbolic play, engagement, and regulation) that has successfully improved outcomes&#xD;
      in children with ASD. Importantly, JASPER specifically targets two key developmental domains&#xD;
      known to be critical for young children with TSC, social communication and play. Recent work&#xD;
      with JASPER in children with TSC shows promise, but still requires a commitment to regular&#xD;
      in-person sessions. The investigators hope to test an adapted version of the caregiver&#xD;
      training version of JASPER, where the entire training is provided remotely through weekly&#xD;
      teleconferences and video feedback. The investigators goal is to determine if remote&#xD;
      caregiver training can improve social engagement and communication between caregivers and&#xD;
      their child with TSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that by adapting the caregiver training version of JASPER to be&#xD;
      delivered through telehealth methods, the investigators can help more families gain access to&#xD;
      high quality training. There is a tremendous need for high quality early intervention, and&#xD;
      remote caregiver training can give families the skills they need to make impactful and&#xD;
      lasting improvements for their child with TSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 66 children, 22 per year whom have been clinically diagnosed&#xD;
      with TSC, are 12-36 months of age, English as primary language at home, and have one parent&#xD;
      available for weekly remote video conferencing. Participants that meet criteria will be asked&#xD;
      to complete assessments from their home (kits will be mailed to them), which will take&#xD;
      several sessions (approximately 2.5 hours). During these assessment sessions via Zoom,&#xD;
      participants will be shown how to do BOSA, SPACE and CCX assessments. A Vineland and Ages and&#xD;
      Stages Questionnaire will also be done during these sessions, but it's just questionnaires.&#xD;
      The SPACE and CCX are particulary important because the participants will have to record&#xD;
      themselves throughout the study doing these assessments. A brief introduction to JASPER will&#xD;
      also be given during this period of assessments. Randomization will occur after assessments&#xD;
      are complete. Participants randomized to intervention will need to meet with the research&#xD;
      staff for 12 weeks via Zoom to discuss their recorded sessions. Each participant in the&#xD;
      intervention group is expected to submit (via UCLA Box) a 30-40 minute video doing JASPER&#xD;
      with their child. These videos will be discussed during the Zoom calls. The group not&#xD;
      randomized to intervention, will continue to care for their child as usual for those 12&#xD;
      weeks. They will not need to record or meet via Zoom with the research staff. At the end of&#xD;
      the 12 weeks, all participants will record themselves doing the two assessments that were&#xD;
      taught at UCLA. They will do and record these assessments again 12 weeks after that in the&#xD;
      3-month follow up. The total study is for 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-six participants (22 per year) will be recruited, consented, and complete remote&#xD;
      assessments. The assessments consist of the BOSA, Vineland, the Short Play and Communication&#xD;
      Evaluation (SPACE), and Caregiver Child Interaction (CCX). The SPACE and CCX will be done&#xD;
      throughout the study. The JASPER introduction and information consist of a self-guided module&#xD;
      introducing caregivers to the developmental concepts of joint engagement, social&#xD;
      communication, and play. They will receive online handouts and strategies as well. A&#xD;
      demographic form and Caregiver Expectancies Belief form wlll also be completed at this point.&#xD;
      After assessments and this JASPER introduction meeting, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive self guided JASPER intervention materials with remote JASPER coaching intervention or&#xD;
      self guided materials only. Both conditions, JASPER materials plus coaching or JASPER&#xD;
      materials only, will last for 12 weeks. The caregivers randomized to intervention, will do&#xD;
      JASPER 30-40 minutes per day (Monday through Friday). They will record one of these days and&#xD;
      share it with the UCLA research staff via a secure network, such as UCLA box. Each week one&#xD;
      of the UCLA research staff will meet via Zoom or Skype to discuss the video. During these 12&#xD;
      weeks, parents will fill out Caregiver Involvement Scale, and Caregiver Diary forms weekly.&#xD;
      After the 12 weeks, the participants will all do a remote SPACE and CCX. The Vineland and&#xD;
      Ages and Stages Questionnaire (Gross and Fine Motors sections only), which was done during&#xD;
      the screening will also be done at this time point over the phone or through Zoom.&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow up SPACE and CCX, 3 months after entry (24 weeks of study) as&#xD;
      well. The Vineland and Ages and Stages Questionnaire (Gross and Fine Motors sections only)&#xD;
      will also be done at this time point over the phone or through Zoom as well.The Caregiver&#xD;
      Expectancies/Belief forms will also be completed at week 1, after the 12 weeks of&#xD;
      intervention (exit), and at the 3 month follow up.&#xD;
