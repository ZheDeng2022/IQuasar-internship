    <textblock>
      Prosody is the melody and rhythm of speech, it is used to refer to the supra segmental&#xD;
      aspects of speech including pitch, loudness and duration. Variations in these features&#xD;
      achieve different prosodic functions and are perceived by the listener as meaningful changes.&#xD;
      The role of prosody in language acquisition and effective communication is documented in&#xD;
      research. Nevertheless, prosodic intervention in children with hearing impairment received&#xD;
      less attention compared to other speech and language areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to adapt the &quot;prosody treatment program&quot;, an evidence based&#xD;
      rehabilitation program, and to detect the efficacy of its activities in improving the&#xD;
      prosodic skills of Egyptian hearing impaired children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;prosody treatment program&quot; is an evidence-based practice targeting receptive and&#xD;
      expressive prosodic skills in addition to speech production, intelligibility, pragmatics and&#xD;
      phonology. The program is applied using a systematic approach of providing cues following the&#xD;
      principles adapted from dynamic temporal and tactile cueing (DTTC) for speech motor learning&#xD;
      to help accelerate the child's learning of the prosodic skills targeted in this program. The&#xD;
      program was translated to Arabic and adapted to be suitable for the Egyptian children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prosody has an important role in several areas of communicative functions including :&#xD;
      grammatical, pragmatic, affective and/or indexical functions. Prosodic abnormalities extend&#xD;
      across a wide range of communication disorders. Intact functioning auditory system has a&#xD;
      fundamental role in language acquisition and development. Children receive the speech of&#xD;
      others as a source of linguistic input which is considered their target and they gradually&#xD;
      modify their productions using their own auditory feedback to reach the target utterance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hearing impairment early in life deprives the child of the source of their linguistic input&#xD;
      affecting various aspects of speech and language development. Speech production of the&#xD;
      hearing impaired is characterized by various segmental and suprasegmental errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case studies show that interventions targeting prosody can modify prosody in young children&#xD;
      with speech and language impairments. Multiple problems of prosody , language, speech and&#xD;
      voice are found in individuals with prosodic impairments ,therefore it is challenging to&#xD;
      develop treatment protocols addressing prosody .There are only few published interventions&#xD;
      targeting prosody .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to lack of well structured comprehensive Arabic programs targeting prosody , this work&#xD;
      was dedicated towards adaptation of &quot;prosody treatment program&quot; a remediation program&#xD;
      targeting receptive and expressive prosodic skills and its application on hearing impaired&#xD;
      children .The proposed program targets two levels: preschool and school aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work was to adapt the &quot;prosody treatment program&quot; program and apply its&#xD;
      activities in cases of hearing impairment to detect its efficacy in improvement of prosodic&#xD;
      skills in Egyptian hearing impaired children fitted with hearing aids or cochlear implant&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted on 55 children with hearing impairment attending the Unit of&#xD;
      Phoniatrics , in the outpatient clinic of Alexandria Main University hospital. Sample size&#xD;
      was calculated using two proportions power analysis in NCSS and PASS program a minimum sample&#xD;
      size required to detect the efficacy of the &quot;prosody treatment program&quot; in improvement of&#xD;
      prosodic skills of Egyptian hearing impaired children and to detect a difference of 0.5 that&#xD;
      achieve 80% power with a target significance level at 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed program is based on &quot; prosody treatment program&quot;, a program targeting receptive&#xD;
      and expressive prosodic skills. It includes activities targeting loudness , word stress&#xD;
      ,syllable stress ,pitch ,question inflections ,emotions ,sarcasm ,rhythm ,chunking, and&#xD;
      speaking rate . The program was adapted in order to be appropriate to the Arabic language and&#xD;
      to the Egyptian children. The program was applied using a systematic approach of providing&#xD;
      cues to help accelerate the child's learning of the prosodic skills targeted in the program.&#xD;
      Cues are adapted from the Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cueing (DTTC) for Speech Motor&#xD;
      Learning hierarchy. It aims at improving motor planning, and programming speech processing as&#xD;
      speech and language acquisition progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is divided into two sections according to the age into preschool section and&#xD;
      school age section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study was conducted on 8 cases with hearing impairment attending the phoniatrics unit&#xD;
      to check the suitability of the rehabilitation program and modify the needed items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects met the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria and were assessed by the&#xD;
      specified protocol of assessment to evaluate prosodic skills, language skills and cognitive&#xD;
      abilities before and after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software package version 20.0. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).&#xD;
      Qualitative data were described using number and percent. Chi square test was used for&#xD;
      comparison of qualitative variables in two groups, Fisher exact test was used to compare&#xD;
      qualitative variables when 50% of cell value was less than 5. McNemar test was used to&#xD;
      compare nominal variables before and after intervention. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used&#xD;
      to verify the normality of distribution. Quantitative data were described using mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation and IQR. Test of significance used included different tests. t test to&#xD;
      compare between different means. Mann Whitney U test to compare non normally distributed&#xD;
      quantitative variables in two different groups. Paired t test for comparison of normally&#xD;
      distributed variables in matched pairs. Wilcoxon signed rank test for pre-post comparison in&#xD;
      non-normally distributed quantitative variables. Kappa coefficient was used to assess level&#xD;
      of agreement between two raters. Significance of the obtained results was judged at the 5%&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
