    <description>All participants who have successfully established remote data-sharing from their glucose monitors to the research team's Glooko account by conclusion of the one-month baseline period will advance to the six-month intervention period.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Remote Patient Monitoring</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants' glucose data will be monitored by the study team using population analytic reports. Participants who either have excessive hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia on these reports will be contacted by a pediatric endocrinologist (the principal investigator) to discuss any necessary adjustments to their home diabetes management plans. This intervention will be in addition to their usual care (regular visits at the UC Davis Pediatric Endocrinology clinic).</description>
