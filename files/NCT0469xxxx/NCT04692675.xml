  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active surveillance (AS) is a standard approach to treat low and intermediate risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer. For AS, disease progression is monitored. AS uses biopsies, prostate specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA) blood tests, and other tools. Researchers want to see if multiparametric magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (mpMRI) can help improve AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if mpMRI can improve how people are monitored during AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men age 18 and older who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer within the last 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo AS. Their PSA level will be checked once a year via blood test.&#xD;
      They will have a digital rectal exam once a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have biopsies every 2-3 years. Needles will be put into different parts of&#xD;
      the prostate. The needles are guided by ultrasound imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have targeted biopsies with mpMRI and MRI guided fusion (MRI-US&#xD;
      fusion). MRI-US fusion combines previous MRI images with live ultrasound images. For MRIs,&#xD;
      participants will lie on their stomach on the scanner table. A coil may be placed in the&#xD;
      rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam and medical record review at least every 3 years.&#xD;
      Their weight and vital signs will be checked. They will give data about their daily&#xD;
      activities, side effects, and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2-3 years, participants will fill out surveys about their prostate health and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give blood, urine, prostate secretion, and saliva samples. The samples will&#xD;
      be used for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for as long as the participant does not need actual treatment for his&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active Surveillance (AS) is a standard approach in the treatment of low and intermediate&#xD;
           risk prostate cancer which employs a strategy of monitoring the clinical progression of&#xD;
           prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AS utilizes prostate biopsies, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and digital rectal&#xD;
           examinations (DRE) as tools to determine clinical progression in prostate cance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol aims to assess an additional tool, multiparametric magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (mpMRI) to actively visualize and monitor disease within the prostate in&#xD;
           addition to standard instruments used to determine clinical progression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the role of mpMRI in the selection and management of participants for AS by&#xD;
           correlating imaging findings with pathological progression as determined on serial&#xD;
           biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the optimal interval of MR imaging in monitoring AS participants for&#xD;
           evidence of progression by correlating sequential MRIs with biopsies with the goal to&#xD;
           reduce unnecessary imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relationship between mpMRI, prostate biopsy pathology results, and&#xD;
           progression in AS participants to determine if prostate biopsies may be safely avoided&#xD;
           based on the accuracy of imaging (sensitivity and specificity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men, 18 years and older with biopsy confirmed prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gleason Score which less than or equal to 3+4=7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial diagnosis of prostate cancer within 2 years of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capable of being consented to the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single arm, prospective, cohort study to correlate mpMRI with prostate biopsy pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We plan to accrue 508 participants over the entire study period, assuming about a 10%&#xD;
           dropout to allow adequate statistical review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored for clinical progression of their prostate cancer with&#xD;
           PSA, DRE, mpMRI, and prostate biopsy (systematic and MRI lesion targeted) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Initial prostate cancer antigen (PSA) screening with an additional PSA screen every&#xD;
                12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Initial DRE screening with additional DRE to be performed every year that either&#xD;
                prostate MRI or biopsy is performed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Initial mpMRI and prior to each biopsy (i.e., mandated at least every two years&#xD;
                until year five, and then every three years thereafter)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Initial systematic 12-Core prostate biopsy and MRI guided fusion (MRI-US fusion)&#xD;
                prostate biopsy of all suspicious lesions (i.e., targeted biopsy). Future biopsies,&#xD;
                including 12-core systematic and targeted biopsy (to be performed in the same&#xD;
                session) will then be mandated every two years until year five at which time&#xD;
                biopsies will be performed every three years thereafter unless contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mpMRI and biopsies may be performed earlier if clinically indicated and will revert&#xD;
                back to previous mpMRI/biopsy schedule after.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biopsy pathology results will be used as the standard for diagnosis of clinical&#xD;
                progression.&#xD;
