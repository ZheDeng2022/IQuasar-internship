  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tested a deviance regulation theory intervention in a sample of university&#xD;
      freshman. The aims were to (a) increase use of protective behavioral strategies, (b) decrease&#xD;
      alcohol use, and (c) decrease alcohol-related consequences.&#xD;

      College student freshmen were invited to participate in a study on the use of alcohol&#xD;
      protective behavioral strategies. They were randomly assigned to receive a positive message&#xD;
      about individuals that used protective strategies, a negative message about individuals that&#xD;
      did not use protective strategies, or an assessment control. They were then followed for the&#xD;
      next 12 months. Assessments were completed at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 26, and 52.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Past three months prior to intervention/study</time_frame>
    <description>Protective behavioral strategies (PBS) are a collection of harm-reduction strategies aimed to decrease alcohol-related consequences when consuming alcohol. The are three broad subtypes of PBS: (1) Manner of Drinking (MD; e.g., avoiding mixing different types of alcohol), (2) Stopping/Limiting Drinking (SLD; e.g., stopping drinking at a predetermined time), and (3) Serious Harm Reduction (SHR; e.g., knowing where your drink is at all times).&#xD;
These PBS were assessed in this study using Protective Behavioral Strategies Survey-20 (PBS-20). The PBS-20 consists of 20 statements covering three factors of protective strategies: Manner of Drinking, Stopping/Limiting Drinking, and Serious Harm Reduction. The frequency of PBS use was be reported on a five-point Likert-scale from 'Never' to 'Always'. Participants were asked to record their PBS use from the past three months.</description>
