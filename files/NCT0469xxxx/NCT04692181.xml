      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral SYN-004 in adult allogeneic HCT&#xD;
           (allo-HCT) recipients who develop fever after conditioning therapy and are treated with&#xD;
           IV β-lactam antibiotics meropenem (MER), piperacillin tazobactam (PIP/TAZO), or cefepime&#xD;
           (FEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate potential absorption of oral SYN-004 into the systemic circulation of&#xD;
           allo-HCT recipients and potential SYN-004-mediated alterations to systemic levels and&#xD;
           efficacy of IV MER, PIP/TAZO or FEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate potential protective effects of SYN-004 on the intestinal microbiome of&#xD;
           allo-HCT recipients treated with IV MER, PIP/TAZO or FEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To obtain preliminary information on potential therapeutic benefits and patient outcomes&#xD;
           of SYN-004 in allo-HCT recipients treated with IV MER, PIP/TAZO or FEP&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, placebo controlled, double blinded Phase 1b/2a study to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of orally administered SYN-004 in adult allo-HCT&#xD;
      recipients. Participants will be randomized 2:1 to SYN-004 or placebo in blocks of three,&#xD;
      stratified in three cohorts based on study assigned antibiotic (MER, piperacillin/tazobactam&#xD;
      [PIP/TAZO], FEP) to be administered if the treating clinicians determine initiation of&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics is indicated. As such, there will be six groups based on&#xD;
      antibiotic cohort and randomized assignment of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Placebo + IV MER (n=4) (MER control). Group 2: SYN-004 + IV MER (n=8) (MER&#xD;
      treatment). Group 3: Placebo + IV PIP/TAZO (n=4) (PIP/TAZO control). Group 4: SYN-004 + IV&#xD;
      PIP/TAZO (n=8) (PIP/TAZO treatment). Group 5: Placebo + IV FEP (n=4) (FEP control). Group 6:&#xD;
      SYN-004 + IV FEP (n=8) (FEP treatment). Study-assigned antibiotics will be dosed as follows&#xD;
      (adjusted for renal function as needed): MER 1 gram every 8 hours, PIP/TAZO 4.5 grams every 6&#xD;
      hours, FEP 1 gram every 8 hours. SYN-004 treated participants (Groups 2, 4 and 6) will be&#xD;
      compared to control participants who receive placebo (Groups 1, 3 and 5, respectively). The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in stages, commencing with Groups 1 and 2 who will be assigned to&#xD;
      receive MER if antibiotics are indicated. MER is the first cohort because anti-infective&#xD;
      efficacy of MER is not anticipated to be affected if SYN-004 is absorbed systemically.&#xD;
      Accrual for Groups 3 and 4 (PIP/TAZO cohort) will begin only after review of the data from&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 2 by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and agreement to proceed.&#xD;
      PIP/TAZO is the next cohort because TAZO is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. As such, in the&#xD;
      unlikely event of SYN-004 systemic absorption, TAZO systemic concentrations should be&#xD;
      sufficient to inhibit any absorbed SYN-004. Accrual for the FEP cohort will begin after&#xD;
      approval by the DSMC's review of results from groups 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients planned to receive an allo-HCT will be eligible for enrollment in the study and can&#xD;
      be enrolled anytime from when it is known they will undergo HCT until day +1 after HCT (day&#xD;
      of study drug start). Written informed consent will be obtained by all patients. To count&#xD;
      towards the enrollment goal of 36 participants, a study participant must receive at least 80%&#xD;
      of scheduled study drug doses from initiation of study assigned antibiotics through the&#xD;
      second antibiotic pharmacokinetic assessment (7-9 days of concomitant study drug and study&#xD;
      assigned antibiotic). Additional participants will be enrolled to replace participants who do&#xD;
      not meet criteria to count towards the goal study enrollment until the goal enrollment is&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1b/2a study will use the SYN-004 dosing regimen (150 mg, PO, q6h) used in previous&#xD;
      Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in healthy volunteers and patents with LRTIs. The first&#xD;
      dose of study drug will be administered at day +1 after HCT and will be continued until&#xD;
      Criteria for Discontinuation of Study Drug are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two periods: the Treatment Period and the Follow-up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Treatment Period will be defined as the time from first dose of study drug until the&#xD;
           last dose. For participants who do not meet criteria for early discontinuation, study&#xD;
           drug will be continued for 72 hours after last dose of MER, PIP/TAZO, or FEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Follow-up Period begins after cessation of study drug dosing and is split into three&#xD;
           parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Part A: up to 30 days after study drug was discontinued&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Part B: from end of Part A to day +180 after HCT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Part C: from end of Part B to day +365 after HCT Patients enrolled in the study&#xD;
                will receive conditioning and HCT according to their treatment plan. Fever and time&#xD;
                of antibiotic start will be defined per local standard of care of patients.&#xD;
                Cessation of antibiotic therapy and/or changes to antibiotic therapy will be at the&#xD;
                discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be evaluated as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments. At&#xD;
      predetermined points during the study as outlined in the SOA, blood samples, urine samples,&#xD;
      fecal swabs, and fecal samples will be collected for the indicated analyses.&#xD;
