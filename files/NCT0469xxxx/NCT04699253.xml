  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The STABELISE-HF is an investigator initiated, international, multicentre feasibility study&#xD;
      that will investigate the use of a web application called SanaCoach Heart failure in patients&#xD;
      with chronic heart failure. SanaCoach heart failure provides patient education, systematic&#xD;
      self-monitoring, a care plan repository and facilitates correspondence with patient's care&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic heart failure are encouraged to self-manage their illness, such as&#xD;
      adhering to medical regimens, monitoring symptoms and adhere to lifestyle recommendations&#xD;
      from the health care provider to optimise health outcomes and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented study participants meeting the eligibility criteria for the STABILISE HF study will&#xD;
      be using the the &quot;SanaCoach heart failure&quot; during a 6-month study period. SanaCoach heart&#xD;
      failure is an application on the internet that supports patients and care providers in the&#xD;
      development, implementation and monitoring of patient self-management. The SanaCoach heart&#xD;
      failure provides information about heart failure, treatment, and lifestyle modifications. It&#xD;
      can also monitor the patient's wellbeing, symptoms, vital signs, and gives advice on whether&#xD;
      review with a health care provider is advisable. Furthermore, it provides a repository for&#xD;
      patient's care plan to give insight into the course and treatment of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and dropout statistics will be assessed and the sociodemographic and comorbidity&#xD;
      profile of consenting study participants as well as consenting non-participants (Patients who&#xD;
      decide not to participate will be given an option to complete an anonymous sociodemographic&#xD;
      survey.) will be analysed.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be using the SanaCoach heart failure for at least 6 months during the study period. SanaCoach heart failure is a web application that will be guiding the patient through a regular, systematic assessment of patient's health and wellbeing as well as regular education sessions. The assessment frequency ranges from daily to monthly, based on the settings provided by the health care provider. Furthermore, it provides a repository for patient's care plan to give insight into the course and treatment of the disorder and offers the possibility to contact the health care provider through the web application.</description>
