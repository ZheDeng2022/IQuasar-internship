  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dolphin 2.0 is a platform that runs an immersive virtual reality software, based on an&#xD;
      oceanic environment, where players control simulated creatures (dolphin, orca, axolotl).&#xD;
      Video games lead to high levels of motivation and arousal, provide immediate feedback and&#xD;
      playback, provide explicit reward and implicit success, and titrate difficulty levels. This&#xD;
      encourages the practice of exercise, being an important complement to physiotherapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of an&#xD;
      immersive virtual reality software (Dolphin, 2.0) in Parkinson's disease symptomatic control,&#xD;
      in a two-arm, randomized, single-blind (blind rater for primary and secondary outcomes),&#xD;
      delayed-start feasibility and efficacy trial.&#xD;
