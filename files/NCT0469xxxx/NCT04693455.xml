      This is a Phase 1, Double Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Single Dose, Dose Escalation&#xD;
      Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ZD03 Capsule in Healthy&#xD;
      Volunteers in The United States&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ZD03 is a novel small molecular drug. It is a synthetic chemical drug candidate for treatment&#xD;
      of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is proposed to be administered orally as capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study.&#xD;
      Approximately 56 HVs will enter into the phase 1 study. The study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety,tolerability and PK of ZD03 capsule at different dose cohorts when administered&#xD;
      orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the enrollment criteria will be enrolled in one of the seven dose levels&#xD;
      designated for the study, including the doses of 20, 40, 80, 120, 180, 240 and 300 mg (doses&#xD;
      escalated by 100%, 100%, 50%, 50%, 33% and 25%, respectively). Each cohort will consist of 8&#xD;
      subjects randomized at 3:1 to receive a single oral dose of ZD03 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) in a&#xD;
      double-blind manner in a fasted state&#xD;

             cohort,Healthy (no clinically significant health concerns), as determined by medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and vital signs at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 at screening&#xD;
             (inclusive) and weighed a minimum of 50 kg (110 lbs).&#xD;

             oophorectomy) or postmenopausal for â‰¥ 12 months. The site will attempt to retrieve&#xD;
             medical records to document sterility; however, the absence of records will not&#xD;
             exclude screening the subject. If medical records cannot be obtained, a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening will be accepted. Postmenopausal status will be confirmed&#xD;
             through testing of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) levels by PI discretion at&#xD;
             screening for amenorrhoeic female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Males must be surgically sterile (&gt; 30 days since vasectomy with no viable sperm),&#xD;
             abstinent or if engaged in sexual relations with a female partner of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential, the subject must be using a condom with spermicide from Screening and for a&#xD;
             period of 30 days after the last dose of Study Drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of contraception for males are condoms with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must have a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count within the normal&#xD;
             range or considered not clinically significant by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have normal blood chemistry or results considered not clinically&#xD;
             significant by the investigator including electrolytes (Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl-),&#xD;
             alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST),&#xD;
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, uric acid, creatinine, blood urea&#xD;
             nitrogen (BUN), and glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must have a normal urinalysis or results considered not clinically&#xD;
             significant by the investigator including a normal protein/creatinine ratio per local&#xD;
             lab reference ranges (&lt; 200 mg/g) and a urine creatinine result that does not exceed&#xD;
             300 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects must have estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) â‰¥ 90 mL/min(Based on&#xD;
             MDRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects must have a normal ECG or results considered not clinically significant by&#xD;
             the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects must be able to comply with the study and follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects are able to understand the study procedures and risks involved and must&#xD;
             provide signed informed consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with any history or clinical manifestations of significant metabolic,&#xD;
             hematological, pulmonary, including latent tuberculosis, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal including cholecystectomy, neurologic, hepatic, renal, urological, or&#xD;
             psychiatric disorders.&#xD;

          5. Subjects who have undergone major surgery within 3 months prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who received any investigational test article within 5 half-lives or 30 days,&#xD;
             whichever is longer, prior to Day 1 study medication dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects who consumed Seville oranges or grapefruit containing foods or beverages&#xD;

             inhibitors/inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes such as barbiturates,&#xD;
             phenothiazines, cimetidine, carbamazepine, etc., within 30 days prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication and that in the Investigator's judgment may have impacted&#xD;
             subject safety or the validity of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who had a positive urine screen for drugs of abuse (amphetamines,&#xD;
             barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates) or cotinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would place&#xD;
