  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MS is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      affecting more than 120,000 people in the UK.and 2.5 million people worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without disease modifying treatment (DMT),the majority of people with MS (pwMS) will develop&#xD;
      significant disability within 10 years of onset, and 50% will require wheelchair assistance&#xD;
      within 20 years. convenient, highly effective and CNS penetrant DMT for patients with&#xD;
      relapsing multiple sclerosis (pwRMS) administered in short (8-10 days/year over 2 years)&#xD;
      treatment courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It effectively depletes B cells, particularly Memory B cells, a likely key mechanism of&#xD;
      disease control in MS. Cladribine is the investigational product in this study as it not&#xD;
      currently used to treat patients with an EDSS of 6.5 - 8.5. This is a multi-centre,&#xD;
      randomised double-blind placebo-controlled phase IIb to test cladribine tablets (MAVENCLAD®)&#xD;
      (3.5mg/kg over 24 months) for safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness, and to advance&#xD;
      mechanistic understanding of its action in people with advanced MS (pwAMS).&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Relapse within six months before screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Inability to complete an MRI (contraindications for MRI, including but not limited to,&#xD;

         18. Treatment with steroids due to MS relapse/progression within three months of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             pwAMS who fall in this category may undergo a further screening visit once the three&#xD;
             months' window has expired and may be included if no steroid treatment has been&#xD;
             administered in the intervening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Treatment with any interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide or&#xD;
             dimethyl-fumarate within three months before screening.&#xD;

             Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators) within three months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Treatment with azathioprine, methotrexate, or cyclosporine within six months before&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. pwAMS treated with teriflunomide will need to undergo accelerated elimination of the&#xD;
             compound before being considered (Research and Case Medical Research 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Treatment with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), mitoxantrone,&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, cladribine, alemtuzumab or another B cell depleting compound, such&#xD;
             as rituximab, ocrelizumab, ublitiuximab, ofatumumab, or biosimilars, unless the&#xD;
             participant concerned has a memory B cell level of ≥20% of the CD19+ population in the&#xD;
             peripheral blood. Such a level would normally not be expected earlier than a minimum&#xD;
             of six months after the last drug administration. Participants who underwent such&#xD;
             treatment will therefore have to be tested for their CD19+/CD27+ memory B cell level&#xD;
             at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Treatment with fampridine: If they are already on treatment for at least six months,&#xD;
             participants should continue throughout the trial. However, starting continuous&#xD;
             fampridine treatment after signing the consent sheet will lead to exclusion from&#xD;
             treatment with IMP/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Concurrent participation or previous participation within the last 6 months in another&#xD;
             clinical trial of an IMP or medical device.&#xD;
