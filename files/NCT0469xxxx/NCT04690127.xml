      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of plyometric training on biceps femoris&#xD;
      longus (BFl) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscle architecture in individuals with anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Individuals will be randomly placed into training&#xD;
      and control groups. Measurements of muscle architecture will be taken bilaterally from BFl&#xD;
      and VL muscles by means of an ultrasound device. Functional performance will be evaluated&#xD;
      with the International Knee Documentation Committee score and the single leg jump test.&#xD;
      Following the initial evaluations, individuals in the training group will receive plyometric&#xD;
      training. Evaluations of muscle architecture and functional performance will be taken again&#xD;
      from the individuals in the training and control groups at the end of the 4th and 8th weeks.&#xD;
      The received ultrasound images will be calculated through the MicroDicom software. In-group&#xD;
      and between-group comparisons will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences program and appropriate tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common, especially in young individuals&#xD;
      participating in rolling and jumping activities. After injury, many people undergo ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction (ACLR) surgery. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of plyometric&#xD;
      training on biceps femoris longus (BFl) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscle architecture (fiber&#xD;
      length, penation angle and muscle thickness) in individuals with ACLR. Individuals who have&#xD;
      undergone ACLR in this study, which is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled&#xD;
      study, will be randomly placed into two different groups, the training group and the control&#xD;
      group. Imagery ability, self-efficacy and motivation will be evaluated with various&#xD;
      questionnaires and scales in order to compare the homogeneity of the groups. Measurements of&#xD;
      muscle architecture will be taken bilaterally from BFl and VL muscles by means of an&#xD;
      ultrasound device. Functional performance will be evaluated with the International Knee&#xD;
      Documentation Committee score and the single leg jump test. Following the initial&#xD;
      evaluations, individuals in the training group will receive plyometric training consisting of&#xD;
      ten different exercises for 8 weeks, 3 sessions per week. In this training, individuals will&#xD;
      not participate in a real plyometric training. Volunteers will watch videos to be prepared&#xD;
      (action observation) and imagine them performing those exercises (motor imagery). Except for&#xD;
      one session that will be applied every two weeks, all other trainings will be given on the&#xD;
      basis of telerehabilitation via distance education tools. Cognitive fatigue at the beginning&#xD;
      and end of the session; at the end of each session, the technical quality and efficiency of&#xD;
      the training will be evaluated. Evaluations of muscle architecture and functional performance&#xD;
      will be taken again from the individuals in the control and training groups at the end of the&#xD;
      4th and 8th weeks. The received ultrasound images will be calculated through the MicroDicom&#xD;
      software. In-group and between-group comparisons will be analyzed using the Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Sciences program and appropriate tests.&#xD;
