  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is the way that the body reacts against infection, injury or illness. An&#xD;
      uncontrolled inflammatory response can lead to the development of inflammatory diseases, such&#xD;
      as rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular conditions. Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      inflammation is a regulated process coordinated by a group of molecules known as specialized&#xD;
      pro-resolving mediator (SPM). These molecules are produced by enzymes via the enzymatic&#xD;
      conversion of essential fatty acids; whereas their biological actions are mediated by&#xD;
      proteins expressed on the surface of cells known as receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the central role that pro-resolving mediators play in regulating the immune response,&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to investigate whether there are genetic variants (mutations) in&#xD;
      genes encoding for enzymes and receptors involved in the biology of these molecules and to&#xD;
      determine how these mutations affect SPM's activity or function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings made as part of these studies will help shed light into mechanism influencing&#xD;
      disease onset and/or progression and potentially enhance the discovery of new and more&#xD;
      effective treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify polymorphisms in SPM-related genes in a South Asian population&#xD;
      and assess whether these lead to alterations in the functions of enzymes and proteins encoded&#xD;
      by these genes. This information will then be used to identify those SNP (Single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphism) that lead to loss of function. We will then evaluate whether these SNP are&#xD;
      linked with altered white blood cell function and increased incidence of chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      disorders by assessing data from the Gene &amp; Health program and other databases such as UK&#xD;
      Biobank. We expect that this approach will provide new insights into molecular mechanisms and&#xD;
      the identification of new mediators/enzyme/receptors families that are dysregulated in&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this aim, we will identify volunteers from the Gene &amp; Health program. The Gene &amp;&#xD;
      Health program has sequenced around 40,000 volunteers and identified around 500 gene variants&#xD;
      that are predicted to lead to complete loss of gene function; among these SNP, 68 are&#xD;
      presented in enzymes and receptors related with SPM including ALOX15, GPR18 and FPR2/ALX. As&#xD;
      part of their recruitment to Gene &amp; Health program, participants have consented to be&#xD;
      contacted about future research studies such as this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the differences in the lipid mediator profiles between the groups, we will&#xD;
      use peripheral blood obtained from consented Gene &amp; Health individuals that present the SNP&#xD;
      of interest (cases) and individuals without the mutation (controls). For the lipid mediator&#xD;
      profiling a liquid chromatography in tandem mass spectrometry strategy (LC-MS/MS) will be&#xD;
      used. Cell biology assays (phagocytosis, platelet activation, etc.) will be conducted using&#xD;
      peripheral blood phagocytes cells. In addition, volunteers will be consented for access to&#xD;
      their centralised health records so we can identify associations between different&#xD;
      polymorphisms and the development of inflammatory conditions through a candidate-gene&#xD;
      association study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks of this study to participants are low and relate to the sharing of confidential&#xD;
      data and blood sample donation. Access to confidential clinical information with&#xD;
      person-identifiable data will be restricted to the Chief Investigator and Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, who are aware of their responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 2018 and&#xD;
      all the obligations related to data management enforced by Gene &amp; Health program. As for the&#xD;
      blood donation, we believe that there is minimal risk to participants as they will only be&#xD;
      asked to donate up to 60 ml of blood per sitting and donors will not be recalled more than 3&#xD;
      separate occasions.&#xD;
