  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum from simple reversible hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis to inflammation and fibrosis termed steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis.&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence indicates that NAFLD is associated with development of heart failure,&#xD;
      abnormal ventricular glucose and fatty acid (FA) utilisation and cardiac steatosis. The&#xD;
      mechanisms behind why some subjects progress from NAFLD to NASH and the link between cardiac&#xD;
      involvement and NAFLD are poorly understood, but must include altered cardiac and&#xD;
      intrahepatic lipid handling. Investigators plan comprehensive kinetic studies of heart and&#xD;
      liver FA uptake and oxidation, ventricular function and substrate utilisation, and hepatic&#xD;
      triglyceride (TG) secretion in order to assess mechanisms governing cardiac and hepatic lipid&#xD;
      and glucose trafficking in subjects with type 2 diabetes with and without NAFLD and NASH and&#xD;
      the relationship with heart function. In addition, the investigators will assess skeletal&#xD;
      muscle and adipose tissue enzyme activities, gene expression and protein concentrations in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic subjects to define mechanisms involved in the cross-talk between heart,&#xD;
      liver, muscle and adipose tissues. Investigators will address these questions using tracer&#xD;
      techniques (11Cpalmitate PET tracers and triglyceride (TG) tracers) to study cardiac and&#xD;
      liver substrate trafficking, as well as MR spectroscopy, echocardiography, muscle and fat&#xD;
      biopsies in combination with state-of-the art muscle and adipose tissue enzyme kinetics,&#xD;
      gene- and protein expression. The overarching goals are to define abnormalities and&#xD;
      differences between NAFLD and NASH in hepatic lipid (FA and TG) metabolism.&#xD;
