  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This experiment is based on a unique technique of deep Transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (dTMS) of the brain's cortex, aiming to produce weight loss in food-addicted severely obese&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The neurobiological underpinnings of food addiction in obesity point to chemical, structural&#xD;
      and functional imbalance in the mesolimbic dopaminergic brain system. This may cause symptoms&#xD;
      of altered reward processing, excessive cravings for hyperpalatable food and repeated&#xD;
      self-regulation failures to control food intake in this population. Specifically, the medial&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and deeper reward-related brain&#xD;
      regions function differentially from healthy controls and similarly to individuals with&#xD;
      substance or behavioral addiction. Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation of the mPFC has&#xD;
      been shown efficacious in reducing cravings and other addictive symptoms in individuals with&#xD;
      SUD, as well as symptoms of compulsivity in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In this&#xD;
      study the investigators use deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) with an H-coil to&#xD;
      safely stimulate the mPFC and deeper brain regions, in individuals with obesity and food&#xD;
      addiction. The investigators aim to produce neuroplasticity favoring the restoration of mPFC&#xD;
      functioning, alleviating food addiction symptoms and promoting weight loss.&#xD;
