  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to develop the French version of the two questionnaires&#xD;
      AIDA and LoPF-Q. The secondary objective is to investigate the links between disrupted&#xD;
      development of identity and adolescent psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To participate in the study, patients will have to complete online or paper versions of the&#xD;
      questionnaires AIDA-LoPF and other assessments of personality and general psychopathology&#xD;
      (BB5, SDQ). Parents will have to answer complete the parent version of the SDQ questionnaire.&#xD;
      The BPFSC-11, which is a clinician-rated assessment, will be completed in a subgroup of&#xD;
      patients, by the same healthcare professional, in order to assess the concurrent validity.&#xD;
      The investigators will also add the clinical diagnoses according to ICD-10 found in the&#xD;
      medical record.&#xD;

      A personality disorder is a lasting mode of behavior and lived experience that deviates&#xD;
      significantly from what is expected in the culture of the individual is invasive and rigid,&#xD;
      appears in early adolescence or adulthood, is stable over time and is a source of distress or&#xD;
      impaired functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the tools for assessing high-risk personality disorders and traits have been&#xD;
      developed in adults.Yet it is important to have effective tools to distinguish personality&#xD;
      disorders from other mental disorders as early as possible. The identification of young&#xD;
      people at high risk of personality disorders allows their rapid referral to appropriate&#xD;
      psychotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AIDA and LoPF-Q, screening questionnaires, were recently developed to include an&#xD;
      assessment of personality functioning in the process of diagnosing emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      disorders in adolescence. They have been tested in several countries such as Germany, USA,&#xD;
      Mexico, Croatia… The results of the studies show that AIDA and LoPF questionnaires are&#xD;
      reliable and valid instruments for assessing normal and disturbed identity in adolescents and&#xD;
      distinguishes well between patients with psychiatric illnesses and healthy controls.&#xD;
