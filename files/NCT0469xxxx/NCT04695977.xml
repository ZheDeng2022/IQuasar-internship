  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMP-001-011 is a Phase 2/3 study of CMP-001 intratumoral (IT) and nivolumab intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      compared to nivolumab monotherapy administered to participants with unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two phases: Phase 2 and Phase 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Phase 2 of the study is to determine confirmed objective response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) for treatment with first-line CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus&#xD;
      nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of Phase 2 of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      first-line CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in subjects&#xD;
      with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Phase 3 of the study is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      for subjects receiving first-line CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab&#xD;
      monotherapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of Phase 3 are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of first-line CMP-001 in combination with&#xD;
           nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
           melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of first-line CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus&#xD;
           nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
