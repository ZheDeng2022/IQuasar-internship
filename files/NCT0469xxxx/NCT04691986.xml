  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is an age-associated clinical condition of poor physiological reserve that increases&#xD;
      risks for falls, hospitalization and mortality. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a&#xD;
      critical co-factor needed for many cellular processes. The natural levels of NAD decline&#xD;
      aging and this has been linked to physical performance decline in animals. Human trials have&#xD;
      demonstrated that nicotinamide riboside (NR), a form of vitamin B3, is safe and effectively&#xD;
      increases NAD+ levels. In animal studies, NR improves treadmill performance and muscle&#xD;
      quality. Here the investigators propose a double-blind randomized control trial to assess the&#xD;
      benefits of NR supplementation on human muscle function and physiology. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate the research findings will support the use of this nutritional supplement to&#xD;
      improve the health of Veterans during aging.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is increasingly seen within the aging population and is driven largely by&#xD;
      musculoskeletal declines. Nearly 9 million Veterans are now 65 years of age or older with&#xD;
      impairments in functional capacity, reduction in quality of life, and an increase in the use&#xD;
      of health care services and associated costs. An estimated 45-50% of those over the age of 85&#xD;
      are frail, which could represent well over 1 million Veterans. Aging, which significantly&#xD;
      contributes to frailty, is highly correlated with reduced levels of nicotinamide adenine&#xD;
      dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential mediator in mitochondrial function. Restoration of cellular&#xD;
      NAD+ levels is gaining support as a therapeutic strategy to maintain and even enhance&#xD;
      functional capacity during aging. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) - an NAD+ precursor - enhances&#xD;
      physical activity and mitochondrial health in mice. Furthermore, NR was recently shown to be&#xD;
      safe in human clinical trials for boosting NAD+, yet the benefits for human physical&#xD;
      performance and muscle physiology are unknown. Therefore, the goal of this project is to&#xD;
      establish a double-blind randomized control trial to assess the impacts of NR on functional&#xD;
      capacity, muscle function and structure, and mRNA signaling in healthy older adults. Towards&#xD;
      this goal, this study will investigate healthy older individuals between the ages of 65 and&#xD;
      85 who will receive NR or a placebo for a period of 3 months. Participants will be tested for&#xD;
      frailty, gait speed, and muscle strength at each time point. Additionally, muscle biopsies&#xD;
      and serum will be collected to assess changes in muscle fiber histology, mitochondrial&#xD;
      biomass and activity, and mRNA profiles. This project will provide greater insight into NR&#xD;
      supplementation as a therapeutic strategy to stave off frailty and maintain resilience during&#xD;
      aging.&#xD;

From this sample extracts will be created to assess changes in muscle NAD+ content (an expected response from NR supplementation). Additionally, mitochondria will be isolated and assessed for overall content and basal and maximal activity. Finally, the muscle sample will be assessed using histology to observe changes in fiber size and if there is a difference in the number of slow and fast twitch muscle fibers. Finally, changes in message RNA expression will be determined in order to understand how treatment affects cellular function.</description>

    <description>Body composition will be measured using bioelectric impedance (BIA) - a technique where participants are asked to stand on the measurement device and hold on to two metal handles. A light - and non-detectable - current is then transmitted allowing for collection of body fat and lean mass in the subject. The assessment takes roughly 2-3 minutes.</description>
