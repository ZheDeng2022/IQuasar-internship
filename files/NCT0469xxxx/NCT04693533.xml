  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between&#xD;
      fremanezumab's ability to prevent migraine and improved sleep quality in migraine patients&#xD;
      (fremanezumab is a FDA-approved humanized CGRP monoclonal antibody for the treatment of&#xD;
      migraine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a within-person study design that examines treatment effects (changes) using&#xD;
      high-resolution assessments. To complete the study, each participant will be observed using&#xD;
      daily assessments of migraine and sleep outcomes before treatment (baseline: 0 to 30 days),&#xD;
      and at 1, 2, and 3 months after treatment (injection 1: days 31-60, injection 2: days 61-90,&#xD;
      injection 3: days 91-120). In essence, this creates an interrupted time-series design where&#xD;
      repeated interventions are introduced at fixed intervals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves 5 visits to the headache clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinic visit 1 (day 0), subjects will learn about the study and if they agree to&#xD;
      participate, will be consented and screened for eligibility. Those deemed to be eligible will&#xD;
      be asked to fill a headache questionnaire and then taught how to fill at home a daily e-diary&#xD;
      for sleep and a daily e-diary for headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinic visit 2 (day 30), subjects will return to the headache clinic to review their&#xD;
      e-diaries and receive the first treatment. The treatment is 225 mg (dissolved in 1.5 ml&#xD;
      solution) fremanezumab. Fremanezumab is a monthly dosed anti-CGRP mAb injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinic visit 3 (day 60), we will review participants' headache and sleep diaries 1 month&#xD;
      after receiving the 1st injection and administer the 2nd injection. This appointment will be&#xD;
      conducted by either one of the study physicians or the study nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinic visit 4 (day 90), we will review participants' headache and sleep diaries 1 month&#xD;
      after receiving the 2nd injection and and administer the 3rd injection. This appointment will&#xD;
      be conducted by either one of the study physicians or the study nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinic visit 5 (day 120), participants will return to the headache clinic to summarize&#xD;
      their experience, review their 120-days e-diaries, and provide any feedback they may have&#xD;
      about their experience with fremanezumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of headache and sleep:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening (visit 1), headache severity and impact will be assessed based on patients'&#xD;
      interviews and HIT-6. Sleep quality will be assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index.&#xD;
      (https://cbtscience.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/insomniaseverityindex.pdf).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 30, 60, 90 and 120, baseline and treatment impact on headache and sleep will be&#xD;
      assessed using the Headache e-diary and the consensus sleep diary [Carney et al., (2012) The&#xD;
      consensus sleep diary: Standardizing prospective sleep self-monitoring, Sleep Vol.35, No.2,&#xD;
      pp.287-302], the latter of which captures total sleep time, sleep latency, wake after sleep&#xD;
      onset, number of awakenings, quality, sleep efficiency, and trouble staying awake.&#xD;

    <description>This primary outcome measures improvement in sleep quality during the treatment period as compared to the pre-treatment period. Sleep quality will be measured using the Insomnia Severity Index. This index scores requires subjects to answer 7 questions by depicting a number (between 0 and 4 ) that represents best their answer. The scale of the Insomnia Severity Index is 0-28. The total score categories are as follows: 0-7 = No clinically significant insomnia, 8-14 = Subthershold insomnia, 15-21 = Clinical insomnia (moderate severity), 22-28 = Clinical insomnia (severe).</description>

    <description>This primary outcome measures changes in number of migraine days per month before and during treatment. The number of migraine days per month will be captures using a validated headache questionnaire and scores as follows: 0-8 migraine days per month = low frequency episodic migraine, 9-14 migraine days per month = high frequency episodic migraine, 15-30 migraine days per month = chronic migraine.</description>
