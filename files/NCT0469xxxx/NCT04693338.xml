  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial evaluates how well a mobile device-based breast cancer survivorship&#xD;
      interactive care plan works in monitoring symptoms and recovery in patients with stage 0-III&#xD;
      breast cancer. The interactive care plan provides patients with individualized, 'just in&#xD;
      time' education materials to promote self-management for those reporting difficult to control&#xD;
      symptoms, as well as escalations to contact their care team for signs or symptoms concerning&#xD;
      for cancer coming back (recurrence). The interactive care plan may help alleviate the&#xD;
      symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, hot flashes, and sexual dysfunction; increase physical&#xD;
      activity level and improve quality of life in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility and usability of the breast cancer (BC) survivorship&#xD;
      interactive care plan (ICP) as designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the behavioral, toxicity symptom burden and quality of life (QOL) changes in&#xD;
      patients engaged with the ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess clinical workflow impact by the introduction of the ICP in the BC survivor&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients completion surveys of 4 common symptoms: fatigue, hot flashes, insomnia, and sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction and receive educational material via mobile application (app) to help with&#xD;
      bothersome symptoms. Patients also completes Monthly questionnaires dealing with symptoms&#xD;
      concerning for cancer recurrence as well as quarterly questionnaires asking about quality of&#xD;
      life domains ( physical, emotional, social and functional quality of life).&#xD;

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29 questionnaire. Higher scores are more favorable 29 includes 7 HRQoL domains (Physical Functioning, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Social Functioning, and Pain). Each of the 7 domains has four 5-level items (i.e., 16 decrements each). The total scores for each domain ranges from 10-90. Across all symptoms, the thresholds (cut scores) identified to differentiate normal from mildly symptomatic were near a T score of 50. Cut scores differentiating mildly from moderately symptomatic were at or near 60, and those separating moderately from severely symptomatic were at or near 70.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29 questionnaire. Higher scores are more favorable 29 includes 7 HRQoL domains (Physical Functioning, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Social Functioning, and Pain). The pain domain has 2 subdomains (interference and intensity). Each of the 7 domains has four 5-level items (i.e., 16 decrements each). In addition to these items, pain intensity is assessed using a single 11-point numeric rating scale anchored between no pain (0) and worse imaginable pain, adding 10 additional decrements. The total scores for each domain ranges from 10-90. Across all symptoms, the thresholds (cut scores) identified to differentiate normal from mildly symptomatic were near a T score of 50. Cut scores differentiating mildly from moderately symptomatic were at or near 60, and those separating moderately from severely symptomatic were at or near 70.</description>
