    <textblock>
      Silent brain infarctions (SBIs) are a manifestation of covert cerebrovascular disease,&#xD;
      without obvious clinical deficit, noted very often in patients presenting with a new stroke&#xD;
      or new transient ischemic attack. SBIs are linked to a significant increase in risk for&#xD;
      subsequent stroke and cognitive decline. However, no biomarker is currently available that&#xD;
      can predict the recurrence of these subclinical lesions. Coated-platelets are a measure of&#xD;
      platelet procoagulant potential significantly increased in patients with ischemic stroke or&#xD;
      transient ischemic attack compared to unaffected controls. Higher coated-platelet levels are&#xD;
      strongly associated with both the presence and number of SBIs. Among medications approved for&#xD;
      preventing stroke recurrence, we identified clopidogrel as a pharmacological agent leading to&#xD;
      a decrease in coated-platelet levels. In this project, we plan to evaluate if clopidogrel can&#xD;
      decrease the rate of occurrence of new silent brain infarctions. The result will enhance the&#xD;
      investigators understanding of the relationship between platelets and silent brain infarcts,&#xD;
      leading to improved health care delivery and also potential targets for novel preventive&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silent brain infarcts (SBIs) are a recently recognized, commonly noted and yet poorly&#xD;
      understood finding of cerebral infarction on imaging studies without a clinically apparent&#xD;
      neurological deficit. The availability of high resolution brain imaging such as MRI has made&#xD;
      the recognition and characterization of these covert markers of cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
      possible. SBIs, also referred to as silent strokes, are subcortical cavities or cortical&#xD;
      areas of gliosis presumed to be caused by previous infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of SBIs in the general population ranges between 8 and 28% in large&#xD;
      cardiovascular and aging studies performed in Europe and North America. A key finding has&#xD;
      been that prevalence rates are relatively low before age 65 with a gradual increase seen with&#xD;
      aging. Among vascular risk factors, hypertension has the strongest association with SBIs,&#xD;
      however other vascular risk factors, such as stroke, have been associated with increased&#xD;
      prevalence of these lesions. The overall prevalence of SBI far exceeds that of symptomatic&#xD;
      stroke and is estimated that for every symptomatic stroke there are approximately 10 SBIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence data for SBIs are sparse, likely a reflection of the need for repeat imaging&#xD;
      studies. Incidence in the general population is estimated at 3% and 6.5% per year from large&#xD;
      population studies. A high incidence of SBIs has been reported following procedures such as&#xD;
      aortic valve replacement or carotid endarterectomy, likely directly related to these&#xD;
      procedures. Research data in a cohort of TIA patients who underwent initial MRI at the time&#xD;
      of the diagnosis and then repeat brain MRI one year after the index event showed a 37%&#xD;
      incidence of new SBIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been considerable evidence linking SBIs with an increased risk for subsequent&#xD;
      occurrence of stroke, development of cognitive decline and mortality, suggesting that SBIs&#xD;
      are precursors of more severe ischemic brain disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coated-platelets are a class of activated platelets, detected only after simultaneous&#xD;
      stimulation with two agonists, thrombin and collagen, or thrombin and convulxin, a collagen&#xD;
      receptor agonist from tropical rattlesnake venom. In stroke-free controls, coated-platelets&#xD;
      represent approx. 30% of all platelets. Coated-platelet levels are increased in stroke&#xD;
      patients as compared to those with lacunar stroke or controls; higher coated-platelet levels&#xD;
      measured at the time of the clinical infarct correlate with an increased risk for recurrence&#xD;
      at 12 months while lower coated-platelet levels are related to the occurrence of very early&#xD;
      inpatient major hemorrhagic complications. These data support a role for platelet&#xD;
      procoagulant potential in the balance between thrombosis and hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several investigations highlight the possibility that coated-platelets play a role in the&#xD;
      events preceding stroke. In asymptomatic carotid stenosis, patients with coated-platelet&#xD;
      levels 45.2% are at highest risk for incident stroke as compared to those with levels &lt; 45.2&#xD;
      %. In SAH patients, delayed cerebral ischemia (ischemic strokes occurring days after the&#xD;
      initial hemorrhage) was linked to a steep increase in coated-platelet levels immediately&#xD;
      predating the infarct. Recent work in stroke patients found higher coated-platelet levels&#xD;
      significantly associated with the presence and number of SBIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal data in stroke patients exploring the impact of medications used for secondary&#xD;
      stroke prevention identified clopidogrel as the only pharmacological agent leading to a&#xD;
      sustained decrease in coated-platelet levels after initiation of therapy. Aspirin,&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy or statins did not lead to a similar effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the investigators study is to evaluate the efficacy of clopidogrel on the&#xD;
      incidence of silent brain infarction in patients with stroke/TIA using a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind aspirin-controlled clinical trial. The investigator's hypothesis is that&#xD;
      clopidogrel treatment will lead to decreased incidence of SBIs in patients with non-lacunar&#xD;
      stroke/TIA treated over a two-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive eligible patients admitted with ischemic stroke or TIA to the Neurology service&#xD;
      qualifying for the study (see inclusion and exclusion criteria separately) will be randomized&#xD;
      to either clopidogrel or aspirin, stratified by sex. The study statisticians will create the&#xD;
      randomization sequence using randomly chosen block sizes of four or six and will implement&#xD;
      the sequence concealment. These doses are part of the recommended guidelines for secondary&#xD;
      stroke prevention and both medications are FDA approved for secondary stroke prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed by the research team in conjunction with regularly scheduled&#xD;
      outpatient visits for up to one year independent of the current study. After the 12-month&#xD;
      time point, the investigators will maintain phone contact with each patient for an additional&#xD;
      12 months to decrease loss to follow-up. Prior to the 24-month time point, the PI/Research&#xD;
      Assistant will order a repeat non-contrast MRI for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial and repeat MRI images will be independently reviewed after the repeat scan is&#xD;
      completed at 24 months by two experienced stroke specialists while blinded to the&#xD;
      coated-platelet levels and treatment arm. The initial and repeat MRI will be compared for the&#xD;
      presence of new (interval) SBIs in order to determine SBI incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBIs will be identified on MRI studies, using a 1.5 Tesla magnet, based on published&#xD;
      guidelines as focal (ovoid or irregularly shaped), 3mm, cavitary lesions, displaying T1&#xD;
      hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity features, and hypointense on FLAIR sequences. In&#xD;
      addition, the cortical SBIs (10% of lesions) may also display some focal atrophic changes of&#xD;
      the cerebral cortex in the area surrounding the infarct. These lesions have a chronic&#xD;
      appearance, can be easily distinguished from acute ischemic changes through the use of DWI&#xD;
      and ADC images and have no corresponding, clinically apparent, cerebrovascular ischemic event&#xD;
      noted in the patient's history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using electronic medical records, the investigators will collect the following data:&#xD;
      prescription medicines, age, sex, race, ethnicity, past medical history, type of stroke,&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score upon admission, results of&#xD;
      diagnostic studies performed for stroke, vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      large-artery artery disease, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke/TIA, hypercholesterolemia,&#xD;
      obesity, cardiac disease, aortic arch plaque, smoking, alcohol consumption), hematological&#xD;
      parameters (total platelet count, mean platelet volume, white blood cell count and&#xD;
      hemoglobin), and coagulation studies (PT, PTT and INR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because prior research linked interval development of SBIs with decline in cognitive&#xD;
      function, patients will be screened for cognitive impairment at discharge using the MoCA&#xD;
      test. Those with abnormal MoCA results (&lt;26/30 points) will be referred to the Memory Loss&#xD;
      clinic for memory loss assessment, including neuropsychological testing. At the end to the&#xD;
      follow-up period repeat neuropsychological testing will be performed in individuals who were&#xD;
      evaluated initially and compared to the initial results. The investigators will also repeat&#xD;
      cognitive screening with MOCA in patients who scored within normal range initially, and those&#xD;
      with abnormal results at 24 months will undergo memory loss assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A target sample size of 152 participants (76 clopidogrel and 76 aspirin) over 1.5 years (8.4&#xD;
      patients/month) is sufficient to provide preliminary estimates of the effect size and&#xD;
      variation in efficacy, as well as feasibility information regarding the conduct of the&#xD;
      clinical trial. This calculation provides 80% power to detect a 65% reduction in the hazard&#xD;
      of SBI for those receiving clopidogrel versus aspirin, assuming a 2-sided 0.05 alpha level,&#xD;
      loss-to-follow-up and death rates of 10%, and follow-up for 24 months. Even if the effect&#xD;
      size observed in the clinical trial is not as large, the trial will still generate valuable&#xD;
      estimates of effect size and variation for efficacy, as well as feasibility information.&#xD;
      These estimates can be used to design a larger, more definitive clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to incident SBI distribution will be compared between the clopidogrel and aspirin&#xD;
      arms using a log-rank test. Adverse event will be compared between the treatment groups using&#xD;
      a Chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test for rare events. Analyses will be based on the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle. A separate per-protocol analysis, analyzing data from all&#xD;
      patients who adhered to the study medication will be performed. No formal interim efficacy&#xD;
      analyses will be performed. Data quality, protocol implementation, retention and patient&#xD;
      adherence and adverse events will be summarized every six months. Statistical significance&#xD;
      will be set at p&lt;0.05. A multiple imputation method will be used to impute missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that treatment with clopidogrel at standard dose for secondary&#xD;
      stroke prevention will lead to a significant decrease in the incidence of SBIs as compared to&#xD;
      treatment with aspirin. The current data will provide proof of concept for future larger&#xD;
      trials with more extended follow-up time that are able to also evaluate reduction on key&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes, such as stroke, myocardial infarction and sudden death. In addition,&#xD;
      key data regarding clinical and imaging features of patients with SBI and progression of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment will be obtained.&#xD;
