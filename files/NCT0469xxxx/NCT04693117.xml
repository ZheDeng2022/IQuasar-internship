  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to investigate the effectiveness of interval training and to&#xD;
      evaluate the best available method for measuring body composition and functional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty obese subjects consecutively voluntarily participated in the current study. They&#xD;
      ranked sedentary according to their level of activity (≥ 30-minute moderate physical activity&#xD;
      3days/wk). The training sessions were divided into the warm-up phase, training phase and a&#xD;
      cool-down phase. The training programs were completed 3days/week for 12 weeks. Body&#xD;
      composition was calculated by skinfold thickness method and bio-impedance before and after&#xD;
      training. Similarly, aerobic capacities were measured by lactate threshold testing and by&#xD;
      Astrand submaximal testing.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The functional capacity was assessed by lactate threshold level and by Astrand submaximal testing by using standardized protocol.&#xD;
Lactate inflection point (LIP), is the exercise intensity at which the blood concentration of lactate and/or lactic acid begins to increase rapidly. It is often expressed as 85% of maximum heart rate or 75% of maximum oxygen intake.</description>

    <measure>Anthropometric measurement (Lean body mass)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Lean body mass:Lean body mass is calculated as the difference between total body weight and body fat weight, or more simply, the weight of everything except the fat. The range of lean body mass considered to be healthy is around 70% - 90% with women being towards the lower end of the range and men higher.</description>

    <measure>Functional Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The functional capacity was assessed by Astrand submaximal testing by using standardized protocol.&#xD;
The Astrand Test is a submaximal cycle ergometer aerobic fitness test best suited in rehabilitation and health purposes. description: Athletes pedal on a cycle ergometer at a constant workload for 7 minutes. Heart rate is measured every minute, and the steady state heart rate is determined.</description>

    <description>Participants were voluntarily participated by non-probability consecutive sampling. It was a one group study with a limitation of non-randomization. The interventional group had performed interval training for 12 weeks, 3 days/week (figure 1). They sedentary conferring to activity level (≥ 30-minute, 3 days/weeks, moderate-intensity physical activity). They were not participated in any interval training program before participating in the study from six months. Written consent was taken after demonstration of the purpose, procedure, and related pros and cons. They were instructed to participate regularly in interval training.</description>

    <description>All individual of interventional group participated in an interval training program, which comprised of 3 days/week for twelve weeks. A booklet was given to each participant containing instructions and guideline about interval training. The interval training program was introduced as prescribed previously.17 After the workout, a cool down period of 5 minutes was given during which they perform paddling with low speed. All training program was supervised by a qualified physical therapist.</description>
