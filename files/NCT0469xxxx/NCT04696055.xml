  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people suffering from liver cancer which&#xD;
      may have spread to nearby tissue and is unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment&#xD;
      (advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC). Before a treatment can be approved for&#xD;
      people to take, researchers do clinical trials to better understand its safety and how it&#xD;
      works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the researchers will learn more about the trial treatment, regorafenib, in a&#xD;
      small number of participants. They will study the results when the trial treatment is taken&#xD;
      with another cancer treatment called pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 parts to this trial. The part 1 (pilot phase) will include about 52 men and&#xD;
      women. The part 2 (expansion phase) will include about 67 men and women. All of the&#xD;
      participants will have HCC and will be aged 18 years or older. All of the participants will&#xD;
      have tried other treatments that did not help their HCC. These other treatments (PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors) are designed to work by stopping the activity of certain&#xD;
      proteins in the immune system thought to play a role in HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both parts of the trial, the participants will take regorafenib and receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. In the pilot phase, there will be 2 groups of participants. The group that&#xD;
      each participant joins will be based on the treatment they already received for their HCC.&#xD;
      The researchers will review the results in each group to learn if regorafenib and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab are helping one group of participants more than others. Outcome of this review&#xD;
      will determine the population to be treated in the expansion phase.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of HCC or non-invasive diagnosis of HCC as&#xD;
             per American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria in cirrhotic&#xD;
             participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresectable advanced HCC eligible for systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have progressed after only one prior line of systemic immunotherapy&#xD;
             treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb administered either as monotherapy or in&#xD;
             combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies. A wash out period of&#xD;
             at least 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, must be completed for&#xD;
             eligibility in this trial. PD-1/PD-L1 treatment progression is defined by meeting all&#xD;
             of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Has received at least 2 doses of an approved anti PD-1/PD-L1 mAb or received&#xD;
                  PD-1/PD-L1 treatment for 8 weeks, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has demonstrated disease progression after PD-1/PD-L1 treatment as defined by&#xD;
                  RECIST 1.1. In the absence of rapid clinical progression, the initial evidence of&#xD;
                  RECIST 1.1 disease progression is to be confirmed using iRECIST by a second&#xD;
                  assessment no less than four weeks from the date of the first documented&#xD;
                  progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. This determination is made by the investigator. Once progressive disease is&#xD;
             confirmed, the initial date of RECIST 1.1 progressive disease documentation will be&#xD;
             considered that date of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. In cases of unequivocal clinical or radiological progression, disease progression&#xD;
        confirmation may not be required after documented discussion and approval by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        c. Progressive disease has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of&#xD;
        anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Participants who receive anti-PD-1 therapy as adjuvant treatment following complete&#xD;
        resection of liver cancer and have disease recurrence (unresectable locoregional disease or&#xD;
        distant metastases) are eligible if they progressed while on active treatment or within 6&#xD;
        months of stopping anti-PD-1 therapy. This will be considered the first line of systemic&#xD;
        therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For these participants, the following applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. a second assessment to confirm disease progression beyond recurrence is not required;&#xD;
             and&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. they must have received at least 2 prior doses of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Liver function status should be Child-Pugh (CP) Class A within 7 days prior to&#xD;
                  the first dose of study intervention. CP status should be calculated based on&#xD;
                  clinical findings and laboratory results during the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1&#xD;
                  within 7 days prior to the first dose of study intervention.&#xD;

                  lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to&#xD;
                  other loco-regional therapy, may be considered measurable if there has been&#xD;
                  demonstrated progression in the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with controlled (treated) hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection will be&#xD;
                  allowed if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Antiviral therapy for HBV must be given for at least 4 weeks and HBV viral&#xD;
                       load must be less than 500 IU/mL prior to first dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Participants on active HBV therapy with viral loads under 500 IU/ml should&#xD;

                       antiviral prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Provision of recent tumor tissue (as defined below) is mandatory at screening.&#xD;
                  Exceptions will be accepted for participants with no recent baseline tumor&#xD;
                  tissues after documented discussion and approval by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Tumor tissue obtained within 180 days of enrollment and after the last dose&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research. Information on the Bayer criteria for listing studies and other relevant information is provided in the Study sponsors section of the portal.</ipd_description>
