  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out about how obtaining consent for procedures&#xD;
      in the PICU affects parental/caregiver stress. The researchers think that alleviating some of&#xD;
      the uncertainly of a PICU stay by discussing types of procedural support offered and&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent prior to their immediate necessity may help decrease stress&#xD;
      experienced by caregivers. This study will allow the researchers to learn more about it.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Having a child admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is a deeply challenging&#xD;
      and stressful experience for parents and caregivers. Despite the high survival when compared&#xD;
      to adult ICUs, a PICU admission can have meaningful long-term, negative health consequences&#xD;
      for adult caregivers including symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. There is little&#xD;
      known in regards to what specific factors impact the mental health of parents/caregivers of&#xD;
      PICU patients. However, research into stress and anxiety has suggested that uncertainty is a&#xD;
      significant contributor to stress when faced with a new environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual informed consent for procedures performed in the PICU is obtained immediately prior to&#xD;
      the procedure. Participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to either&#xD;
      usual informed consent prior to each procedure or to a single consent form obtained upon&#xD;
      admission to PICU for possible procedures their child may undergo. In this study participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a survey at two separate times during the child's PICU&#xD;
      hospitalization- 48-72 hours after admission and again upon transfer or discharge from the&#xD;
      PICU. Data will be collected about the child from the medical record including age,&#xD;
      diagnosis/reason for PICU admission, length of stay, and any procedures performed in PICU&#xD;
      requiring consent.&#xD;

    <description>Stress will be assessed using the Short Stress Overload Scale (SOS-S). The SOS-S is a 10 item questionnaire. Items are rated not at all to a lot. Ratings are assigned a score and the scores are summed. Summed scores range from 10 - 50 with higher scores indicating greater stress. Parents may be asked to complete the questionnaire multiple times depending on how long their child is in the PICU.</description>
