  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to verify the significance of the inclusion of procedures of a comprehensive&#xD;
      therapeutic approach according to Eastern techniques to classical physiotherapy and to find&#xD;
      out whether these Eastern techniques can contribute to the enrichment of standard&#xD;
      physiotherapy. According to TCM and Ayurveda, another goal is to develop appropriate regimen&#xD;
      measures to create a yoga regimen suitable for patients who have renal and bladder&#xD;
      dysfunction according to TCM and whose main common symptom is chronic non-specific low back&#xD;
      pain. The study is based upon comparing a four-week physiotherapy program according to the&#xD;
      physician's indication and a physiotherapy program enriched with compiled regimen measures&#xD;
      and yoga exercises in selected probands.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Two groups of probands were used - an experimental and control group. There were 6 probands&#xD;
      in each group. The four-week therapy effect, which took place twice a week for 60 minutes,&#xD;
      was compared. The control group received physiotherapy, as indicated by the physician.&#xD;
      According to TCM and Ayurveda, the experimental group underwent physiotherapy as indicated by&#xD;
      a doctor enriched with yoga exercises and regime measures. It was asked to perform yoga&#xD;
      exercises daily at home. The therapy's effect was evaluated using the Short-form-36&#xD;
      Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire (HRQoL), the VAS scale of pain intensity, the&#xD;
      number of responses in the anamnestic questionnaire the author compiled the kinesiological&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
