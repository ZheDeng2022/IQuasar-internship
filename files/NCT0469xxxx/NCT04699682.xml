    <textblock>
      The propias, and more recently the update of the recommendations relating to the control of&#xD;
      the spread of bacteria highly resistant to emerging antibiotics issued by the High Council of&#xD;
      Public Health (December 2019), recommend the implementation of measures to maintain the rate&#xD;
      of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPC) such as Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.&#xD;
      pneumoniae) isolated from bacteremia in healthcare establishments in France at less than 1%,&#xD;
      and that of Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) belonging to Enterococci Resistant to&#xD;
      Glycopeptides (ERG) such as Enterococcus faecium isolated from bacteremia in health&#xD;
      establishments in France at less than 1% also. At the same time, the prevalence of colonized&#xD;
      patients is increasing. One of the recommended measures concerns the fight against cross&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high technicality of the treatments, the risks of cross-transmission are very high&#xD;
      and present at each stage of the dialysis procedure. Screening and isolation of patients&#xD;
      colonized with emerging Highly Resistant Bacteria (BHRe) is essential to avoid their spread&#xD;
      and the risk of infection with these germs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening is done using rectal swabs. If the patient is found to be a carrier of BHRe, he&#xD;
      should be isolated. Isolation is made more difficult in the hemodialysis room due to their&#xD;
      architectural configuration, the organization of care and the chronicity of the patients.&#xD;
      Patients have a monthly sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The isolation is allowed after obtaining six consecutive negative rectal swabs, the number of&#xD;
      which has been arbitrarily defined. Indeed, the negativation of the samples does not confirm&#xD;
      the disappearance of the carriage (that is to say the presence of BHRe), hence the need to&#xD;
      repeat them. Persistence of colonization at a rate below the detection limit is possible.&#xD;
      With for corollaries:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolation which could be lifted more quickly in the event of real disappearance of the&#xD;
           strain since the investigators know that a prolonged period of isolation can lead to a&#xD;
           loss of opportunity for the patient and the investigators know its impact for the&#xD;
           patient, on the operation of the service and its cost, with in particular the increase&#xD;
           in withdrawals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolation lifted too early in the event of persistent carriage with risk of secondary&#xD;
           transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of this study is to determine the clearance of the carriage of BHRe, i.e. their&#xD;
      disappearance, in the chronic dialysis patient and to define, secondly, the factors&#xD;
      associated with the prolonged carriage corresponding to the presence of bacteria for more&#xD;
      than 3 months. , and elements of answer concerning the early disappearance of the EPC in the&#xD;
      event of co-colonization by ERG and EPC. The follow-up of this carriage for 1 year will make&#xD;
      it possible to evaluate the relapse corresponding to the reappearance of the bacteria&#xD;
      previously identified, the recolonization corresponding to the acquisition of a new BHR, or&#xD;
      the reinfection corresponding to an infection with a new highly resistant bacterium.&#xD;
