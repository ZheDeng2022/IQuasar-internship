  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The high prevalence of chronic pain in community-dwelling older adults requires&#xD;
      attention from nurses. The aim of the present study is to use a music-with-movement exercise&#xD;
      program to improve the pain situations of older adults with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to implement a music-with-movement exercise program (MMEP) for older&#xD;
      adults suffering from chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of a music-with-movement exercise program on improving the pain&#xD;
           intensity, pain self-efficacy, mood, and quality of life of the older adults with&#xD;
           chronic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the participants' level of adherence to the music-with-movement exercise by&#xD;
           using an exercise logbook and measurements of heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated outcomes: This study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial. An 8-week&#xD;
      music-with-movement exercise program will be used as the intervention for older adults with&#xD;
      chronic pain in District Elderly Centers in Hong Kong. It will consist of four sessions of&#xD;
      center-based, face-to-face activities and four weeks home-based and digital-based activities&#xD;
      delivered through a WhatsApp group. A music therapist, in consultation with the&#xD;
      physiotherapist, will lead the center-based activities. Each center-based session will&#xD;
      consist of 30 minutes of music-with-movement exercise and 10 minutes of instruction on pain&#xD;
      knowledge and pain management. Each participant will receive an exercise logbook to practice&#xD;
      and record the frequency of their engagement in the music-with-movement exercise at home.&#xD;
      They will receive WhatsApp reminders to remind them to continue the home-based sessions.&#xD;
      Outcome measures include pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, mood, heart rate and physical&#xD;
      activity intensity, and quality of life. Data will be collected before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. Participants need to complete the exercise logbook to record their adherence to&#xD;
      the intervention. The findings of this study will provide clinical implications for nurses to&#xD;
      integrate music with movement exercise to manage pain.&#xD;
