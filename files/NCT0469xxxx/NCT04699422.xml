  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess and compare the efficacy of a serratus anterior plane&#xD;
      (SAP) block and our current pain protocol (Patient Controlled Intravenous Analgesia with&#xD;
      opioids) in the prevention and treatment of acute postoperative pain after totally endoscopic&#xD;
      aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last two decades, cardiac surgical techniques changed dramatically. Evidence for&#xD;
      good short and long-term outcome after endovascular and minimally invasive procedures is&#xD;
      rising. The goal of avoiding sternotomy is earlier patient recovery without compromising&#xD;
      safety. Therefore, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have been implemented to&#xD;
      aim for early extubation and ambulation. Analgesic regimens after cardiac surgery did not&#xD;
      change significant however. Opioids remain the cornerstone of analgesia in the postoperative&#xD;
      cardiac surgical care units, despite known side effects as nausea, constipation and risk for&#xD;
      addiction. Neuraxial anesthetic techniques after cardiac surgery have been studied and&#xD;
      validated to reduce opioid consumption. Their implementation in clinical practice however&#xD;
      remains limited for two reasons. First, heparinization is required for cardiac surgery, which&#xD;
      increases the risk neuraxial hematoma after neuraxial anesthesia, leading to deleterious&#xD;
      complications as paraplegia. Secondly, neuraxial anesthesia induces orthosympathicolysis,&#xD;
      enhancing vasoplegia after cardiac surgery. However, fascial plane blocks in cardiac surgery&#xD;
      since peripheral blocks do not induce sympathicolysis and consequences of chest wall hematoma&#xD;
      are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, Blanco described the serratus anterior plane (SAP) block as an analgesic option for&#xD;
      chest wall surgery. In this fascial plane block, local anesthetics are injected in the plane&#xD;
      beneath the anterior serratus muscle and in the plane between latissimus dorsi and serratus&#xD;
      anterior in an ultrasound guided manner. SAP block provides analgesia in dermatomes T2-T9.&#xD;
      Recently, successful analgesia after SAP block has been demonstrated for soft tissue chest&#xD;
      wall surgery, thoracotomy and rib fractures. No major side effects were reported. More&#xD;
      specifically, no sympatholytic effects or chest wall hematoma were observed. However, up to&#xD;
      now no prospective studies assessing the analgesic efficacy of SAP block after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery are published. Two retrospective studies show conflicting results. Berthoud et al.&#xD;
      retrospectively compared SAP block to continuous wound infusion after different types of&#xD;
      minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) and found reduced morphine consumption as well as&#xD;
      shorter intensive care and hospital length of stay after SAP block. In contrast, Moll et al.&#xD;
      found no difference in opioid consumption between SAP block and no block in patients after&#xD;
      robotic coronary artery bypass grafting (rCABG). The authors comment they only performed the&#xD;
      deep component of the SAP block, and some surgical entry points were outside dermatomes&#xD;
      T2-T7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a novel minimally invasive&#xD;
      cardiosurgical technique. Surgical incision is made anteriorly in intercostal space two on&#xD;
      the right hemithorax. Since intercostal space two is innervated by dermatomes T2-T3, somatic&#xD;
      analgesia can be obtained with SAP block. In addition with a favorable safety profile and a&#xD;
      minimal/non-existent risk of evoking sympatholytic effects, a SAP block may be a suitable&#xD;
      analgesic technique to prevent/minimize postoperative pain after totally endoscopic AVR&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
