  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a pilot 4-week at home study with 48 individuals with stroke&#xD;
      and 10 therapists working with stroke patients to examine the feasibility and effect of a&#xD;
      wearable focal muscle vibration device on upper limb strength and function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke often leads to significant impairment of upper limb function and is associated with&#xD;
      decreased quality of life. Patients have difficulty moving out of the upper extremity flexion&#xD;
      synergies that often dominate attempts to function after stroke. Change in muscle activation&#xD;
      is the key underlying factor. Despite study results from several interventions for muscle&#xD;
      activation and motor coordination, wide-scale adoption remains largely elusive due to the&#xD;
      lack of sustainability of those interventions. The main reasons for the unsustainability are&#xD;
      under-doses of the interventions and low patient compliance and participation. Recent studies&#xD;
      among individuals without disabilities as well as those with strokes have shown that with&#xD;
      focal vibration, there is greater potential to increase and coordinate muscle recruitment and&#xD;
      build muscle strength and endurance. This form of treatment could widely benefit stroke&#xD;
      patients and therapists who are in need of sustainable intervention that is effective and&#xD;
      efficient to building muscle work capacity for function. Thus, the aims of this study are to&#xD;
      evaluate the usability and feasibility of a novel vibration-based wearable device for upper&#xD;
      limb rehabilitation in stroke patients. Forty-eight stroke patients and 10 therapists working&#xD;
      with those stroke patients will be recruited to evaluate the usability of the device. All&#xD;
      stroke patients will participate in a 4-week in-home vibration treatment to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the device. Patients will be randomized into four groups receiving vibrations&#xD;
      with different frequency (60 Hz or 120 Hz) and amplitude (0.2mm or 2mm). All groups will&#xD;
      follow a prescribed dose of vibration based on the therapists' recommendations. Strength and&#xD;
      functional outcomes will be measured before and after the 4-week in-home intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that all groups will show an increase in grip strength and upper&#xD;
      limb function at the end of study compared to baseline and that the increases in outcomes&#xD;
      will be different in different groups. The investigators also expect all participants will&#xD;
      tolerate the wearable device without adverse side effects and report high levels of&#xD;
      satisfaction with the device. This pilot study may help to develop a novel sustainable&#xD;
      wearable system providing vibration-based muscle activation for upper limb function&#xD;
      rehabilitation. It may provide patients opportunity to apply the prescribed vibratory stimuli&#xD;
      in-home and/or at community settings. It may also allow therapists to monitor treatment usage&#xD;
      and patient performance and to adjust the treatment doses based on progression.&#xD;
