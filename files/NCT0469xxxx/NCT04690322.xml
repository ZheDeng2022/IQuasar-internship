  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized control trial in which each patient will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either extended half-life factor VIII based replacement therapy or&#xD;
      non-FVIII based replacement therapy, which are both standard of care treatment for persons&#xD;
      with Hemophilia A.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out if there is a difference in the way children with&#xD;
      hemophilia A form a clot and also evaluate if they develop tiny bleeds within the joint and&#xD;
      subsequently early joint changes when receiving extended half-life factor VIII based&#xD;
      replacement therapy vs non-FVIII based replacement as part of their hemophilia treatment to&#xD;
      prevent spontaneous joint bleeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both therapies are standard of care therapies for patients with hemophilia A. The only&#xD;
      experimental/research procedures as part of this study include the thrombin generation assay&#xD;
      and ultrasound. All other procedures are standard of care.&#xD;
