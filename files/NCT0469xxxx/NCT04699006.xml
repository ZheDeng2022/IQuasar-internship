  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the second fatal gynecological cancer. More than 70% of ovarian cancer&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed as advanced. Olaparib is the first oral poly adenosine&#xD;
      diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PAPPi) approved by the U.S. Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) in December 2014. It can be used as a maintenance treatment for adult patients with&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer after platinum-containing chemotherapy has achieved complete or partial&#xD;
      remission. At present, most studies based on olaparib are randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCTs). Because RCTs often have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and they are&#xD;
      implemented in a highly standardized environment. Its internal validity is high, but the&#xD;
      research results may not be able to be extrapolated to practice. This study is a prospective&#xD;
      real world study. In this study, based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST 1.1), we evaluate the use of olaparib in patients with ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer in the progression-free survival (PFS),&#xD;
      overall survival (OS), and objective control rate (ORR), etc. At the same time, the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of olaparib and the impact on the quality of life of patients are evaluated.&#xD;
      Finally, we analyze the results as a supplement to the conclusions of randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials to provide better guidance for patients.&#xD;

      1. Research status at domestic and foreign&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ovarian cancer is the second fatal gynecological cancer. More than 70% of ovarian cancer&#xD;
           patients are diagnosed as advanced. Standard treatments include optimal reduction&#xD;
           surgery and platinum/taxane chemotherapy. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most&#xD;
           common histological type of ovarian cancer, up to 20% of high-grade serous ovarian&#xD;
           cancer (HGSOC) shows germline and/or somatic mutations in the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene. BRCA1&#xD;
           and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes that play a central role in repairing DNA&#xD;
           double-strand breaks (DSBS) through homologous recombination (HR). Due to their&#xD;
           increased sensitivity to DNA damage reagents, they extend the survival period of BRCA1&#xD;
           and BRCA2 mutant EOCs, among which BRCA2 vectors have the best survival rate.&#xD;
           Poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase 1 is a key ribozyme involved in&#xD;
           single-strand break (SSB) repair through the base excision repair pathway. In the&#xD;
           absence of poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase(PARP) activity, these lesions&#xD;
           are considered to have transformed into DSB. Cells lacking HR, such as BRCA mutant&#xD;
           cells, are extremely sensitive to PARP inhibition. This phenomenon called &quot;synthetic&#xD;
           lethality&quot; has led people to study poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase&#xD;
           inhibitors (PARPi) used as therapeutic agents in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Olaparib is the first oral PARPi approved in the United States in December 2014 for the&#xD;
           fourth-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations. In the early&#xD;
           development of PARPi olaparib, studies have found that platinum sensitivity seems to be&#xD;
           related to a higher objective response rate between BRCA carriers and non-carriers.&#xD;
           Gelmon et al. designed a phase II randomized trial Study 19, which evaluated the&#xD;
           efficacy of olaparib and placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with&#xD;
           platinum-sensitive serous ovarian cancer recurrence. Compared with the placebo group,&#xD;
           the median progression-free survival (PFS) of the olaparib group was significantly&#xD;
           longer (8.4 months for the olaparib group and 4.8 months for the placebo group (HR=0.35;&#xD;
           [95) % credibility interval (CI) =0.25-0.49]; p&lt;0.001). Post-hoc analysis showed that&#xD;
           among BRCA germline mutations (gBRCA) carriers, the improvement of PFS in the olaparib&#xD;
           group was greater (HR≤0.18; [95%CI=0.10-0.31]; p &lt;0.0001). The SOLO2 study is a&#xD;
           randomized, controlled phase III randomized controlled trial, which further confirmed&#xD;
           the findings of patients with gBRCA mutations in Study 19. At present, based on the&#xD;
           latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and guidelines for the&#xD;
           clinical application of PAPPi for ovarian cancer, the first-line recommends&#xD;
           PARPi+bevacizumab (Bev) maintenance therapy, and PARPi maintenance therapy is the&#xD;
           standard treatment for platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The above-mentioned studies based on olaparib are mostly randomized controlled trials&#xD;
           (RCTs). Because RCTs often have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, they are&#xD;
           carried out in a highly standardized environment, so that the research subjects have&#xD;
           good homogeneity. The validity is high, but the research results may not be able to be&#xD;
           extrapolated to practice. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the role of treatments&#xD;
           for advanced diseases in the real world. To provide better guidance for patients,&#xD;
           real-world evidence is needed to make up for the lack of randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
           At present, in real-world researches, there are only retrospective studies on the use of&#xD;
           olaparib in ovarian cancer at home and abroad, and the results are consistent with its&#xD;
           corresponding RCTs. There is a lack of prospective real-world evidence with higher&#xD;
           levels of evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
           The drug name is olaparib tablets. This product is a film-coated tablet. 1)150mg: green&#xD;
           to green/gray, oval, biconvex tablets, with &quot;OP150&quot; engraved on one side and blank on&#xD;
           the other side. 2)100mg: yellow to dark yellow, oval, biconvex tablets, with &quot;OP100&quot;&#xD;
           engraved on one side and blank on the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research programs&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Overall design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is a prospective real-world product registration study. It is an&#xD;
           observational study. The main research content is to evaluate the efficacy and adverse&#xD;
           reactions of PARPi olaparib in patients with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or&#xD;
           primary peritoneal cancer. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we collect&#xD;
           various information of the target research participants, and organize the data and&#xD;
           perform statistical analysis under the guidance of epidemiologists and statistical&#xD;
           experts. The curative effect is evaluated by indicators such as PFS, overall survival&#xD;
           (OS), and objective response rate (ORR). Moreover, we collect and analyze the adverse&#xD;
           reactions of study participants after taking olaparib. 20ml blood samples and surgically&#xD;
           removed histological samples of enrolled patients are collected (only for enrolled&#xD;
           patients who agree to blood sampling) for exploratory biological marker research and&#xD;
           exploratory pharmacogenetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           This research is an observational study. 245 study participants are expected to be&#xD;
           included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3 Stratification factors&#xD;
&#xD;
           This research can set up different plans according to the following different&#xD;
           stratification factors and research purposes.1) Number of treatment lines: first-line&#xD;
           maintenance, second-line maintenance, back-line treatment, excess indications. 2)&#xD;
           BRCA1/2 mutation status: positive, negative. 3) Platinum sensitive status: platinum&#xD;
           sensitive, platinum resistant. 4) CA125 level, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.4 Treatment plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is a non-interventional study that only collects data and does not interfere&#xD;
           with clinical treatment. The medication is administered according to clinical&#xD;
           instructions, guidelines and local treatment routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research process&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Subject informed&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients should sign an informed consent form before the start of the study. The&#xD;
           researchers need to explain the contents of the informed consent to the subjects in&#xD;
           detail. After the candidate has fully read and understood the informed consent, if she&#xD;
           agrees to participate in the study, the subject should sign and date the informed&#xD;
           consent. Researchers also need to sign and date the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Interview on selection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within 7 days of the subjects' enrollment, the investigator collected baseline data,&#xD;
           including: general information; medical history diagnosis; past tumor treatment history;&#xD;
           family history; whether it meets the admission criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Interview during treatment and the last interview&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the subjects are enrolled, the investigator will conduct a visit every 12 weeks.&#xD;
           The data include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Efficacy evaluation: CT/MRI imaging examination and tumor marker CA125 examination&#xD;
                are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety evaluation: whether there are adverse events (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At baseline, at the same time as the RECIST assessment time (once every 12 weeks)&#xD;
                until the objective radiation disease progression or the end of the study treatment&#xD;
                interview, a functional assessment of cancer treatment-ovarian cancer (FACT-O)&#xD;
                questionnaire survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Definition of Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           AE refers to all the adverse medical events that occur after the subject receives the&#xD;
           experimental drug. It can be manifested as symptoms and signs, diseases or abnormal&#xD;
           laboratory tests, but it may not be causally related to the experimental drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Severity of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the study period, the severity of AEs will be classified according to Common&#xD;
           Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, and AE of grade ≥3 will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Relationship with study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
           When judging the correlation between AEs and study drugs, the following factors should&#xD;
           be considered: 1) It is definitely related; 2) It may be related; 3) Possibly&#xD;
           irrelevant; 4) Definitely irrelevant; 5) Undecidable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4 Adverse event records&#xD;
&#xD;
           All adverse events that occur from the subject's first use of olaparib to 4 weeks after&#xD;
           the last dose, including observed by the investigator, obtained by inquiries, and&#xD;
           spontaneously reported by the subject should be fully recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Researchers need to continue to follow up all AEs until the event is cured, returns to&#xD;
           baseline, reaches a stable state, or no more information is available. The researcher&#xD;
           needs to monitor and record the outcome of the AE in the subject's source file. After&#xD;
           the study, there is no need to actively collect new AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Drug management&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is a real-world study, and olaparib is a marketed drug, so olaparib needs to&#xD;
           be purchased and used by patients according to the normal procedures in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Data recording and monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.1 Data logging&#xD;
&#xD;
           This project uses table records. According to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements,&#xD;
           in order to ensure patient privacy, patient names should not appear. All patients' names&#xD;
           should be filled with name codes, and the codes should be abbreviated in Chinese name.&#xD;
           The specific dosage and time of medication are unknown, and should be filled in unknown&#xD;
           rather than blank or missing items. The researcher should ensure that all data must be&#xD;
           consistent with the &quot;inpatient medical record&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.2 Data monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the test process, the research unit will review the completed test case data,&#xD;
           check whether the data is correct, complete and standardized, and assess the&#xD;
           traceability of all data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 Definition of statistical analysis data sets&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study includes cases that have received at least one trial drug and have a safety&#xD;
           evaluation into the primary and secondary endpoint analysis. Those who have not used a&#xD;
           trial drug or have no research data after being selected can be eliminated. Excluded&#xD;
           cases should be kept for future reference and no statistical analysis should be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 Statistical analysis methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           The continuous variables in this study are described by median and interquartile range.&#xD;
           Categorical variables are described by absolute value and the proportion of the total&#xD;
           number of patients. Χ2 test are used for comparison between groups. The method of&#xD;
           survival analysis is used to statistically process the follow-up data. Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
           method is used to draw the survival curve of the follow-up subjects. Log-Rank test was&#xD;
           used to evaluate the survival difference between each group. Cox regression model was&#xD;
           used to analyze the influencing factors of the survival time of each group of follow-up&#xD;
           subjects. Candidate influencing factors with a significance level of 0.05 in the&#xD;
           univariate analysis were selected into the multivariate analysis. For all analyses, the&#xD;
           test level α=0.05, when p&lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. All analyses&#xD;
           were performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) software (version&#xD;
           22.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Quality control and quality assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      All research processes should establish standardized operating procedures.&#xD;
