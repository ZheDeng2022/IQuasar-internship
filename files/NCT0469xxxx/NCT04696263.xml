  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different techniques to perform the standard of&#xD;
      care surgery to treat prostate cancer. This surgery is called robotic radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
      There are two robotic surgical systems approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to&#xD;
      perform this surgery. First system is called the Da Vinci ® Xi system. With this system, six&#xD;
      small incisions are made during the surgery. Second system is called the Da Vinci ® SP&#xD;
      system. With this system a single incision is made during the surgery. Same surgery is done&#xD;
      with each surgical system. This study aims to understand whether a single incision surgery&#xD;
      ends up with better recovery after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Scar evaluation by using a validated assessment tool, the Participant and Observer Scar Assessment Scale.17 It consists of two scales: the observer scale and the participant scale (Figs. 1 and 2). Both scales contain six items that are scored numerically. Each of the six items on both scales has a 10-step score, with 10 indicating the worst imaginable scar or sensation. The total score of both scales consists of adding the scores of each of the six items (range, 6 to 60). The lowest score, 6, reflects normal skin, whereas the highest score, 60, reflects the worst imaginable scar.</description>
