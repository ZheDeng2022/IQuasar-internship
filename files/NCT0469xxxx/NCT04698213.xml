      This study aims to test if patients achieving a tumor response with the combination of&#xD;
      axitinib plus avelumab, can discontinued the axitinib in order to delay the resistance to the&#xD;
      anti VEGFR-TKI and decrease the related toxicity of the combination therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Axitinib is an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently approved in EU for&#xD;
      treatment of patients affected by metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) progressed after&#xD;
      another anti VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axitinib inhibits the proangiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF), thereby exerting an anti-angiogenic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against the human&#xD;
      immunosuppressive ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein, with potential immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, avelumab binds to&#xD;
      PD-L1 and prevents the interaction of PD-L1 with its receptor programmed cell death protein 1&#xD;
      (PD-1). This inhibits the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may&#xD;
      restore immune function through the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) targeted to&#xD;
      PD-L1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, avelumab induces an antibody-dependent&#xD;
      cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-1, a cell surface&#xD;
      receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on T cells, negatively&#xD;
      regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligand, and plays an&#xD;
      important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. PD-L1, a transmembrane protein, is&#xD;
      overexpressed on a variety of tumor cell types and is associated with poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of axitinib plus avelumab has been recently reported to be better than&#xD;
      sunitinib alone for treatment of previously untreated mRCC patients (Motzer RJ, et al. NEJM&#xD;
      2019). The study reported a median PFS of 13.8 for the combination of axitinib plus avelumab&#xD;
      compared to 8.4 months for sunitinib (p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the treatment related toxicity, a previous study suggests that the discontinuation&#xD;
      of the TKI in patients achieving a tumor response may lead to a longer definitive progression&#xD;
      free survival (22.4 months) and overall survival (34.8 months) with a better safety profile&#xD;
      (Ornstein MC et al. JCO 2017). Despite the new response to TKI after its reintroduction, the&#xD;
      majority of patients progressed after the first months of treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      suggesting the necessity to maintain the tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test if patients achieving a tumor response with the combination of&#xD;
      axitinib plus avelumab, can discontinued the axitinib in order to delay the resistance to the&#xD;
      anti VEGFR-TKI and decrease the related toxicity of the combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II trial with a partial treatment discontinuation design in patients who&#xD;
      achieved tumor decrease greater than 30% compared to baseline during the first 36 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the trail will receive axitinib at 5 mg BID plus avelumab at 10&#xD;
      mg/Kg every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be continued until progression of disease during the first 36 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy. At week 36, patients achieving a tumor decrease ≥ 30% will discontinue axitinib and&#xD;
      continue avelumab until progression of disease defined as ≥ 20% increase compared to the&#xD;
      tumor burden measured at week 36. At disease progression, axitinib will be restarted at the&#xD;
      same dosage used before discontinuation for at least 24 weeks if progression did not occur&#xD;
      before. Patients who achieved again tumor decrease of ≥ 30% after 24 weeks of therapy&#xD;
      rechallenge with axitinib and avelumab may discontinue axitinib and maintain avelumab until&#xD;
      progression of disease in an intermittent manner.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the health status of the subjects during the study treatment the &quot;5-Level EuroQol Group's 5-Dimension&quot; (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire will be administered to the patients within 3 days prior the first study treatment, the first day of each odd cycle (1, 3, 5, etc.) of avelumab, prior to treatment administration, and at the end of treatment visit.&#xD;
This questionnaire consists of 2 parts, the EQ-5D index (or simply EQ-5D) and EQ-VAS. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression). A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the 5 dimensions and is converted to a single summary index or health utility value. The EQ-VAS is a visual analog scale where the patient indicates how good or bad his health is today by marking an appropriate point on a line between 0 to 100, which correspond to the worst and best imaginable health states.</description>

                  Complete healing of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed before the start&#xD;
                  of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             III. Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis of &gt; 0.5 teaspoon&#xD;
             (2.5 ml) of red blood, or other history of significant bleeding (eg, pulmonary&#xD;
             hemorrhage) within 3 months before the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             IV. Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endobronchial disease manifestation.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Active infection requiring systemic treatment, infection with human&#xD;
                  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-&#xD;
                  related illness, or chronic hepatitis B or C infection (Hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#xD;
                  or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening [positive HBV surface antigen&#xD;
                  or HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening test positive]).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Malabsorption syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Major surgery (eg, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 3 months&#xD;
             before the start of treatment. Complete wound healing from major surgery must have&#xD;
             occurred 1 month before the start of treatment and from minor surgery (eg, simple&#xD;
             excision, tooth extraction) at least 10 days before the start of treatment. Subjects&#xD;
             with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 msec within 1&#xD;
             month before the start of treatment (see Section 5.5.4 for Fridericia formula). Three&#xD;
             ECGs must be performed. If the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is&#xD;
             ≤ 500 msec, the subject meets eligibility in this regard.&#xD;

             agent. Patients with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or hyperthyroid&#xD;
             diseases not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following: a. intranasal,&#xD;
             inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular&#xD;
             injection); b. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone&#xD;
             or equivalent; c. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT&#xD;
             scan premedication).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has a history of substance abuse or medical, psychological, or social conditions that&#xD;
             may interfere with the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study&#xD;
