  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity for LifeKit Prevent&#xD;
      Colorectal Neoplasia Test for colorectal cancer (CRC) and for adenoma, including advanced&#xD;
      adenoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects 40 years of age and older scheduled for a screening colonoscopy will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Subjects will collect a stool sample that will be tested by the LifeKit Prevent Colorectal&#xD;
      Neoplasia Test at a central laboratory and that will be tested using a commercially available&#xD;
      FIT. After sample collection, subjects will undergo a screening colonoscopy per standard of&#xD;
      care. Investigators will be blinded to the results of the LifeKit Prevent Colorectal&#xD;
      Neoplasia Test during the study; the LifeKit Prevent Colorectal Neoplasia Test and FIT&#xD;
      results will not be used for clinical management of subjects. Personnel performing the&#xD;
      colonoscopy and reports from the colonoscopy and personnel performing the histopathological&#xD;
      review of the tissue and/or any reports will remain blinded to the results of the LifeKit&#xD;
      Prevent Colorectal Neoplasia Test results.&#xD;
