  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the high recurrence of urolithiasis in patients, the search for less aggressive and&#xD;
      preventive treatments is increasingly necessary. Renalof® is presented as an alternative to&#xD;
      herbal medicine being a product that, due to its diuretic and demineralization properties of&#xD;
      kidney stones, has been widely used in this patient population, disintegrating and&#xD;
      eliminating calcium oxalate and struvite stones in a painless in the genitourinary system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the objective of determining the efficacy of this therapy, an observational,&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, single-blind, two-arm study was carried out: treatment group with&#xD;
      Renalof® and control group, placebo.&#xD;

      With the objective of determining the efficacy of this therapy, an observational,&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, single-blind, two-arm study was carried out: treatment group with&#xD;
      Renalof® and control group, placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group consists of 120 patients over 18 years of age, of both sexes, with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of urolithiasis less than 10 mm in diameter, present throughout the entire&#xD;
      reno-uretero-bladder path, diagnosed by ultrasound, renal CT and urography . The Renalof®&#xD;
      product was administered at a dose of 650 mg daily for 3 months and the presence of stones in&#xD;
      any location of the reno-ureteral tract was evaluated using one of the diagnostic means&#xD;
      mentioned in monthly consultations. The second group, treated with placebo corresponding to&#xD;
      35 people constituting 30% of the universe. The study period was from August 2019 to July&#xD;
      2020 at the Hospital Escuela Antonio Lenin Fonseca and the Seniors clinic, in the city of&#xD;
      Managua, Nicaragua.&#xD;

    <description>A total of 120 patients treated with the study product Renalof® at a dose of 650 mg twice daily were followed for 4 months. A preliminary analysis of the types of stones present in the study patients was performed according to the main compound, using a biophysical profile by biochemical analysis and the clinical characteristics, medical history and biochemical profile of the creatinine values of the test patients. Imaging and quality of life tests were carried out during the trial to check the efficacy and possible adverse effects of the test product in patients with kidney stones.</description>
