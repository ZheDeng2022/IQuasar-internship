  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Gladius First trial is designed as a single-centre, open, prospective, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial aimed to assess the efficiency and safety of coronary chronic total occlusion&#xD;
      (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using the antegrade wiring strategy with a&#xD;
      first-choice intermediate Gladius guidewire. To this end, consecutive patients referred to&#xD;
      CTO PCI with intended primary antegrade wire escalation strategy, will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      fashion to antegrade wiring starting with the Gladius guidewire or antegrade wiring using the&#xD;
      standard guidewire escalation strategy.&#xD;
