  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial compares cryoablation combined with stereotactic body radiation therapy to&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy alone to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      pain from cancer that has spread to the bones (bone metastases). Bone is a common site of&#xD;
      metastasis in advanced cancer, and bone metastases often result in debilitating&#xD;
      cancer-related pain. The current standard of care to treat painful bone metastases is&#xD;
      radiation therapy alone. However, many patients do not get adequate pain relief from&#xD;
      radiation therapy alone. Another type of therapy that may be used to provide pain relief from&#xD;
      bone metastases is cryoablation. Cryoablation is a procedure in which special needles are&#xD;
      inserted into the tumor site. These needles grow ice balls at their tips to freeze and kill&#xD;
      cancer cells. The goal of this trial is to compare how well cryoablation in combination with&#xD;
      radiation therapy works to radiation therapy alone when given to cancer patients to provide&#xD;
      pain relief from bone metastases.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of cryoablation in combination with stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) or SBRT only for the treatment of painful bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess for narcotics utilization by daily morphine equivalent dose. II. To assess&#xD;
      duration of pain response reported by International Pain Response Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess for local tumor control. IV. To assess for changes in patient quality of life&#xD;
      with Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess for adverse event rates. VI. To assess incidence and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events/toxicity. VII. To assess technical success for cryoablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the local microenvironmental changes following SBRT and cryoablation&#xD;
      combined with SBRT to bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy for 1 fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo cryoablation. Within 10 days after cryoablation, patients undergo&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy for 1 fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,&#xD;
      and 24 weeks.&#xD;
