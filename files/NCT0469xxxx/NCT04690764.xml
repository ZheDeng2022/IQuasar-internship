  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients have varying degrees of anxiety and fear before surgery. We believe that&#xD;
      preopertive anxiety levels have an effect on intraoperative hemodynamics and recovery and&#xD;
      affect intraoperative drug consumption. Inspired by this idea, we aimed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of preoperative anxiety on hemodynamics, recovery, and drug consumption in patients&#xD;
      undergoing total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) due to neuromuscular monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Preoperative anxiety has been reported in 60-80% of the patients who will&#xD;
      undergo surgery. Preoperative anxiety and fear may be due to the type of anesthesia, as well&#xD;
      as to the patient's previous experiences, personality traits, concerns about surgical&#xD;
      intervention, and postoperative pain. The anxiety levels of the patients can be affected by&#xD;
      various factors such as their previous experiences, the way they come to the hospital, their&#xD;
      gender, age, and the type of surgery they will undergo. The most widely used medical test for&#xD;
      anxiety measurement is the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scale developed by Spielberg&#xD;
      et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary aim of our study is to evaluate the effects of preoperative anxiety on&#xD;
      intraoperative hemodynamics and recovery, and the secondary aim is to determine its effect on&#xD;
      intraoperative drug consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that preoperative anxiety levels affect intraoperative&#xD;
      hemodynamics and recovery and affect intraoperative drug consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: The study was planned prospectively, observationally. In the&#xD;
      neurosurgery operating room of Sultan Abdülhamit Han Training and Research Hospital, patients&#xD;
      whose operation is planned to be performed under neuromonitoring between 1 September 2019 and&#xD;
      1 February 2021 will receive a preoperative Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)&#xD;
      questionnaire and anxiety scores will be recorded. Afterward, routine anesthesia induction&#xD;
      and follow-up will be performed for patients who are taken to the operating table. The&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety score will be compared with the data recorded after the operation&#xD;
      (hemodynamic data, total drug amount, recovery time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Patients undergoing TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia) due to&#xD;
      Neuromuscular monitoring during neurosurgery operation, aged 18-70, who are literate, who do&#xD;
      not have any psychiatric and neurological diseases, who are in ASA I and II class, Patients&#xD;
      who do not drink alcohol regularly will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients who do not agree to participate in the study, patients who can&#xD;
      not cooperate, patients using psychiatric drugs regularly and patients with chronic drug&#xD;
      habits will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 80 patients&#xD;

    <measure>Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire and anxiety scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery baseline to 1 week of postoperation</time_frame>
    <description>STAI measures anxiety. The questionnaire asks the patients how they feel and allows them to respond on a frequency scale that ranges from 1(not at all) to 4(almost always/very much so). Scores range from 20-80 and the higher the score the greater the anxiety level.</description>
