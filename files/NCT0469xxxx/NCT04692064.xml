  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center confirmatory clinical study is to verify the algorithm of mCVI® to&#xD;
      accurately capture pulse rate and respiratory rate in 20 healthy subjects in comparison to&#xD;
      commercially-available Masimo pulse oximeter devices. This is a non significant risk device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this confirmatory clinical study the mCVI® device is a mobile application used to simply&#xD;
      verify the algorithm when the mobile video reads a patients pulse rate and respiratory rate&#xD;
      while spontaneously breathing. There is no facial recognition technology. There is no&#xD;
      immediate feedback given to the research team to act upon or provide for further clinical&#xD;
      care decisions. In real time, the mCVI® device will be compared to two commercially available&#xD;
      Masimo pulse oximeter devices in a single visit.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical conditions that could compromise a participant's ability to provide for all&#xD;
             breathing samples, pedal the Cubii Pro elliptical, or follow instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medications that could compromise a participant's ability to participate in the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Excessive facial hair, facial deformities, or obstructions (like glasses or face&#xD;
