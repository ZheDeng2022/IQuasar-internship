  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a global, prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine if the use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) as an adjunctive imaging modality and&#xD;
      as an interventional treatment guide will result in a more accurate diagnosis of deep vein&#xD;
      occlusion (DVO), will guide optimal therapy, and will provide better clinical outcomes with&#xD;
      reduced cost of care for patients presenting with persistent venous leg ulcers (VLUs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 266 subjects presenting with venous ulcers that have&#xD;
      previously undergone ablation for superficial of and/or perforator venous disease followed by&#xD;
      at least 3 months of prescribed compression therapy prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 6 study visits for each subject that will be completed over a period lasting&#xD;
      approximately 24 months. Subjects will undergo a baseline/screening assessment (visit 1)&#xD;
      followed by an interrogation procedure (visit 2) if the subject is enrolled into the&#xD;
      interrogation arm. If the subject is randomized to the deferred interrogation arm, he/she&#xD;
      will have a hospital/office visit in lieu of the interrogation procedure, which will be&#xD;
      considered visit 2. For statistical purposes, the wound assessment performed at the index&#xD;
      procedure/hospital visit will be considered the baseline measurement. 30±14 days and 90±14&#xD;
      days after Visit 2, the subject will return to the office for a 1- and 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      visit, respectively. The subjects will return at 6- and 12-months post-index procedure/Visit&#xD;
      2 for follow-up assessments. The follow-up period for this study will be approximately 24&#xD;
      months, with a phone call only at 24-months post-index procedure/visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study has a planned enrollment period of 36 months and a planned study duration&#xD;
      period of 5.17 years&#xD;

    <measure>Rate of detection and difference in complete ulcer healing between the interrogation group and the deferred interrogation group</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of detection and difference in complete ulcer healing between the interrogation group and the deferred interrogation group at 3 months. Complete ulcer healing is defined by 100% epithelialization of the venous ulcer. Healing will not be assumed for any area of the wound where a scab is present.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite of the difference in deep venous obstruction (DVO) detection and the subsequent changes in treatment plan informed by IVUS compared to MPV.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Composite of the difference in DVO detection and the subsequent changes in treatment plan informed by IVUS compared to multiplanar venography (MPV). DVO is defined as ≥50% diameter reduction in the deep venous system as assessed by MPV or ≥50% reduction in cross-section area of the deep venous system assessed by IVUS. Changes in treatment plan will be assessed by use of a patient diary and follow up patient visits up to 24 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life scores using the EQ5D-5L as compared in both arms</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in QOL scores for both arms using the EQ5D-5L. The scale uses a scoring system of 0-100. Each response is assigned a number 1-5 and then added at the end to equal a number between 0-100. The higher the total, the better the score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life scores using the 36 Item Short Form question assessment as compared in both arms</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in QOL scores for both arms using the 36 Item Short Form question assessment. The responses are coded using a scoring key, then averaged to get a final score in each of the 8 categories utilized on the assessment. Items are scored ranging from 0-100. The higher the average, the better the score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical score using the Venous Ulcer Assessment (VCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in clinical score will be assessed using the VCSS. The VCSS consists of 10 questions, each response is scored on a scale of 0-3. The total score ranges between 0-30 and is used to assess changes in disease severity over time. A lower score is a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical classification using the Clinical Etiology and Anatomy Pathology classification system</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in clinical classification will be assessed using the Clinical Etiology and Anatomy Pathology (CEAP) scoring system. The system is designed to classify chronic venous disease. The clinical classification consists of 7 possibilities, ranging from 0-6, followed by sub categories to assign 1)symptoms, 2) etiologic classification, 3) anatomic classification, 4)pathophysiologic, and 5) anatomic segment classification. The lower the clinical classification score, the less severe the disease state.</description>

    <description>patients will first be evaluated with MPV (limited to 3 views). The prescribed course of treatment based on the MPV results will be documented and patients will then be evaluated using IVUS.

Any patients determined to still require venous stenting based on IVUS results will be stented accordingly using IVUS to guide stent placement.</description>
