  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) rare genetic disorder due by inactivating mutations in the&#xD;
      PHEX gene leading to increased levels in FGF-23. Elevated FGF-23 reduces renal phosphate&#xD;
      reabsorbtion and and limits 1-alpha hydroxylase driven Vitamin D activation, eventually&#xD;
      leading to phosphate wasting, defective bone mineralization and additional health issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burosumab is a recombinant fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody developed to treat XLH by&#xD;
      binding FGF23, thereby restoring normal phosphate homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BUR03 is a Phase 3b open-label, single-arm, single-center study to confirm the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Burosumab treatment in adult (age ≥18 years) XLH patients without upper age limit&#xD;
      and irrespective of baseline pain level and to further evaluate the efficacy in this cohort&#xD;
      and the assocaited effect of treatment on physical functioning, mobility and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims at enrolling and treating 34 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of XLH with&#xD;
      q4w s.c. injection of Burosumab 1mg/kg body weight over 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to attiain normal serum phosphorus levels, secondary objectives include&#xD;
      key parameters of physical function and activity, mobility and mineral homeostasis.&#xD;
