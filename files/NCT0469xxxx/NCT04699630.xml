  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of an antibody drug conjugate U3-1402 in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have received no prior anti-HER2 therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      U3-1302 is an antibody drug conjugate comprising a recombinant fully human anti HER3&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody linked to a linker containing topoisomerase I inhibitor. This study is a&#xD;
      phase II study of U3-1402 in subjects with MBC who have received no prior anti HER2 therapy.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part A and Part B). All enrolled subjects in part A&#xD;
      will undergo pretreatment biopsies to determine if subjects with particular biomarker&#xD;
      expression (ER/PR/HER2/HER3) show preliminary efficacy after an analysis is performed at 24&#xD;
      weeks. Part B will enroll subgroups of subjects that will be defined from part A based on&#xD;
      ER/PR/HER2/HER3 expression and will be evaluated for efficacy analysis.&#xD;
