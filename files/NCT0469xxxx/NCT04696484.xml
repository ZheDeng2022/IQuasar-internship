  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the feasibility of a new, brief intervention, the 'coopeRATE&#xD;
      Prompt', for informing conversations between patients and physicians in routine tele-health&#xD;
      and in-person adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) care. The coopeRATE Prompt is two questions designed&#xD;
      to elicit patients' concerns and goals to facilitate collaborative goal setting within the&#xD;
      health care visit. This is a prospective single arm study that will be conducted at four CF&#xD;
      care centers in the United States.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participating patients will be asked to complete two online surveys. The first survey, which&#xD;
      includes the coopeRATE Prompt intervention questions, is completed 1-4 days before their&#xD;
      upcoming healthcare visit. After completing this survey and before their visit, patients'&#xD;
      intervention responses are shared with their physician and, if requested, other members of&#xD;
      their care team. The second patient survey is completed within 24 hours after their&#xD;
      healthcare visit. Participating clinicians are asked to complete a single online survey&#xD;
      within one month after completion of patient data collection.&#xD;
