      The &quot;SMOB&quot; project intends to contribute to fill the gap with reliable and operational&#xD;
      outcome measures for type III and IV SMA. In analysing the reliability in imaging (spinal and&#xD;
      muscular), electrophysiology analysis (MUNIX), and evaluate the evolution of respiratory&#xD;
      function for 50 patients' cohort. The investigators would also take the opportunity to&#xD;
      collect biologic samples in order to investigate genetic markers and to assess quality of&#xD;
      life of patients by QoL-gNMD questionnaire. The investigators aim to build a database that&#xD;
      will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of a new therapy for adult SMA patients by&#xD;
      studying the natural history of the disease. The investigators have distributed the various&#xD;
      expertise in Work Package where several centers are involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is original in that it evaluates the parameters of qMRI and MUNIX in correlation&#xD;
      with blood biomarkers. To our knowledge, there are no quantitative MRI (spinal and muscular)&#xD;
      biomarkers and/or electrophysiological (MUNIX technique) highlighted for tracking the&#xD;
      progression of the adult form of SMA type III and IV. This pilot study would allow&#xD;
      identification of predictive markers of the disease progression, and to have validated,&#xD;
      sensitive to change and relevant measurement tools that could be used as endpoints in future&#xD;
      therapeutic trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by&#xD;
      degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons, atrophy of skeletal muscles, and generalized&#xD;
      weakness. It is caused by homozygous disruption of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene by&#xD;
      deletion, conversion, or mutation. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that&#xD;
      affects mostly children but also some adults. Motor neuron loss often results in severe&#xD;
      muscle weakness causing affected infants to die before reaching 2 years of age. There are&#xD;
      types I, II, and III that affect children, and Type IV that affects adults. The prevalence of&#xD;
      this rare disease is around 1/30 000 births.The disease is characterized by a slowly&#xD;
      progressive muscle weakness over many years in patients with a milder form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMA is caused by the loss of SMN1 and the retention of at least 1 copy of a highly homologous&#xD;
      SMN2. An alternative splicing event in the pre-mRNA arising from SMN2 results in the&#xD;
      production of low levels of functional SMN protein. Onset and severity of disease, and&#xD;
      therefore type, correlate mainly with SMN2 copy number (and theoretically with SMN protein&#xD;
      level) providing a molecular basis for the classification of the different subtypes of SMA.&#xD;
      Type III patients have 3-4 copies, and patients with type 4 usually have 4 copies or more.&#xD;
      About 30% of patients have type III SMA, which is associated with onset between ages 18&#xD;
      months and adulthood. By definition standing or walking without support is achieved, although&#xD;
      many patients lose these abilities later with disease progression (Zerres.K et al 1995).&#xD;
      Patients usually present with symptoms of falls, difficulty climbing stairs, and other&#xD;
      features of proximal weakness and respiratory deficit. Abnormal gait characteristics are&#xD;
      common in order to compensate for weakness, and many patients are able to continue ambulation&#xD;
      despite severe weakness. Foot deformity may be seen in ambulatory patients. Lifespan is&#xD;
      normal in SMA type III. Some classifications of SMA include an additional disease subtype at&#xD;
      the mild end of the continuum. In this case, patients may be classified as having type IV&#xD;
      SMA. Patients with type IV, representing less than 5% of SMA, are ambulatory and have the&#xD;
      mildest form of SMA. The presentation is very similar to type III and is distinguished solely&#xD;
      on later onset during adulthood (Zerres K. et al 1995, Piepers S. et al 2008). Though onset&#xD;
      of type IV is not clearly defined, it is often considered to be at age 30 or later. The&#xD;
      remarkably slow rate of progression of late onset SMA types IIIb and IV underlines that more&#xD;
      sensitive tools are needed to monitor muscle strength in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documenting functional status in SMA is important, since all patients show limitations in&#xD;
      daily functioning and the preservation or improvement is the goal for pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention. Regardless, precisely designed supportive, rehabilitative, and palliative care&#xD;
      can partly reduce the disease burden and alter the natural history. Treatment is designed to&#xD;
      address the primary and secondary effects of muscle weakness and should include management of&#xD;
      pulmonary complications, nutritional and gastrointestinal support, orthopedic care,&#xD;
      rehabilitative interventions, and end-of-life care. Standards of care for SMA are&#xD;
      established, but there is need for improved and more specific directives in this regard (Wang&#xD;
      CH et al 2007). It is important to understand the expected natural history of SMA to&#xD;
      anticipate and stratify risk, to monitor function with appropriate measures, to determine the&#xD;
      appropriate treatment options, and to delivery timely intervention. Proactive care and&#xD;
      treatment decision-making by the treatment team and family are of utmost importance.&#xD;
      Preclinical progress in the SMA field has been rapid since the identification of SMN1 as the&#xD;
      responsible gene in 1995 and by the creation of the first mouse model in 2000 (Hsieh-Li HM et&#xD;
      al, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical therapeutic trials have been performed in SMA without success. The first&#xD;
      very successful therapies in murine models of SMA were published in 2010 using gene therapy&#xD;
      to replace the SMN1 gene (Foust KD et al, 2010). Later a phase 1 trial was conducted using&#xD;
      systemic delivered AAV9 gene therapy to replace SMN1 in infants with SMA type I. A single&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of adeno-associated viral vector containing DNA coding for SMN resulted&#xD;
      in longer survival, superior achievement of motor milestones, and better motor function than&#xD;
      in historical cohorts (Mendell. R et al, 2017). More recently, development of antisense&#xD;
      oligonucleotide therapies that can modify SMN2 splicing to include exon 7 and produce&#xD;
      increased amounts of full length SMN protein has shown promising results. Nusinersen is an&#xD;
      antisense oligonucleotide. It has been developed for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy&#xD;
      (SMA). In the CHERISH trial, among children with later onset SMA, significant improvement in&#xD;
      motor function was observed with Nusinersen treatment as compared with a sham procedure.&#xD;
      Persons with later-onset SMA and their caregivers indicated that stabilization of their&#xD;
      current state would meet their therapeutic expectations and represent a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      response. In this trial, as in the ENDEAR trial for infantile-onset SMA (most likely to be&#xD;
      classified as SMA type 1), they found that Nusinersen had the capacity to produce meaningful&#xD;
      changes in the clinical course of SMA. In this trial, more than half the children in the&#xD;
      Nusinersen group had an increase from baseline to month 15 in the Hammersmith Functional&#xD;
      Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) score of at least 3 points (i.e., a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      improvement), which is uncommon among children with later-onset SMA (Mercuri E. et al, 2018).&#xD;
      This trial had some limitations, no adult form of SMA was considered. In the trial, 16% of&#xD;
      the enrolled children were 6 years of age or older. The results reported are consistent with&#xD;
      the results of previous open-label studies that enrolled children up to 15 years of age. The&#xD;
      studies showed that Nusinersen had positive effects in populations of children with SMA type&#xD;
      II or III that were broader and more heterogeneous than the population enrolled in this&#xD;
      trial. That is why it is important to explore the Nusinersen effects on type III and IV and&#xD;
      allow adult patients to benefit from this new therapy. For that it is essential to have&#xD;
      efficient biomarkers for evaluation of efficiency of Nusinersen as it remains somewhat&#xD;
      controversial given its high price and its highly invasive administration. In this&#xD;
      therapeutic evaluation context, the choice of outcome measures had a great importance.&#xD;
      Moreover, although advances have been made on SMA pathogenesis, there still are unknown&#xD;
      factors that could explain the variability of the disease's severity among patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;NH-SMA&quot; project intends to contribute to fill the gap with reliable and operational&#xD;
      outcome measures for type III and IV SMA. In analysing the reliability in imaging (spinal and&#xD;
      muscular), electrophysiology analysis (MUNIX), and evaluate the evolution of respiratory&#xD;
      function for 50 patients' cohort. The investigators would also take the opportunity to&#xD;
      collect biologic samples in order to investigate genetic markers and to assess quality of&#xD;
      life of patients by QoL-gNMD questionnaire. The investigators aim to build a database that&#xD;
      will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of a new therapy for adult SMA patients by&#xD;
      studying the natural history of the disease. The investigators have distributed the various&#xD;
      expertise in Work Package where several centers are involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is original in that it evaluates the parameters of qMRI and MUNIX in correlation&#xD;
      with blood biomarkers. To our knowledge, there are no quantitative MRI (spinal and muscular)&#xD;
      biomarkers and/or electrophysiological (MUNIX technique) highlighted for tracking the&#xD;
      progression of the adult form of SMA type III and IV. This pilot study would allow&#xD;
      identification of predictive markers of the disease progression, and to have validated,&#xD;
      sensitive to change and relevant measurement tools that could be used as endpoints in future&#xD;
      therapeutic trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to identify potential markers (clinical, biological, genetic,&#xD;
      imaging) of the health status evolution The health evolution will be assessed at 6, 12, 18&#xD;
      and 24-month post-inclusion. The primary point is the 24-month follow-up. The other points&#xD;
      will be retained as secondary points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health status evolution will be assessed using&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MFM-32 (gold standard, Motor Function Measure), RULM (Revised Upper Limb Module) HFMSE&#xD;
           (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded), SMAFRS (spinal muscular atrophy&#xD;
           functional rating scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle strength assessment (QMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gait speed, 30s sit to stand, climb 4 stairs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of Respiratory Functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life, pain, and fatigue assessment: QoL-NMD-V1, EVA, EVN, FSS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imagery: Muscular, spinal and cranial MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrophysiological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological and biochemical analyses: blood test samples, NF dosage, genetics,&#xD;
           proteomics, biobanking The main analyses currently used to determine the patient status&#xD;
           are the clinical examination, especially the MFM-32 score, which is the gold standard,&#xD;
           the RULM and the evaluation of the respiratory functions. The other analyses will bring&#xD;
           supplementary data. Their comparison to the usual analyses will allow us to see if it is&#xD;
           possible to detect more subtle changes in the patient status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to identify potential markers (clinical, biological, genetic,&#xD;
      imaging) of the treatment response in the subgroup of patients who will be treated The&#xD;
      treatment response will be assessed at 6, 12, 18 and 24- month post-inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment response will be assessed This study is a multicenter, prospective study, to&#xD;
      follow for 24 months a cohort of 100 patients aged from 18 to 70 and suffering from type III&#xD;
      and IV SMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of a prospective study is most likely to fulfill the objectives. Five evaluation&#xD;
      visits are planned at D0, M6, M12, M18 and M24. Two years follow-up is necessary because of&#xD;
      the variability and the rate of progression of this chronic disease. This period is also&#xD;
      appropriated to better estimate the clinically meaningful difference of the outcome measures&#xD;
      studied. Thus, a 24 month- follow-up will be conducted with a visit every one year. An&#xD;
      inter-visit questionnaire will be completed by phone once a year between 2 visits, to have a&#xD;
      more regular follow-up of the disease evolution and to minimize the number of patients lost&#xD;
      to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients will be included. The investigators estimate than 70 will be able to walk&#xD;
      independently and 30 in wheelchairs. About 40 type III patients will be treated with&#xD;
      Nusinersen during the 2 years follow-up and won't be evaluated for natural history of SMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will allow to approximate pertinent odd ratios regarding the primary (health&#xD;
      status evolution) and the secondary (treatment response) objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess markers of 1) health status evolution; 2) treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health status evolution will be assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 24-month post-inclusion. The&#xD;
      health status will be measured from many parameters (Clinical examination, Imagery,&#xD;
      Electrophysiological examination Biological and biochemical analyses) The treatment response&#xD;
      will be assessed in the subgroup of treated patients, at 6- 12- 18- and 24-month&#xD;
      post-inclusion. The response treatment will be assessed through the improvement of clinical&#xD;
      scores, and quality of life Predictive biomarkers of disease progression of type III and IV&#xD;
      SMA will be evaluated from the baseline to the end of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that this study will help to identify quantitative reliable markers that will&#xD;
      allow a better understanding of the disease progression and a better management and patient&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
