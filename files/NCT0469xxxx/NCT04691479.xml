    <textblock>
      A multicentre, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.The control group followed the usual&#xD;
      treatment, while the intervention group (PIMA) followed the treatment with an adapted and&#xD;
      flexible care plan depending on socio-demographic, clinical and psychological variables. The&#xD;
      treatment plan includes different channels (home, telephone, care center), a continuous&#xD;
      evaluation, and the use of the motivational interview in each of the interventions with the&#xD;
      patient. The main outcome was adherence. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, emotional&#xD;
      state, activities, social relationships, perceived competence and motivation.&#xD;

      The aim of this trial was to determine adherence to CPAP and health- related outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with OSA via a comprehensive and multidisciplinary program based on stratification&#xD;
      and individualized care plans, including the motivational interview.&#xD;

    <description>Educational and training program using motivational interview technical.&#xD;
Stratification labels: to determine the personalized intervention plan are obtained from two types of variables: personal and modulation variables. For psychological variables the Perceived Competence Evaluation Questionnaire validated in Adherence to CPAP in OSA (CEPCA) is used. Drowsiness is obtained through the administration of the Epworth Somnolence Test, and the apnoea-hypopnea index is taken from the patient's clinical history.&#xD;
Segmentation: With the psychological and clinical variables, in this first visit, &quot;predictive&quot; information is obtained on how the patient's adherence will be: high adherence, moderate adherence or low adherence.&#xD;
Taking this information into account, the care plan will start considering how the patient is and their situation with respect to adherence. Depending on their evolution, the care plan is adapted. For patients with low adherence, telemonitoring is used.</description>

    <description>The patients followed the standard of care, which consists of starting therapy in the hospital, where the nurse performed training in the use of CPAP equipment, mask adjustment, and safety and maintenance instructions. For follow-up, the patient was always referred to the Hospital, with a frequency established by the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (Day 30, Day 90 and Day 180). The follow-up procedure consisted of reviewing the CPAP hour meter and resolving any incidents that may have arisen, with the necessary corrective actions (change of mask, positive reinforcement, and explanation of specific aspects).</description>
