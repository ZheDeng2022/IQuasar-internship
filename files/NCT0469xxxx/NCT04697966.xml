      A growing body of research implicates rumination as being a transdiagnostic risk factor&#xD;
      involved in the development of depression and anxiety in youth. Critically, mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation has shown significant promise in targeting rumination, and ultimately improving&#xD;
      depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means&#xD;
      for accessing mindfulness training, while being interactive and engaging for youth. Despite&#xD;
      their growing popularity among teens, strikingly little research has been conducted on these&#xD;
      apps. Two critical questions have yet to be addressed: (1) what are the underlying neural and&#xD;
      cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps and (2) for whom&#xD;
      is app-based mindfulness well-suited. To address these gaps, adolescents (ages 13-18) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to an app-delivered mindfulness course vs. a control condition and will&#xD;
      complete pre- and post-intervention resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) scans to probe static and dynamic functional connectivity within - and between - brain&#xD;
      networks strongly implicated in mindfulness training and rumination. In addition, cognitive&#xD;
      tasks will be administered at pre- and post-intervention to assess attentional control&#xD;
      abilities putatively enhanced by mindfulness training. Finally, mindfulness skills and&#xD;
      changes in rumination will be assessed via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment&#xD;
      (EMA). First, the investigators will test whether changes in (1) brain functional&#xD;
      connectivity, (2) attentional control and (3) acquisition and use of mindfulness skills&#xD;
      mediate between-group (i.e., app vs. control) differences in the reduction of rumination.&#xD;
      Second, the investigators will test whether a machine learning model incorporating baseline&#xD;
      clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics can be used to identify which&#xD;
      adolescents are predicted to benefit from app-based mindfulness training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years. Headspace -&#xD;
      among the most popular of these platforms - has over 42 million users. Recent surveys&#xD;
      indicate that 11% of U.S. adolescents have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with&#xD;
      anxiety or depressive symptoms, which increase substantially during the adolescent years. A&#xD;
      growing body of research implicates rumination as being a transdiagnostic risk factor&#xD;
      involved in the development of depression and anxiety in youth. Critically, mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation has shown significant promise in targeting rumination, and ultimately improving&#xD;
      depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means&#xD;
      for accessing mindfulness training, while being interactive and engaging for youth. Despite&#xD;
      their growing popularity among teens, strikingly little research has been conducted on these&#xD;
      apps. Two critical questions have yet to be addressed, which are strongly aligned with the&#xD;
      NCCIH Strategic Plan: (1) what are the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that&#xD;
      account for the beneficial effects of these apps and (2) for whom is app-based mindfulness&#xD;
      well-suited. To address these gaps, adolescents (ages 13-18) will be randomly assigned to an&#xD;
      app-delivered mindfulness course vs. an active control condition and will complete pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to probe&#xD;
      static and dynamic functional connectivity within - and between - brain networks strongly&#xD;
      implicated in mindfulness training and rumination (i.e., Default Mode Network and Salience&#xD;
      Network). In addition, cognitive tasks will be administered at pre- and post-intervention to&#xD;
      assess attentional control abilities putatively enhanced by mindfulness training. Finally,&#xD;
      mindfulness skills and changes in rumination will be assessed via smartphone-based ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA). First, the investigators will test whether changes in (1) brain&#xD;
      functional connectivity (dynamic resting state functional connectivity via coactivation&#xD;
      pattern analysis), (2) attentional control (Correct NoGo % on the SART task) and (3)&#xD;
      acquisition and use of mindfulness skills (assessed via EMA) mediate between-group (i.e., app&#xD;
      vs. control) differences in the reduction of rumination. Second, the investigators will test&#xD;
      whether a machine learning model incorporating baseline clinical, demographic, and&#xD;
      psychosocial characteristics can be used to identify which adolescents are predicted to&#xD;
      benefit from app-based mindfulness training. Ultimately, such an algorithm may inform&#xD;
      individual risk-benefit assessments that could be used to objectively communicate the&#xD;
      probability of experiencing positive vs. adverse outcomes to users prior to engaging with a&#xD;
      mindfulness app. Collectively, results are expected to advance (1) our understanding of the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of app-based mindfulness&#xD;
      training and (2) our ability to predict which adolescents are well-suited to these&#xD;
      increasingly popular apps.&#xD;

    <description>The Headspace app consists of guided mindfulness meditations and is available for both Apple iOS and Android devices. For the proposed study, participants will be instructed to complete the app's most popular introductory program which consists of three levels (&quot;Basics 1-3&quot;), with each level comprising 10 sessions (30 in total) over 30 days. The program is intended to introduce the key principles and techniques of mindfulness (including focused meditation on the breath, body scanning, and noting), and strategies for applying mindfulness to daily life. Sessions begin with a duration of 10 mins, though users have the option to increase the duration to 15- and 20-mins during levels 2 and 3, respectively. (The length of these guided meditation sessions could be considered relatively brief, but they will not be modified as the purpose of this study is to examine this highly popular mindfulness app as is.) The guided meditations are supplemented with psychoeducational content.</description>

    <intervention_name>Psychoeducational Active Control Condition</intervention_name>
    <description>The majority of prior research on mindfulness interventions has relied on single-arm designs or wait-list controls conditions, rather than active control conditions. Accordingly, we will include a structurally-equivalent active control condition, delivered via the same Headspace app. Specifically, the control condition will consist of 30 excerpts from Andy Puddicombe's audiobook The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness. The narrated sessions are 10 mins in duration and delivered via the Headspace app, thus closely matching the mindfulness intervention across key attributes. User flow through the app is identical in both the mindfulness and control conditions, differing only in session content. The audiobook sessions, being predominantly psychoeducational, introduce the background and key concepts and principles behind mindfulness, and include reflections from Mr. Puddicombe's experience as a monk. The chosen excerpts exclude content which feature guided mindfulness exercises.</description>
