  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard for detection and removal of precancerous lesions, and has&#xD;
      been amply shown to reduce mortality. However, the miss rate for polyps during colonoscopies&#xD;
      is 22-28%, while 20-24% of the missed lesions are histologically confirmed precancerous&#xD;
      adenomas. To address this shortcoming, the investigators propose a new polyp detection system&#xD;
      based on deep learning, which can alert the operator in real-time to the presence and&#xD;
      location of polyps during a colonoscopy. The investigators dub the system DEEP: (DEEP)&#xD;
      DEtection of Elusive Polyps. The DEEP system was trained on 3,611 hours of colonoscopy videos&#xD;
      derived from two sources, and was validated on a set comprising 1,393 hours of video, coming&#xD;
      from a third, unrelated source. For the validation set, the ground truth labelling was&#xD;
      provided by offline gastroenterologist annotators, who were able to watch the video in&#xD;
      slow-motion and pause/rewind as required; two or three specialist annotators examined each&#xD;
      video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized pilot study of patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective screening and surveillance colonoscopies using DEEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of additional polyps detected by the DEEP system in real time colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety by prospective assessment of the rate of adverse events during the study period&#xD;
           attributed or not to the use of the DEEP system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stability of the DEEP system by measuring the rate of false positives (False Alarms) per&#xD;
           colonoscopies 4 And to examine its feasibility and usefulness of in clinical practice by&#xD;
           assessing the colonoscopist user experience while using the DEEP system in a 5 point&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
