  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) from Asian ancestry are reported to have different genomic&#xD;
      architectures compared with LUADs from Caucasian ancestry. However, due to lack of available&#xD;
      cases, few studies controlled the clinical attributes during the comparisons of the genomic&#xD;
      alterations. In this study, the investigators will identify Asian LUADs patients who had&#xD;
      broad-panel next-generation sequencing (NGS) performed on their primary tumor between January&#xD;
      2018 and December 2019 at the department of thoracic surgery of Peking University People's&#xD;
      Hospital. Then, Caucasian LUADs patients who had targeted NGS (Memorial Sloan&#xD;
      Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets [MSK-IMPACT]) will be&#xD;
      identified in the GENIE database, which consists of 6673 primary lung adenocarcinoma samples&#xD;
      with clinical annotations. Finally, genomic alterations regarding somatic mutations, copy&#xD;
      number variations, fusions, mutational signatures, oncogenic pathways, and therapeutic&#xD;
      actionability will be comprehensively compared between these two cohorts after adjusting age,&#xD;
      sex, smoking status, and pathologic stage using propensity score matching. This study will&#xD;
      elucidate important ancestry differences between Asian and Caucasian lung adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
