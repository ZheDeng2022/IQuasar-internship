  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to evaluate the effect of cognitive stimulation (CS) on the functioning of&#xD;
      the prefrontal cortex (PFC), seeking an analysis of both cerebral hemodynamics in&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and aspects related to the initiation of neurodegenerative processes. The&#xD;
      intervention presents an individual format and the participants are elderly without or with&#xD;
      neurocognitive disorders (NCD). Concretely, to assess the effects of individual CS on global&#xD;
      cognition, and mood, as well as to analyze neuronal activity with oxygenation, volume and&#xD;
      blood flow in the brain, evaluating the impact of cognitive stimulation on brain&#xD;
      hemodynamics. Participants in the intervention group receive two 45 min-session of CS per&#xD;
      week for 12 weeks in addition to their treatment as usual. Participants in the control group&#xD;
      will maintain their treatment as usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Faced with an unprecedented global ageing population and the current COVID-19 pandemic, the&#xD;
      risk of social vulnerability increases in the elderly population, promoting the development&#xD;
      and aggravation of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular NCD. The diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      this pathology emphasizes cognitive changes, and as such is based clinically on cognitive&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PFC is considered the centre of cognitive function, where it encompasses attention,&#xD;
      memory and executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention is the cognitive function that allows us to orient to the relevant stimuli and&#xD;
      process them to respond accordingly. Given its functionality, it is distinguished into three&#xD;
      types of attention: selective, divided and sustained. Attentional dysfunction can be present&#xD;
      in several conditions where cognitive deficit is the main symptom, such as Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to memory, it is subdivided according to time storage, i.e. short or long term.&#xD;
      Short-term memory is capable of operating with certain perceived information for a limited&#xD;
      space of time and can later be forgotten or transferred to long-term memory. Two other&#xD;
      complementary components are distinguished in this type of memory: immediate memory and&#xD;
      recent memory. Long-term memory is a latent memory with unlimited capacity that can remain&#xD;
      outside the conscious circuit until circumstances require another mode of response. It&#xD;
      involves separate, interdependent and dynamic processes of storage, consolidation and&#xD;
      evocation. It is made up of two major subsystems: implicit or non-declarative memory, and&#xD;
      explicit or declarative memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding executive functions, they designate the cognitive processes of control and&#xD;
      integration aimed at the execution of behaviour directed at complex objectives, requiring&#xD;
      sub-components such as attention, programming, time sequencing, inhibition of competing&#xD;
      processes and information, monitoring and selection of strategies. Executive functions&#xD;
      include various processes such as working memory, planning, response to reactions and error&#xD;
      corrections, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that in the early stages of NCD, people are able to learn and improve their&#xD;
      cognitive function through interventions such as CS. CS is recommended by the National&#xD;
      Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence as a non-pharmacological therapy for people with&#xD;
      mild to moderate NCD and is an intervention where the cognitive domains are not used in&#xD;
      isolation but integrated. An individual format is associated with better results. In a&#xD;
      systematic review on CS, studies have shown strong evidence that CS has a positive impact on&#xD;
      cognitive function, depression, daily life activities and behaviour for people with NCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no studies are known that have analyzed prefrontal cortex activity in the elderly&#xD;
      population associated with a functional method of infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This method&#xD;
      provides information on hemodynamic changes associated with cortical activation by measuring&#xD;
      in a non-invasive way changes in the relative ratios of deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) and&#xD;
      oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and recording the dynamics in the PFC of the elderly during a cognitive&#xD;
      stimulation programme with the fNIRS method may contribute to expanding knowledge about&#xD;
      aspects related to neurodegenerative processes and cognitive function in the elderly.&#xD;
