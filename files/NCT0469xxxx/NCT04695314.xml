      To determine the effect of foot reflexology in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients&#xD;
      and the effect of a shoe insert to perform continuous foot reflexology in ocular hypertensive&#xD;
      (OHTN) patients.&#xD;

      This is a prospective pilot study in glaucoma patients and a prospective therapeutic trial in&#xD;
      ocular hypertensive patients. Patients were recruited from the Temple Ophthalmology&#xD;
      outpatient clinic. Primary open-angle glaucoma patients were recruited from those about to&#xD;
      have SLT for additional intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering. OHTN patients were recruited&#xD;
      from the clinic. The glaucoma patients performed a 5-minute foot massage on a foot massage&#xD;
      board and the IOP was checked pre-massage, post-massage and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post&#xD;
      massage. OHTN patients underwent a one-month drop washout and then performed a 5-minute&#xD;
      massage using a 3D-printed shoe insert with the identical pressure checks. They then were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to wear the shoe insert or a sham insert for one day. IOP was checked&#xD;
      before inserting the insert and at the end of the day. The number of steps was recorded each&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
