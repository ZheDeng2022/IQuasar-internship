    <textblock>
      The current study is going to investigate the nature exposure intervention on the ability of&#xD;
      self-regulation and decision-making skills among mentally fatigued soccer players. The&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to view some nature photos, which can facilitate the recovering&#xD;
      process for directed attention and the ability of self-regulation. Thus, to see the&#xD;
      improvement in decision-making skills.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention of this study is nature exposure, specifically, instruct subjects to view&#xD;
      and immerse in some nature photos due to the humanity of biophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition of mental fatigue will be induced by the Stroop task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the intervention or process of viewing photos, the baseline will be recorded to&#xD;
      compare the post-test value of self-regulation and the score of decision-making skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the different durations of viewing photos will be implemented to identify the&#xD;
      optimal selection.&#xD;

    <description>Nature exposure has different ways, such as walk in the real nature environment; viewing nature photos. Two main reasons make this study will not use the real nature environment: (1) the limitation of time before or amid the soccer competition; (2) the pandemic situation does not allow people go outside as frequently as before. Therefore, the current study will select some nature photos, which are restorative environments and can restore directed attention to counteract mental fatigue.</description>
