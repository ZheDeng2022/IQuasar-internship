  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With advancing age, adults experience increasing speech understanding difficulties in&#xD;
      challenging situations. Currently, speech-in-noise difficulties are rehabilitated by&#xD;
      providing hearing aids. For older normal-hearing adults, however, hearing devices do not&#xD;
      provide much benefit since these adults do not have a decreased hearing sensitivity. The goal&#xD;
      of the &quot;Speech Perception with High Cognitive Demand&quot; Project is to evaluate the benefit of a&#xD;
      new auditory-cognitive training paradigm. In order to provide maximal benefit for older,&#xD;
      normal-hearing adults, a validation of the new training materials is required. In a pilot&#xD;
      study, the investigators will evaluate the new auditory-cognitive training paradigm in 15&#xD;
      young, normal-hearing adults (18-30 years). Based on these results, the training paradigm can&#xD;
      be further optimized for older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With advancing age, adults experience increasing speech understanding difficulties in&#xD;
      challenging situations, such as difficulty with understanding other persons in a noisy&#xD;
      restaurant. Speech-in-noise difficulties are typically rehabilitated by providing hearing&#xD;
      aids. For older normal-hearing adults, however, hearing devices do not provide much benefit&#xD;
      since these adults do not have a decreased hearing sensitivity. For these adults&#xD;
      communication difficulties persist in everyday life situations and can even lead to social&#xD;
      withdrawal, isolation, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of studies demonstrates that combined auditory-cognitive training paradigms&#xD;
      can offer speech-in-noise benefits to adults with hearing loss that could prevent the&#xD;
      consequences listed above (Ferguson &amp; Henshaw, 2015; Lawrence et al., 2018). The goal of the&#xD;
      &quot;Speech Perception with High Cognitive Demand&quot; Project is to evaluate the benefit of a new&#xD;
      auditory-cognitive training paradigm for older normal-hearing adults. The investigators&#xD;
      developed an American English version of the Nottingham (UK) PLUS training paradigm in which&#xD;
      listeners are asked to focus and listen to one speaker while ignoring another speaker.&#xD;
      Although it cannot ensured that every participant will experience direct significant benefit&#xD;
      from the training, the paradigm is being designed to optimally enhance the possibility of&#xD;
      benefit: an adaptive procedure is employed in order to train each individual at their own&#xD;
      level and to make the task challenging, and a short-term memory component is added to the&#xD;
      original training paradigm to also enhance the cognitive skills of the participants. In&#xD;
      addition, the training is implemented on tablets rather than computers, making at-home&#xD;
      training possible (many older adults are more comfortable with tablets than laptops). This&#xD;
      way, not only the risk of COVID-19 for participants is minimized, but training is also&#xD;
      provided in a realistic setting which will ensure a better transfer of the trained skills to&#xD;
      daily communication situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to provide maximal benefit for older, normal-hearing adults, a validation of the new&#xD;
      training materials is however required, and the initial validation will be for younger adults&#xD;
      only. The investigators will evaluate the translated and adjusted sentences (from UK to&#xD;
      American English), the adaptive procedure, and the short-term memory component, in young,&#xD;
      normal-hearing adults (18-30 years). Based on the results of this pilot study, the sentences&#xD;
      and procedures of the training paradigm can be further optimized for older adults.&#xD;

    <description>Sentences of seven different scenarios will be presented to young, normal-hearing adults. Participants will be instructed to listen to one speaker and ignore the other one, will be asked to recall the keywords of the to-be-attended sentence after the target sentence (0-back) or after the next sentence was presented (1-back; short-term memory component). The sentences will be presented using an 2 down-1up adaptive procedure in which the ratio of the levels of the to-be-attended and to-be-ignored speaker will be adjusted based on the correctly recalled keywords. This means that the procedure will converge to a level-ratio for which the participant understands 71% of the to-be-attended speaker, also called the speech reception threshold (SRT). The SRT will be used to compare the 0-back versus 1-back task and the validity of the different scenarios/sentences and procedures (mean/median SRT, inter- and intrasubject variability of the scenarios and test-retest session).</description>
