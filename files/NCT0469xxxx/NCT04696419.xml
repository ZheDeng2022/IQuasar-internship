  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to identify and quantify objective non-invasive measures of the immediate&#xD;
      effect of contact with dogs in a standardized experimental setup. Employing a within-subject&#xD;
      design, the study includes healthy participants that are exposed to three different levels of&#xD;
      contact to a dog compared with a no-dog control condition while obtaining measures of both&#xD;
      physiological, behavioral, and psychological effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a within-subjects design, we will compare four standardised and controlled test&#xD;
      situations with different levels of dog contact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) visual (V), 2) tactile and visual (TV), 3) tactile, visual, interaction (TVI), and&#xD;
      4)control (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be subjected to all four test situations on the same day, and will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to test order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the test day, we collect background information and baseline measures for the participants&#xD;
      (baseline period, duration: 50 minutes), whereafter they rest for 30 minutes&#xD;
      (pre-intervention rest period). After this the participants are subjected to the four test&#xD;
      situations (10 minutes each) that are followed by rest intervals (30 minutes each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants' interaction with the dog during the 10-minute test situations are&#xD;
      standardised according to the specific contact treatment. Most physiological and all&#xD;
      behavioural measures are recorded continuously throughout each test in order for us to link&#xD;
      the &quot;dosage&quot; of dog (the different levels of contact) with the psychological responses and&#xD;
      some physiological measures obtained before an after each test situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below is shown the exact time schedule of the test day, that we refer to when describing the&#xD;
      outcome measures. The baseline period (30 minutes) is not included in the total test period&#xD;
      (total duration= 190 minutes), that consist of a pre-intervention and intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline period (50 minutes - not part of total test period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-intervention period (start, t=0 minutes; end t= 30 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test situation 1 (start, t=30 minutes; end, t=40 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rest period 1 (start, t=40 minutes, end, t= 70 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test situation 2 (start, t=70 minutes; end, t=80 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rest period 2 (start, t=80 minutes, end, t= 110 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test situation 3 (start, t=110 minutes; end, t=120 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rest period 3 (start, t=120 minutes, end, t= 150 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test situation 4 (start, t=150 minutes; end, t=160 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rest period 4 (start, t=160 minutes, end, t= 190 minutes)&#xD;
