    <textblock>
      To-date, there is no evidence on qigong's effects for improving well-being of pre-frail and&#xD;
      frail older cancer survivors. Our aim is to conduct a pilot study for testing out the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a qigong intervention to the elderly cancer survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is an emerging concept in geriatric research and practice. It is defined as a state&#xD;
      of increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes including death. A cohort study has found that&#xD;
      respondents with cancer were significantly more frail compared to those without cancer. A&#xD;
      plausible explanation is both cancer itself and the therapies used to treat it add additional&#xD;
      stressors that challenge a patient's physiologic reserve. A systematic review has revealed a&#xD;
      high prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty in older cancer patients, with the median&#xD;
      estimates of 42% and 43%, respectively. Cancer treatment can hasten survivors' aging process&#xD;
      and increase their risk of developing frailty, thus placing cancer survivors at heightened&#xD;
      risk of such poor health outcomes as falls, fractures, and disability. This calls for&#xD;
      effective interventions that would improve frailty in older cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qigong, a type of mind-body intervention, is particularly suitable for older adults, as it is&#xD;
      implemented without aerobic and musculoskeletal strain. This equipment-free form of exercise&#xD;
      is ideal for settings with limited resources, as well as for the frail elderly, because it&#xD;
      can be performed at home at any time, reducing such barriers as weather, transportation, and&#xD;
      cost. Meta-analysis suggests that Baduanjin is beneficial in the general population in terms&#xD;
      of improved quality of life, balance, handgrip strength, and trunk flexibility. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, there is no evidence on qigong's effects for improving well-being of pre-frail and&#xD;
      frail older cancer survivors. Our aim is therefore to conduct a pilot study for testing out&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of a qigong intervention to the elderly cancer survivors.&#xD;

Scores of all subscales and single-item measures range from 0 to 100. Higher scores for functional scales represent higher level of functioning, global health status/quality of life, but higher scores for a symptom scale / item represent a higher level of symptom severity.</description>
