  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that endothelial dysfunction is an early predictor of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events in at-risk patients. Finding safe and effective product able to improve endothelial&#xD;
      function is of public health interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many clinical studies have shown that monomer of flavanols from cocoa significantly improved&#xD;
      endothelial function, in particular endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (ED-FMD)&#xD;
      after a single dose. Grape is also a main source of flavanol monomers, that's why many human&#xD;
      studies have shown significant effects of grape-derived products on endothelial function&#xD;
      within 2 hours following a single dose intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the effect of 2 doses of a proprietary and&#xD;
      standardised botanical blend rich in polyphenols (SBRP), on ED-FMD in fasting conditions, in&#xD;
      comparison to a placebo, in healthy adults. This blend is made of two botanical extracts: a&#xD;
      grape extract and a blueberry extract. In order to provide supportive evidence on the&#xD;
      mechanisms and biological plausibility to the clinical effects of the product, appropriate&#xD;
      biological parameters and circulating metabolites will be assayed.&#xD;
