  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to explore the activity of chlorambucil, an alkylating&#xD;
      agent commonly used in chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment, in metastatic patients, gBRCA,&#xD;
      including VUS, or DDR mutated, previously treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, treatment strategies for patients affected by metastatic pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are still very scant. Gemcitabine and fluoropyrimidine based&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens are standard I line chemotherapy. Recently, landmark genome-wide&#xD;
      studies revealed the existence of a distinct subpopulation of PDAC with highly unstable&#xD;
      genomic properties, due to mutations in DNA Damage Repair genes (DDR), in particular BRCA1/2&#xD;
      mutations. Germline mutations cause a deficiency in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair&#xD;
      due to inhibition of DNA double-strand breaks repair by the mechanism of homologous&#xD;
      recombination. Cancer cells rely on DNA repair to survive the damage induced by genotoxic&#xD;
      stress and DNA repair enables cancer cells to accumulate genomic alterations that contribute&#xD;
      to their aggressive phenotype. BRCA1/2 abrogation and homologous repair deficiency (HRD)&#xD;
      confer sensitivity to DNA damage-inducing drugs, in particular those inflicting cytotoxic DNA&#xD;
      crosslinks that interfere with DNA replication. The sensitivity of BRCA1/2-mutated tumors to&#xD;
      platinum compounds has been validated in multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, similar lesions are induced by DNA-alkylating agents, which include&#xD;
      mono-functional (e.g. mitomycin C) or bifunctional alkylators (e.g. chlorambucil). Small&#xD;
      molecule inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) have been recently developed and&#xD;
      they showed an interesting activity and efficacy in breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      tumors. Although platinum drugs and PARP inhibitors show initially good responses in the&#xD;
      clinic, most patients acquire resistance to these drugs. Chlorambucil shows high selective&#xD;
      toxicity against human cells and xenograft tumors with compromised BRCA1/2 function. Patients&#xD;
      affected by metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma, pretreated with at least one previous&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy, will be treated with oral chlorambucil for 42 consecutive days&#xD;
      After restaging, responder patients and those with stable disease will receive for 14&#xD;
      consecutive days every 28 days until disease progression (RECIST 1.1 criteria) or unbearable&#xD;
      toxicity, patient refusal or medical decision.&#xD;
