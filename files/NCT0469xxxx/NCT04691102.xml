  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural and balance disorders are common in neurological disorders. They are often&#xD;
      associated with reduced mobility and fear of falling, which strongly limit independent&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADL), compromise the quality of life and reduce social&#xD;
      participation. Here the investigators apply an existing software solution to: 1) obtain&#xD;
      biomarkers of gait deficits in 5 neurological conditions, 2) develop an automatic procedure&#xD;
      supporting clinicians in the early identification of patients at high risk of falling as to&#xD;
      tailor rehabilitation treatment; 3) longitudinally assess these patients to test the efficacy&#xD;
      of rehabilitation. High-density electroencephalography (EEG), and inertial sensors located at&#xD;
      lower limbs and at upper body levels will be used to extract the most appropriate indexes&#xD;
      during motor tasks. The ultimate goal is to develop cost-effective treatment procedures to&#xD;
      prevent recurrent falls and fall-related injuries and favour the reintegration of the patient&#xD;
      into everyday activities. The first hypothesis of this study is that clinical professionals&#xD;
      (e.g., medical doctors and rehabilitative staff) would strongly benefit from the possibility&#xD;
      to rely on quantitative, reliable and reproducible information about patients motor deficits.&#xD;
      This piece of information can be nowadays readily available through miniaturized wearable&#xD;
      technology and its information content can be effectively conveyed thanks to ad hoc software&#xD;
      solution, like the A.r.i.s.e. software. The second hypothesis of the present study is that&#xD;
      early identification of patients at high risk of dependence and the subsequent application of&#xD;
      personalized treatment would allow for cost-effective treatment procedures to favor the&#xD;
      autonomy into everyday activities. The results of this project could represent a valuable&#xD;
      support in the clinical reasoning and decision-making process.&#xD;

    <measure>Electroencephalography (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A portable and low-weight 128-EEG channels system will be use in order to obtain neural predictors of gain stability during walking in the real-world and to distinguish types of walking. Briefly, source-space EEG signals (based on the individual anatomical image) will be reconstruct to estimate activity (e.g., power spectrum density-PSD) and connectivity (via FC correlation) at rest and during motor tasks</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiogram (EKG) and electrooculography (EOG) during resting state and the execution of motor tasks. During the records, an inertial sensors-based assessment will be performed on all patients. Three different motor tasks will be considered for postural and gait functions, commonly adopted in the clinical practice (i.e., 10-Meter-Walk, Figure-of-8-Walk, and Fukuda-Stepping tests). To assess the motor function of upper limb, three different tasks, representative of the typical ADL movements, will be considered (Reach Out, Reach and Touch, Reach and Grasp). Each task will be repeated 3 times.&#xD;
The whole assessment procedure will last approximately 40 minutes.</description>
