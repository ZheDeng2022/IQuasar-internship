      Though OPV is safe and effective, it can mutate and reacquire neurovirulence in rare&#xD;
      circumstances. This can result in vaccine-associated paralytic polio and circulating&#xD;
      vaccine-derived polioviruses. Use of tOPV had risk of generating VAPP and seeding new type 2&#xD;
      circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses though wild type 2 virus was eradicated in September&#xD;
      2015. For this reason tOPV vaccine was withdrawn globally in April 2016 and switched to bOPV.&#xD;
      cVDPV2 outbreaks have occurred in sixteen countries after cassation of OPV2. Using stockpiled&#xD;
      mOPV2 to respond to this situation risks propagating new cVDPVs. IPV induces only limited&#xD;
      intestinal mucosal immunity not effective to interrupt fecal-oral route transmission in&#xD;
      settings of poor hygiene and sanitation. Therefore, development of novel oral polio vaccine&#xD;
      with enhanced genetic stability and lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence compared to&#xD;
      current Sabin 2 strains is major priority of global polio eradication Program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical development plan outlines studies through Phase II development with nOPV2&#xD;
      candidate strains being tested in adult toddler and infant populations who received prior&#xD;
      dose of OPV or IPV. No study has been conducted in truly naive newborns with no prior receipt&#xD;
      of any polio vaccines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Vaccinating healthy newborns with novel type 2 polio virus candidate vaccines is&#xD;
      safe and can induce putatively protective immune response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability after one and two doses of nOPV2 vaccine candidates 1&#xD;

      seroprotection rate geometric mean and median titers to vaccination after two doses of nOPV2&#xD;

      Burden: Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) contains attenuated (weakened) polioviruses. Though OPV is&#xD;
      safe and effective, it can mutate and reacquire neurovirulence in rare circumstances. This&#xD;
      can result in vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) and circulating vaccine-derived&#xD;
      polioviruses (cVDPVs) on rare occasions. Use of tOPV, therefore, had the risk of generating&#xD;
      VAPP and seeding new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV2), even though&#xD;
      the wild type 2 virus was eradicated in September 2015. For this reason tOPV vaccine was&#xD;
      withdrawn globally in April 2016 and switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV).&#xD;
      Circulating vaccine-derived type-2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) outbreaks have occurred in sixteen&#xD;
      countries after cassation of OPV2. Using stockpiled mOPV2 to respond to this situation risks&#xD;
      propagating new cVDPVs and this phenomenon has already been observed in multiple geographies&#xD;
      following the switch. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) induces only limited intestinal mucosal&#xD;
      immunity and is not effective to interrupt fecal-oral route transmission in settings of poor&#xD;
      hygiene and sanitation. Therefore, development of novel oral polio vaccine/s with enhanced&#xD;
      genetic stability and lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence compared to current Sabin 2&#xD;
      strains is a major priority of the global polio eradication Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge gap: The current clinical development plan outlines studies through Phase II&#xD;
      development with the nOPV2 candidate strains being tested in adult, toddler, and infant&#xD;
      populations who have received prior dose/s of OPV and/or IPV. No study has been conducted in&#xD;
      truly naive newborns with no prior receipt of any polio vaccines to strengthen the clinical&#xD;
      evidence in favour of utilizing these novel OPV strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Existing Sabin type 2 polio virus vaccines can mutate in to pathogenic virus and&#xD;
      become neurovirulent, causing VAPP and cVDVP. So novel type 2 polio virus candidate vaccines&#xD;
      is an urgent need especially for outbreak situations. The nOPV2 strains are intended for use&#xD;
      as safer alternatives to mOPV2 vaccines for outbreak response. Data from this proposed study&#xD;
      result will further strengthen the clinical evidence base to deploy novel, genetically stable&#xD;
      OPV strains to reduce the risk of generating cVDPV and VAPP. The study will generate data on&#xD;
      novel OPV2 candidates for pre-licensure use in outbreak scenarios and for eventual full&#xD;
      licensure and WHO Prequalification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : Vaccinating healthy newborns with novel type 2 polio virus candidate vaccines&#xD;
      (nOPV2) is safe and can induce a putatively protective immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;

        -  To evaluate seroprotection rate, geometric mean and median titers to vaccination after&#xD;
           one dose of nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further evaluate seroprotection rate, geometric mean and median titers to vaccination&#xD;
           after two doses of nOPV2 candidate 1 in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns.&#xD;

&#xD;

           measured asCCID50 per g of stool) at fixed time points following one and two doses of&#xD;
           nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 in newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess genetic stability through genetic deep sequencing assay and neurovirulence test&#xD;
      through transgenic mice NV assays from a subset of participants stools samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a Phase II clinical trial which will be conducted in rural Bangladesh at Matlab.&#xD;
      The total enrolment target for the clinical trial is 330 , with 220 in nOPV2 candidate 1 arm&#xD;
      and 110 in placebo arm. All participants will be randomized (in block randomization of&#xD;
      variable length) 2:1 ratio to nOPV2 vaccine candidate C1(2 drops) and placebo group (2&#xD;
      drops). All eligible healthy newborn participants will be vaccinated orally at birth and at 4&#xD;
      weeks of age with C1 (105.0± 0.5 CCID50, 2 drops) or placebo (2 drops) of age followed by&#xD;
      fIPV + bOPV at week 8, bOPV at week 12 and fIPV + bOPV at week 16 and other vaccines&#xD;
      according to EPI schedule in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to record any immediate reaction participants will be observed for 30 minutes&#xD;
      following each dose of vaccination. Study staff will visit homes of the participants daily&#xD;
      for 7 days to collect systemic solicited adverse events after study vaccination using&#xD;
      electronic dairy cards. Unsolicited adverse events, adverse events of special interest and&#xD;
      serious adverse events will be collected throughout the entire study period by weekly home&#xD;
      visit. Mothers of the participant will be provided a telephone number to communicate with the&#xD;
      investigator for any adverse or serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three blood samples each of 1 ml, will be collected to measure the immune response of nOPV&#xD;
      vaccine candidate 1: the first pre-vaccine blood sample on the day of first dose nOPV2&#xD;
      vaccine candidate 1 /placebo (at birth), second blood sample at 4 weeks before second dose&#xD;
      nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 /placebo and the third blood sample will be collected at 8 weeks&#xD;
      before giving fIPV + bOPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers of enrolled participants will be requested to collect about 8 grams (about the size&#xD;
      of one adult thumb) of stool from participants to assess viral sheddings. A total of seven&#xD;
      stool samples will be collected: the first pre-vaccine sample will be collected on the day of&#xD;
      first dose nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 /placebo (at birth), second sample at week 2, third&#xD;
      sample at week 4 before second dose nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 /placebo, fourth stool sample&#xD;
      at week 6, fifth stool at week 8 before giving fIPV + bOPV vaccine, sixth stool sample at&#xD;
      week 10 and seventh sample at week 12 of age to assess viral shedding.&#xD;
