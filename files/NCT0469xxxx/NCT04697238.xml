  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity related ailments, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and metabolic disorders are&#xD;
      major causes of death in the Western World. This trial may result in improved prevention,&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatments for obesity and obesity-related disorders. Published data show that&#xD;
      if a weight is carried by a rodent, this animal will lose body weight and gain an improved&#xD;
      glucose control. Recently published data further show comparable results in humans when&#xD;
      carrying an additional weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to confirm and further investigate these findings in humans. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to let obese participants carry weight vests and monitor their change in&#xD;
      body weight. The investigators will also measure food intake, physical activity, energy&#xD;
      expenditure, body composition, abdominal fat and heart rate variability. This to further&#xD;
      examine the potential beneficial effects of loading and the mechanism of action.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if wearing a weight vest with 11 percent of body weight for 8 hours/day for 5&#xD;
      weeks decreases body weight in obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if wearing a weight vest with 11 percent of an individual's body weight for up&#xD;
      to 5 weeks affects levels of abdominal fat, liver fat, fat mass, fat free mass, physical&#xD;
      activity, energy expenditure, waist circumference, food intake or activity in the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system in obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine, exploratory, if wearing a weight vest with 11 percent of an individual's body&#xD;
      weight for up to 5 weeks affects serum concentrations of circulating proteins, metabolites or&#xD;
      electrolytes in obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design and procedure protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of adding artificial weights to individuals&#xD;
      suffering from obesity. Enrolled study subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either&#xD;
      carry a heavy weight vest with 11 percent of the individual's body weight (intervention&#xD;
      group) or a light weight vest with 1 percent of the individual's body weight (control group).&#xD;
      The weight vests will be worn for a total of 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight, abdominal fat, liver fat, waist circumference, food intake, energy expenditure,&#xD;
      physical activity, activity in the autonomic nervous system, fat mass, bone mass, water mass&#xD;
      and fat free mass together with endpoint blood samples will be measured before the start of&#xD;
      intervention to obtain base line values. New measurements will then be done for comparison&#xD;
      during or after the intervention to determine the effect of added artificial loading on obese&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a total of 10 weeks. During the first 3 weeks of the study measurements&#xD;
      will be made which will be used as baseline. The following 5 weeks contains the intervention&#xD;
      and the carrying of a weight vest. The last 2 weeks is a follow up period and at the end of&#xD;
      this period follow up measurements will be done. During or after the intervention period new&#xD;
      measurements will be made to be compared with the baseline measurements to evaluate the study&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid the risk of carry-over effects, the investigators have decided to not use a&#xD;
      crossover design. This could have decreased the variation of the measurement values and&#xD;
      increased the power of the study. However, the investigators believe there could be a risk of&#xD;
      a carry-over effect with a cross over design. As this is a completely new effect in clinical&#xD;
      studies, the investigators have no information about the wash-out time needed to avoid this&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A parallel study design will be used in which the control group is to be compared with the intervention group. To avoid the risk of carry-over effects, the investigators have decided to not use a crossover design. This could have decreased the variation of the measurement values and increased the power of the study. However, the investigators believe there could be a risk of a carry-over effect with a cross over design.

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Subjects might be able to determine if they are in the control group or intervention group since it is difficult to mask the difference between a heavy and a light weight vest. Therefore, intervention in this study won't be masked for the participants. However, group affiliation will be masked for outcomes assessors.</masking_description>
