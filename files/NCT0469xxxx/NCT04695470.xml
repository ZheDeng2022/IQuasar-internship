    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Single arm Phase II trial. Patients were eligible to participate when&#xD;
      they had histological or cytological confirmed metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      Non-MSI(microsatellite instability)-high and TMB(tumor mutational burden)-High.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients had to have received at least a second-line standard therapy, including&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan-based regimens and VEGF(vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor) inhibitors and to have disease progression within 3 months after the last&#xD;
      administration of the last standard therapy or to have stopped such therapy due to&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities. Pre-treatment with anti-EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor) were&#xD;
      mandatory if RAS(Rat sarcoma virus) wild and left side .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who met the eligibility criteria took fruquintinib plus Sintilimab until disease&#xD;
      progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent by the patient, or decision&#xD;
      by the treating physician that discontinuation would be in the patient's best interest. The&#xD;
      primary study endpoint was PFS(progression free survival) rate at 6 months.&#xD;
