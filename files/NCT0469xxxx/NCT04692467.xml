    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting an unblinded pilot randomized control trial of 250 persons&#xD;
      living with HIV (PLWH), aged 18-65 years, who receive antiretroviral therapy care at Haitian&#xD;
      Group for the Study of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO), are virally&#xD;
      suppressed, and have pre-hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 120-139 or diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (DBP) 80-89 mmHg) to be randomized to early hypertension (HTN) treatment&#xD;
      versus standard of care (SOC). Participants will be recruited from GHESKIO's HIV clinic.&#xD;
      Eligible individuals will complete informed consent and be randomized to early HTN treatment&#xD;
      vs. SOC. Participants in early HTN treatment will initiate amlodipine immediately versus&#xD;
      those in SOC will initiate amlodipine only if they meet the HTN threshold (SBP ≥140 or DBP&#xD;
      ≥90 mmHg) during the study period. All participants will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate antihypertensive&#xD;
      treatment among people living with HIV (PLWH) with pre-hypertension (pre-HTN) at GHESKIO.&#xD;
      This study will provide critical data on the feasibility, benefits and risks of&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatment for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention among PLWH with&#xD;
      pre-HTN that will inform a future definitive trial powered for incident CVD events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot study, the investigators will enroll 250 PLWH (18-65 years of age) who have&#xD;
      been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ≥ 1 years with viral suppression within past 12&#xD;
      months and SBP 120-139 or DBP 80-89 mm Hg and no current antihypertensive treatment;&#xD;
      randomize them to &quot;early HTN treatment&quot; or the current standard of care (SOC); and follow&#xD;
      them for 12 months. Amlodipine is the recommended first-line anti-hypertensive medication&#xD;
      according to Haiti's new primary care HTN guidelines. Participants in the early HTN treatment&#xD;
      arm will initiate amlodipine 5 mg immediately, increasing to 10 mg if SBP &gt;130 mm Hg after 1&#xD;
      month. Participants in the SOC arm will initiate amlodipine only if they develop HTN (SBP&#xD;
      ≥140 or DBP ≥90 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that meet study eligibility criteria will proceed to study enrollment visit (~90&#xD;
      min). Participants will be randomized to early HTN treatment vs. SOC in a 1:1 ratio using a&#xD;
      computer-generated random assignment. The research nurse will collect demographic and&#xD;
      clinical data, administer a baseline questionnaire, measure unobserved BP, and perform an&#xD;
      ECG. The questionnaire includes a CVD medical history, family history, medications, CVD&#xD;
      health behaviors (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, and diet) using validated questions&#xD;
      that have been used at GHESKIO and are comparable to those used in US cohorts. Enrollment&#xD;
      labs (~15ml of venous blood) including HgbA1c, total cholesterol, high density cholesterol,&#xD;
      CD4 cell count, and HIV viral load (unless available from electronic medical record in the&#xD;
      past 6 months) will be collected. Samples of serum and plasma will be stored for future&#xD;
      studies, with documented consent from participants. The study physician will interpret the&#xD;
      ECG and perform an echocardiogram and vascular ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug will be dispensed to participants randomized to the early treatment arm with&#xD;
      appropriate education and counseling on adherence and potential side effects. Amlodipine will&#xD;
      be started at 5mg at enrollment and increased to 10mg if SBP &gt;130 mm Hg after 1 month for&#xD;
      participants in the early treatment arm. Locator and contact information will be verified and&#xD;
      follow up appointment given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment and randomization assignment (including amlodipine initiation), participants&#xD;
      will have follow-up visits either at GHESKIO (months 0.5-1, 3, 6, 9, 12) or in the community&#xD;
      / home with community health workers (months 2, 5, 8). All visits will include BP&#xD;
      measurement, lifestyle counseling, adherence encouragement, and assessment of adverse events.&#xD;
      The GHESKIO visits will also include a physical exam. Participants in the early intervention&#xD;
      arm will receive monthly amlodipine refills. Participants in the SOC arm will initiate&#xD;
      amlodipine only if they develop hypertension (SBP &gt;140 or DBP &gt;90 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 12-month study visit, participants will also complete a brief questionnaire about&#xD;
      changes in health behaviors and have viral load measured. Participants may return to the HIV&#xD;
      clinic at any time for symptoms, questions, or other concerns, and a BP measurement will be&#xD;
      taken at each of these encounters. Adverse events will be assessed at each visit. Medical&#xD;
      record abstraction will be done by research staff for any hospitalization or death among a&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
