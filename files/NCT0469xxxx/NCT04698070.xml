  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute malnutrition (AM) is a continuum condition, arbitrarily divided into severe and&#xD;
      moderate categories (SAM, MAM) which are managed separately, with programs overseen by&#xD;
      different agencies with different products and supply chains. Such separation complicates&#xD;
      delivery of care, contributes to poor program performance, and creates confusion among&#xD;
      caregivers. Reduction in the mortality burden from AM will stem from improved simplicity,&#xD;
      efficiency and cost-effectiveness of current protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for SAM treatment in the current Niger protocol is complex. It is determined by 3&#xD;
      independent criteria: nutritional oedema, Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) &lt; 115 mm or&#xD;
      weight-height Z score (WHZ) &lt;-3. Also, the Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) ration in&#xD;
      Niger protocol (130-200 kcal/kg/d) is paradoxical. The amount of RUTF prescribed in the first&#xD;
      weeks of treatment is often less than what given to child reaching recovery (MUAC &gt; 125 and&#xD;
      WHZ &gt;-2), because weekly ration is determined by the child's weight. Rate of weight gain is&#xD;
      highest in the first two weeks of treatment, then plateaus - suggesting no benefit of&#xD;
      increased RUTF ration at the end of treatment. Progressive reduction is a more rational use&#xD;
      of RUTF and this supplement is equally effective for SAM and MAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This community-based non-inferiority trial will compare two strategies for the treatment of&#xD;
      AM to the Niger protocol for SAM and MAM. The Optimizing treatment for acute MAlnutrition&#xD;
      (OptiMA) strategy uses MUAC &lt; 125 mm or nutritional oedema as admission criteria and&#xD;
      optimizes RUTF by adapting doses to the degree of malnutrition. RUTF dose for MUAC &lt; 115 mm&#xD;
      or oedema is 170 kcal/kg/d and progressively reduces to 75 kcal/kg/d as MUAC increases. The&#xD;
      Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) uses the same eligibility criteria&#xD;
      like OptiMA, but simplifies more the RUTF ration by providing 1000 kcal/d for children with&#xD;
      oedema or MUAC &lt; 115 mm and 500 kg/d for children with MUAC 115-124 mm. Children are&#xD;
      considered recovered if they have 2 consecutive weekly MUAC measures ≥ 125 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be individually randomized to treatment in one of the 3 study arms and will&#xD;
      attend clinic visits weekly until nutritional recovery. After discharged, they will be&#xD;
      monitored monthly via a nurse-conducted home visits until 6 months post-inclusion. The trial&#xD;
      arms will be compared using a composite outcome indicator that includes vital status,&#xD;
      anthropometric measures and relapse following the index AM episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that simplified strategies could substantially increase the number of&#xD;
      children in care compared to current SAM programs without requiring additional RUTF or&#xD;
      staffing while maintaining recovery rates in line with current programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main outcome, the success rate, is defined by a composite of three endpoints : alive, not&#xD;
      acutely malnourished per the definition applied at inclusion and not having an additional&#xD;
      episode of AM throughout the 6- month observation period. All other children are classified&#xD;
      as 'unsuccessful'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary major outcome, the recovery rate, is defined by reaching during the 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up a MUAC&gt;=125 and no oedema during two consecutive weeks, a minimum RUTF treatment&#xD;
      period of 4 weeks and good clinical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the main objective, the expected success rate is 68% with a statistical power of 90%. For&#xD;
      the secondary priority objective n°1, the expected recovery rate is 82% and for the secondary&#xD;
      priority objective n°2, the expected recovery rate is 74% with a statistical power of 80%.&#xD;
      For all objectives, the margin of non-inferiority set is 10% with a level of significance set&#xD;
      at 1.25% unilaterally. An inflation of 5% to account for unexploitable data was also added.&#xD;
      The number of randomized subjects required is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  568 participants to meet the main objective;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  295 participants with severe acute malnutrition to meet the secondary priority objective&#xD;
           n°1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  384 participants with MUAC&lt;115mm at admission to meet the secondary priority objective&#xD;
           n°2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and monitoring :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paper form will be completed by the trial nurses during the outpatient follow-up or at home&#xD;
      visits. Data will be recorded by data entry agents supervised by a data manager using RedCAP&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring will be performed every week at each site by clinical trial monitors under&#xD;
      the responsibility of the research activities manager, according to the recommendations of&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practices. All data entered in the database will be checked for completeness&#xD;
      and consistency. The methods of data entry, coding, control, validation and database freezing&#xD;
      will be described in a &quot;data management&quot; guide. Before the implementation of the trial, a&#xD;
      monitoring plan will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the end of the inclusion period, a statistical analysis plan will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of the primary endpoint (success rate) will be compared between the OptiMA and&#xD;
      ComPAS strategies to the standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of the primary secondary endpoint (recovery rate) will be compared between the&#xD;
      OptiMA and ComPAS strategies to the standard protocol, for children randomized in the severe&#xD;
      acute malnourished stratum and for children admitted with a MUAC&lt;115mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These comparisons will be made by Intention To Treat (ITT) (including all randomized&#xD;
      participants), and Per-Protocol (PP) (including only those participants who received the full&#xD;
      randomized treatment strategy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis (success in the overall population regardless of the level of&#xD;
      malnutrition) and the main secondary analysis (recovery rate in the &quot;severely malnourished&quot;&#xD;
      stratum) in ITT and PP are non-inferiority analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OptiMA and ComPAS strategies will be deemed non-inferior to the standard strategy if the&#xD;
      primary and main secondary analysis statistically demonstrate non-inferiority in both ITT and&#xD;
      PP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analyses in terms of success and recovery will be performed on available data. In&#xD;
      case of missing data, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using the maximum bias method.&#xD;
      Missing data can be vital status if the child is absent at the last visit, and anthropometric&#xD;
      data (weight, MUAC, height). In the case of missing height data, the last available height&#xD;
      can be taken into consideration given the low variability of this value from one month to the&#xD;
      next.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probabilities of success, recovery and relapse in each of the strategies and the&#xD;
      quantities of RUTF consumed per child to achieve recovery will serve to construct a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness model.&#xD;

SAM: Children with MUAC&lt;115 or WHZ&lt;-3 or nutritional edema, will be treated with RUTF, according to a dosage table based on weight at each visit.&#xD;
MAM: Children aged between 6-24 months with MUAC between 115 -124 mm and WHZ&gt;-3 will be treated with RUSF. Children with the same anthropometry but age 24-59 m will only receive supplementation if they develop criteria for SAM during the 6 month study period.

All children will be followed-up for 6 months following randomization.
