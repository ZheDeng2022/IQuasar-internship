      Rationale There is ongoing controversy over the optimal treatment and rehabilitation strategy&#xD;
      of an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR). The highest general complication rate is reported&#xD;
      in patients treated with percutaneous repair and early mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The purpose of the study is to compare the results of two ways of postoperative&#xD;
      regimen after treatment with the modified and biomechanically significantly stronger&#xD;
      percutaneous repair under local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods &amp; Population All the consecutive patients with an acute complete Achilles tendon&#xD;
      rupture who will agree to take part in a study will be randomized after a modified&#xD;
      percutaneous repair under local anesthesia into functional group (FG), using a modified brace&#xD;
      and immobilization group (IG), wearing a rigid plaster, in both groups for the period of 6&#xD;
      weeks. After that they will follow the same (standardized) rehabilitation protocol. Major and&#xD;
      minor complication rate, diameter of the healed tendon, active and passive ankle range of&#xD;
      motion (using neutral zero method), standing heel-rise test (with 25 repetition within a&#xD;
      minute for a grade of normal) and clinical outcome using American Foot and Ankle Society&#xD;
      (AOFAS) hindfoot-ankle score, return to the previous activity level, presence of associated&#xD;
      complaints and subjective assessment (scored as good, fair or poor) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame This will be a 4-year study with a 3-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: There will be no differences in demographic parameters (age, gender, side&#xD;
      and mechanism of the injury) between groups. Patients in the FG will reach sooner final range&#xD;
      of motion (ROM) and muscular strength without limping and will be (subjectively) more&#xD;
      satisfied with the treatment. There will be no statistically significant differences observed&#xD;
      between groups according to the number of complications and in the end functional results&#xD;
      with return to pre-injury activities.&#xD;

      Rationale &amp; background information There is ongoing controversy over the optimal treatment&#xD;
      and rehabilitation strategy of an acute Achilles tendon rupture. Percutaneous suturing seems&#xD;
      to bridge the gap between open surgical and conservative treatment, but still raises&#xD;
      scepticism due to concerns like strength of the repair, approximation of torn ends,&#xD;
      re-rupture rate, sural nerve injuries, early functional rehabilitation and thus final&#xD;
      outcome. The highest general complication rate (15.6%) is reported in patients treated with&#xD;
      percutaneous repair and early mobilization. The purpose of the study is to analyze the&#xD;
      results of two ways of postoperative regimen after treatment with the modified and&#xD;
      biomechanically significantly stronger percutaneous repair under local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study goals and objectives The goals of the study are to compare the results of two ways of&#xD;
      postoperative regimen after treatment with the modified and biomechanically significantly&#xD;
      stronger percutaneous repair under local anesthesia . Objectives are to find whether the&#xD;
      modified repair is strong enough to be used with functional treatment that enables more&#xD;
      comfort and earlier rehabilitation to the patients with comparable end (functional) results&#xD;
      and no more complications (particularly re-ruptures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a 4-year prospective observational study, with a 3-year follow up of all the&#xD;
      consecutive patients who will meet the inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) patients 18 years of age or older; 2) a rupture that occurred no more than 7 days before&#xD;
      the operating procedure; 3) closed, complete ATR; 4) a rupture that occurred in the tendinous&#xD;
      portion (2-8 cm proximal to the insertion); 5) no previous operative procedures or history of&#xD;
      partial or complete rupture of the involved tendon; 6) no previous local, oral or parenteral&#xD;
      therapy that might have weakened the tendon (for instance local infiltration of anesthetics&#xD;
      or steroids in the AT region, oral or parenteral immunosuppressive therapy in patients with&#xD;
      transplanted organs or immune diseases etc.). The diagnosis must be confirmed clinically with&#xD;
      palpable gap in the tendon, positive Thompson's test and inability of the patients to raise&#xD;
      on their toes or heel. The diagnosis will be routinely checked by ultrasonography and in any&#xD;
      case of doubt with MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology All the patients who agree to take part in a study will undersign&#xD;
      informed/consent and will be operated on with the modified and biomechanically significantly&#xD;
      stronger percutaneous repair under local anesthesia . After that they will be randomized&#xD;
      after modified percutaneous suturing under local anesthesia in two groups - based on the day&#xD;
      of Team A on service in the functional bracing group (FG) or based on the day of Team B in&#xD;
      the group who will wear rigid immobilization (IG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first schedule will be on the second day (dressing), when functional brace or rigid&#xD;
      immobilization will be applied in 25Â° of plantar flexion (PF). After that regular follow up&#xD;
      will be after 3 and 6 weeks. In FG immobilization remains the same for 6 weeks, in IG it will&#xD;
      be changed after 3 weeks and the foot put into neutral position. Patients in both groups will&#xD;
      use crutches for assistance, and careful weightbearing of 5 to 10 kg will be allowed within&#xD;
      first 3 weeks. Patients will be allowed to perform ROM exercises as much as their&#xD;
      immobilization allows. After 3 weeks, patients may start with weightbearing as much as&#xD;
      tolerated (until pain is felt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 weeks, all immobilization will be removed and patients in both groups will start with&#xD;
      the rehabilitation according to the protocol (learned with physiotherapists). They are&#xD;
      allowed to walk without crutches, with progressively increasing weightbearing (till tolerable&#xD;
      pain) and ROM exercises with careful increasing of dorsiflexion (DF) (till 8 weeks in the&#xD;
      sitting position and if possible, in water). Stretching exercises and squats with lifted heel&#xD;
      will be allowed after 8 weeks (with a hand support between two chairs or tables and careful&#xD;
      increasing of the load until pain is felt). Raising on toes or heels with the operated leg&#xD;
      only will be allowed 12 weeks after the operation. Limited sports activities will be&#xD;
      individually allowed after three months with recommended full loading 6 months after&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major and minor complication rate, diameter of the healed tendon, active and passive ankle&#xD;
      range of motion (using neutral zero method), standing heel-rise test (after 3 and 6 months if&#xD;
      no pain is felt) and clinical outcome using AOFAS score will be observed. Return to the&#xD;
      previous activity level, presence of associated complaints and subjective assessment (scored&#xD;
      as good, fair or poor) will be also assessed. The outcome will be checked again after 1 and&#xD;
      finally after 3 years. All the data will be recorded in the medical record (in computer),&#xD;
      additional (manual) list is recorded with the investigators. Statistical analysis (parametric&#xD;
      and non-parametric tests) will be performed (null hypothesis is that there will be no&#xD;
      significant differences between the groups in the number of complications, particularly&#xD;
      re-ruptures and in final results (type I and type II errors will be considered, p value less&#xD;
      than 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant). In any case of complications&#xD;
      patients can be scheduled anytime to the clinics in order to solve the problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety considerations Any patient can withdraw the study anytime - it has to be stated but in&#xD;
      the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the safety protocols must be respected and no harm produced to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Clinical follow-up will take part 3 years. Patients will be scheduled after 3 and 6&#xD;
      weeks and then after 2, 3 and 6 months and then after 1 and 3 years after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance The trial will follow the principles of good clinical practice - patients&#xD;
      will be able to come to the clinics anytime if any complications occur and to withdraw the&#xD;
      study at any time. All the data through will be recorded in the hospital data system and in&#xD;
      the checking list of investigators and followed by the investigators and other clinicians at&#xD;
      the department, who will be acquainted to the study. Results will be collected and checked at&#xD;
      the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes of the study It's expected that patients in the FG will earn more comfort&#xD;
      and regain earlier ROM and strength with no statistically significant differences in&#xD;
      complication rate (particularly re-rupture rate) and possible benefits in the end functional&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of results and publication policy Publication of the results could bring the&#xD;
      support and more confidence in the use of modified percutaneous Achilles tendon repair under&#xD;
      local anesthesia with early functional treatment. It could be thus assessed as an effective&#xD;
      one (with no more complications and with low costs) and as the method that brings more&#xD;
      comfort to the patients with earlier ROM, strength and ability to return to the previous&#xD;
      activities in comparison to the concept of rigid postoperative immobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the project It's designed as a 4-year study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problems anticipated Potentially low number of patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      who will accept to participate in the study, possible problems with the fear in patients of&#xD;
      weakness of the functional immobilization, that can be so simply removed, potential problems&#xD;
      in respecting the rehabilitation protocol, potential loss of the patients to the final&#xD;
      follow-up and potential rejection of the patients to wear rigid immobilization, once they&#xD;
      will hear about the comfort and benefits of functional bracing in the patients in the FG&#xD;
      (this is one of the reasons for a relatively short duration of the project).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project management The project will be lead by the main investigator and helped with the&#xD;
      co-investigator - all the other employees at the department will be acquainted with the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Presented research will be performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      The protocol will be considered and approved by the national ethics committee (KME) and will&#xD;
      follow ethical standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be given informed/consent protocol with a free will to take a&#xD;
      participation or to decide to any other type of treatment (non-operative or open operative&#xD;
      treatment) with a clear presentation of benefits and drawback of each method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budget and other support for the project No extra funds will be requested or provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaboration with other scientists or research institutions No other research institutions&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Links to other projects No link to other projects or groups of investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other research activities of the investigators Investigators are a full time employees for a&#xD;
      clinical work in a state-owned hospital as Orthopaedic-Trauma surgeons.&#xD;
