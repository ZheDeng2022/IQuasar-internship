  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of arterial oxygen desaturation (hypoxemia) during the induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia remains one of the main causes of complications and mortality in anesthesia. In a&#xD;
      healthy patient breathing in ambient air [Inspired O2 fraction (FiO2) = 21%] before the onset&#xD;
      of narcosis, a drop in arterial O2 saturation (SpO2) occurs within 1 to 2 minutes. When&#xD;
      pre-oxygenation is performed for 3 minutes in healthy subjects with FiO2 = 100%, SpO2 is less&#xD;
      than 97% after 7.9 minutes of apnea and arterial O2 desaturation (SpO2 &lt;93%) occurs after 8&#xD;
      to 9 minutes. For this reason and &quot;in order to prevent arterial desaturation during tracheal&#xD;
      intubation or supraglottic device insertion maneuvers&quot;, it is recommended &quot;to systematically&#xD;
      perform a pre-oxygenation procedure (3 min / 8 deep breaths) , including in the context of an&#xD;
      emergency &quot;. Tolerance to apnea is conditioned by the amount of O2 stored during the&#xD;
      pre-oxygenation phase. Oxygen is transported to different tissues in 2 forms: combined with&#xD;
      hemoglobin (Hb) and in dissolved form. In ambient air, the quantity of O2 transported by the&#xD;
      Hb is much greater than the part transported in dissolved form. However, when the patient&#xD;
      breathes a gas enriched in O2, all the molecules of Hb are quickly saturated (SpO2 = 100%),&#xD;
      while the content of dissolved O2 increases constituting a reserve allowing to increase the&#xD;
      tolerance to apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under usual conditions (3 minutes pre-oxygenation with FiO2 = 1), tolerance to apnea is&#xD;
      shorter in obese subjects. Arterial O2 desaturation occurs after 2-3 minutes of apnea in&#xD;
      patients with grade III obesity [Body Mass Index (BMI)&gt; 35 kg / m2]. In addition, arterial O2&#xD;
      desaturation is faster the higher the BMI is. In fact, in obese patients, the lung volumes&#xD;
      that can be mobilized in the supine position are modified compared to the non-obese subject:&#xD;
      decrease in vital capacity, decrease in expiratory reserve volume, increase in airway&#xD;
      resistance, decrease in thoracic compliance. These changes are, in part, explained by the&#xD;
      weight of tissue on the rib cage and abdomen leading to compression of the lungs and&#xD;
      diaphragm. In addition, there is also an increase in oxygen consumption in patients with a&#xD;
      BMI&gt; 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different techniques have been proposed to increase apnea tolerance in obese patients. For&#xD;
      Dixon et al., The desaturation of the morbidly obese subject (BMI&gt; 40 kg / m2) is less rapid&#xD;
      after 3 minutes of pre-oxygenation carried out with the patient in a half-seated position at&#xD;
      25 °: 201 seconds against 155 seconds in the Control group. This additional time seems to&#xD;
      correlate with the value of the arterial pressure in O2 (PaO2) measured at the end of the&#xD;
      pre-oxygenation (442 vs 360 mmHg). Likewise, the proclive position (30 ° reverse&#xD;
      Trendelenburg) during the pre-oxygenation phase seems effective in limiting the occurrence of&#xD;
      desaturation after induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The O2 reserve is usually assessed by measuring the partial pressure of O2 in the arterial&#xD;
      blood. A value greater than 100 mmHg indicates that an amount of O2 is &quot;in reserve&quot;,&#xD;
      increasing tolerance to apnea. In practice, this examination is not feasible in current&#xD;
      practice because it requires the performance of an invasive procedure, cannot be measured&#xD;
      continuously and the rendering of the result is delayed by several minutes. In recent years,&#xD;
      a technology based on spectrophotometry has been developed to measure the saturation of Hb in&#xD;
      O2 in non-pulsatile blood. By algorithmic transformation, an Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) is&#xD;
      calculated. Its value varies from 0 to 1 and covers a data range between 100 and 200 mmHg of&#xD;
      blood pressure in O2 (moderate hyperoxia). This data is obtained continuously and&#xD;
      non-invasively from a sensor (RD Rainbow SET R Sensors; Masimo) placed on the 3rd or 4th&#xD;
      finger of the hand. When a patient receives an O2 enriched gas mixture, the value of ORI&#xD;
      increases rapidly and reaches a plateau. When the patient is in apnea, the drop in the ORI&#xD;
      value precedes the drop in SpO2 by several tens of seconds. In a pilot study observing the&#xD;
      kinetics of ORI in non-obese (BMI &lt;25 kg / m2) or obese (BMI&gt; 30 kg / m2) anesthetized&#xD;
      patients, we observed that the time required to reach the plateau of l The ORI was longer&#xD;
      (133 ± 30 seconds) in &quot;obese&quot; patients compared to &quot;non-obese&quot; patients (89 ± 28 seconds).&#xD;
      Thus, one hypothesis to explain the poorer tolerance to apnea in obese patients would be that&#xD;
      the duration of 3 minutes of pre-oxygenation as recommended in the recommendations is&#xD;
      insufficient.&#xD;
