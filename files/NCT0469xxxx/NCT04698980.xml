  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In French Guiana, malaria is endemic and two species predominate: P. falciparum and P. vivax.&#xD;
      The treatments against Plasmodium vivax malaria are: nivaquine for 3 days against circulating&#xD;
      blood parasites and primaquine for 14 days against parasites dormant in the liver. Primaquine&#xD;
      can cause iatrogenic hemolytic anemias in patients with favism, i.e. G6PD deficiency. This&#xD;
      anemia can be severe enough to cause the death of the deficient patient. Thus, the WHO and&#xD;
      HCSP recommendations indicate that a quantitative assay of the activity of this enzyme should&#xD;
      be carried out before its prescription. This deficiency is a recessive inherited disease&#xD;
      linked to the X chromosome characterized by more or less low levels of enzymatic activity&#xD;
      which depends on the genotype of the patients but not only because the phenotype depends on&#xD;
      the level of activation of the X chromosome for each cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, obtaining a G6PD assay in French Guiana is a long process since it is done in&#xD;
      mainland France and the pre-analytical conditions are quite demanding. Thus, in areas of&#xD;
      transmission of P. vivax, patients usually have a bout of revival before being prescribed&#xD;
      primaquine. This period includes: dosing G6PD at a distance from access, obtaining the result&#xD;
      and then the nominal ATU to finally obtain and deliver the primaquine.&#xD;

      This is a interventional,prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional and comparative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this study, the following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selection of subjects according to their G6PD activity from the list of participants&#xD;
           previously included in the ELIMALAR Palustop study and from known LHUPM patients in&#xD;
           Cayenne following a request for a G6PD dosage, whether or not related to malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of clinical data from participants (sex, age, ethnicity of parents and&#xD;
           grandparents).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood samples from subjects showing G6PD activity of the following three&#xD;
           categories &quot;severe deficiency&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of G6PD activity by the &quot;STANDARD G6PD&quot; technique from SD BIOSENSOR versus&#xD;
           the reference enzymatic method&#xD;
