  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare heterogeneous group of inherited disorders&#xD;
      characterized by brittle bones, frequent fractures, and skeletal deformities that affect an&#xD;
      individual's ability to walk. Based on Sillence classification, there are four types of OI;&#xD;
      Type I (mild, non-deforming), Type II (perinatal lethal), Type III (severely deforming), and&#xD;
      Type IV (moderately deforming). Recently 3 types added type V, VI and type VII.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deformities of the long bones are common in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta&#xD;
      particularly in the lower limbs Where they are also more severe. Multiple fractures can occur&#xD;
      and the ability to walk may be compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of orthopaedic surgery implies the correction of long bone bowing, rotational&#xD;
      malalignment, angular deformity and prevention or reduction of the fracture incidence&#xD;
      .Surgical intervention in the form of multiple osteotomies, realignment and fixation by&#xD;
      intramedullary rods can correct deformity of the long bones and provides internal support&#xD;
      enhancing the potential for standing and assisted or independent walking Sofield and Millar,&#xD;
      Page and Mead popularized the operation of multiple osteotomies and fixation by&#xD;
      intramedullary rods. In 1963 the baily dubow nail was first introduced The telescopic rodding&#xD;
      and nailing have been developed in order to obtain a long lasting osteosynthesis in a growing&#xD;
      long bone, thus, reducing the need of replacement. The evolution of telescoping rods for the&#xD;
      treatment of fractures and deformity in children with diminished bone Quality has resulted in&#xD;
      an approved and commercially available new single entry telescopic rod system, the Fassier&#xD;
      Duval Telescopic IM System (FD-rod).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent publications a high reoperation rate for proximal rod migration and a complication&#xD;
      rate up to 40% because of rod migration, limited telescoping and joint protrusion was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that our study will advance the proper surgical intervention for children with&#xD;
      osteogenesis imperfecta for better functional outcomes&#xD;
