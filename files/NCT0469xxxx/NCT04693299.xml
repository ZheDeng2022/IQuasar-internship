  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate bowel preparation for colonoscopy has an extremely relevant impact on diagnostic&#xD;
      yield and procedural success. The guidelines recommend an adequate colon cleansing rate of at&#xD;
      least 90% of procedures. It has been shown that patients with inadequate colon cleansing&#xD;
      history have a high probability of not reaching an adequate bowel preparation again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surprisingly, no evidence-based recommendations are available regarding bowel preparation in&#xD;
      the patient with inadequate colon cleansing history. Therefore, identifying the factors&#xD;
      associated with repeated inadequacy of bowel cleansing is crucial in order to define the best&#xD;
      preparation strategy in this subset of patients. The implications for patients and for&#xD;
      healthcare system are many: improving the quality of bowel preparation would reduce the need&#xD;
      to repeat colonoscopy and the risk of conducting unreliable examinations. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      would reduce the costs for the healthcare system by avoiding to overload endoscopic units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient and hospitalized patients, adults, candidates for colonoscopy for any pathology,&#xD;
      as part of the normal care process, with the need to repeat bowel preparation due to&#xD;
      inadequate cleansing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency regime&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to obtain consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refusal of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of factors independently associated with repeated inadequate colon cleansing&#xD;
      after inadequate bowel preparation at previous colonoscopy, and consequent development (and&#xD;
      validation) of a predictive model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colon cleansing will be evaluated according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS),&#xD;
      which assigns a score from 0 (presence of solid stools) to 3 (excellent visualization of the&#xD;
      colonic mucosa) for each of the three main segments of the colon, i.e. right colon,&#xD;
      transverse colon and left-rectum colon. Colon cleansing will be judged inadequate in case of&#xD;
      a total score &lt;6 or a score &lt;2 even in only one of the colic segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Assess the prevalence of repeated inadequate bowel cleansing in the patient with previous&#xD;
      inadequate cleansing&#xD;
