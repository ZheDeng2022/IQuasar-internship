      This study is aprospective cohort study on the outcome of a combination of bone marrow&#xD;
      stimulation and modified suture bridge in the arthroscopic treatment of small and medium&#xD;
      rotator cuff tear. The patients with small to medium rotator cuff injuries (less than 3cm in&#xD;
      diameter) requiring arthroscopic surgery were collected. The patients were followed up before&#xD;
      and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery, including pain, functional&#xD;
      score, joint range of motion, MRI and CT findings, complications and other quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative indicators. The self-control and intra group analysis were performed to evaluate&#xD;
      the treatment effect; and the correlation analysis was performed on the treatment results To&#xD;
      determine the important factors affecting the therapeutic effect.&#xD;

    <description>According to the anteroposterior diameter of the injury, single or double high braided thread were used to suture the tendon in a modified Mason Allen way without knotting. Bone marrow stimulation was carried out in the footprint area of rotator cuff. A 2.0 mm diameter cone was created with a depth of 1 cm and a spacing of 5 mm. Six to eight holes were made due to the diameter of the tear of rotator cuff until blood and fat droplets exudate. Then the threads were passed through the locking eyelet of the lateral row anchor. After tightening the threads, the anchor was screwed in at the distal part of the gteater tuberosity. With this new technique, the rotator cuff was repaired by one lateral row anchor without medial row knotting.</description>
