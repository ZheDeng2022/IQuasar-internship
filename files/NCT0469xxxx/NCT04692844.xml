      Pathophysiology of tremor-modulating mechanisms of propranolol and primidone in essential&#xD;
      tremor (ET) will be studied using accelerometry with electromyography (EMG), transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS), and eyeblink conditioning paradigm (EBCC). TMS is a&#xD;
      well-established experimental method for studying the effects of drugs on motor cortex&#xD;
      excitability. EBCC is a learning paradigm that can be used for studying cerebellar&#xD;
      dysfunction since only brainstem and cerebellar functions seem to be needed for this&#xD;
      paradigm. The investigators will use TMS to study the mechanisms of primidone and propranolol&#xD;
      action in ET, EBCC paradigm to evaluate cerebellar dysfunction in ET patients and to show&#xD;
      whether cerebellar dysfunction influences the effectiveness of propranolol and primidone. The&#xD;
      investigators will clinically assess patients using The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment&#xD;
      Scale (TETRAS) and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) scales. Patients&#xD;
      with ET will be studied prior to treatment with propranolol or primidone and re-tested 3-6&#xD;
      months after treatment initiation. On each visit, the investigators will clinically assess&#xD;
      the patients and perform accelerometry, TMS measurements, and the eyeblink classical&#xD;
      conditioning (EBCC) paradigm. The investigators hypothesize that in ET patients, baseline&#xD;
      electrophysiological parameters will differ between responders and non-responders to&#xD;
      propranolol and primidone and that propranolol and primidone will cause a different pattern&#xD;
      of change in electrophysiological parameters among responders. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      cerebellar dysfunction will negatively correlate with patients' response to treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Although ET is the most common of movement disorders, its pathophysiology has not&#xD;
      yet been fully explained. Central nervous system functional studies have shown that&#xD;
      oscillatory activity within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical networks plays a key role in ET's&#xD;
      pathophysiology. The origin of this oscillatory activity and the potential role of the&#xD;
      primary motor cortex in its formation or modulation remains unknown. Neuropathological&#xD;
      studies found degenerative structural changes in the cerebellum of ET patients. Propranolol&#xD;
      and primidone are the first-line therapies for ET and the sole medications for treating ET&#xD;
      with the level A recommendations according to the latest guidelines of the American Academy&#xD;
      of Neurology. Propranolol is a beta-blocker class of medication and primidone is a&#xD;
      barbiturate. In spite of solid evidence of their effectiveness in ET patients, the mechanisms&#xD;
      of their central action are not yet fully understood. It is believed that propranolol&#xD;
      mediates its therapeutic action through peripheral beta-2 adrenergic receptors of skeletal&#xD;
      muscles and muscle spindles and through central beta-adrenergic and serotoninergic receptors.&#xD;
      After oral intake, primidone is partially metabolized to phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA) and&#xD;
      phenobarbital. Even though the studies have shown that PEMA does not have anti-tremor&#xD;
      activity, primidone is much more effective in alleviating tremor than phenobarbital alone. In&#xD;
      addition, it has been shown that the anti-tremor effect of primidone occurs sooner than its&#xD;
      metabolite phenobarbital is produced. This may be due to the non-metabolized primidone&#xD;
      compound having an anti-tremor activity or due to PEMA's and phenobarbital's synergistic&#xD;
      activity. No association between anti-tremor activity and the concentration of primidone or&#xD;
      phenobarbital in the serum has been found. While phenobarbital activity is well known to be&#xD;
      mediated through binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors, the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of non-metabolized primidone is poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To study the mechanisms of primidone and propranolol action in ET with the use of TMS.&#xD;
      The investigators believe that studying mechanisms of action of medications that have been&#xD;
      shown to reduce ET can further improve the understanding of ET pathophysiology. Since the&#xD;
      cerebellum is thought to be involved in ET pathophysiology the EBCC paradigm will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate cerebellar dysfunction in ET patients and to show whether cerebellar dysfunction&#xD;
      influences the effectiveness of propranolol and primidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and inclusion/exclusion criteria: Fifty patients will be recruited from the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic for extrapyramidal disorders. Only patients with the diagnosis of ET made&#xD;
      according to the newest consensus statement on the classification of tremors and only&#xD;
      patients who will be initiated on propranolol or primidone will be included. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria for TMS will be used. Patients having a history of seizures or mental illness,&#xD;
      patients with a cardiac pacemaker, metal material in the head (except dental material in the&#xD;
      mouth), or with medication pumps and pregnant women will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: Patients treated with propranolol or primidone will be studied prior to&#xD;
      treatment and 3 - 6 months after treatment initiation. Patients will not be allowed to start&#xD;
      any new medication with the action on the central nervous system, while included in the&#xD;
      study. Tremor will be assessed clinically using the TETRAS scale and by EMG and accelerometry&#xD;
      recordings. Positive treatment response will be defined as a 30% or more decrease in tremor&#xD;
      amplitude. At baseline cerebellar function will be assessed clinically with the SARA scale&#xD;
      and electrophysiologically using the EBCC paradigm. TMS will be used to study motor cortex&#xD;
      excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerometry with electromyography: Tremor (frequency and amplitude) will be objectively&#xD;
      evaluated in the subjects with accelerometry. A triaxial accelerometer will be attached to&#xD;
      the 3rd metacarpal bone bilaterally. Simultaneously EMG will be recorded. Bipolar Ag / AgCl&#xD;
      surface EMG electrodes will be placed over the flexor carpi radialis and the extensor carpi&#xD;
      radialis muscle bilaterally. Electromyography and accelerometry will be recorded while&#xD;
      subjects will be sitting in an armchair/wheelchair or lying in a hospital bed (a) at rest&#xD;
      position (b) with arms outstretched (postural condition) (c) at the postural condition with&#xD;
      500 g mass attached to the hand (weight loading) and (d) while performing a goal-directed&#xD;
      task (action).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) Single TMS pulses will be applied using Magstim 2002&#xD;
      magnetic stimulator with monophasic waveform (Magstim Company, Carmarthenshire, Wales, UK).&#xD;
      For double TMS pulses, two Magstim 2002 stimulators connected with the Bistim module will be&#xD;
      used. The stimulators will be connected to a standard figure 8 coil. The coil will be&#xD;
      positioned tangentially to the skull and over the 'hotspot' point on the scalp, with the&#xD;
      handle pointing backward at an angle of ~ 45 ° with respect to the sagittal plane. Hotspot&#xD;
      point is defined as stimulation site resulting in the largest motor evoked potentials (MEPs)&#xD;
      recorded over the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle. A hotspot point will&#xD;
      be found by visual inspection. The MEP amplitude in APB muscle will be measured with EMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC) paradigm is a protocol of associative motor&#xD;
      learning in which paired presentation of a conditioned (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US)&#xD;
      leads to the production of a conditioned eyeblink response (CR) 10,42. The CS will be a tone&#xD;
      with a frequency of 2000 Hz and a strength of 50-70 dB higher than the hearing threshold of&#xD;
      the subject (but at least 80 dB) and a duration of 400 milliseconds that will be presented&#xD;
      bilaterally via binaural headphones. The unconditioned stimulus will be delivered by&#xD;
      percutaneous supraorbital nerve electrical stimulation through a pair of Ag-AgCl cup&#xD;
      electrodes with the cathode over the supraorbital foramen and the anode 2 cm above.&#xD;
      Percutaneous electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve will last 200 microseconds and&#xD;
      will start 200 microseconds before the end of the CS so that the stimuli will co-terminate.&#xD;
      Blinking will be recorded with EMG electrodes placed bilaterally over the orbicularis oculi&#xD;
      muscles. The test will consist of seven sets. In the first six sets, there will be nine&#xD;
      trials with paired conditioned-unconditioned stimuli, one trial with the only US, and one&#xD;
      trial with only CS. In the seventh section, eleven trials of only CS will be given. Among the&#xD;
      individual tests, there will be a random interval (from 10s to 30s), so that the habituation&#xD;
      will be as small as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Clinical and TMS measures before and after treatment will be compared&#xD;
      using parametric or nonparametric two-related-samples T-test, depending on the data&#xD;
      distribution or repeated-measures ANOVA. Regression analyses will be used to determine&#xD;
      demographic, clinical, and electrophysiological predictors of response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized by investigators that in ET patients, baseline electrophysiological&#xD;
      parameters will differ between patients who will improve while taking propranolol or&#xD;
      primidone (responders) and patients who will not improve while taking any of these&#xD;
      medications (non-responders). Propranolol and primidone will cause a different pattern of&#xD;
      change in electrophysiological parameters among responders. Since the intention component of&#xD;
      action tremor usually responds to treatment to a lesser degree than other components of&#xD;
      tremor and is reported to be associated with cerebellar dysfunction, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that cerebellar dysfunction will negatively correlate with the patient's response&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
