    <textblock>
      Prospective open-label single-arm feasibility study assessing the tolerability of opioid&#xD;
      medication reduction in conjunction with noninvasive peripheral nerve stimulation (NPNS) for&#xD;
      patients taking prescription opioids to treat moderate-severe primary RLS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For RLS patients taking a stable dose of prescription opioid medications prior to study&#xD;
      entry, iterative opioid dose reduction is performed in conjunction with open-label NPNS&#xD;
      treatment. For each of two iterative step-downs in opioid dose (step-down #1 and step-down&#xD;
      #2), a 1-2-week run-in phase to allow resolution of opioid withdrawal symptoms unrelated to&#xD;
      RLS is followed by a 1-wk assessment phase to evaluate if RLS symptoms have increased. Study&#xD;
      participation is terminated if there is a clinically significant increase in RLS severity&#xD;
      during the assessment phase or if there are intolerable opioid withdrawal symptoms at any&#xD;
      time. Participants who tolerate both step-downs have the option of an extension phase&#xD;
      involving a third step-down with the same format.&#xD;
