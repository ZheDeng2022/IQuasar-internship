    <textblock>
      The incidence of crush is one of the important indicators of the quality of health care in&#xD;
      various medical institutions in the world. The Taiwan Hospital Evaluation and Medical Quality&#xD;
      Council (referred to as the Medical Policy Council) listed crush as a quality indicator of&#xD;
      clinical care in 2011 (Taiwan Clinical Effectiveness indicator system, 2011), the incidence&#xD;
      of crush is also a sensitive indicator of nursing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study: based on the nursing of crushed wounds, intervene in education and&#xD;
      training courses, and add elements of flipped learning, to evaluate the effectiveness of KAP&#xD;
      (knowledge, attitude, practice) and self efficacy of nursing staff for learning crushed&#xD;
      nursing.&#xD;

      The incidence of crush is one of the important indicators of the quality of health care in&#xD;
      various medical institutions in the world. The Taiwan Hospital Evaluation and Medical Quality&#xD;
      Council (referred to as the Medical Policy Council) listed crush as a quality indicator of&#xD;
      clinical care in 2011 (Taiwan Clinical Effectiveness indicator system, 2011), the incidence&#xD;
      of crush is also a sensitive indicator of nursing care, reflecting the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      structure, process and results of nursing care (Cai, Zheng, Liu, 2011). Reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of crush has been the goal of the joint efforts of health care institutions. In&#xD;
      2008, the US CMS announced that it would stop paying for the treatment of crushed patients in&#xD;
      hospitals, allowing medical institutions to pay more attention to the prevention of crushing,&#xD;
      so many promote the quality of medical care The organizations have put forward relevant&#xD;
      strategies, including the announcement of evidence-based tools for predicting and evaluating&#xD;
      crush injuries, guidelines on the classification and prevention of crush injuries, and&#xD;
      training materials for crush education (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2014;&#xD;
      Edsberg et al ., 2016; Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2017). The occurrence of&#xD;
      pressure injury can be prevented. Many studies have explored the reasons why nursing staff&#xD;
      cannot implement the behaviors of pressure injury prevention. The results show that the&#xD;
      common obstacles are the lack of time and manpower of nursing staff, lack of relevant&#xD;
      education and training, and failure to provide standard operations. Routine, physicians did&#xD;
      not participate, etc. (Jankowski &amp; Nadzam, 2011; Moore &amp; Price, 2004; Worsley, Clarkson,&#xD;
      Bader, &amp; Schoonhoven, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, many researchers have explored the impact of various education and training&#xD;
      methods on nursing staff's cognition, behavior and attitude related to the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of crush. They can all prove that education and training measures can significantly&#xD;
      improve nursing staff's cognition. These important changes must be carefully considered as to&#xD;
      what learning or training methods should be used to provide first-line nursing staff to&#xD;
      familiarize them with and correctly perform practical operations. Clinical nurses are faced&#xD;
      with ever-changing patient situations. The goal of learning is not only to transfer knowledge&#xD;
      to enhance cognition, but more importantly, how to transform knowledge into clinical practice&#xD;
      skills and provide clinical decision-making with appropriate care measures in response to&#xD;
      different situations. Ability, teaching must use multiple strategies to achieve this goal,&#xD;
      providing a real and interactive learning environment, allowing nurses to participate in&#xD;
      operational activities in a simulated real environment, repeatedly learning related knowledge&#xD;
      and techniques, and strengthen the proficiency of clinical applications And to build&#xD;
      consensus on care can improve the quality of work (Norman, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study: based on the nursing of crushed wounds, intervene in education and&#xD;
      training courses, and add elements of flipped learning, to evaluate the effectiveness of KAP&#xD;
      (knowledge, attitude, practice) and self efficacy of nursing staff for learning crushed&#xD;
      nursing.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of pressure ulcer</measure>
    <time_frame>2days</time_frame>
    <description>The section measure nurses&quot; knowledge regarding pressure ulcer prevention, staging, and wound description. The researcher used a known, public and validated available tool of Pieper Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Test. (Pieper and oton,1959). The tool has 39 items of yes, no, I don&quot;t know.&#xD;
=90%-100% showed a very high level of knowledge, 80%-89,99% showed a high level of knowledge, 70%-79, 99% showed a moderate level of knowledge, 60%-69, 99% showed a low level of knowledge, And a percentage below 60% showed a very low level of knowledge.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitude of pressure ulcer</measure>
    <time_frame>2days</time_frame>
    <description>The section has 11 items describing the nurses &quot;attitudes regarding pressure ulcer prevention. The researcher used the validate &quot;Staff Attitude Scale&quot; adapted from a scale used by Moore and Price which is also an a scale open to the public (to use the instrument does not require permission). Each item has 5 point scoring system ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.&quot; Here, &quot;strongly disagree&quot; = 5 points, &quot;disagree&quot; = 4 points, &quot;Neither agree nor disagree&quot;=3 points, Agree=2 points and &quot;Strongly agree&quot;=1 point. (Moore Z, Price P, 2004).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Practice of pressure ulcer</measure>
    <time_frame>2days</time_frame>
    <description>This tool originally consisted of multiple-choice questions with &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;responsible person&quot; and &quot;comment&quot; as options but after adaptation, only &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; remained as options.&#xD;
The McDonald&quot;s standard of learning outcome was used to interpret the level of practice as either low or high as follow.(McDonald, 2002): A percentage of 60% indicated a very low level of practices, A percentage of 60%-69,99% indicated a low level of practices , A percentage of 70%-79,99% indicated a moderate level of practices, A percentage of 80%-89, 99% indicated a high level of practices, A percentage of 90%-100% indicated a very high-level of practices.</description>
