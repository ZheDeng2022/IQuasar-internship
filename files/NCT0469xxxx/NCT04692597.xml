  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, control trial of Active Duty and DoD Beneficiaries, age 18 years&#xD;
      or older, with complaints of hand osteoarthritis. Subjects will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      groups receiving either LLLT or sham LLLT. Subjects will receive LLLT or sham LLLT weekly&#xD;
      over a period of six weeks. At each visit, patients will rate their pain using the Defense&#xD;
      and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and assess their functionality using the Disabilities&#xD;
      of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Subjects will have a follow up visit six&#xD;
      weeks after the treatment protocol for a final assessment of pain and function. The Phoenix&#xD;
      Thera-Lase laser is a Class II, 510k cleared device (#K151521) and is legally marketed in the&#xD;
      US. Investigators are using in accordance with its approved labeling and no changes to the&#xD;
      approved labeling are being sought.&#xD;

      US. Investigators are using in accordance with its approved labeling and no changes to the&#xD;
      approved labeling are being sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phoenix Thera-Lase System is intended to emit energy in the infrared spectrum to provide&#xD;
      topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for temporary relief of minor&#xD;
      muscle and joint pain, muscle spasm, pain and stiffness associated with minor arthritis,&#xD;
      promoting relaxation of muscle tissue and to temporarily increase local blood circulation. It&#xD;
      is specifically designed as a high-power laser with an output power of 35 Watts and an output&#xD;
      wavelength of1064 nm. The study will be utilizing an output power of 74 Watts and an output&#xD;
      wavelength of 1275 nm.&#xD;
