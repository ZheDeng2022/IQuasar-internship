      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of teverelix TFA in the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced prostate cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo an up to 7 day screening period to determine eligibility for&#xD;
      study entry. On Day 0, patients who meet the eligibility requirements will be enrolled in an&#xD;
      open-label manner and will receive a loading dose of teverelix TFA (one subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      injection in the abdomen and one intramuscular (IM) injection in the buttock). Patients will&#xD;
      then receive maintenance doses of teverelix TFA (one SC injection in the abdomen) at 4- or&#xD;
      6-weekly intervals up to week 24. The patients will return for a final assessment 4 weeks&#xD;
      after their last maintenance dose injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dosing regimen to be tested (Group 1) is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loading Dose = 120 mg teverelix TFA SC + 120 mg teverelix TFA IM Maintenance Dose = 120 mg&#xD;
      teverelix TFA SC every 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this dosing regimen is unsuccessful (more than 2 (of 20) patients fail treatment) then&#xD;
      recruitment to Group 1 will end and enrollment in Group 2 will open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing regimen that may be tested (Group 2) is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loading Dose = 90 mg teverelix TFA SC + 90 mg teverelix TFA IM Maintenance Dose = 90 mg&#xD;
      teverelix TFA SC every 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this dosing regimen is unsuccessful (more than 2 (of 20) patients fail treatment) then&#xD;
      recruitment to Group 2 will end and the study will be terminated.&#xD;
