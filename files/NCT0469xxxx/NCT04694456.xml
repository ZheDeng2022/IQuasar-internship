  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The facial-glenohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (DMFSH1) is characterized by a selective&#xD;
      and asymmetrical involvement of the facial muscles, the shoulder girdle and the anterolateral&#xD;
      lodge legs. Genetically, the disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner and is&#xD;
      caused by a pathogen contraction of repeat units (UR) say D4Z4 localized to the telomeric&#xD;
      portion of chromosome 4qA. The loss of UR causes hypomethylation of DNA and chromatin&#xD;
      relaxation of the region that lead to inappropriate expression of DUX4 retrogene highly&#xD;
      toxic. The inappropriate expression induces a T cell reaction inflammatory response that&#xD;
      participate and increase muscle damage. In favor of this hypothesis, several muscle MRI&#xD;
      studies have shown that atrophy and fibro-adipose degeneration (hyper signal in T1) were&#xD;
      preceded by the appearance of muscle inflammation (hyper signal T2STIR) confirmed on&#xD;
      histologically and dysregulation of genes involved in adaptive and innate immunity.&#xD;
      scientific hypothesis and potential benefits: the investigateur hypothesize that in patients&#xD;
      of DMFSH1, the immune system cells may participate in the pathophysiology of the disease&#xD;
      through changes in serum secretion of one or more cytokines and / or a modification of the&#xD;
      response of inflammatory cells in some cell damage stimuli. Design: this is a single-center&#xD;
      pilot study, interventional. In this study, the investigator will assay the serum cytokines&#xD;
      and changes in peripheral blood cells of the expression of cytokines in response to some&#xD;
      stimuli in 20 patients with Type 1 DMFSH genetically confirmed at an intermediate stage of&#xD;
      clinical disease (kept walking, but at least one muscle of lower limbs reached) and compare&#xD;
      with controls from the CYTOKINAGE study. The investigator will also carry patients clinical&#xD;
      testing (MMT sum score) and functional (6minute test march MFM) and a MRI not injected whole&#xD;
      body (T1 sequences + and T2STIR) to study the relationship between these parameters and&#xD;
      secretion cytokines or serum in response to certain stimuli Main objective: to compare serum&#xD;
      levels of IL-6 in patients with DMFSH and controls.&#xD;
