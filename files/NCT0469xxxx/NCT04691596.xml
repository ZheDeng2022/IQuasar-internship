  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this two-month pilot study is to measure the behavioral change induced by&#xD;
      targeted habit formation reminders that are surfaced via an iPhone app and financial&#xD;
      incentives that were offered conditional on using a personalized contextual cue for a daily&#xD;
      walking habit. The data and user feedback collected during this study will also be used to&#xD;
      optimize the design and content of the iPhone app, which will be tested in future, larger&#xD;
      scale experimental research.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects for this research are recruited on campus at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and&#xD;
      the State University of New York at Albany, and their participation was incentivized. After&#xD;
      meeting the eligibility criterion (including have at least some intrinsic motivation for&#xD;
      increasing physical activity), downloading the project's iPhone app, and signing the project&#xD;
      consent form, all participants will have their step count data recorded for an 8-week study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing interventions that have successfully improved study participants' health-related&#xD;
      behaviors typically find that behavioral changes do not persist beyond 3 months after the&#xD;
      intervention period. Fortunately, novel habit formation interventions from the psychology&#xD;
      literature offer the potential for building long-term behavioral change and avoiding the&#xD;
      common &quot;relapse triangles&quot; observed in these existing behavioral interventions. These new&#xD;
      methods are based on the theory that habits are formed through the repetition of the same&#xD;
      behavior in response to a stable, environmental cue. After an initial period of repetition,&#xD;
      automaticity is formed, and the behavioral response becomes more effortlessly/unconsciously&#xD;
      induced by the environmental cue. Behavioral reminders that reinforce a specific behavioral&#xD;
      routine-environmental cue pair have been shown to support this initial period of habit&#xD;
      formation; however, given the individualized nature of these reminders, a generalizable&#xD;
      intervention method has not been developed and empirically tested. This research will use an&#xD;
      iPhone app to examine the role of both general informational on contextually cued habits and&#xD;
      the use of personalized reminders and financial incentives for using a daily physical&#xD;
      activity contextual cue on the persistence of physical activity behavior after the&#xD;
      intervention tools are withdrawn.&#xD;
