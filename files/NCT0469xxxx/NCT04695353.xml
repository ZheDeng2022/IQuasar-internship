  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telecommunication Platforms are new technology founded to build better short messages service&#xD;
      alternative. Their use have increasingly drawn a wider range of interest as a text&#xD;
      communication and video chat system between health care professionals and patients and health&#xD;
      care professionals themselves. However, high-quality and adequately evaluated research,&#xD;
      especially in the field of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson´s disease, is needed&#xD;
      to establish whether patients with these specific neurological problems can be effectively&#xD;
      managed with these technological tools in low, middle, and high-income countries&#xD;

      Telecommunication Platforms are new technology founded to build a better short message&#xD;
      service alternative. Their use have increasingly drawn a wider range of interest as a text&#xD;
      communication and video chat system between health care professionals and patients and health&#xD;
      care professionals themselves. However, high-quality and adequately evaluated research,&#xD;
      especially in the field of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson´s disease, is needed&#xD;
      to establish whether patients with these specific neurological problems can be effectively&#xD;
      managed with these technological tools. In this study, patients with Parkinson´s disease from&#xD;
      high, middle, and low-income countries covering urban and rural populations, with at least&#xD;
      one neurologist with Movement Disorders practice (Spain, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria,&#xD;
      Tanzania, South Korea, United States, Egypt), will be included. Feasibility, clinical&#xD;
      management, providers and patient´s satisfaction will be compared between in-office vs.&#xD;
      telemedicine (virtual) visits. This study will show the effectiveness of telemedicine, when&#xD;
      the access to specialized neurological care is limited, especially now with the Covid-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
