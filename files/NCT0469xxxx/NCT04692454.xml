      According to the total population of cancer patients, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC), two of gastroenterological cancers are involved in the most acquired&#xD;
      five cancers. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of tumor-related morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide, and HCC is one of the top ten cancers in China. Currently, the&#xD;
      intervention for gastrointestinal cancers mainly focuses on surgical removal, but patients&#xD;
      still have a high risk of recurrence. Thus, the prevention of cancer recurrence is the most&#xD;
      crucial topic for the intervention. The pathophysiology of gastroenterological cancers is&#xD;
      multifactorial and not yet completely understood. However, immunosuppression is a major&#xD;
      contributing factor in tumor cells play a central part in disease progression. It determines&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients.&#xD;

      the prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune checkpoint or complementary therapy in the course of cancer treatment has been&#xD;
      reported as effective methods for patients. In recent years, more integrated treatment&#xD;
      studies have found that acupuncture can improve the discomfort and pain caused by&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In addition, the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has shown that acupuncture&#xD;
      can effectively regulate the immunity of patients. In this study, investigators are&#xD;
      considering to apply modern acupuncture as the immune modulation in gastroenterological&#xD;
      cancers. Modern acupuncture is to use the scalp and ear acupuncture methods to identify&#xD;
      diseases and checkpoints and apply them to regulate the immune function of patients with&#xD;
      gastroenterological cancers. The infiltration of a specific subtype of T-cell and the&#xD;
      expression of PD-L1 in tumors may be applied as indicators of cancer prognosis. These CD8 T&#xD;
      cells (also called Tex cells) often fail to eradicate tumors and can become dysfunctional or&#xD;
      exhausted. The magnitude of the reinvigoration of circulating Tex cells determined in&#xD;
      relation to pretreatment tumor burden correlated with clinical response. By monitoring Tex&#xD;
      cells, investigators will evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture as a complementary therapy&#xD;
      to regulate the immune functions of patients with gastroenterological cancers&#xD;

    <description>Using PBMC to analyze the number of CD8+ T that is NK, NKT, DC, and Monocyte.&#xD;
At the start of acupuncture adjuvant therapy (week 0, week 2, and week 4) blood was collected.&#xD;
Blood draw - 15 ml/each&#xD;
Week0- baseline, the original data of CD8+T before receiving acupuncture&#xD;
Week2- the data of CD8+T after receiving acupuncture&#xD;
Week4- the data of CD8+T after two weeks that the patients did not receive acupuncture&#xD;
Compare with week0 and week2 data, if week2 data is higher than week0, it means the acupuncture has effective to add the number of CD8+ T.&#xD;
Compare with week 2 and week 4 data results and confirm the data change of the number of CD8+ T after stopping the acupuncture. If the data do not decline, it means the effect of acupuncture remains to exist. If the data declines, it means the effect of acupuncture weakens.</description>
