  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This past century witnessed a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity. successful&#xD;
      maintenance of weight loss is defined as losing at least 10% of the initial body weight and&#xD;
      maintaining it for at least one year. However, keeping the low body weight is rarely&#xD;
      maintained, as 80% of people who lost 10% of their body weight will return to their initial&#xD;
      weight within a year. Although there is no agreement as to what contributes to the recurrent&#xD;
      weight regain phenomenon (also known as 'weight cycling' or 'yo-yo diet'), it is strongly&#xD;
      associated with the risk of developing metabolic risk factors and their complications&#xD;
      including heart disease and all-cause mortality. Altering the gut microbiota is one method to&#xD;
      treat disease states associated with gut bacteria. For instance, fecal microbiota transplant&#xD;
      (FMT) or fecal bacteriotherapy, is the process of transferring stool from a healthy donor to&#xD;
      another. Although numerous individual microbes have been identified as related to obesity,&#xD;
      multiple studies suggest that loss of microbial diversity has a stronger impact on the&#xD;
      development of metabolic dysfunction, this diversity may be restored by FMT. This study will&#xD;
      determine whether microbiome modulation might be a possible future target against recurrent&#xD;
      obesity in humans and whether orally administered FMT from a lean donor, post weight loss&#xD;
      might be an effective intervention to prevent weight regain.&#xD;

      This is a placebo-controlled, double blinded interventional study evaluating high intensity&#xD;
      oral fecal microbiota transplantation from lean healthy donors to prevent weight regain after&#xD;
      a successful weight loss intervention. Volunteers will be recruited in the following ways:&#xD;
      e-mail, and social media. Volunteers wishing to participate will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding the aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Volunteers who&#xD;
      qualify for the study will be invited to an introductory meeting at the Weizmann Institute of&#xD;
      Science. The details of the experiment and potential risks or discomforts involved in it will&#xD;
      be presented, after which the volunteers will sign informed consent forms. Volunteers will&#xD;
      start the study and become active participants for a maximal duration of two years, depending&#xD;
      on the weight loss process&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline - one week of profiling and screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutritional intervention - weight loss intervention which will be based on Mediterranean&#xD;
           hypocaloric diet restriction. Meetings will occur every two weeks starting from the&#xD;
           second week of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FMT/ Placebo intervention - 5 weekly cycles of high intensity lean donor FMT/placebo&#xD;
           will be administered starting after reaching a weight loss of 5 to 10% of total body&#xD;
           weight. Each cycle will consist of 10 capsules administered on two consecutive days&#xD;
           (total 100 capsules)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up meetings - total follow up of one year after FMT cycles. Meetings will occur&#xD;
           every month for the first 3 months of the study, and every 3 months, Afterwards.&#xD;
