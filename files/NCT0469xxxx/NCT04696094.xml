  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to detect the change of m6A RNA modification from peripheral&#xD;
      blood of patients with moyamoya disease, and to assess the relationship between clinical&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;

      Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by occlusion of&#xD;
      bilateral internal carotid and intracerebral arteries with the compensatory growth of fragile&#xD;
      small vessels. The etiology of disease is still unclear. The pathology is associated with&#xD;
      blood vessels, characterizing the molecular changes of blood in patients with MMD may yield&#xD;
      insights into the disease. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is identified to be the most common and&#xD;
      abundant RNA molecular modification in eukaryotes, and involves in a variety of metabolic&#xD;
      processes of RNA, such as RNA transcription, shearing, nuclear transport, and translation&#xD;
      ability. The propose of this study is to investigate the change of m6A RNA modification in&#xD;
      patients blood with moyamoya disease and its influence on clinical indicators, aiming to&#xD;
      provide potential pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.&#xD;

    <description>Stage 1 stenosis of the carotid artery at its suprasellar portion, usually bilateral; Stage 2 moyamoya vessels begin to develop at the base of the brain; Stage 3 moyamoya vessels become more prominent as major trunks in the anterior circulation become severely stenotic or occluded; Stage 4 posterior cerebral arteries are occluded, moyamoya vessels begin to diminish and collateral pathways from extracranial circulation develop; Stage 5, moyamoya vessels are diminishing and extracranial circulation progresses; Stage 6, moyamoya vessels and the major cerebral arteries completely disappear, the cerebral hemispheres receive blood through the abnormal extracranial-intracranial anastomosis.&#xD;
