      This study takes place in the Divisions of Urology. Patients who have only received hormonal&#xD;
      therapy will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly sorted into an experimental group and a&#xD;
      control group after completing a pretest questionnaire. The experimental group will receive&#xD;
      the the multimedia hormone therapy information program once per week for 6 consecutive weeks,&#xD;
      while the control group will receive routine care. The follow-up data collections will be&#xD;
      completed at 8 and 12 weeks after the pretest. For quantitative measurement, the main&#xD;
      variables will be social support, self-efficacy, quality of life, and positive thinking.&#xD;

      This study takes place in the Divisions of Urology at Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals. Patients&#xD;
      who have only received hormonal therapy will be enrolled. With reference to past research&#xD;
      findings, self-efficacy theory, and experts' advice, a multimedia hormone therapy information&#xD;
      program was developed. The multimedia hormone therapy information program covered 6 topics,&#xD;
      namely the recognition of hormone therapy and multimedia information programs, mindfulness,&#xD;
      exercise, stress relief, positive thinking, and prevention or reduction of fatigue. A pilot&#xD;
      study will be conducted to check the feasibility of intervention study design and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the program will be tested. Patients will be randomly sorted into an&#xD;
      experimental group (multimedia information group, n = 36 to 40) and a control group (routine&#xD;
      care group, n = 36 to 40) after completing a pretest questionnaire. The experimental group&#xD;
      will receive the multimedia information intervention once per week for 6 consecutive weeks,&#xD;
      while the control group will receive routine care. The follow-up data collections will be&#xD;
      completed at 8 and 12 weeks after the pretest. For quantitative measurement, the main&#xD;
      variables will be social support, self-efficacy, quality of life, positive thinking, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with program. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) will be used to o analyze&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
