  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses videoconferencing to deliver an evidence-based exercise program, Seated Tai&#xD;
      Chi for Arthritis, to adults aging with long-term mobility disabilities. In the 8-week Tele&#xD;
      Tai Chi intervention, participants will use a tablet or computer to join a small-group,&#xD;
      online class (1hr, twice weekly) from home; during each session, participants will exercise&#xD;
      as a group along with the pre-recorded video lessons and have the opportunity for social&#xD;
      interaction (via video chat) before and after class. The study will examine the effects of&#xD;
      the Tele Tai Chi program on physical activity and social connectedness for adults aging with&#xD;
      long-term mobility disabilities, a population likely to experience barriers to exercise&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

      This study is part of the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Technologies to&#xD;
      Support Aging-in-Place for People with Long-Term Disabilities (RERC TechSAge). This study&#xD;
      uses videoconferencing to translate an evidence-based exercise program for older adults,&#xD;
      Seated Tai Chi for Arthritis, from an in-person setting to a remote class and to a different&#xD;
      population, adults aging with mobility disabilities. In the 8-week Tele Tai Chi intervention,&#xD;
      participants will use a tablet or computer to join a small-group, online class (1hr, twice&#xD;
      weekly) from home; during each session, participants will exercise as a group along with the&#xD;
      pre-recorded video lessons and have the opportunity for social interaction (via video chat)&#xD;
      before and after class. The study will examine the effects of the Tele Tai Chi program on&#xD;
      physical activity and social connectedness (primary outcomes), as well as exercise&#xD;
      self-efficacy, falls efficacy, depression, quality of life, and pain (secondary outcomes) for&#xD;
      adults aging with long-term mobility disabilities, a population likely to experience barriers&#xD;
      to in-person exercise participation.&#xD;
