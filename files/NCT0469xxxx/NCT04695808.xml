    <textblock>
      Parallel to the increase in life expectancy by years, the population of women living in the&#xD;
      post-menopausal period is also increasing. In order to have a healthy menopause, which is an&#xD;
      important part of women's life, it is thought that the adoption of yoga practice without&#xD;
      health risks by women and its implementation as a lifestyle may be effective in reducing the&#xD;
      symptoms of menopause experienced by women. In line with this information, it is aimed to&#xD;
      determine the effect of yoga training on menopausal symptoms. The research will be carried&#xD;
      out with menopausal women between the ages of 40-60 in Famagusta region. Women will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups as intervention and control. Personal information form and menopause&#xD;
      rating scale will be used in the research. The intervention group will be given yoga practice&#xD;
      two days a week for 10 weeks. Menopause rating scale will be applied to the intervention and&#xD;
      control group before and after the research.&#xD;

    <description>It was developed in German by Schneider et al. In 1992 to measure the severity of menopausal symptoms and was adapted to English in 1996. MRT was adapted to Turkish by Gürkan in our country in 2005. There are &quot;0 = None&quot;, &quot;1 = Mild&quot;, &quot;2 = Moderate&quot;, &quot;3 = Severe&quot; and &quot;4 = Very severe&quot; options for each item in the Likert-type scale consisting of 11 items including menopausal complaints. The total score of the scale is calculated based on the scores given for each item. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 0, the highest score is 44.</description>
