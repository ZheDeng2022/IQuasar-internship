    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether people with CLL or SLL who are currently&#xD;
      receiving treatment with ibrutinib can stop treatment and remain off-treatment for at least&#xD;
      12 months, if they have achieved complete or partial remission of their disease.&#xD;

    <description>Participants without evidence of clinical relapse will remain off therapy and continue serial monitoring through end of study at 24 cycles. Participants with clinical relapse will continue to be monitored off therapy through 24 cycles or until meeting criteria for treatment per iwCLL criteria. If participants experience clinical relapse requiring treatment, radiology assessment, disease assessment, and testing for resistance mutations will be performed. Participants will be observed for an additional 12 cycles following start of reintroduction of therapy.</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,&#xD;
        the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center&#xD;
        (MSKCC). If the investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their&#xD;
        patient's medical records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study&#xD;
        and their potential for enrolling in the research study. Potential subjects contacted by&#xD;
        their treating physician will be referred to the investigator/research staff of the study.&#xD;
        The principal investigator may also screen the medical records of patients with whom they&#xD;
        do not have a treatment relationship for the limited purpose of identifying patients who&#xD;
        would be eligible to enroll in the study and to record appropriate contact information in&#xD;
        order to approach these patients regarding the possibility of enrolling in the study.&#xD;
