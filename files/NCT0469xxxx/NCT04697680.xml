  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1/3 of Americans sleep ≤6h per night, an amount that has been deemed&#xD;
      sub-optimal by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society, the&#xD;
      National Sleep Foundation, American Thoracic Society, and the American Heart Association.&#xD;
      These consensus statements echo findings from many reviews on this topic. This is alarming,&#xD;
      given epidemiologic and experimental research showing that reduced sleep time is associated&#xD;
      with a variety of negative health outcomes including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, and mortality. Different people may need different amounts of sleep. And some people&#xD;
      may not be able to make large changes to their sleep schedule all at once. Many individuals&#xD;
      have situational constraints that change over time. As such, short sleep represents an unmet&#xD;
      public health problem. There are, however, no empirically supported interventions for&#xD;
      insufficient sleep. The proposed study addresses this critical gap by evaluating the efficacy&#xD;
      of a novel intervention that is theoretically grounded, feasible, and has positive impacts on&#xD;
      sleep duration. The intervention in the proposed study is by design self-correcting,&#xD;
      individually-tailored, and not dependent on unknown individual sleep needs. It can adapt to&#xD;
      any schedule and situation and can adapt to changes in a person's sleep schedule. The main&#xD;
      goal of this study is to evaluate whether a manually determined sleep extension intervention&#xD;
      is effective at improving sleep and related outcomes among adults who find it difficult to&#xD;
      get enough sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 35 % of Americans sleep ≤6h per night, an amount that has been deemed&#xD;
      sub-optimal by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society, the&#xD;
      National Sleep Foundation, American Thoracic Society, and the American Heart Association.&#xD;
      These consensus statements echo findings from many reviews on this topic. This is alarming,&#xD;
      given epidemiologic and experimental research showing that reduced sleep time is associated&#xD;
      with a variety of negative health outcomes including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, and mortality. As such, short sleep represents an unmet public health problem. There&#xD;
      are, however, no empirically supported interventions for insufficient sleep. The proposed&#xD;
      study addresses this critical gap by evaluating the efficacy of a novel intervention that is&#xD;
      theoretically grounded, feasible, and has positive impacts on sleep duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have associated habitual short sleep duration with important adverse&#xD;
      cardiometabolic outcomes, including weight gain, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      stress, etc. They suggest that those that report short sleep may be more likely to experience&#xD;
      functional impairments and are less likely to engage in behaviors consistent with a healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle. A proposed mechanism of these relationships is that insufficient sleep duration&#xD;
      triggers metabolic disturbances and increased immune response resulting in appetite&#xD;
      dysregulation, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and resultant disease states. In addition to&#xD;
      cardiometabolic effects, behavioral and functional consequences of short sleep have been&#xD;
      well-documented. For example, short sleepers are more likely to exhibit difficulties&#xD;
      initiating and/or maintaining sleep daytime sleepiness drowsy driving, and other impairments&#xD;
      as a result of sleep loss. Laboratory studies have extensively documented neurocognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral effects of sleep loss, including increased objective sleepiness, impaired&#xD;
      vigilance using computer-based psychomotor assessments, and deficits in working memory,&#xD;
      decision-making, and executive function, as assessed using standardized neuropsychologic and&#xD;
      neuroimaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most, if not all, sleep disorders have targeted interventions. Interventions have not been&#xD;
      developed or evaluated for insufficient sleep. An effective and disseminable intervention for&#xD;
      insufficient sleep will likely differ from those of sleep disorders- rather than an&#xD;
      in-clinic, visit-based, medication/device/procedure-focused, non-tailored approach, a&#xD;
      successful approach for insufficient sleep will likely be out-of-clinic,&#xD;
      population/community-based, lifestyle-focused, and individually-tailored. The problem of&#xD;
      insufficient sleep is less like other sleep disorders and more like other health behaviors,&#xD;
      such as smoking, poor diet, and lack of physical activity, in that the reasons for&#xD;
      insufficient sleep involve beliefs and attitudes, home and work demands, and environmental&#xD;
      constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this in mind, a behavioral intervention was developed based on concepts originally&#xD;
      implemented in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI), the most well-supported&#xD;
      treatment approach for insomnia. Although CBTI does not routinely increase sleep duration, it&#xD;
      has sleep efficiency as its primary endpoint and employs concepts that can potentially be&#xD;
      used to increase sleep time while maintaining high levels of sleep efficiency. The&#xD;
      intervention originally developed included algorithms that recognize the natural &quot;ebb and&#xD;
      flow&quot; of sleep ability within an individual seek to use an individual's own sleep data to&#xD;
      predict (1) when is an optimal time to make a change to sleep, and (2) what sort of&#xD;
      incremental change should be made with the eventual goal of increasing sleep efficiency and&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different people may need different amounts of sleep. And some people may not be able to make&#xD;
      large changes to their sleep schedule all at once. Many individuals have situational&#xD;
      constraints that change over time. The intervention in the proposed study is by design&#xD;
      self-correcting, individually-tailored, and not dependent on unknown individual sleep needs.&#xD;
      It can adapt to any schedule and situation and can adapt to changes in a person's sleep&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sleep extension intervention specifically uses a novel approach, where individualized&#xD;
      feedback will be provided to each participant, based on information provided by the wearable&#xD;
      devices and the sleep diary. The goal is recognizing the optimal time to make a change to&#xD;
      sleep patterns and deciding what kind of change should be made.&#xD;
