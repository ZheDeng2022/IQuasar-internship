  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, progressive, incurable neurodegenerative disease that&#xD;
      can result in severe disability and impairment in health-related quality of life. Current&#xD;
      medical and surgical therapies are aimed toward maximal symptom relief with minimal&#xD;
      associated side effects or morbidity. It is generally accepted that a well-placed&#xD;
      stereotactic lesion is comparable in its magnitude of clinical effect to the high frequency&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of the same target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exablate Neuro is intended to treat movement disorders with unilateral ablation of targets in&#xD;
      the thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus nuclei.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the ExAblate system, transcranial high-intensity focused ultrasound has been coupled&#xD;
      with high resolution MRI to provide precise, consistent treatments that can be monitored&#xD;
      throughout the procedures.&#xD;
