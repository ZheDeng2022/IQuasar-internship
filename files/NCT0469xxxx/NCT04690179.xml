    <textblock>
      The objective of our study is to evaluate the prevalence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity&#xD;
      in our surgical population and their relationship in postoperative complications after&#xD;
      complex abdominal wall surgery and its influence on hernia recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study on a prospective maintains database of complex abdominal wall&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We select patients with defects larger than 10 cm from any location (W3 of the EHS&#xD;
      classification), excluding other causes of complex abdominal wall in order to have a more&#xD;
      homogeneous sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) scans of the selected patients will be reviewed to&#xD;
      establish the diagnosis of sarcopenia, obesity, sarcopenia-obesity or the absence of these&#xD;
      (normal). The CT scans will be reviewed by two trained investigators, blinded to&#xD;
      postoperative complications and survival. In case of disagreement, a third investigator will&#xD;
      break the tie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiological diagnosis of sarcopenia has been established based on the skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass index. Skeletal muscle mass measurement will be performed in a cross-section in the&#xD;
      pre-surgical CT scan at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BMI, the Visceral Fat Area and the Subcutaneous Fat Area (SFA) will also be measured.&#xD;
      With the previous data, the VFA / SFA ratio will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed with the collection of sociodemographic data, comorbidities and&#xD;
      presence of risk factors for the development of incisional hernia, ASA, size and location of&#xD;
      the hernia, surgical technique, postoperative complications according to Clavien-Dindo, stay,&#xD;
      readmission, late complications and hernia recurrence. Likewise, the presence or absence of&#xD;
      recurrence will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed to see if there is a correlation between sarcopenia&#xD;
      and sarcopenic obesity with the appearance of local and systemic complications and&#xD;
      recurrence. To evaluate the independent contribution of each variable to the presence of&#xD;
      complications, a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of incisional hernia after laparotomy is as high as 20% according to current&#xD;
      literature, and repair of incisional hernias is one of the most frequently performed&#xD;
      operations by general surgeons. A not inconsiderable part of these hernias, due to their&#xD;
      size, complexity or degree of contamination, is considered complex abdominal wall. Surgery in&#xD;
      these patients is a major surgery that is accompanied by a marked anabolic response and a&#xD;
      high incidence of local and systemic complications and a high recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, there has been a growing interest in evaluating the relationship between&#xD;
      surgical results and body composition. Sarcopenia is a new concept that reflects the loss of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle mass. Recent publications have recognized sarcopenia as a prognostic factor&#xD;
      in the evolution of surgical patients operated on for cancer, transplants, trauma and&#xD;
      emergency surgery, but there is still little evidence that it plays a role in surgery for the&#xD;
      complex abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of sarcopenia is growing progressively. One of the causes may be that life&#xD;
      expectancy has increased worldwide and is well known that ageing is associated with the&#xD;
      progressive loss of muscle mass (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia can be classified into primary, which is caused by ageing, and secondary, which is&#xD;
      caused by immobility or diseases such as cancer (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive accumulation of fat mass. It&#xD;
      is a major public health problem and is recognized as a risk factor for global morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Its incidence continues to increase worldwide and its prevalence has doubled since&#xD;
      1980 (11). It is well documented that visceral obesity is associated with high complication&#xD;
      rates in patients who undergo abdominal wall surgery (12-15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body mass index (BMI) has long been used to diagnose malnutrition. However, weight gain&#xD;
      and loss are not reliable indicators of changes in body composition; generally, men store&#xD;
      body fat in the visceral area while women store it mainly subcutaneously. Also, people tend&#xD;
      to lose muscle mass and gain fat as they age. Therefore, patients with a similar BMI may have&#xD;
      a different nutritional status (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenic obesity combines the risks of obesity and sarcopenia and is considered the&#xD;
      worst-case scenario (17,18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to evaluate the prevalence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity&#xD;
      in our population. The aim is to evaluate its relationship in postoperative complications&#xD;
      after complex abdominal wall surgery and its influence on hernia recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective study on a prospective maintains database of complex abdominal wall surgery&#xD;
      of three hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have decided to select only patients with defects larger than 10 cm from any location (W3&#xD;
      of the EHS classification) (19), excluding other causes of complex abdominal wall in order to&#xD;
      have a more homogeneous sample (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conjunction with the Radiology Department of Ramón y Cajal University Hospital,&#xD;
      pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) scans will be reviewed to establish the diagnosis of&#xD;
      sarcopenia, obesity, sarcopenia-obesity or the absence of these (normal). The CT scans will&#xD;
      be reviewed by two trained investigators, blinded to postoperative complications and&#xD;
      survival. In case of disagreement, a third investigator will break the tie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiological diagnosis of sarcopenia has been established based on the skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass index. Skeletal muscle mass measurement will be performed in a cross-section in the&#xD;
      pre-surgical CT scan at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). To identify muscle&#xD;
      tissue the range -29 to +150 in Hounsfield Units (HU) will be used. The L3 region contains&#xD;
      the following muscles: psoas, paraspinal muscles, and muscles of the abdominal wall&#xD;
      (transverse abdominis, external and internal obliques, rectus abdominis). The skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass index will be calculated with the sum of the cross-sectional areas of these muscles&#xD;
      (cm2). These values will be normalized according to the square of the patient's height (m2).&#xD;
      As a cut-off point for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, we will use the values published by Prado&#xD;
      et al. (≤52.4 cm2 / m2 in men and ≤38.5 cm2 / m2 for women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define obesity we use several indexes. The most widely accepted is body mass index (BMI)&gt;&#xD;
      30 kg / m2 (25-30 kg / m2-overweight). However, this index does not take into account muscle&#xD;
      mass and fat distribution, which are associated with different risk profiles. The Visceral&#xD;
      Fat Area (VFA) measured by CT is strongly correlated with BMI and waist circumference.&#xD;
      Cross-sectional measurement of VFA demonstrates a stronger correlation than anthropomorphic&#xD;
      measurements with obesity-related conditions, such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The VFA&#xD;
      measurement will be performed in a cross-section in the preoperative CT scan at the L3 level.&#xD;
      To identify fat tissue, the range -190 to -30 in Hounsfield Units (HU) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Japanese Obesity Society, we will consider visceral obesity calculated by CT&#xD;
      as a visceral fat area (VFA)&gt; 100cm2, regardless of sex and age. Despite the fact that the&#xD;
      Asian population and the Western population present important differences, this data has&#xD;
      already been used previously in European series. To complete the study, the Subcutaneous Fat&#xD;
      Area (SFA) will also be measured. With the previous data, the VFA / SFA ratio will be&#xD;
      calculated. The patient will be considered viscerally obese when the VFA / SFA ratio is &lt;0.4.&#xD;
      This correction will be used to mitigate biases derived from using values in different&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed with the collection of sociodemographic data, characteristics of&#xD;
      the surgical procedure, as well as complications derived from it. Likewise, the presence or&#xD;
      absence of recurrence will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables: sex, age, comorbidities and presence of risk factors for the development of&#xD;
      incisional hernia, ASA, weight, height, BMI, date of surgical intervention, size and location&#xD;
      of the hernia, surgical technique, postoperative complications according to Clavien-Dindo ,&#xD;
      stay, readmission, late complications, hernia recurrence, end-date of follow-up. To evaluate&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, a quality-of-life assessment was measured preoperatively and at 1-&#xD;
      and 2-year follow-up, using the European Registry for Abdominal Wall Hernias Quality of Life&#xD;
      (EuraHS-QoL) score, a hernia-specific tool developed by the European Hernia Society (20). In&#xD;
      addition, the following will be collected by radiology: skeletal muscle mass index (Skeletal&#xD;
      Muscle Index: SMI), visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for collecting clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, patients potentially candidates for the study will be selected from the complex&#xD;
      abdominal wall database of the three participating hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of selected patients from Hospital Ramón y Cajal will be sent to the Radiology&#xD;
      Department of the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital for the collection of SMI, VFA and SFA in&#xD;
      the pre-surgical CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative CT scans of the selected patients from the Henares University Hospital and&#xD;
      the Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda University Hospital will be recorded on a computer device to&#xD;
      be analyzed in the Radiology Department of the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital. Once the&#xD;
      study variables have been calculated, computing devices containing preoperative CTs will be&#xD;
      eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality of the quantitative variables will be analyzed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov&#xD;
      test. Continuous variables will be expressed as mean with standard deviation, and categorical&#xD;
      variables will be represented as proportions. For comparison analysis between groups,&#xD;
      continuous variables will be compared using the Student's t-test and categorical variables&#xD;
      will be analyzed, as appropriate, using the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test (univariate&#xD;
      analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of hernia recurrence, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used. In the&#xD;
      comparison of hernia recurrence between the groups, the long-rank test will be performed. In&#xD;
      the multivariate analysis for hernia recurrence, the Cox regression model will be used, which&#xD;
      will include the significant variables in the univariate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the independent contribution of each variable to the presence of complications, a&#xD;
      univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis will be performed with the inclusion&#xD;
      of candidate predictors, which are significant with p &lt;0.200 in the univariate comparison&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistically significant result will be considered when a value of p &lt;0.05. SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics Version 23 will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study limitations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of activities The approval of the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Ramón y&#xD;
      Cajal University Hospital is expected to be obtained in January 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, the patients candidates to participate in the study will be selected from the&#xD;
      complex abdominal wall data base of the three participating hospitals. We estimate that this&#xD;
      selection will be made in the month of February.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patients have been selected, the parameters described in the materials and methods&#xD;
      section will be determined in the preoperative CT scan of each patient. We estimate that the&#xD;
      time required to complete this part of the study will be six to eight months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, a statistical analysis will be made of the data obtained from the preoperative CT scan&#xD;
      and from the complex abdominal wall surgery database and the results will be interpreted. A&#xD;
      manuscript will be prepared to communicate the results obtained. We estimate that this&#xD;
      process will be performed in two or three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To know the incidence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in complex abdominal wall&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm whether sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are risk factors for the appearance&#xD;
           of complications and recurrence after complex abdominal wall surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This could help to better estimate the surgical risk of patients undergoing complex&#xD;
           abdominal wall surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are potentially modifiable with a proper nutritional&#xD;
           and physical exercise program. If we show that sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are&#xD;
           risk factors for the appearance of complications, it could help to reduce the morbidity&#xD;
           of these patients.&#xD;
