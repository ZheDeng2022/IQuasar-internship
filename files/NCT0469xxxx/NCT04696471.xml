  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a common and highly debilitating psychiatric disorder, however, the&#xD;
      predisposing brain mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, the investigators aim to examine&#xD;
      the immediate effect of transcranial brain stimulation (TBS) on brain activity and emotions&#xD;
      in adults with and without BD as a first stage toward understanding the predisposing brain&#xD;
      mechanisms of BD. The investigators hypothesize that TBS will reduce brain activity while&#xD;
      playing a game with rewards in all adults, but the TBS will reduce brain activity more in the&#xD;
      adults with BD compared to adults without BD. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      this reduced brain activity will be associated with reduced BD symptoms, such as negative&#xD;
      emotions.&#xD;

      This study aims to examine the effects of noninvasive stimulation on brain activity as&#xD;
      measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in participants with and without&#xD;
      Bipolar I Disorder. Eligible participants will undergo 5 study visits: a screening visit, a&#xD;
      baseline MRI visit, and 3 cTBS visits. Participants will receive brain stimulation and&#xD;
      undergo fMRI scanning at each of the 3 cTBS study visits, however, at one of the visits, the&#xD;
      brain stimulation will be a sham. The research associates and participants will be blinded to&#xD;
      when the sham occurs, which will be randomized beforehand. Certain information is withheld to&#xD;
      protect the scientific integrity of the study design&#xD;

left vlPFC sham TBS (go through the motions of applying cTBS to the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex but very low current is administered so that the participant feels like cTBS is being administered even though the current is too low to stimulate brain cells) Participants will know that one session will be a sham, but they will be blinded to which session is the sham.</description>

    <description>cTBS is a brief stimulation of a part of the brain with a magnetic field that passes through the scalp and skull safely. It is FDA-approved as a treatment for psychological conditions including depression; however, this device is not approved for the treatment of adults with Bipolar Disorder I or for use in healthy adults. This research study is using the cTBS off label in all participants (those with and without Bipolar Disorder I) to examine research questions</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators will complete and submit a National Data Archive (NDA) Data Sharing Agreement within 6 months of the Notice of Award Issue date. Study staff will upload data dictionary to the NDA website, and will review the NDA data definition for the measures collected and define the project's data definition harmonized to that standard. For measures not yet defined, project staff will work with the NDA staff to define the measure following NDA best practices. Informed consent will be collected from study participants that allows for broad sharing of participants' de-identified data. Study staff will use participants' personally identifiable information to generate NDA Global Unique Identifier (GUID) numbers for study participants.&#xD;
All data will be identified by GUID numbers only prior to submission to the NDA database. Data transfer procedures will be in accordance with all Institutional Review Board guidelines and federal regulations including HIPAA.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Raw data and data from descriptive/raw measures will be submitted on a semi-annual basis by July 15 and January 15 or the next business day. We also agree to submit to NDA the analyzed data yielded in our project (i.e., 12 months after accomplishment of each primary aim or objective, or immediately upon publication of the project's primary results, whichever occurs first). The PIs reserve the right to publish on the stated aims in a timely manner during the period of the award. Data will be available for addressing other research questions (i.e. which are not described in funded/pending grants) as soon as the data have been checked for accuracy (a period which will be no later than one year after the completion of each assessment). After the award has ended, the study investigators will continue to test the stated aims, but will also continue to solicit collaborations with outside researchers and to consider data requests in a timely manner.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Outside investigators must submit a 1)proposal of the study aims, hypotheses, variables/constructs, analytic approach, and estimated duration of the proposed research; 2)resume, qualifications, source of financial support, and conflict of interest statement; 3)sign a data-sharing agreement and confidentiality statement that stipulates using the data for the stated research purposes only, securing the data using appropriate computer technology, not manipulating the data in order to identify participants, acknowledging the grant that supported data collection and management in publications/presentations, and destroying or returning the data after analyses are complete; 4)obtain approval from their Institutional Review Board, and along with other staff members who have access to the data, submit certificates of the University of Pittsburgh Education and Certification Program in Research Practice Fundamentals or provide written documentation pf similar human subjects protection training.</ipd_access_criteria>
