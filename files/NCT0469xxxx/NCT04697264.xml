  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of women diagnosed with uterine cancer continues to rise each year. Since the&#xD;
      early 1990s, there has been almost 55% rise in the United Kingdom (UK). 34% of endometrial&#xD;
      cancer can be attributed to obesity. In the obese state, the function of adipose tissue&#xD;
      deteriorates resulting in a state of chronic inflammation. Adipocytokine-related signalling&#xD;
      pathways promote cancer development by causing inflammation, cell proliferation, DNA damage&#xD;
      and by inhibiting apoptosis. The investigators postulate that adipocytokines levels are&#xD;
      significantly different in uterine cancer patients of different weight categories and&#xD;
      different grade/stage/ type of tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any woman attending the hospital with endometrial cancer and receiving treatment here will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. Consent will be sought to obtain 30mls (2 1/2&#xD;
      tablespoons) of venous blood at the time of surgery, on day 1 post-surgery and 3/6 months&#xD;
      post-surgery during routine follow-up to check biomarker (adiponectin, leptin, tumour&#xD;
      necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2) levels to see if&#xD;
      the markers can be used to assess response to treatment. The investigators will also get&#xD;
      consent to collect tissue - adipose tissue (after surgery) and uterine cancer tissue and&#xD;
      lymph nodes (after histo-pathological evaluation) to assess for biomarkers. The investigators&#xD;
      will also obtain blood samples from patients undergoing chemotherapy for advanced stage&#xD;
      endometrial. All tissues procured will be anonymised and analysed at the oncology laboratory,&#xD;
      Leggett building, University of Surrey and later correlated with patients' medical data as&#xD;
      well as with tumour grade, stage and type. The investigators will also use archival tissue&#xD;
      blocks stored at the same laboratory for analysis (previously consented for use in research).&#xD;
      These are anonymised tissue and there is no link to patients' data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim would be to ultimately find immuno-stimulatory/ suppressive biomarkers in order to&#xD;
      develop novel diagnostic/ prognostic tools.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract. It is the&#xD;
           fourth most common cancer in the UK with around 9,500 new cases in 2017, current&#xD;
           lifetime risk being 1 in 36 women. The number of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer&#xD;
           continues to rise each year. Since the early 1990s, uterine cancer incidence rates have&#xD;
           increased by almost three-fifths (55%) in the UK (2015-2017). The association between&#xD;
           endometrial cancer and obesity is well documented. 7.5% of all cancers in women in UK&#xD;
           are attributable to being overweight / obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m2). For endometrial cancer,&#xD;
           this risk rises to 34%. A review of meta-analyses showed endometrial cancer risk is 16%&#xD;
           higher per 5 kg- gained during adulthood, 29% higher per 10cm increase in hip&#xD;
           circumference and 27% higher per 10cm increase in waist circumference. This higher&#xD;
           endometrial cancer risk with raised BMI is present in both pre- and post-menopausal&#xD;
           women. Moreover, patients who are obese tend to have a poorer outcome with more&#xD;
           co-morbidities than their non-obese counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the overweight and obese state, the function of the adipose tissue deteriorates&#xD;
           resulting in a state of chronic inflammation. In this inflammatory state, adipocytes and&#xD;
           macrophages secrete several molecules, adipokines and inflammatory cytokines, which may&#xD;
           promote tumour development and angiogenesis and stimulate adhesions and migration of&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Most implicated adipocytokines in the tumorigenesis pathway are adiponectin, leptin,&#xD;
           tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Insulin-like growth factor 1&#xD;
           and 2 (IGF 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adipocytokine related signalling pathways are important in the development of an&#xD;
           inflammatory microenvironment for tumours. This process is thought to increase the risk&#xD;
           of endometrial cancer by inducing cell proliferation and preventing cell apoptosis.&#xD;
           Adiponectin, the most abundant adipokine, has been suggested to have anti-angiogenic,&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. Raised leptin levels in obese state&#xD;
           promotes inflammation by stimulating the production of IL-6, TNFα as well as IL-1 and&#xD;
           IL-126. Leptin and adiponectin secretion are counter-regulated in vivo. A study by Luhn&#xD;
           et. al. has shown adiponectin to have inverse relationship with the risk of endometrial&#xD;
           cancer and leptin to have a direct correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Also, in an inflammatory environment, macrophages secrete potent proinflammatory&#xD;
           cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, which are known to activate numerous transcription&#xD;
           factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in immune responses,&#xD;
           anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The mechanisms of tumorigenesis are&#xD;
           thought to be involved are free-radical production that cause DNA damage and impaired&#xD;
           DNA repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research have further suggested that systemic levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)&#xD;
           is dysregulated in obesity either due to increased IGF production or by down-regulation&#xD;
           of IGF binding protein (IGFBP) production. IGF 1 is a growth and proliferation promotor&#xD;
           and has inhibitory effects on cell death and is a major contributor in many neoplastic&#xD;
           transformations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The above biomarkers are physiologically interrelated and are likely to reflect a more&#xD;
           restricted number of underlying biological pathways. Possibly, they work in a&#xD;
           synergistic capacity to modulate the risk of developing endometrial cancer. If specific&#xD;
           patterns of cytokine expression were found to be predictive of adverse outcome, then the&#xD;
           specific receptors may be targeted as a therapeutic option for endometrial cancer11. No&#xD;
           study so far has looked at all these markers together in the serum and tissue samples of&#xD;
           the same endometrial cancer patients to give a more wholesome idea about their effect on&#xD;
           tumour genesis, progression and outcome. Therefore, this study is designed to assess the&#xD;
           prognostic significance of these six biomarkers in the blood and tissue of endometrial&#xD;
           cancer patients and co-relating the levels with their BMI and tumour type, after&#xD;
           adjusting for age, parity, smoking status, menopausal status, use of hormone replacement&#xD;
           therapy (HRT)/ hormonal contraception, and prevalence of diabetes and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Development of novel biomarkers for a variety of uses including diagnosis, treatment&#xD;
           monitoring and prognostication is on the Cancer Reform Strategy agenda and actively&#xD;
           encouraged by the National Cancer Research Institute and Medical Research Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Understanding how adipocytokines influence endometrial cancer risk may help to elucidate&#xD;
           biological mechanisms important for the observed obesity-endometrial cancer association.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. THEORITICAL FRAMEWORK&#xD;
&#xD;
           As the incidence of endometrial cancer continues to rise there is a health need for a&#xD;
           better diagnostic and prognostic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Studying the different biomarker levels in blood and cancer tissue will enable us to&#xD;
           look for new targets that may be useful in the treatment and prognostication of this&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Also, if the levels of these markers change significantly post-treatment, the&#xD;
           investigators can investigate if it will be possible to use these markers to assess&#xD;
           response to treatment as follow-up for risk of recurrence forms an important part of the&#xD;
           treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS / OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess the relationship between the endometrial cancer and blood and tissue&#xD;
           biomarkers in patients referred for endometrial cancer management to Royal Surrey NHS&#xD;
           Foundation trust and to correlate with obesity and tumour characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. STUDY DESIGN and METHODS of DATA COLLECTION AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients being referred to the Royal Surrey NHS Foundation trust with diagnosed&#xD;
           uterine cancer will be given the research information leaflet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Initially, an invitation letter will be sent alongside the patients' clinic appointment&#xD;
           letter to inform them of the study and give them time for preliminary consideration of&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will then be approached in the outpatients' clinics after the initial&#xD;
           consultation by the clinician. They will be given a participant information leaflet&#xD;
           detailing the study rationale, methodology and analysis. Patients who agree to&#xD;
           participate in the study will be asked to sign a consent form after explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographic data will be collected at the same time to correlate various risk factors&#xD;
           associated with the development of uterine cancer. This data will be collected by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A short patient interview (10 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients' medical notes Data from the interview will be directly entered into an&#xD;
                existing departmental database for Gynaecological oncology which is password&#xD;
                protected and stored on NHS computers. A copy of the data proformas from the&#xD;
                interview will be filed in a secure room within the University department to allow&#xD;
                for source data verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will then have 30mls (2 ½ tablespoons) of venous blood taken on the day of&#xD;
           the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tissue samples from the participants undergoing hysterectomy will be collected as&#xD;
           follows: the PI will collect any fresh tissue (adipose tissue) directly from theatre&#xD;
           before fixing as it is not needed for establishing diagnosis and the uterine cancer&#xD;
           tissue and lymph node will be collected by the PI after histo-pathological examination&#xD;
           from the histo-pathology department after the diagnosis is established. All tissue&#xD;
           processing will adhere to Human Tissue Authority (HTA) guidelines and will be performed&#xD;
           at the Oncology laboratory at Leggett building at University of Surrey.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participants will have a repeat blood test (30mls) on day 1 post-surgery and at&#xD;
           their 3 or 6 months routine post-surgery follow up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For those participants who are recommended chemotherapy, the investigators will also ask&#xD;
           consent to collect demographic data at the time of consultation and baseline blood&#xD;
           sample (30mls venous blood) before commencing chemotherapy and after 3rd and 6th&#xD;
           chemotherapy cycles to assess any changes in the biomarkers that may correlate with&#xD;
           progression or regression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will also obtain archival tissue blocks (of uterine cancer patients&#xD;
           consented from a previous study for use during an appropriate ethics committee approved&#xD;
           research) to help increase the number of recruitments for this study. Their demographic&#xD;
           data with identification log will be made available to the PI only to assess for&#xD;
           correlation between their data and the tissue diagnosis during analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2. Sample analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           ELISA will be used to assay bio-marker levels in blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For tissue analysis the investigators will set up a tissue microarray (TMA). This will&#xD;
           allow more uniform staining of the sample for immunohistochemistry with no&#xD;
           inter-specimen variation of the staining method. Each case will be reviewed, and the&#xD;
           area of interest (tumour) will be marked on the slide and cores from the areas of&#xD;
           interest will be used to create the microarray block. Sections can then be cut from the&#xD;
           microarray block and slides prepared for immune staining. The advantage of using this&#xD;
           method is that the samples are subjected to the same conditions while being stained and&#xD;
           the same part of a tumour can be reliably stained for several markers. Tissue sections&#xD;
           from the TMA will be used for immune-staining and the expression of the markers of&#xD;
           interest will be scored. Clinical data which is available on the cases will then be&#xD;
           correlated with the histological and immunohistochemical scores and statistical analysis&#xD;
           will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3. Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard statistical analytical tools will be used to analyse the data. Relation between&#xD;
           different variables will be sought with odds ratio, confidence interval and significance&#xD;
           with P value (&lt;0.05 significant). The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to assess&#xD;
           differential expression of immune markers between tissue types -blood and tumour tissue.&#xD;
           Correlation with clinical characteristics will be determined using univariate log-rank&#xD;
           and multivariable Cox proportional hazards adjusting for age, stage, grade and&#xD;
           histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. SAMPLE AND RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified in the Royal Surrey NHS Foundation trust - either&#xD;
      seen here or referred here and receiving her treatment here for diagnosed endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1. Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will aim to recruit 30-60 patients with diagnosed endometrial cancer in the&#xD;
      study. This sample size will also include archived tissue sample (formerly consented and&#xD;
      stored in Leggett building, University of Surrey, for use in future ethical research).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2. Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients seen or referred with endometrial cancer at the Royal Surrey Oncology Department&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not receive any payments for participation in the study. The investigators aim&#xD;
      to obtain all information and samples at the time of routine visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.1. Sample identification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer will be identified through the Gynaecological&#xD;
      Oncology Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting or by the Gynaecological Oncology or Medical&#xD;
      Oncology teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.2. Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained after the patient has received the participant information&#xD;
      leaflet and had the opportunity to discuss and ask questions about the study. Enough time&#xD;
      will be given for the purpose. Patients must all have capacity to consent. Consent will be&#xD;
      undertaken by clinicians on the Gynaecological Oncology team. If necessary, a translator or&#xD;
      language line can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will also be taken for use of samples (anonymised and stored in Leggett building,&#xD;
      University of Surrey following all regulations by HTA) for use in future research.&#xD;
