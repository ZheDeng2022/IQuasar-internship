      To improve neurocognitive outcomes in 2-year-old children by implementing a community-based&#xD;
      intervention program that follows the principles of Conscious Discipline.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to introduce Conscious Discipline (CD) in Grenada as a means of improving&#xD;
      neurodevelopment in 2-year-old children. The CD intervention promotes improved&#xD;
      social-emotional connections between parents/guardians and children that reduces harsh&#xD;
      discipline and corporal punishment and provides an ideal environment for the development of&#xD;
      higher cognitive functioning (e.g. working memory, inhibition, emotional regulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is implemented by using a distributed local, train-the-trainer model in&#xD;
      partnership with the Grenada Roving Caregiver Program, managed by GRENCASE. CD training was&#xD;
      provided to 85 existing Roving Caregivers, 70 of whom were certified as Conscious Discipline&#xD;
      Paraprofessionals (CDPPs). Certified CDPPs traveled out to communities and villages&#xD;
      throughout Grenada, to impart knowledge and skills to new and expecting parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the intervention, parents who received CD training were assessed in their ability&#xD;
      to implement CD skills with their child(ren). Neurocognition was assessed in children&#xD;
      post-intervention using the INTERGROWTH 21st Neurodevelopmental Assessment (INTERNDA).&#xD;
      Neurocognitive outcomes were compared between the intervention arm and the waitlist control&#xD;
      arm of the study.&#xD;

    <description>The INTER-NDA is a measure of cognition, motor skills (fine and gross motor), language (expressive and receptive), behavior, executive function, attention and social-emotional reactivity for 2-year-olds. The measure is comprised of 30 items scored across a spectrum, with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group received one-on-one Conscious Discipline classes with a Roving Caregiver. These classes consisted of the dissemination of Conscious Discipline Skills and fun songs, games, and activities to foster connections between the infant and caregiver. Both the infant and caregiver received the intervention simultaneously.</description>
