      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the brain has been used to change the activity and&#xD;
&#xD;
      connections in the brain to improve memory. Researchers are interested in how these brain&#xD;
      changes cause memory improvements and how activity at the time of stimulation may change the&#xD;
      effects of TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how brain stimulation can be used to improve memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-40&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, participants will have a physical exam and will talk about their health. They&#xD;
      will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by&#xD;
      a strong magnetic field. During the MRI, participants will lie on a table that can slide in&#xD;
      and out of the scanner. A coil will be placed over the head. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      keep their eyes focused on a small cross on a computer screen inside the scanner. The scanner&#xD;
      makes loud noises. Participants will get earplugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visits 2 and 3, participants will have TMS and perform tasks. For TMS, a wire coil encased&#xD;
      in plastic is held on the scalp. When the coil is triggered, a brief electrical current&#xD;
      passes through the coil and creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During TMS,&#xD;
      an electroencephalogram (EEG) will record brain activity. For the EEG, a cloth cap with&#xD;
      electrodes is fitted on the participant s head. Participants will complete a memory task and&#xD;
      a spatial processing task. They will also complete surveys about their mental state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last 2-3 weeks.&#xD;

      The Behavioral Neurology Unit studies the human brain systems underlying learning and&#xD;
      adaptation with the goal of finding interventions to make these processes more efficient.&#xD;
      This study will observe neural reorganization underlying episodic memory performance. The&#xD;
      protocol will investigate how engaging in a memory task alters the activity and connectivity&#xD;
      of the network and the relevance of those changes to successful task performance. Also, how&#xD;
      this adaptation influences plasticity of the network will be examined. Using simultaneous&#xD;
      TMS, EEG, and cognitive testing, this study will examine the network basis of memory&#xD;
      processing, as well as elucidating potential mechanisms of TMS-induced memory improvement.&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to (1) examine the effects of TMS on EEG biomarkers of&#xD;
      successful memory performance and (2) investigate how the task state of the episodic memory&#xD;
      network influences the effect of faciliatory TMS on memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will answer basic science questions about the network basis of memory processing,&#xD;
      with potential application to other cognitive networks and domains. Additionally, these data&#xD;
      will provide a greater understanding of TMS as a tool for influencing the hippocampus, the&#xD;
      network, and memory performance, allowing for optimization of stimulation for that purpose.&#xD;
      Finally, this work will address clinical questions on how to improve memory and re-channel&#xD;
      activity in networks via noninvasive stimulation for clinical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Episodic memory provides a means by which we reflect on the past, make decisions about the&#xD;
      future, and form a learned identity. Deficits in this system occur in a variety of&#xD;
      neurological and psychiatric disorders, making them one of the most debilitating problems in&#xD;
      neurology. However, there currently exist no effective treatments for memory impairment. A&#xD;
      better understanding of how the brain adapts to perform a memory demand will not only expand&#xD;
      our basic knowledge of memory processing but could inform novel treatments for individuals&#xD;
      with memory impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Episodic memory depends on the hippocampus and a distributed set of regions which form the&#xD;
      hippocampal-cortical network (HCN), including medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate, and&#xD;
      medial and lateral parieto-occipital cortex. This network shows changes in fMRI activity and&#xD;
      connectivity in response to successful memory encoding and retrieval. Likewise, abnormal&#xD;
      function of this network has been associated with memory impairment in many disorders,&#xD;
      including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and Alzheimer s disease. Additionally, the HCN&#xD;
      generates real-time EEG signatures of successful encoding and retrieval, most notably the&#xD;
      Late Positive Posterior Event-Related Potential (ERP) and oscillatory activity in the&#xD;
      theta/alpha band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been substantial recent interest in using brain stimulation to manipulate brain&#xD;
      networks, both to test the role of particular regions and networks in memory processing&#xD;
      causally and as a potential therapeutic tool in treating memory disorders. Noninvasive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to manipulate activity and connectivity&#xD;
      in the HCN and improve memory performance in healthy adults. Repeated treatment over days&#xD;
      produces lasting effects, but single sessions of cTBS have been effective and time-locked&#xD;
      cTBS can produce facilitation at the trial-by-trial level. However, while enhancement of&#xD;
      connectivity in the HCN is positively correlated with memory improvement, how TMS treatment&#xD;
      increases the retention of information in the HCN and particularly the hippocampus remains&#xD;
      unknown. Additionally, while the effects of time-locked cTBS have been examined in relation&#xD;
      to fMRI activity in the hippocampus39, the effect of HCN cTBS on EEG measures of successful&#xD;
      memory has not been studied. Establishing these mechanisms will improve the basic&#xD;
      understanding of how the brain successfully meets a memory demand and inform translational&#xD;
      studies for the treatment of memory impairment. One goal of this project is to examine the&#xD;
      effects of on-line TMS on the electrophysiological signatures of successful memory&#xD;
      performance to provide more information on the mechanism by which TMS improves episodic&#xD;
      memory to develop new and specific biomarkers of target engagement for future clinical&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of brain stimulation have been shown previously to vary depending on neural&#xD;
      state, such as the phase of oscillations relevant to the stimulated network and network&#xD;
      activation by simultaneous task performance. However, the influence of brain state on HCN&#xD;
      facilitation with TMS has not been investigated, despite its likely importance. A second goal&#xD;
      of this project is to examine this question of task state-dependent modulation for the HCN&#xD;
      and episodic memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using simultaneous EEG, TMS, and memory testing, we will investigate the EEG activity related&#xD;
      to successful memory performance and examine how TMS modulates that activity. In healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, we will deliver brief, facilitatory TMS before and during the encoding trials of&#xD;
      a memory task to either the HCN, via an inferior parietal cortex site with maximal&#xD;
      hippocampal connectivity, or to the vertex as a control. We will additionally deliver&#xD;
      stimulation during a control task with similar attentional demands and processing load, and&#xD;
      there will be a no-stimulation condition for both tasks. We will record task performance and&#xD;
      time-locked EEG activity, focusing on episodic memory performance and the late positive&#xD;
      posterior ERP, theta/alpha power, and EEG functional connectivity measured during encoding&#xD;
      and retrieval as our outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention of interest will be TMS delivered to the region of the left posterior parietal cortex with the greatest connectivity with the left hippocampus derived from the baseline resting-state fMRI session. This region was chosen because of its dense connections with the hippocampus, allowing stimulation of this location to modulate function of the hippocampal-cortical network. The control intervention target will be vertex, a commonly used active control site which does not influence neural or behavioral activity.</description>
