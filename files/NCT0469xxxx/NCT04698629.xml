  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is evaluate the acceptability/usage of a newly implemented model of&#xD;
      delivery of care, namely a community-pharmacy program, to provide access to medications to&#xD;
      treat hepatitis C (HCV), and prevent overdose and HIV, for persons who inject drugs (PWID)&#xD;
      with HCV who are in need of treatment. Adults will be enrolled who test positive for HCV at&#xD;
      community sites and who agree to linkage to the community-pharmacy program through the use of&#xD;
      patient navigators. The primary outcome of the study will be the measure of the number/% of&#xD;
      participants who are successfully linked to the community-pharmacy program and assess HCV&#xD;
      treatment initiation, completion, and cure. In addition, other outcomes including receipt of&#xD;
      other medications (e.g. Naloxone, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and medications for opioid&#xD;
      use disorders), and self-reported substance use and HIV risk behaviors will also be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm, prospective observational study of 40 adult persons who inject drugs (PWID) who&#xD;
      screen positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) with a reactive antibody test at community sites&#xD;
      who are offered facilitated linkage to community-pharmacy program through patient navigators.&#xD;
      Individuals who are eligible and enroll will complete a baseline survey to assess&#xD;
      sociodemographics, substance use, HIV risk behaviors, and awareness of and interest in HCV&#xD;
      treatment. After the survey, the participants will be linked to the community-pharmacy&#xD;
      program, via the patient navigator, where treatment for HCV and opioid use disorder (OUD), as&#xD;
      well as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), Naloxone and vaccinations, will be offered to&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months, participants will complete a follow-up survey, which will include questions&#xD;
      on: whether an evaluation for HCV occurred at the community pharmacy, whether HCV treatment&#xD;
      was initiated since baseline visit, substance use, HIV risk behaviors, receipt of medications&#xD;
      to treat HCV, opioid use disorder, Naloxone and PrEP receipt, medication adherence, and&#xD;
      injecting network.&#xD;
