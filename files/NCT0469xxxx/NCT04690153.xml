  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal deaths due to uterine atony bleeding are the leading causes of maternal death in our&#xD;
      country and all over the world. In this respect, our clinic is among the clinics with the&#xD;
      highest number of experience in our country and aims to reduce maternal deaths and mothers&#xD;
      who will need intensive care due to bleeding with a hemorrhage stopping technique that will&#xD;
      have a serious contribution to both our country and the world literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary goal, thanks to the bleeding-stopping technique, to reduce their deaths. Our&#xD;
      secondary aim is, thanks to the bleeding-stopping technique we offer, To prevent and reduce&#xD;
      the complications seen in mothers during the operative period.&#xD;

      Our research was carried out to our obstetrics clinic between 01 Agustus 2015 - 01 December&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients transplanted due to postpartum bleeding and patients requiring surgery due to&#xD;
      abnormal postpartum bleeding in our clinic will be included. Patients with a previously known&#xD;
      bleeding disorder will not be included in the study. In our study, the parameters of the&#xD;
      patients who had bleeding due to postpartum uterine atony and who needed uterine surgery&#xD;
      previously underwent triple Hayman compression suture to stop bleeding will be included in&#xD;
      the study. Patients with a triple Hayman suture covering the upper 2/3 of the uterus to stop&#xD;
      uterine bleeding will be evaluated in the study.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who are referred to our clinic due to postpartum hemorrhage between the ages of 18-45 and who need to undergo a surgical procedure (not responding to medical treatment) due to abnormal uterine bleeding in our clinic will be included. Patients with a previously known diagnosis of bleeding and coagulation disorders will not be included in the study. Considering that we are one of the primary referral centers in Istanbul in terms of deliveries and post-partum bleeding in our hospital, it is aimed to terminate the study with approximately 50 participants.</description>
