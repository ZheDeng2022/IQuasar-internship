  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a translational, prospective, open-label, monocentric research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a population of 60 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (DLBCL) for whom first-line treatment with R-CHOP is planned as part of their standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIMILY program aims at identifying biomarkers and/or molecular signatures related to&#xD;
      immuno-phenotypic and -genotypic characteristics of the tumor and immune microenvironment, at&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis, during R-CHOP, and at 24 months or time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be followed during 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples will be collected :&#xD;
at baseline (before the 1st R-CHOP cycle)&#xD;
before the 3d administration of chemotherapy (CT) (i.e. after 2 cycles of CT and same timepoint as interim FDG-PET/CT)&#xD;
at the end of induction (i.e. end of R-CHOP treatment)&#xD;
at 24 months after initiation of R-CHOP treatment&#xD;
at the time of progression (if progression occurs before 24 months of treatment).&#xD;
Tumor samples will be collected at baseline (from an archived initial diagnostic tumor specimen) and at the time of progression (if applicable from lymph node biopsy performed as part of a standard of care surgical procedure).&#xD;
Bone marrow samples will be collected at baseline and at the time of progression (if applicable) only in patients for whom a bone marrow aspiration (BMA) is necessary as part of their standard of care, upon physician's decision.</description>
