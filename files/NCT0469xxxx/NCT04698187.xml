  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMP-001-010 is a Phase 2 study of CMP-001 intratumoral (IT) and nivolumab intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      administered to participants with refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine confirmed objective response with CMP-001&#xD;
      in combination with nivolumab in subjects with refractory unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMP-001 administered by intratumoral (IT)&#xD;
           injection in combination with nivolumab in subjects with refractory unresectable or&#xD;
           metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in subjects with&#xD;
           refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
           subjects with refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and describe the immunogenicity of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
           subjects with refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

             treatment with a local Health Authority approved BRAF inhibitor, with or without&#xD;
             mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor. Patients with BRAF V600 mutations who&#xD;
             refuse a BRAF inhibitor will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Refractory to PD-1 blockade either as monotherapy or in combination with other&#xD;
             therapies, as defined by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Received treatment with a Food and Drug Administration approved PD-1 blocking&#xD;
                  antibody for 12 weeks or longer.&#xD;

                  blocking antibody, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Evidence of confirmed PD must be established by investigator assessment at least 4&#xD;
             weeks after the initial date of PD. The second assessment may serve as the Baseline&#xD;
             for this study if completed within 30 days before to the start of study treatment.&#xD;
             NOTE: in subjects with histologically confirmed recurrence on or after adjuvant PD-1&#xD;
             blocking antibody, confirmatory imaging is not required.&#xD;

          4. Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1 and all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. At least 1 accessible lesion amenable to repeated IT injection. b. One or more&#xD;
             measurable lesions at least 1 cm in diameter that are not intended for CMP 001&#xD;
