  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a stroke, individuals present with motor and/or cognitive impairments. These&#xD;
      impairments limit activity, restrict participation and affect quality of life. Therefore,&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs are provided from the earliest days. However, an important proportion&#xD;
      of patients do not achieve the recommended amount of rehabilitation therapy (even in&#xD;
      institutional systems). In fact, patients do not always have access to healthcare systems.&#xD;
      Moreover, hospital resources and healthcare systems are often limited (especially in poor&#xD;
      countries) which has led to the development of new cost-effective rehabilitation methods such&#xD;
      as self-rehabilitation and tele-rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop and validate relevant self-assessments tools in virtual reality&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to propose auto-adaptative virtual reality-based therapies based on the link between&#xD;
           motor and cognitive functions.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Box and Block Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, on average 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of manual dexterity and activity that requires repeatedly moving 1-inch blocks from one side of a box to another in 60 seconds.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Bells Test</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Research Arm Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, on average 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 19 item observational measure used by physical therapists and other health care professionals to assess upper extremity performance (coordination, dexterity and functioning). Items are categorized into four subscales (grasp, grip, pinch and gross movement) and arranged in order of decreasing difficulty, with the most difficult task examined first, followed by the least difficult task. Task performance is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (no movement) to 3 (movement performed normally).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, on average 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reliable tool for measuring the usability. It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper limb 3D position</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, on average 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Upper limb 3D position will be measured with different virtual reality devices (Oculus Quest, htc Vive, REAtouch). This will be done thanks to the headset's infra-red camera or the controller's inertial measurement units.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper limb peak velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, on average 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Upper limb peak velocity will be measured with different virtual reality devices (Oculus Quest, htc Vive, REAtouch). This will be done by deriving 3D position (obtained previously thanks to the headset's infra-red camera or the controller's inertial measurement units) and extracting highest value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper limb smoothness</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, on average 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Upper limb smoothness will be measured with different virtual reality devices (Oculus Quest, htc Vive, REAtouch). This will be done by deriving three times 3D position (obtained previously thanks to the headset's infra-red camera or the controller's inertial measurement units) and converting it to a logarithmic dimensionless jerk. Second option is to measure a spectral arc length (also computed from 3D position)</description>
