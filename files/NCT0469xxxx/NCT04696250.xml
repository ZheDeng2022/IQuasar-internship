  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticancer drugs can lead to various adverse events. This study analyses reports of adverse&#xD;
      events for treatment including Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification L&#xD;
      (antineoplastic agents, endocrine therapy, immunostimulants, and immunosuppressants drugs) in&#xD;
      the World Health Organization's (WHO) global database of individual safety case reports&#xD;
      (VigiBase).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators use VigiBase, the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual&#xD;
      safety case reports, to identify cases of adverse events following treatment with&#xD;
      antineoplastic agents, endocrine therapy, immunostimulants or immunosuppressants drugs.&#xD;
