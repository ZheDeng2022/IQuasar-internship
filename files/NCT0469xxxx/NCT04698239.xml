  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne treatment by laser or other light devices is a currently accepted procedure. It allows&#xD;
      faster resolution of injuries, with fewer side effects and greater patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of the Milesman Blauman laser is based on diode laser technology that&#xD;
      produces pulses of blue light with a wavelength of 445 nanometers, in the blue and visible&#xD;
      spectrum. It combines the precision of laser technology by focusing energy on diseased areas.&#xD;

      Introduction / Justification Acne vulgaris (AV) is a polygenic multifactorial disease of the&#xD;
      pilosebaceous units, which leads to the formation of both non-inflammatory lesions&#xD;
      (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules and cysts), which affects&#xD;
      approximately 85% of the population .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acne treatment by laser or other light devices is a currently accepted procedure. It allows&#xD;
      faster resolution of injuries, with fewer side effects and greater patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of the Milesman Blauman laser is based on diode laser technology that&#xD;
      produces pulses of blue light with a wavelength of 445 nanometers, in the blue and visible&#xD;
      spectrum. It combines the precision of laser technology by focusing energy on diseased areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MILESMAN Laser has been on the market for over two years and has been used for cosmetic&#xD;
      purposes and has proven to be safe during that time on the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN GOAL The main objective of this study is to describe the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      device (Milesman Laser) as a treatment for inflammatory acne lesions (papules and pustules).&#xD;
      To do this, we will measure the evolution of the number of injuries of this type on the&#xD;
      patient, before and after the application of the laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will have the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory assessment of the change in acne classification on the EGAE scale (grade 1 -&#xD;
           4) after laser application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the adverse effects derived after the laser application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the degree of patient satisfaction after the laser application. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
           Open, prospective, interventional, single-arm, quasi-experimental analytical study of&#xD;
           before and after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of design is based on the measurement and comparison of the response variable&#xD;
      before and after the subject's exposure to the experimental intervention. It is a national,&#xD;
      single-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE According to the objective of the study, we plan to get at least 25 patients. In&#xD;
      this study we define sample as the entire area to be treated on the face, that is, we will&#xD;
      obtain 25 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PERIOD The duration of the study will be 3 months from the inclusion of the first&#xD;
      patient. The duration of the patient in the study is 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION The Milesman laser has a handpiece, which allows each injury&#xD;
      to be targeted via an indicator light and the person handling it will trigger the shot via a&#xD;
      foot pedal. A maximum of 10 shots will be made on each acne injury, depending on the size and&#xD;
      type of injury. Finally, 2-3 shots will be taken to photocoagulate the follicle walls and&#xD;
      thus prevent the lesion from recurring or becoming infected again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laser will be applied to all inflammatory facial injuries in a single session, it is&#xD;
      estimated that the duration of the session is about 20 minutes, depending on the number of&#xD;
      injuries&#xD;
