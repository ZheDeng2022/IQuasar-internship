      Objectives to evaluate the oral health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction in&#xD;
      completely edentulous patients, when restored by maxillary and mandibular fixed&#xD;
      (screw-retained) or removable telescopic retained implant supported prosthesis. 19 patients&#xD;
      were randomized to receive either a fixed or a removable maxillary and mandibular full arch&#xD;
      implant prosthesis. They were then asked to answer the OHIP-14 and a patient satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire at 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months post-prosthetic insertion.&#xD;

      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      General operative procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the eligibility criteria were fulfilled in a patient, new complete maxillary and&#xD;
      mandibular dentures were fabricated for this patient to allow for prosthetically driven&#xD;
      implant placement. 4 implants were placed interforaminally so that they were parallel to each&#xD;
      other. If the patient had an existing satisfactory denture, that was delivered at least six&#xD;
      months ago, it was evaluated for retention, fit, support, stability, occlusion and esthetics.&#xD;
      New and old dentures were later used for constructing the scan appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly assigned into two groups with an allocation ratio 1:1. Simple&#xD;
      randomization was done by preparing sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, that&#xD;
      contained two-times folded cards with the treatment group written inside. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      patients were assigned either to group T (control treatment/ telescopic retained implant&#xD;
      supported removable overdentures) or group S (test treatment/ screw retained implant&#xD;
      supported fixed prosthesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm : Engaging (Internal hex) cylindrical, plastic patterns (Octa plastic&#xD;
      cylinder, multi unit abutment, Red, Dentis, Daegu -Korea) were used to construct the primary&#xD;
      copings of the telescopic prosthesis.The finished primary copings were scanned using a lab&#xD;
      scanner (Shera Echo-scan 7. Dental Wings, Montreal-Canada). This was necessary to design and&#xD;
      to mill the wax pattern of the secondary copings using CAD/CAM technology (Dental Wings&#xD;
      Software, Dental Wings, Montreal -Canada). Secondary coping was designed to properly fit to&#xD;
      the primary coping. The framework was then tried in. At that time it was ready for its&#xD;
      intra-oral luting to the secondary copings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the control treatment: Once adequate fit of the framework of the hybrid prosthesis was&#xD;
      achieved, the wax of the trial denture was converted into heat-cured acrylic resin using&#xD;
      conventional packing and flasking techniques. The prosthesis was finished, polished and&#xD;
      screwed in the patient's mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of blinding of the operator, the participants and the assessor (patient) due to the&#xD;
      obvious dissimilarity between the treatment arms, could have created performance and&#xD;
      assessment bias. In an attempt to decrease the performance bias, randomization was delayed&#xD;
      until the abutments were connected. When the prosthesis was delivered to the patient, they&#xD;
      were requested to answer OHIP-14 and patient satisfaction questionnaires 2 weeks after&#xD;
      prosthetic insertion, then 3, 6 and 12 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this RCT was to evaluate patient satisfaction and oral-health related quality of&#xD;
      life in completely edentulous patients receiving removable implant overdentures versus fixed&#xD;
      implant hybrid restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were statistically described in terms of mean +/- standard deviation (+/- SD), median&#xD;
      and range. Comparison of ordinal variables between the study groups was done using Mann&#xD;
      Whitney U test for independent samples. Within group comparison of the ordinal data was done&#xD;
      using Friedmann test to detect significant differences between time in periods. This was&#xD;
      followed by Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired comparisons. Two sided p values less than&#xD;
      0.05 was considered statistically significant. Additionally, a correlation between relevant&#xD;
      domains of the OHIP-14 and the patient satisfaction questionnaires was done using Spearman&#xD;
      rank correlation test. All statistical calculations were done using computer program IBM SPSS&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for the Social Science; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) release 22 for&#xD;
      Microsoft Windows&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Completely edentulous male patients with an age range from 40- 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a HbA1c equal to or less than 7&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients should have normal maxillo-mandibular relationship (Angle class I).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients should have maxillary and mandibular ridges at least 7mm in width and 13 mm&#xD;
             in height in the interforaminal areas and in the esthetic zones (premolar to premolar&#xD;
             regions), respectively. This accommodated a pre-planned implant size of 3.7mm x 10 or&#xD;
             11mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The maxillary and mandibular ridges should be covered by keratinized attached mucosa&#xD;
             at least 5mm in width.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. An interarch space between the edentulous maxillary and mandibular ridges should not&#xD;
             be less than 22 mm to accommodate the planned maxillary and mandibular&#xD;
             implant-supported prostheses. This was confirmed by mounted diagnostic casts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who were cooperative and who were psychologically and mentally stable as&#xD;
             revealed from the initial interview with the patients were considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females were excluded on purpose to prevent failures associated with osteoporosis and&#xD;
             to avoid gender variability which definitely affects the results of patient&#xD;
             satisfaction and OHIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients requiring hard or, soft tissue grafting of the proposed implant sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Heavy smokers (more than 10 cigarettes / day) or patients with para-functional&#xD;
             habits like clenching or bruxism were excluded. This was important to decrease the&#xD;
             risk of implant failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Patients with temporo-mandibular joint disorders were considered ineligible because&#xD;
             of the expected occlusal disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patients with systemic disease that might contra-indicate implants placement or&#xD;
             affect osseointegration e.g. uncontrolled diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Patients who took chemo-or radiotherapy or any drug that might counter-affect the&#xD;
             healing process or the quality of bone.&#xD;
