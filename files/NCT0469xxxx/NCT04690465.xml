  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: There is on one hand sufficient evidence showing strong association between&#xD;
      resilience and self-rated successful aging. On the other hand, strength training could&#xD;
      contribute the cultivation of resilience among older adults. Therefore, the current study&#xD;
      aims to examine the effectiveness of resistance training on resilience among Chinese older&#xD;
      adults in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will apply a three-group, double blinded (outcome assessors and data&#xD;
      analysts), randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      interventions on resilience, functional fitness, and health related quality of life&#xD;
      immediately after a 16-week intervention, as well as the residual effects 12 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: It is expected that resistance training is promising or even superior to aerobic&#xD;
      training in the improvement of resilience. Given the limited evidence on the literature, it&#xD;
      is urgently needed to explore the effects of resistance training on the improvement of&#xD;
      resilience in older adults. Findings of the current study can contribute to the development&#xD;
      of effective resistant training programs for the promotion of resilience among older adults.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Qualified participants who have signed a consent letter will be randomly assigned into three groups by a draw of lots, in a ratio of 1:1:1. The three groups will be 1) Intervention group: Resistance training (n = 40); 2) Active concurrent control group: Eight-form Yang-style Tai Chi program (n = 40); and 3) Non-treatment control group (n = 40).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Resilience - The Chinese Version of Resilience Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure is conducted to examine the change from baseline resilience level at 4 months and at 7 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Chinese version of RS (CRS) will be used to measure participants' resilience in the study. The CRS was modified from the Resilience Scale developed by Wagnild and Young with subsequent validation in Chinese older population and confirmed its four-factor structure: equanimity, meaningfulness, ceaseless self-improvement, and self-reliance. It is a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (highly disagree) to 7 (highly agree), with a greater score mirroring higher level of resilience. Three levels are set, with scores of 145 and above indicating moderate to high resilience, scores from 126 to 144 indicating low to moderate levels of resilience, and scores less than 126 indicating low resilience.</description>

    <time_frame>The measure is conducted to examine the change from baseline body composition at 4 months and at 7 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The functional fitness (FF) of participants will be measured using the Senior Fitness Test (SFT) battery. The SFT is a widely used measurement for functional fitness of older adults in the ageing and physical activity area. Within the SFT, the body mass index (BMI) will be used to examine the body composition of the participants.</description>
