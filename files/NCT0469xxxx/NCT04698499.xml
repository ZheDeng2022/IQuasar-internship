    <textblock>
      Dysphagia affects 22% of those over the age of 50, which equates to 250 million people&#xD;
      worldwide and 360,000 in Alberta. At high risk are survivors of head and neck cancer (70%).&#xD;
      Difficulties with swallowing are not only life threatening and resource-intense, but also&#xD;
      socially limiting. To regain swallowing function and avoid or reduce the consequences of&#xD;
      dysphagia, patients require regular, intensive therapy over many months to strengthen&#xD;
      swallowing muscles and improve swallow coordination. This therapy is often coupled with&#xD;
      visual biofeedback that uses surface electromyography (sEMG). Despite evidence that&#xD;
      swallowing exercises are effective when provided with an intensive regimen and when coupled&#xD;
      with sEMG biofeedback, patients rarely receive it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this work is to determine whether the use of a mobile system equipped with&#xD;
      sEMG biofeedback affects adherence to home-based swallowing exercises. The secondary aim of&#xD;
      this work is to determine if the exercise program results in improved patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes related to dysphagia and nutrition. Our tertiary aim is to determine if previous&#xD;
      findings of adherence can be replicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty adults with oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to OPSCC treatment will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. This study will follow a cross over randomized design such that all participants&#xD;
      will be provided with both types of treatment: using pen and paper (Treatment Arm A) and&#xD;
      using the mobile health system (Treatment Arm B).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Dysphagia affects 22% of those over the age of 50 [1], which equates to 250&#xD;
      million people worldwide and 360,000 in Alberta [2]. At high risk are survivors of head and&#xD;
      neck cancer (70%), stroke patients (78%), people with Parkinson's disease (82%) and those&#xD;
      who've had a traumatic brain injury (65%) [3]. Left untreated, dysphagia has serious health&#xD;
      consequences, such as malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and even death. The associated&#xD;
      longer hospital stays and complications result in an estimated annual burden of care of $547&#xD;
      billion in USA [4]. In Alberta, managing just one consequence of dysphagia (aspiration&#xD;
      pneumonia) in patients with head and neck cancer and stroke costs the healthcare system $2.53&#xD;
      million CAD a year [5]. Difficulties with swallowing are not only life threatening and&#xD;
      resource-intense, but also socially limiting. Patients with dysphagia avoid social situations&#xD;
      that involve eating, are disproportionately affected by depression, and miss more than 3&#xD;
      times the number of workdays than individuals without swallowing difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To regain swallowing function and avoid or reduce the aforementioned consequences of&#xD;
      dysphagia, patients require regular, intensive therapy over many months to strengthen&#xD;
      swallowing muscles and improve swallow coordination. This therapy is often coupled with&#xD;
      visual biofeedback that uses surface electromyography (sEMG). sEMG biofeedback lets patients&#xD;
      know how hard their muscles are contracting and for how long during a given exercise. sEMG&#xD;
      biofeedback is used to teach patients how to perform exercises correctly, elicit maximum&#xD;
      effort, and demonstrate incremental improvements in performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite evidence that swallowing exercises are effective when provided with an intensive&#xD;
      regimen and when coupled with sEMG biofeedback, patients rarely receive it. This limited&#xD;
      access stems from poor patient and clinician resources. For patients, getting to the clinic&#xD;
      to access a clinician and the equipment is inconvenient and costly. In order to cope with&#xD;
      limited patient engagement, clinicians are more likely to manage dysphagia by providing diet&#xD;
      modifications, by prescribing feeding tubes, and by giving patients maneuvers and exercises&#xD;
      on a printed sheet of paper. These approaches to the management of dysphagia are inadequate&#xD;
      to meet the needs of patients. Furthermore, a recent systematic review found that average&#xD;
      adherence to dysphagia management recommendations was between 22% and 52% [6]. With the&#xD;
      advent of strict distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, remote care via&#xD;
      telerehabilitation or mobile health (mHealth) technologies has received increased attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS: The primary aim of this work is to determine whether the use of a mobile system&#xD;
      equipped with sEMG biofeedback affects adherence to home-based swallowing exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of this work is to determine if the exercise program results in improved&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes related to dysphagia and nutrition. Our tertiary aim is to&#xD;
      determine if previous findings of adherence can be replicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile swallowing system selected for study The Mobili-T is a mobile swallowing exercise&#xD;
      system for patients with swallowing difficulties. This mHealth system can be used by patients&#xD;
      for home-based swallowing exercises. It is comprised of a mobile device, a smartphone patient&#xD;
      app, and a clinician portal. The patient wears the mobile device during exercise. The mobile&#xD;
      device uses clinical grade surface electromyography (sEMG) and sticks under the chin with a&#xD;
      medical-grade double-sided adhesive. The sEMG hardware comes with a charging dock that&#xD;
      doubles as a carrying case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sEMG signal is wirelessly transmitted to the smartphone app. Here, the sEMG is shown to&#xD;
      the patient as visual biofeedback, where the deflection of the biofeedback signal reflects&#xD;
      the strength and duration of muscle contraction. The muscles monitored are found under the&#xD;
      chin (submental area) and are those targeted during typical swallowing rehabilitation. The&#xD;
      app uses a smart software that walks patients through a set of clinically proven swallowing&#xD;
      exercises [7,8], uses a back-end algorithm to detect whether or not the sEMG signal collected&#xD;
      was elicited by a swallow (as opposed to other extraneous movements such as head movements),&#xD;
      and calculates effort targets based on the patient's abilities. Clinicians can remotely&#xD;
      monitor patient progress, adherence, and adjust prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the unique aspects of Mobili-T is that the investigators have involved patients and&#xD;
      clinicians in the design from the inception of the project. The investigators also have&#xD;
      conducted usability and feasibility research testing [9-13]. Our feasibility study was a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental pretest-posttest trial with 20 patients with dysphagia secondary to head&#xD;
      and neck cancer (submitted for publication). The investigators evaluated whether or not&#xD;
      patients could successfully complete swallowing therapy using the Mobili-T at home under the&#xD;
      remote clinical supervision of our speech language pathologist. The investigators found that&#xD;
      adherence rates to home-based swallowing exercise remained at or above 72% over a six week&#xD;
      treatment period and that dysphagia-specific quality-of-life improved following this six week&#xD;
      treatment program. However, the study had limitations that precluded us from understanding&#xD;
      whether the observations noted were a result of the use of the technology or a result of&#xD;
      participant attitude and motivation in being part of a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim with the present study is to determine if our previous findings can be replicated,&#xD;
      and also to identify if these findings are unique to the use of an mHealth technology. We are&#xD;
      also interested in whether patient-reported nutrition and health change throughout the&#xD;
      treatment block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these objectives, we will have two conditions within the study: 1) home-based&#xD;
      dysphagia exercise using the current gold standard of printed instructions and a diary to&#xD;
      track adherence, and 2) home-based dysphagia exercises using an mHealth system to provide&#xD;
      biofeedback and track exercise completion. To ensure that all patient participants have&#xD;
      equitable access to both conditions, a cross over randomized design will be used such that&#xD;
      all participants will be provided with both types of treatment-delivery methods. This study&#xD;
      design was previously used by Mertens et al. (2016) to determine if a mobile application&#xD;
      improves therapy adherence rates in elderly patients undergoing rehabilitation [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of our study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 (i.e., primary objective). Determine if adherence to home-based swallowing&#xD;
      exercises is different when a mobile system equipped with sEMG biofeedback is used versus pen&#xD;
      and paper (diary format).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. There is no difference in average weekly adherence between the experimental&#xD;
      group (mHealth system) and the control group (pen and paper).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. There is no difference in average daily exercise dose (total # of exercise&#xD;
      trials completed in the treatment block/ number of days in the treatment block) between the&#xD;
      experimental group (mHealth system) and the control group (pen and paper).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2. Determine if the exercise program results in improved patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      related to dysphagia, nutrition, and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3. There is no difference in patient-reported outcomes on the MD Anderson&#xD;
      Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI), caloric intake, and health between the experimental group&#xD;
      (mHealth system) and the control group (pen and paper).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Determine if previous findings related to adherence and patient-reported&#xD;
      swallowing outcomes can be replicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4. Average weekly adherence rates to home-based swallowing exercise will remain at&#xD;
      or above 72% over a six week treatment period. Twenty-five percent of participants will&#xD;
      experience a minimally important differences in their pre- and post-therapy&#xD;
      dysphagia-specific quality-of-life scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General study details for ITA A total of 60 patient participants will be recruited, 30 per&#xD;
      study arm. The study will last 3 months and one week (or 13 weeks). However, the study will&#xD;
      remain open until all participants have been recruited and have completed the trial (expected&#xD;
      to take 1 year). Sample size calculation is detailed below, in section 1.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants 1.1 Recruitment. Participants will be recruited through speech-language&#xD;
      pathologists (SLPs) at the University of Alberta Hospital, Cross Cancer Institute, Institute&#xD;
      for Reconstructive Sciences in Medicine, Home Nutrition Support Program, Foothills Medical&#xD;
      Center, Tom Baker Cancer Center and Central Alberta Cancer Center. Participants will be&#xD;
      identified by their SLPs. Participants also will be recruited from a pool of individuals who&#xD;
      have contacted the research team during the feasibility trial or following media events,&#xD;
      wishing to be notified about upcoming trials. Participants will be consecutively recruited&#xD;
      until the sample size is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment An email alert (found in Documents) will be sent to physicians and&#xD;
      speech-language pathologist (SLPs) in the province known to work with head and neck cancer&#xD;
      patients. They will be told which patients are eligible for this study and will be provided&#xD;
      information about the study. SLPs will also be provided with the study poster and study flyer&#xD;
      so that they can share these with interested patients. Hence, participants will be identified&#xD;
      by their physicians or speech-language pathologist (SLP) and recommended for swallowing&#xD;
      therapy to the research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are referred to the study by their SLP and are interested in participating will&#xD;
      be asked by their referring clinician to complete the Consent to Recruit/ Be Contacted form&#xD;
      (found in Documents). This form will be passed on to the Research Clinician by the referring&#xD;
      clinician. Consent To Be Contacted by Researcher Form has an expiry date listed on the form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants also will be recruited from a pool of individuals who have contacted the&#xD;
      research team during the feasibility trial, through word of mouth, or following media events,&#xD;
      wishing to be notified about upcoming trials. They will be alerted of the study via an email&#xD;
      (found in Documents) and the study recruitment poster. The study flyer will be shared only&#xD;
      with anyone who is interested. If these patients express an interest in participating, they&#xD;
      will still require a referral from their own attending SLPs (i.e., community clinicians).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in the study if they have a diagnosis of oropharyngeal&#xD;
      dysphagia secondary to HNC treatment. The patient's present or past SLP will be used as a&#xD;
      source of referral and validation that the patient is a good candidate for home based&#xD;
      swallowing exercise using the effortful and/or the Mendelsohn swallows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients unknown to the investigators first, they will NOT be contacted directly until&#xD;
      patients have provided consent to do so. Patients will be approached by their attending&#xD;
      clinicians (physicians or SLPs). Clinicians will let patients know that a study is currently&#xD;
      underway. They will share the title of the study, study poster, and study flyer with the&#xD;
      patient and ask them if it is okay for a Research Clinician (Dr. Gabriela Constantinescu) to&#xD;
      contact them with more information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Clinician will contact the patient and ask them if they are still interested in&#xD;
      participating. If yes, she will share the letter of information and consent form&#xD;
      electronically (either emailed to the patient or to their SLP). A second call will be&#xD;
      scheduled and the Research Clinician will then go over the letter of information with the&#xD;
      patient in detail. If the patient is still interested in the study, 3 appointments in&#xD;
      Edmonton will be booked. Consent will be obtained in person, at the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient affirms on the phone however, that they are no longer interested in the study,&#xD;
      the patient's contact information will be shredded. Occasionally, patients may request to be&#xD;
      contacted at a later date due to personal reasons. In this scenario, contact information will&#xD;
      be kept in a secure location until the sample size for the study is reached. At that time, if&#xD;
      the patient has not been contacted/ booked, their contact information will be shredded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of the study coordinators /investigators/ research clinician are directly involved in&#xD;
      the patients' care. Patients may simply tell their attending clinicians that they are not&#xD;
      interested in hearing further details about the study and the Research Clinician will not be&#xD;
      aware of this information. Patients will be reminded by the Research Clinician that&#xD;
      participation is voluntary and that care will not be affected in any way by their decision.&#xD;
      Any callback list is not publicly displayed. It will be kept in the study binder (in a locked&#xD;
      room at the University of Alberta) until shredded as detailed above. The Research Clinician,&#xD;
      Dr. Gabriela Constantinescu, will look after contact information of patients expressing&#xD;
      interest, until shredded as detailed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria. Participants will be enrolled in the study if they have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to treatment for squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (OPSCC). SCCs make up 90% of all HNCs. Participants will be consecutively recruited, until&#xD;
      the sample size is achieved. Participants will be recruited any time 3 months or later&#xD;
      post-surgery or post-(chemo)radiation therapy. This time frame was selected to avoid&#xD;
      duplication of services for patients who may receive swallowing therapy during their&#xD;
      radiation therapy and to target patients with chronic and stable dysphagia. Participants will&#xD;
      be included: 1) if they have received treatment for head and neck cancer (e.g., +/-surgery,&#xD;
      +/-radiation therapy, +/- chemotherapy), 2) if their attending speech-language pathologist&#xD;
      has confirmed from a Modified Barium Swallow (MBS) assessment or Fiberoptic Endoscopic&#xD;
      Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) that the patient is a candidate for the effortful swallow&#xD;
      and/or the Mendelsohn maneuver therapy. These exercises are used routinely in clinical&#xD;
      practice and target specific physiological impairments of the swallow that are common to&#xD;
      OPSCC patients. Participants will be excluded: 1) if they have a history of cognitive delay,&#xD;
      2) a history of stroke or traumatic brain injury, and 3) if they cannot reliably navigate the&#xD;
      Mobili-T system after the training session, and 4) if their SLP confirms planned swallowing&#xD;
      exercises or procedures to address dysphagia like esophageal dilation. Participants also will&#xD;
      be excluded if they have a beard that they are not willing to shave or partially shave (as&#xD;
      the device adheres under the chin, on the surface of the skin). Finally, participants will be&#xD;
      excluded if they are unable to travel to Edmonton 3 times during a 3 month period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in keeping with contraindications listed on the Mobili-T labeling, patient&#xD;
      participants will be excluded if they: have an implanted electronic device of any kind,&#xD;
      including cardiac pacemakers or similar assistive devices, electronic infusion pumps, and&#xD;
      implanted stimulators; if they have irritated skin or skin with open wounds under the chin;&#xD;
      if they have an allergy to silver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Sample Size. No previous literature exists on a clinically significant difference in&#xD;
      adherence or dose to guide sample size calculation. The researchers used a previous study&#xD;
      [15] to guide our sample size selection. In the cited study, a total of 79 OPSCC patients&#xD;
      were randomized to 3 treatment arms (26 or 27 patients participants per arm), where one of&#xD;
      the treatment arms included swallowing therapy using an app. As the present study has 2&#xD;
      treatment arms, we will recruit 52 to 60 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we have consulted an epidemiologist regarding sample size calculation. The&#xD;
      following calculator was used:&#xD;
      http://hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/sample_size/js/js_crossover_quant.html along with the following&#xD;
      parameters: 0.05 significance level, two-sided, within patient standard deviation of 35.5&#xD;
      [6], power of 0.9, and a minimal detectable difference in means of 22. This sample size&#xD;
      calculation is based on the primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 General Procedure: Sixty adults with oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to OPSCC treatment&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. This study will follow a crossover randomized design (AB/BA)&#xD;
      such that all participants will be provided with both types of treatment: using the mobile&#xD;
      health system and using pen and paper. Randomized allocation will be determined using Sealed&#xD;
      Envelope, a Randomization and online database for clinical trials&#xD;
      (https://www.sealedenvelope.com/)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient expresses interest in the study/ is referred to the study by their clinician&#xD;
      (e.g., SLP), the Research Clinician, Dr. Gabi Constantinescu, will contact the participants&#xD;
      with more information and screening questions (e.g., do you have a beard?). An electronic or&#xD;
      hard copy version of the Letter of Information and Consent form will be shared with the&#xD;
      patient. The information and questions are meant to ensure that patients interested in the&#xD;
      study fit most exclusion/ inclusion criteria before traveling to Edmonton. If patient&#xD;
      participants self-refer to the study via word of mouth (and were not referred by their&#xD;
      attending SLPs), consent to contact the patient's attending SLP will be obtained before&#xD;
      participants are invited to Edmonton for their first appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's attending SLP will be contacted to ensure that services are not duplicated&#xD;
      elsewhere, that the patient is not booked for other procedures that may impact outcomes in&#xD;
      this trial (e.g., esophageal dilation), that a swallow assessment was recently completed and&#xD;
      that the SLP believes the patient will be a good candidate for the swallowing therapy offered&#xD;
      through this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pre-, washout, and post-treatment sessions will take place in Edmonton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Pre-treatment session. The Letter of Information and Consent will be reviewed again. The&#xD;
      MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) and the Health Questionnaire (EuroQoL EQ-5D) (both&#xD;
      described in section 3.0 Outcome Measures) will be administered. Next, Dr. Constantinescu&#xD;
      will: (1) determine the order of treatment blocks for the participant (i.e., Group1 - AB, or&#xD;
      Group 2 - BA); (2) introduce the Mobili-T system (if applicable); (3) introduce the&#xD;
      swallowing exercises and allow time for practice; (4) explain the treatment block format and&#xD;
      associated documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The swallowing therapy exercises will be explained and practiced until patients can&#xD;
      demonstrate competency on their own. This ability is defined as the successful completion of&#xD;
      five consecutive trials of each exercise, where the success will be judged by clinical visual&#xD;
      inspection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be sent home with the Three-Day Dietary Intake Record to complete and&#xD;
      return at their next appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient participants are randomized to the Treatment Arm B with the mHealth system first,&#xD;
      then training with the system will occur in the presence of the Research Clinician and will&#xD;
      conclude once the patient appears comfortable with the device, has shown that he/ she can set&#xD;
      up the device and start the software independently, and has demonstrated competency with the&#xD;
      exercises. The Research Clinician in this study (i.e., registered SLP) will remotely monitor&#xD;
      the session data from participants who are using the mHealth system and will be available to&#xD;
      answer questions and troubleshoot technology issues. Patients will not be identified on the&#xD;
      device, app, or clinician portal. The app simply records the serial number on the device&#xD;
      hardware (e.g., 001). This is noted in the researcher's records (e.g., J Smith - 001).&#xD;
      Participants will further be identified by a participant code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Treatment blocks A and B. Patients will be asked to practice at home for 3 months&#xD;
      targeting a daily total of 8 sets of 3 exercise types with 3 repetitions of each. The daily&#xD;
      total target will be 72 trials (8 sets * 3 exercise types * 3 repetitions of each). Exercise&#xD;
      type and dose will be the same for all participants, for a daily total of 24 regular saliva&#xD;
      swallows, 24 effortful saliva swallows, and 24 Mendelsohn maneuver saliva swallows. Treatment&#xD;
      Arm A will consist of using pen and paper to complete the exercises. This is considered&#xD;
      standard care. Treatment Arm B will consist of using Mobili-T to complete the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Post-treatment session. Following the first Treatment Arm (A or B), there will be a&#xD;
      one-week washout period. During this week, as well as following the second Treatment Arm, a&#xD;
      post-treatment session will be booked and the Three-Day Dietary Intake Record provided for&#xD;
      home completion. This session will consist of administering the MDADI, the Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (EuroQoL EQ-5D), and either returning or providing the Mobili-T system.&#xD;
