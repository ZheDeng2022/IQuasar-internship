    <textblock>
      Identification of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular factors that affect the integrity and&#xD;
      functional performance in children with cerebral palsy is very essential as it enables&#xD;
      multidisciplinary rehabilitation team to design the proper intervention to improve functional&#xD;
      performance and independence for those children.&#xD;

      Limited literature is available regarding the relation between selective voluntary motor&#xD;
      control and motor functions in children with cerebral palsy. Up to our knowledge this is the&#xD;
      first study intending to investigate the influence of selective voluntary motor control on&#xD;
      upper extremity function in children with spastic cerebral palsy. Therefore, the current&#xD;
      study will be conducted to investigate the correlation between selective voluntary motor&#xD;
      control and upper extremity functions in children with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is no relation between SVMC and upper limb function in children with spastic&#xD;
           hemiparetic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is no relation between upper extremity SVMC and hand grip strength in children&#xD;
           with spastic hemiparetic CP.&#xD;

    <measure>Test of Arm Selective Control</measure>
    <time_frame>1/2/2021 to 30/4/2021</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of the assessment is to systematically evaluate a person's ability to move the upper extremity with selective voluntary motor control by observing movement control, coordination, fluency, mirroring, and speed at each joint, and then assigning a grade. Each joint is scored as a 0, 1, or 2. The joints of the affected limb are summed for a limb score for a total score. The maximum score is 16 per side, or 32 points in total (in hemiplegia assess the affected side only) with higher score indicates better performance. Admiration of the teat items and scoring will be conducted according to the scale user instructions.</description>

    <description>A convenient sample of children with spastic hemiparetic CP of both genders will participate in this study. To avoid type II error, sample size calculation was performed prior to the study, based on data of pilot study, using G*POWER statistical software (version 3.1.9.2; Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany) [Exact tests- correlational study, α=0.05, β=0.2, and effect size = 0.4] and revealed that the appropriate sample size for this study is N=46.</description>

    <description>It will be used to assess selective voluntary motor control. It is a reliable and valid evaluation tool used to quantify and describe selective voluntary motor control in children with spastic cerebral palsy. The goal of the assessment is to systematically evaluate a person's ability to move the upper extremity with selective voluntary motor control by observing movement control, coordination, fluency, mirroring, and speed at each joint, and then assigning a grade, all in 'real time. Clinically this measure may guide the selection of medical, surgical, or therapy interventions and may improve outcome prognosis after brief training. Raters demonstrated excellent reliability in assessing upper extremity SVMC in a group of children with hemiplegic, diplegic, and quadriplegic CP using the Ttest of arm selective control</description>

    <description>Hand held dynamometer (Camry Digital Hand Dynamometer Grip Strength, Model EH101-37, China) will be used to assess hand grip strength of the affected upper extremity. It is generally small, portable and relatively cheap reliable measurement instruments to measure muscle strength of the arm and hand in children with spastic cerebral pasly. It is used to measure strength; maximal voluntary isometric contraction; objectively in kilograms, pounds or newtons. Such devices have been proven to have good to excellent reliability in different populations. It represents an easily accessible way to assess muscle weakness in children with cerebral palsy and the overall reliability is considered to be good.</description>

    <description>It will be used to assess function of the affected upper extremity. It is a reliable and valid outcome measure designed to evaluate movement patterns and hand function in children with cerebral palsy. It is designed to be used with children who have neuromotor dysfunction with spasticity and has been validated with children from 18 months to 8 years of age.</description>
