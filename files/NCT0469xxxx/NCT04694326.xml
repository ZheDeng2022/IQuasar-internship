  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our purpose is to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes by checking HbA1c in&#xD;
      patients hospitalized outside internal medicine services and assess whether or not there is a&#xD;
      difference between those without diabetes awareness and those with known diabetes in terms of&#xD;
      age, sex, education status, presence of comorbidity and Body Mass Index (BMI).&#xD;

      The study included 630 patients hospitalized outside internal medicine services and internal&#xD;
      medicine side-branch services at or over the age of 18 whose anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      could be made. The sociodemographic properties and comorbidities of the patients were&#xD;
      recorded. Their anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose and HbA1c measurements&#xD;
      were made. Those with a previous diagnosis of diabetes were grouped as 'Known Diabetes',&#xD;
      those without a known diabetes diagnosis but with an HbA1c value of ≥6.5% during&#xD;
      hospitalization were grouped as 'Diabetes Unaware', and those with an HbA1C value of &lt;6.5%&#xD;
      were grouped as 'No Diabetes'. Whether or not there were differences among the 3 groups based&#xD;
      on sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements and disease statuses was&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;

        The study was conducted at two different tertiary healthcare institutions located in&#xD;
        Istanbul in Turkey. Patientswho were inpatients of units other than internal medicine&#xD;
        services and internal medicine side-branch services at or over the age of 18 whose&#xD;
        anthropometric measurements could be made were included. . The internal units included&#xD;
        neurology, dermatology, physiotherapy and rehabilitation, cardiology, infectious diseases&#xD;
        and pulmonology services, while the surgical units included general surgery, cardiovascular&#xD;
        surgery, pulmonary surgery, orthopedics and traumatology, brain surgery, ophthalmology,&#xD;
