    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to improve biological collections of patients presenting rare&#xD;
      neurological disorders with known or suspected autoimmune origin. This collection will&#xD;
      provide appropriate biological samples to identify new biomarkers and to be accessible to the&#xD;
      medical, scientific and industrial communities for the identification of new therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neuroimmunology is a rapidly expanding field since major advances have been made in basic&#xD;
      immunology and numerous new clinical entities have been identified in the last 10 years. Even&#xD;
      if these discoveries have led to major advances in patient's management and treatment, a lot&#xD;
      of work needs to be done to improve the diagnosis and prognostic biomarkers. It is widely&#xD;
      known that the immune system is implicated in a variety of neurological disorders such as&#xD;
      infections, encephalitis or multiple sclerosis. Numerous neurological disorders affecting the&#xD;
      central and peripheral nervous system can be attributed to the immune system and need to be&#xD;
      recognized as some of them can be cured by appropriate immunotherapy. These neurological&#xD;
      disorders include autoimmune encephalitis and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes but also&#xD;
      myasthenia, chronic demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy and other neuromuscular&#xD;
      pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These neurological disorders are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies in the&#xD;
      patient's sera or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). These autoantibodies are generally highly&#xD;
      specific and necessary to make the diagnosis. However, in some cases, despite strong clinical&#xD;
      arguments for a neuroimmunological disorder, we do not identify autoantibodies, leading to&#xD;
      inappropriate treatment and a blind follow-up considering the risk of recurrence or of&#xD;
      associated tumor. Furthermore, even if the specific role of some autoantibodies or of immune&#xD;
      T cells in some of these pathologies are suspected or already documented, for most of them&#xD;
      the exact mechanism is still unknown. We need to explore the sera and CSF of these patients&#xD;
      to identify new diagnosis and prognosis biomarker. Moreover, the availability of immune cells&#xD;
      isolated from these patients will help us to decipher the pathophysiological mechanisms to&#xD;
      create new therapeutic strategies. For this, animal models are already available in Centre&#xD;
      Physiopathology Toulouse and in the French reference center in Lyon. As genetic&#xD;
      susceptibilities may underlie, at least in part, the variability of the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations and of the response to treatment, DNA from patients will be collected and&#xD;
      immune genes sequencing will be compared to other control groups, included international&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
