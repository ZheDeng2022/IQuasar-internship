      The goal of this study is to implement and evaluate the need, feasibility and effectiveness&#xD;
      of a resident-initiated, step-wise, graduated operative curriculum designed to enhance&#xD;
      resident autonomy for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for general surgery residents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to improve resident autonomy and confidence through detailed and&#xD;
      stepwise feedback and to also assess resident and attending perceptions regarding resident&#xD;
      skill and autonomy.&#xD;

    <description>General surgery residents at Mayo Clinic will complete surveys measuring resident autonomy, performance, confidence and case complexity at baseline and postoperatively following laparoscopic cholecystectomy to serve as a pre-intervention baseline.&#xD;
A standardized step-wise operative curriculum will then be implemented Residents will follow and graduate through this curriculum by initiating a perioperative model of briefing objectives, intraoperative teaching, and debriefing feedback (BID). The effectiveness of the intervention will then be measured by comparing survey results pre and post intervention.</description>
