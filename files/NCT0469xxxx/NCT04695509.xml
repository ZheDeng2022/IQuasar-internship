  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol (Propofol Kabi, Registration number from the State Register of Medicines - 000875)&#xD;
      is a widely used intravenous anesthetic. It is well known about different effects of propofol&#xD;
      infusion, including euphoria, psycholalia, disinhibition, talkativeness, satisfaction etc.&#xD;
      However, the basic mechanisms of such effects remain unknown. We suppose that propofol&#xD;
      sedation with various levels of sedation (from light to deep) leads to neuromediators&#xD;
      changes. We examine dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, GABA and serotonin in peripheral&#xD;
      venous blood before, during and after propofol sedation. Therefore, we suppose drugs for&#xD;
      sedation, in particular, propofol will affect neuromediators concentration.&#xD;

      The study is a prospective, nonrandomized, single center investigator design. Twenty-six&#xD;
      healthy patients undergoing elective trauma surgery (arthroscopy, reconstructive foot&#xD;
      surgery, osteosynthesis of intra-and periarticular fractures of the proxymal humerus) under&#xD;
      regional anesthesia (spinal anesthesia or brachial plexus block) with medical propofol&#xD;
      sedation are enrolled in this study. Montreal cognitive assessment test is a high validity&#xD;
      test for detecting cognitive impairment before operation. American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system is used to assess the physical&#xD;
      status of patients before operation. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is used to&#xD;
      determine the levels of anxiety and depression before operation. Two 18 or 20 G venous&#xD;
      cannulae are inserted in the left and/or right forearm for drug infusion and blood sampling.&#xD;
      The Richmond Agitation and Sedation scale (RASS) and bispectral index monitor A-2000XP (BIS,&#xD;
      Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. (USA), Registration certificate for a medical device RZN&#xD;
      2005/498) are used to determine the levels of sedation. Briefly (less than 10 seconds)&#xD;
      awakens with eye contact to voice or any movement (but no eye contact) to voice, bispectral&#xD;
      index values 70-90 correspond light-moderate sedation. No response to voice, but any movement&#xD;
      to physical stimulation, bispectral index monitoring values 60-70 correspond deep sedation.&#xD;
      BBraun Space with target control infusion sedation (TCIS, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Registration&#xD;
      certificate for a medical device RZN 2013/905) is used for dosing of propofol with moderate&#xD;
      (1-st group) or deep sedation (2-nd group). Philips Monitor IntelliVue MP40 (Medizin Systeme&#xD;
      Boblingen GmbH, Germany, Registration certificate for a medical device RZN 2014/2009) is used&#xD;
      for monitoring the electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse oximetry&#xD;
      during the infusion of the propofol and 15-20 minutes thereafter. Peripheral venous blood&#xD;
      samples are taken for analyzing neuromediators concentration 5 minutes before sedation (10&#xD;
      ml), after 35-40 min of propofol sedation (10 ml) and 10-15 minutes after the end of propofol&#xD;
      infusion (emergence from sedation). The blood is centrifuged for at least 8 minutes at 4000&#xD;
      revolutions per minute (RPM) in the test tube 367525-BD VACUTAINER (Becton Dickinson), plasma&#xD;
      is taken, which is further frozen at a temperature of -20 C in the test tube 363706-BD&#xD;
      MICROTAINER (Becton Dickinson). After 26 patients are recruited, the blood plasma is analyzed&#xD;
      by conducting the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, IBL Hamburg) of neuromediators&#xD;
      (dopamine (Catalog № Re59161), serotonin (Catalog № Re59121), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),&#xD;
      acetylcholine (Catalog № Re59161), noradrenaline (Catalog № Re59261)). Concentrations of&#xD;
      neuromediators between moderate and deep sedation groups are compared using Student's t-test&#xD;
      for independent samples. Concentrations of neuromediators before, during and after sedation&#xD;
      are compared using Friedman-test for dependent samples. All data is presented as mean ± SD, a&#xD;
      value of P less than 0.05 is taken as statistically significant.&#xD;
