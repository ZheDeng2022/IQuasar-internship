      Purpose off the study is investigating to efficacy of kinesio taping on neck lymphedema after&#xD;
      the head and neck cancer therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The neck lymphedema is a multidirectional process that depends on lymphatic circulation&#xD;
      issues. The lymphedema can be treated using such as therapies, drugs or surgeries. There are&#xD;
      few techniques for treatment of neck lymphedema and also in our best knowledge the kinesio&#xD;
      taping therapy on lymphedema following neck cancer therapy had not been investigated or&#xD;
      published. The study will assess the efficacy of kinesio taping in neck lymphedema with&#xD;
      manual therapy after the head and neck cancer treatment.&#xD;
