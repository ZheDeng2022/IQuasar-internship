      A prospective randomised study comparing the near visual acuity outcomes using Salzburg&#xD;
      Reading Desk in pseudophakic patients with idiopathic full-thickness macular hole treated&#xD;
      with pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling versus inverted flap&#xD;
      technique. The aim of the study is confirm or disprove the hypothesis, that the near visual&#xD;
      acuity results of pars plana vitrectomy with inverted flap technique for idiopathic macular&#xD;
      hole are not inferior to pars plana vitrectomy with complete internal limiting membrane&#xD;
      peeling technique. Patients will be followed for 6 months after the operation and near best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity testing on Salzburg reading desk, distance best corrected visual&#xD;
      acuity on ETDRS tables and microperimetry will be performed and compared between both groups.&#xD;
      Also the macular hole closure rate and complication rate will be compared between both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (MH) is an anatomic defect of the macula caused by the&#xD;
      traction of the vitreous. Interruption of all neural retinal layers from the internal&#xD;
      limiting membrane (ILM) to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is present. Although other&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches like pneumatic or enzymatic vitreolysis may lead to MH closure, pars&#xD;
      plana vitrectomy (PPV) remains a gold standard for the treatment of full-thickness MH.&#xD;
      Combination of PPV with full ILM peeling showed excellent results in small to medium MH,&#xD;
      however the success rates dropped significantly with the increasing size of MH. PPV with&#xD;
      inverted flap technique was introduced to address this issue and showed great results in MH&#xD;
      of all diameters. In inverted flap technique, ILM is peeled around the MH and small piece of&#xD;
      it is placed over the MH. It is speculated, that it serves as a scaffolding for gliosis&#xD;
      allowing it to close large MHs. Besides gliosis, the ILM flap seals the MH by secluding&#xD;
      communication between the vitreous and subretinal space, creating a closed compartment&#xD;
      enabling the RPE to pump out fluid effectively. However, it is not known whether the ILM left&#xD;
      in the macular hole might not hinder the healing process and full closure of macular hole.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to perform a detailed assessment of the state of the macula and near&#xD;
      best corrected visual acuity and to compare the results of complete ILM peeling and ILM flap&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomised study comparing the near visual acuity outcomes using&#xD;
      Salzburg Reading Desk in pseudophakic patients with idiopathic full-thickness MH treated with&#xD;
      PPV with ILM peeling versus inverted flap technique. Participants are randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ration to undergo 25-gauge PPV with complete ILM peeling or with circular inverted flap&#xD;
      technique with sulphur hexafluoride as a tamponade and recommendation to maintain reading&#xD;
      position for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline visit (D1) one day prior to the operation, patients undergo distance best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA) exam using ETDRS charts, intraocular pressure (IOP) measuring&#xD;
      using the non-contact tonometry, anterior segment slit-lamp examination, fundus&#xD;
      biomicroscopy, microperimetry and optical coherence tomography (OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At month 3 (M3) and month 6 (M6) visits, patients undergo distance BCVA exam using ETDRS&#xD;
      charts, near BCVA exam using the Salzburg reading desk (SRD Vision, NY, USA), IOP measuring&#xD;
      using the non-contact tonometry, anterior segment slit-lamp examination, fundus&#xD;
      biomicroscopy, microperimetry, and OCT. The closure of macular hole and post-operational&#xD;
      complications are assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distance BCVA is performed using ETDRS charts and recorded in logMAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microperimetry is performed using the MAIA Confocal Microperimeter (CenterVue S.p.A, Padova,&#xD;
      Italy). Expert exam 4-2 of the study eye is performed two times and the average of macular&#xD;
      integrity score, average threshold score and fixation stability P1 and P2 are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT is performed using the Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).&#xD;
      Macula of the study eye is scanned in 512 horizontal scans in the angle of 20x20 degrees with&#xD;
      the spacing of 11 um in High Speed mode with noise reduction set to ART=5. The minimum and&#xD;
      basal macular hole diameter is recorded, and the staging of the macular hole is performed&#xD;
      using both the Gass and International Vitreomacular Traction Study Classification System.&#xD;
      Presence or absence of epiretinal membrane is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near BCVA is performed using the Salzburg reading desk. The best near correction is&#xD;
      determined first using the Jaeger Reading Eye Charts. Examination on Salzburg reading desk is&#xD;
      performed afterwards in Czech with the reading distance set to 40 cm with contrast and&#xD;
      luminance set to 100%. Progressively smaller text is presented to the patient until his&#xD;
      reading speed falls under 80 words per minute (wpm) or until his word miss rate is higher&#xD;
      than 1. At this point, patient is presented with 5 different sentences with the same text&#xD;
      size. Test is ended if the patient cannot exceed the reading speed of 80 wpm or if his word&#xD;
      miss rate is higher than 1 3 or more times for the same text size. The smallest text size&#xD;
      where reading speed is over 80 wpm or word miss rate is 1 or lower is recorded in logMAR as&#xD;
      near BCVA.&#xD;
