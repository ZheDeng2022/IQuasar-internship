    <textblock>
      To compare the impact of insulin degludec (IDeg-100) and insulin glargine U300 (IGlar-300) on&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk parameters - glycaemic variability (GV), oxidative stress, arterial&#xD;
      stiffness and lipid parameters - in insulin naive patients with DMT2.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We recruited a total of 25 patients (23 completed the study) with T2DM who had uncontrolled&#xD;
      disease on two or more oral antidiabetic drugs. After the wash-up period, they were&#xD;
      randomized alternately to first receive either IDeg-100 or IGlar-300 along with metformin.&#xD;
      Each insulin was applied for 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of each phase,&#xD;
      biochemical and oxidative stress parameters were analysed and augmentation index was&#xD;
      measured. On three consecutive days prior to each control point, patients performed a 7-point&#xD;
      SMBG profile. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring thiol groups and hydroperoxides&#xD;
      (d-ROM) in serum. For augmentation index measuring, we used SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical,&#xD;
      Sydney, Australia) which allow non-invasive measurement of AIx on radial artery using strain&#xD;
      gauge transducer placed on the tip of a pencil-type tonometer. This method is based on the&#xD;
      principle of applanation tonometry&#xD;

After seven days they were randomized to first receive IDeg-100 In phase one they received IDeg-100 and metformin for 12 weeks. Phase one was followed by a second wash-up period in which patients received metformin alone again for seven days. In phase two, which also lasted for 12 weeks, patients were switched from IDeg-100 to IGlar-300 (and metformin was continued). The initial dose of both insulins was 0.2 IU/kg.</description>
