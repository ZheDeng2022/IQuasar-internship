  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study assessing safety and&#xD;
      limited efficacy of intraoperative C1INH (500U/kidney) vs. Placebo administered into the&#xD;
      graft renal artery 1-2 hours prior to implantation in adult subjects receiving a deceased&#xD;
      donor kidney allograft considered high-risk for development of DGF (KDPI&gt;80). Once eligible&#xD;
      patients are identified, consented, and have an acceptable kidney transplant offer, they will&#xD;
      be randomized by the Cedars-Sinai Research Pharmacy to receive study drug vs. placebo. Drug&#xD;
      and placebo will be prepared by the Cedars-Sinai Research Pharmacy and conveyed to the&#xD;
      operating room in a blinded manner. The drug will be administered by the transplant surgeon&#xD;
      in the OR in a blinded manner.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-operative, infusion of C1INH into the renal allograft artery 1-2 hours prior to&#xD;
      implantation will improve early graft function and reduce the rate of DGF, requirements for&#xD;
      dialysis, graft survival and eGFR in patients receiving kidney allografts from high risk&#xD;
      deceased donor compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early graft function has a long-term effect on graft survival. Poor early graft function and&#xD;
      DGF contributes to decreased short- and long-term patient and graft survival, increased&#xD;
      incidence of acute rejection, prolonged hospitalization, and higher costs of transplantation.&#xD;
      Although multiple factors contribute to the impaired graft function, ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      injury (IRI) is the underlying pathophysiology leading to poor early graft function and DGF.&#xD;
      A &gt;35% incidence of DGF has remained constant over time despite significant improvements in&#xD;
      immunosuppressive strategies and patient management. This may be due to increased use of&#xD;
      kidneys from &quot;extended-criteria&quot; and/or non-heart-beating donors, where even greater rates&#xD;
      (&gt;60%) of DGF have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 94,653 people are currently waiting for a kidney transplant in the United States&#xD;
      (UNOS.org 9/30/2019). Of the 19,360 kidney transplants performed in the US in 2018, 20% were&#xD;
      from DCD donors and 9% from donors of KDPI&gt;85. The USRDS reports that more than 50% of&#xD;
      patients on the waiting list are willing to accept a kidney from an expanded-criteria donor&#xD;
      (KDPI &gt;85). This study will seek to expand the use of high KDPI kidneys and reduce wastage by&#xD;
      showing improved function after C1INH treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fulfill all I/E criteria will be eligible to be enrolled into Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      I Study Group (40 patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Arm I - KDPI &gt;80 kidneys will be infused with one intrarenal dose of 500U of&#xD;
      Berinert® in OR prior to implantation into the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm - KDPI &gt;80 kidneys will be administered one intrarenal dose of normal saline (NS)&#xD;
      in the OR in a volume identical to the volume of the dose of Berinert® before implantation of&#xD;
      kidney into the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug v. placebo administration will be randomized 1:1. Drug preparation and randomization&#xD;
      will be carried out in a blinded fashion by research pharmacist.&#xD;
