  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The two main objectives of this study are to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      implanting the PanOptix Trifocal IOL in patients who have had previous myopic Lasik. The&#xD;
      primary objectives to demonstrate clinical safety will be the quality of vision questionnaire&#xD;
      (QUVID) which will demonstrate the patient's perception of halos, glares, and starbursts&#xD;
      before and after the implantation of the trifocal IOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective to demonstrate clinical effectiveness will be done by measuring visual&#xD;
      outcomes at distance, intermediate, and near. In addition, the patients will also fill out&#xD;
      the spectacle independence questionnaire (IOLSAT Questionnaire) to determine their level of&#xD;
      glasses independence postoperatively. In addition, at the conclusion of the study the patient&#xD;
      will also fill out a patient satisfaction survey.&#xD;

      Clinical Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of bothersome visual symptom items (defined as a very or extremely bothersome visual&#xD;
      symptom that impacts daily living under overall condition) for the patients who are&#xD;
      post-refractive who receive a PanOptix Trifocal IOL at the time of cataract surgery will be&#xD;
      assessed. The bothersome visual symptom items of interest are halos, glare, and starbursts.&#xD;
      Patients will also be assessed on level of glasses independence with an assessment of both&#xD;
      corrected and uncorrected distance, intermediate, and near vision. Lastly patient&#xD;
      satisfaction score will also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERALL STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, single center, bilateral, non-randomized,&#xD;
      open-label, observational clinical study. All patients will have had prior myopic Lasik and&#xD;
      will receive a PanOptix Trifocal IOL in both eyes at the time of cataract surgery. These&#xD;
      patients will then be followed for up to 6-months to assess their refractive predictability,&#xD;
      quality of vision, spectacle independence, and overall patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 months; however, any subject that undergoes a lens repositioning procedure due to IOL&#xD;
      misalignment, or reports &quot;very&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot; overall bother that impacts daily living for any&#xD;
      of the 3 defined bothersome visual symptoms (halos, glare, or starbursts) at 6 months, will&#xD;
      be followed through 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons will perform routine small-incision, femtosecond laser assisted, cataract surgery&#xD;
      and use the Alcon-recommended implantation systems for lens implantation. Refractive target&#xD;
      outcomes will be emmetropia for both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be bilaterally implanted; the second eye is to be implanted within&#xD;
      approximately one month after the first-eye surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a minimum of 10 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative for both eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surgical Procedure for each individual eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 1-day and 1-week visits for each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month visits for both eyes together&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In addition, a 1-year postoperative visit will be required for subjects who undergo a&#xD;
           lens repositioning procedure due to IOL misalignment at any time during the study, and&#xD;
           for subjects who report &quot;very&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot; overall bother that impacts daily living for&#xD;
           any of the 3 defined bothersome visual symptoms (halos, glare, or starbursts) at 6&#xD;
           months.&#xD;

    <description>Will assess patient complaints of glares, halos and starbursts after implantation of the trifocal PanOptix lens. Each of these three symptoms will be assessed on how often they occur, severity of each symptom, and how bothersome they are for the patient. The patient will rank the how often they occur as never, rarely, sometimes, most of the time, and always. The patient will rank severity of their worst experience as: none, a little, mild, moderate, and severe. And the patient will rank how bothered they are by each of these symptoms as: not bothered at all, bothered a little bit, bothered somewhat, bothered quite a bit, or bothered very much.</description>

        Bilateral cataracts in individuals who have had prior myopic laser assisted in situ&#xD;
        keratomileusis or photorefractive keratectomy. Topography ablation patterns need to be well&#xD;
        centered, and the corneal higher order aberration number needs to be less than 0.6 um for a&#xD;
        4 mm pupillary diameter on the itrace. PanOptix IOL power will be selected by utilizing the&#xD;
        American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery online post refractive calculator:&#xD;
        https://iolcalc.ascrs.org/. In addition, this IOL power calculation will be confirmed with&#xD;
        Alcon's intraoperative ORA aberrometer.&#xD;
