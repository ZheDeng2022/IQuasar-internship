    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female participants aged 18 years or older, with pathologic diagnosis of&#xD;
             follicular lymphoma (FL) (Grade 1, 2, 3A) in the most recent tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed or refractory disease following two or more treatment regimens, at least one&#xD;
             of which must have contained an anti-CD20 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received previous CD19-directed therapy must have a biopsy which&#xD;
             shows CD19 expression after completion of the CD19-directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease as defined by the 2014 Lugano Classification as assessed by&#xD;
             positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) or, if not&#xD;
             Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block (or minimum&#xD;
             10 freshly cut unstained slides if block is not available). Note: Any biopsy since&#xD;
             initial diagnosis is acceptable, but if several samples are available, the most recent&#xD;
             sample is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function as defined by screening laboratory values within the following&#xD;
             parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 10^3/μL (off growth factors at least 72&#xD;
                  hours),&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count ≥75 × 10^3/μL without transfusion in the past 2 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Alanine aminotransferase, AST, and GGT ≤2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN),&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN (participants with known Gilbert's syndrome may have a&#xD;
                  total bilirubin up to ≤3 × ULN),&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min by the Cockcroft and Gault equation.&#xD;
                  Note: A laboratory assessment may be repeated a maximum of two times during the&#xD;
                  Screening period to confirm eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)(1) must agree to use a highly effective&#xD;
             method(2) of contraception from the time of giving informed consent until at least 9&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study treatment. Men with female partners who are of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use a condom when sexually active or practice&#xD;
             total abstinence from the time of giving informed consent until at least 6 months&#xD;
             after the participant receives his last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. WOCBP are defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone bilateral tubal&#xD;
                  ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy; or who have not been&#xD;
                  postmenopausal. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months&#xD;
                  without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
                  level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state&#xD;
                  in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.&#xD;
                  However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is&#xD;
                  insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Highly effective forms of birth control are methods that achieve a failure rate&#xD;
                  of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Highly effective&#xD;
                  forms of birth control include hormonal contraceptives associated with inhibition&#xD;
                  of ovulation (oral, injectable, patch, intrauterine devices), male partner&#xD;
                  sterilization, or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when this is&#xD;
                  the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: The double-barrier method (e.g., synthetic condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with&#xD;
        spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic abstinence (such as calendar, symptothermal,&#xD;
        post ovulation), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and&#xD;
        spermicide-only are not acceptable as highly effective methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
