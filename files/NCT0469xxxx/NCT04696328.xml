    <textblock>
      Targeting patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, the purpose of this study is as&#xD;
      follows: to confirm short-term efficacy by observing changes and transitions in cardiac&#xD;
      function and clinical symptoms compared with each patient's baseline (before and after&#xD;
      comparison) by human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocyte sheet transplantation, and to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability including the combined use of immunosuppressants.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of a human (allogeneic) iPS&#xD;
      cell-derived cardiomyocyte sheet in combination with an immunosuppressant for ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy patients. The primary evaluation items will be improvement of left ventricular&#xD;
      systolic function (LVEF) for efficacy, and safety will be assessed by blood tests, general&#xD;
      laboratory tests, and other safety-related evaluations. Secondary evaluation items are NYHA&#xD;
      functional evaluation, left ventricular remodeling evaluation by echocardiography,&#xD;
      hemodynamic evaluation, physical activity function evaluation such as 6MWD and SAS, QOL, and&#xD;
      exercise tolerance evaluation by questionnaires.&#xD;
