      The objective of this research is to collect data to create an observatory of&#xD;
      microcrystalline rheumatism (gout and calcium-crystal rheumatism) in patients treated at the&#xD;
      Groupement des Hôpitaux de l'Institut Catholique de Lille, in order to better understand the&#xD;
      disease and improve patient care, in particular with the help of medical imaging.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients already included in another observational study set up in 2016 and meeting the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria may be included in this study. An information letter will be sent to&#xD;
      them by mail. If they wish to oppose to the use of their data, they can then return the&#xD;
      objection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample will be supplemented by new patients who are recruited during a classic&#xD;
      rheumatology consultation. The investigator will propose the study to all patients meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be informed of the objectives of the study and their rights. For patients who agree&#xD;
      to participate in the study, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the usual care, they will benefit from an ultrasound and/or a dual energy&#xD;
      scanner (M0). Imaging data will be collected. Routine clinical follow-up is then carried out&#xD;
      in consultation, with collection of clinical and biological evolution data, and morphological&#xD;
      data if necessary if imaging is rechecked, until the patient is lost to follow-up or the&#xD;
      follow-up is interrupted at the GHICL for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available quarterly or semi-annual data will be collected.&#xD;
