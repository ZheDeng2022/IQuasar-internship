  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry needling is a minimally invasive technique which generates good results and neuromuscular&#xD;
      benefits. Its application involves a highly prevalent effect called post-needling soreness.&#xD;
      It is defined as a residual pain, located in the incision area, with a self-limiting period&#xD;
      of 24-72 hours, as a result of a physiological process generated by the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, different clinical trials have been carried out to measure the effectiveness of&#xD;
      several techniques for reducing post-needling soreness, reaching positive results. However,&#xD;
      no studies have been found with the aim of distinguish which method is more effective for&#xD;
      this goal; therefore, it is clear the need to continue investigating on the subject and&#xD;
      comparing these techniques among them.&#xD;

      Main objective. To figure out if one of the four techniques (isometric, concentric, eccentric&#xD;
      contraction exercise and analytic passive stretching) is more effective for reducing post-&#xD;
      needling soreness immediately, at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. To verify if there is a correlation between independent variables and&#xD;
      post-needling soreness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type. Non-blinded randomized clinical trial. Intervention. Dry needling on an active&#xD;
      myofascial trigger point in superior trapezius, followed by one of the following treatments&#xD;
      according to the specific group: 1) concentric contraction exercise, 2) isometric contraction&#xD;
      exercise, 3) eccentric contraction exercise or 4) analytic passive stretching.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change From Baseline in Pain Scores on the Visual Analog Scale at 72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators use a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to determine the intensity of the patient's post-needing pain after and for 72 hours after DN.The VAS is a 100-mm line, oriented horizontally, with one end representing &quot;no pain&quot; and the other end representing &quot;worst pain.&quot; Subjects will be asked to rate their current pain with a mark on the scale.</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pain Catastrophizing at 72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a Likert-type questionnaire with 5 levels (0-4) that includes 13 items that measure 3 dimensions of catastrophism: magnification, rumination and despair. The Spanish version of this scale has shown to have an appropriate internal consistency, test-retest reliability and sensitivity to changes.</description>

    <measure>Fear of Pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Fear of Pain at 72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of Pain Questionnaire. This scale is a Likert-type questionnaire with 5 levels (1-5) with 3 lists of 10 sub-items that contemplate 3 different aspects of fear of pain: fear of mild pain, fear of severe pain, fear of pain related to the area doctor. The Spanish version of this scale has shown to have an acceptable validity and reliability.</description>

    <measure>Pain Anxiety Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pain Anxiety at 72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale. This Likert-type questionnaire with 6 levels (0-5) includes 20 items that measure 4 dimensions of pain anxiety: cognitive anxiety, escape / avoidance, fear and physiological anxiety. The Spanish version of this scale has been shown to have appropriate validity and reliability</description>

    <description>After applying the dry needling technique to the upper trapezius muscle, the participant will be placed in a standing position, with the shoulders positioned in the scapular plane. A medium stiffness Theraband elastic band will be placed between the participant's ipsilateral foot on the side on which the dry needling technique was applied and the acromio-clavicular joint on the same side.The exercise will consist of raising the shoulder against the resistance of the elastic band, slowly and for 5 seconds</description>
