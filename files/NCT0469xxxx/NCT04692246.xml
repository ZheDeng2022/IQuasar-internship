  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis, an infectious disease that affects the tooth-supporting tissues and shows a&#xD;
      wide range of clinical, microbiological, and immunological manifestations, is associated with&#xD;
      and probably caused by dynamic interaction among infectious agents, host immune responses,&#xD;
      hazardous environmental exposure and genetic propensity. Bacteria are necessary for the&#xD;
      disease to appear, but are not sufficient and do not account for all cases of periodontitis.&#xD;
      According to one survey in the USA, chronic periodontitis affects approximately 46% of the&#xD;
      adult population, with an even higher prevalence among the elderly. This prevalence refers to&#xD;
      the cohort of young adults according to the WHO, with ages ranging from 35 to 44 years. Forms&#xD;
      of periodontitis that appear at younger ages (before the age of 30 years), and that have&#xD;
      other characteristics in addition to age, are known as aggressive periodontitis. The&#xD;
      prevalence of this disorder ranges from 0.2% in Caucasians to 2.6% in Afro-Americans. The&#xD;
      microbiota of the human oral mucosa together with other anatomical locations in the body&#xD;
      constitute the human microbiome. The equilibrium between these organisms and the host&#xD;
      response plays a fundamental role in human biology, both in health maintenance and in the&#xD;
      appearance of disease. Unfavorable alterations in the composition of the microbiota are&#xD;
      termed dysbiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiseptics and antibiotics such as Chlorhexidine or Metronidazole, are delivered locally as&#xD;
      an adjunct to scaling and root planing procedures, in order to eradicate the subgingival&#xD;
      microbes, hence creating a healthy subgingival environment. However, the results presented in&#xD;
      the literature are inconclusive. There is a need for further clinical trials with strict&#xD;
      methodological criteria for allowing a more precise assessment of the efficacy of local&#xD;
      antimicrobials in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there has been renewed interest in the application of natural products. Several&#xD;
      natural products and herbs have claimed to have better properties and less side effects than&#xD;
      chemical agents for irrigation. The use of natural extracts and essential oils as an&#xD;
      irrigation agent for ultrasonic instrumentation has shown to promote slight adjunctive effect&#xD;
      compared to chlorhexidine or water. In other study, natural extract showed a greater&#xD;
      improvement compared to controls in patients with a more severe degree of periodontitis.&#xD;
      However, in other studies this pocket reduction and clinical attachment gain were no&#xD;
      significant when compared to water. Natural products have also been tested in forms of oral&#xD;
      spray, and have shown to be effective against common oral pathogens without significant&#xD;
      cytotoxicity in an in vitro study. Thus, it has the potential to prevent the infections and&#xD;
      may serve as adjunctive treatment to conventional therapy. They claim to have the same or&#xD;
      even more anti-microbial effect and anti-inflammatory effect without adding any chemicals.&#xD;
      But still there is no adequate scientific evidence to support this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test the effect as an adjutant to therapy of a nutraceutical composed of&#xD;
      several plant extracts in patients with periodontitis and different levels of risk for&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. Specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The response of periodontal clinical variables to non-surgical periodontal treatment in&#xD;
           patients treated with the extract, compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The effect on local inflammatory markers, in patients treated with the extract compared&#xD;
           to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The modifier effect of metabolic syndrome-related variables in the treatment outcomes of&#xD;
           the patients treated with the extract compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of the plant extract would act as an anti-inflammatory agent, contributing to&#xD;
      better treatment outcomes of periodontitis, in terms of clinical and biochemical variables.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study unit/population Subjects with diagnosis of periodontitis according to the joint EFP/AAP&#xD;
      2018 criteria for the case definition of periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Patients attended in the University of Granada School of Dentistry&#xD;
      (Granada, Spain) Signing of a written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Age under 18 years, received periodontal treatment in the last year,&#xD;
      anti-microbial therapy in the previous 3 months, multiple pregnancy and the presence of&#xD;
      neoplastic or severe infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling and randomization It is estimated to explore at least 60 patients, of which 30 will&#xD;
      be randomized to each group, accordingly to similar studies on the topic available in the&#xD;
      literature. The group allocation will also follow similar studies published previously in the&#xD;
      field (7-9, 12, 13). All patients will receive standard periodontal treatment with an&#xD;
      ultrasonic new generation device (AIRFLOWÂ® Prophylaxis Master, EMS Dental, Nyon,&#xD;
      Switzerland), and the group division will be based on the use of the extract as an adjunct to&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group: Patients that will receive the application of the extract in form of irrigation&#xD;
      solutions in the periodontal pockets during regular periodontal treatment. Patients would&#xD;
      continue at home during the follow-up period, taking the essential oils in as a rinse twice&#xD;
      per day, and as a spray when regular toothbrush could not be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Patients that will follow the same protocol, but using regular irrigation and&#xD;
      a placebo spray at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers that will perform the clinical examinations will be blinded for the group&#xD;
      allocation of the participants, since the random allocation and prescription will be&#xD;
      performed by a different researcher. Study products and placebo will be provided previously&#xD;
      by the company BIONAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sociodemographic variables: sex, age, smoking habit (cigs/day), alcohol consumption&#xD;
           (g/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Periodontal clinical variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Periodontal examination will be performed by a calibrated researcher using PCPUNC15&#xD;
           periodontal probe (Hu-friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) and dental exploration mirror. Six&#xD;
           surfaces in each implant will be measured: mesiovestibular, vestibular, distovestibular,&#xD;
           distolingual, lingual, mesiolingual. All clinical data will be recorded in a periodontal&#xD;
           chart. Clinical data will be gathered at baseline, and at 2 and 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bleeding on probing: The percentage of bleeding implants while probing, will the&#xD;
           registered following the index of Ainamo and Bay (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oral hygiene: Oral hygiene will be measured using the Plaque Index proposed by Tonetti&#xD;
           (15). The presence of plaque will be registered by visual examination without using a&#xD;
           plaque revealing agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Metabolic syndrome-related variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Body height&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biochemical variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of saliva, subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid will be obtained at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study, at 2 months and at the end of follow-up. A panel of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be obtained at the beginning of the study, at 2 months and at the end of&#xD;
      follow-up for the assessment of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid profile (Total cholesterol, Triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analysis A database in Excel format will be prepared&#xD;
      including all recorded variables. The data will be analyzed by a single researcher. The&#xD;
      statistical software SPSS v.21.0 (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) will be used, performing&#xD;
      descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations and percentages) and analytical procedures&#xD;
      (95% confidence intervals, Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square, Student's t-test for paired&#xD;
      samples, and univariate and multivariate regression analysis). A 5% significance level will&#xD;
      be considered for all tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study will be designed in order to comply with the standards of&#xD;
      the las revision of the Helsinki declaration. Approval from the Research Ethics Committee in&#xD;
      Human Studies of the University of Granada will be obtained prior to the beginning of the&#xD;
      study. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants in the study. All&#xD;
      obtained data will be anonymous and the study will be designed following the CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines for reporting clinical trials (16).&#xD;
