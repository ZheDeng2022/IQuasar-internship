  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      gilteritinib in male and female participants with severe, mild and moderate renal impairment&#xD;
      compared to healthy male and female participants with normal renal function. This study will&#xD;
      also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of gilteritinib in male and&#xD;
      female participants with severe, mild and moderate renal impairment and healthy male and&#xD;
      female participants with normal renal function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is comprised of 2 parts. Part 1 includes participants with severe renal impairment&#xD;
      and normal renal function. Part 2 includes participants with mild and moderate renal&#xD;
      impairment and normal renal function. Participants will be residential for a single period of&#xD;
      14 days/13 nights. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day 14 on the&#xD;
      condition that all required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical&#xD;
      reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit.&#xD;
