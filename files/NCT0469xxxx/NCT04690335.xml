    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether the investigational, live&#xD;
      attenuated, intranasally delivered vaccine MV-012-968 ('study vaccine') may have prophylactic&#xD;
      efficacy against symptomatic RSV infection when administered to adults 18-45 years of age in&#xD;
      the Human Viral Challenge model.&#xD;

    <description>SAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the study vaccine or not, that threaten life or result in any of the following: death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <description>MAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the study vaccine or not, with unscheduled medically attended visits, such as urgent care visits, acute primary care visits, emergency department visits, or other previously unplanned visits to a medical provider. Scheduled medical visits such as routine physicals, wellness checks, 'checkups', and vaccinations, are not considered MAEs</description>
