  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implement a randomized controlled trial, evidence-based, culturally adapted, environmental&#xD;
      enrichment intervention for the purpose of enhancing neurocognitive outcomes among Zika&#xD;
      Exposed Children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention group received up to twelve 1-hour weekly visits by trained and experienced&#xD;
      Grenadian parent and infant relationship specialists who provided home-based interventions as&#xD;
      part of the Saving Brains Grenada project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The environmental enrichment intervention is a brain-based program that teaches parents about&#xD;
      brain development in young infants and skills for building a strong social-emotional&#xD;
      connection that stimulates brain development and maximizes neurocognitive function. A&#xD;
      detailed intervention manual was developed and used as a guide for the intervention&#xD;
      specialists. Neurocognitive outcomes in the intervention and control group were assessed pre&#xD;
      and post intervention by a separate and blinded assessment team.&#xD;

    <measure>The INTERGROWTH 21st Neurodevelopmental Assessment (INTER-NDA)</measure>
    <time_frame>22-30 months</time_frame>
    <description>The INTER-NDA is a measure of cognition, motor skills (fine and gross motor), language (expressive and receptive), behavior, executive function, attention and social-emotional reactivity for 2-year-olds. The measure is comprised of 30 items scored across a spectrum, with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>
