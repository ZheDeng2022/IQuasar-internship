  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAD is a challenging affliction which has a high annual morbidity rate in China and the&#xD;
      world. Severe CAD may lead to compromised cardiac function, decreased exertional capacity and&#xD;
      poor quality of life (QOL). The most common treatment for CAD is medication, percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). However, some patients&#xD;
      had long-term of history with complex severe artery lesions, they are not candidate for redo&#xD;
      interventional therapy. Cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) is an exploring therapy used&#xD;
      globally for CAD patients, which is known for its safety, non-invasiveness and&#xD;
      effectiveness.The previous RCT from the investigators' team has already finished, and results&#xD;
      are in submission processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single arm, observational study design. CAD patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      consecutively. The entire treatment period will last 3 months with 9 sessions. Outcomes are&#xD;
      assessed as efficacy outcomes and safety outcomes. Efficacy outcomes include symptom (CCS&#xD;
      score, NYHA classification, nitroglycerin dosage, SAQ questionnaire), exertional capacity&#xD;
      (6MWT), quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) and imaging evaluation (myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      imaging and echocardiography). Safety outcome include the change of serum TNT, CKMB, BNP and&#xD;
      adverse event (AE) occurrence. The participants will be followed up at 13th week, 6th months&#xD;
      and 12th months.&#xD;

      CAD is a challenging affliction which has a high annual morbidity rate in China and the&#xD;
      world. Severe CAD may lead to compromised cardiac function, decreased exertional capacity and&#xD;
      poor quality of life (QOL). The most common treatment for CAD is medication, percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). However, some patients&#xD;
      had long-term of history with complex severe artery lesions, they are not candidate for redo&#xD;
      interventional therapy. Cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) is an exploring therapy used&#xD;
      globally for CAD patients, which is known for its safety, non-invasiveness and effectiveness.&#xD;
      In the previous clinical studies, CSWT can alleviated angina symptom, improved myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia and increased exertional capacity. Many single arm studies proved its efficacy and&#xD;
      safety. Our RCT has already finished, and results are in submission processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single arm, observational study design. CAD patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      consecutively. The entire treatment period will last 3 months with 9 sessions. CSWT will be&#xD;
      administered in the first week, follow by a 3-week non-treatment interval. Outcomes are&#xD;
      assessed as efficacy outcomes and safety outcomes. Efficacy outcomes include symptom (CCS&#xD;
      score, NYHA classification, nitroglycerin dosage, SAQ questionnaire), exertional capacity&#xD;
      (6MWT), quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) and imaging evaluation (myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      imaging and echocardiography). Safety outcome include the change of serum TNT, CKMB, BNP and&#xD;
      adverse event (AE) occurrence. Symptom, 6MWT and questionnaires will be evaluated at baseline&#xD;
      and 13th week, 6th months, 12th months of CSWT. Imaging outcomes will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and 13th week, 12th months of CSWT. The level of TNT, CKMB and BNP will be tested&#xD;
      before and 1st week after initiation of CSWT.&#xD;
