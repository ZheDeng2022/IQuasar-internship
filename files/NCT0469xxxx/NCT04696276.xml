  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program includes preoperative counseling, fasting&#xD;
      avoidance, non-opioid analgesia, fluid balance, normothermia and early mobilization. ERAS&#xD;
      pathways were developed to reduce hospital length of stay, reduce costs and decrease&#xD;
      perioperative opioid requirements, and be beneficial for patients. We propose the hypothesis&#xD;
      that the ERAS pathway could reduce the length of stay (LOS) in hospital for patients&#xD;
      undergoing major gynecolodic oncology surgery (MGOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated in two groups: An ERAS pathway group including preoperative&#xD;
      counseling, early feeding/mobilization, and opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia; and a&#xD;
      classic model group of post operative recovery as control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Gynecological Cancer of the inner genital organs includes ovarian cancer, endometrial and&#xD;
      cervical cancer and its therapeutic approach is surgical removal of the organ with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last decade has developed various postoperative recovery protocols aimed at safe and&#xD;
      rapid recovery of the patient after a surgery and early discharge from the hospital. These&#xD;
      protocols are known as ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocols or Fast-Track (FT)&#xD;
      and combine various evidence-based perioperative care techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ERAS protocols include specific approaches preoperative, intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative, by the multidisciplinary team (surgeon, anesthetist and nurse), and aim at&#xD;
      reducing the postoperative stress and pain, fasten the feeding and the mobilization of the&#xD;
      patient after the surgery and rapid the hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed to evaluate the superiority of the ERAS pathway to conventional&#xD;
      non-ERAS clinical practice in reducing the LOS. The results may provide new insight into the&#xD;
      clinical applications of the ERAS pathway for MGOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This doctoral thesis aims to compare the effectiveness of the Protocol ERAS against the&#xD;
      classical model of recovery, in the postoperative recovery of patients with Gynecological&#xD;
      Cancer undergoing MGOS, in a Public Oncology Hospital in Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of ERAS programs is expected to emerge in the length of hospital stay, in pain&#xD;
      control, in perioperative stress, in the early feeding and mobilization of patients who have&#xD;
      undergone MGOS.&#xD;
