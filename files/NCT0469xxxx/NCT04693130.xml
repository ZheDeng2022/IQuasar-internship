      The purpose of this study is to explore the differences between stress, anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      mindfulness, salivary amylase activity and postnatal maternal outcomes for prenatal mental&#xD;
      disorders women with mindfulness prenatal education program&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a Mindfulness prenatal education program in&#xD;
      reducing pregnant women's perceived stress, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, salivary&#xD;
      alpha-amylase compared to a control group. The investigators hypothesize that use of the&#xD;
      mindfulness prenatal education program by study group will lead to improved related mood&#xD;
      symptoms compared with control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial comparing two education programs with health and singleton&#xD;
      pregnant women is run by the Random Allocation Software (Saghaei, 2004). Use the G-Power&#xD;
      3.1.9 windows: repeated measures and between factors among two groups to calculate the number&#xD;
      of samples, and setting the power = .8, Î± = .05, effect size = .25. The estimated number of&#xD;
      samples may be lost 20%, total 76 samples.&#xD;
