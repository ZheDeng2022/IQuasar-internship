  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The cardinal&#xD;
      symptoms of PD are tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Gait disturbance&#xD;
      is also one of the key features of PD. At present, the mainstream treatment of PD is the&#xD;
      dopaminergic supplement. However, the response to the medical treatment varies between&#xD;
      symptoms. Rigidity and bradykinesia respond to the medical treatment the best, and tremor&#xD;
      respond partially. Gait disorders do not usually respond to the dopaminergic medication.&#xD;
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most notorious and devastating presentation of gait&#xD;
      disorders in PD. Currently, there is no available treatment for FOG, even the invasive deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation does not work on it. Repetitive transcortical magnetic stimulation (rTMS)&#xD;
      is a novel non-invasive intervention. Through the magnetic stimulation, brain neurons could&#xD;
      be activated by the electrical current. The application of rTMS had been approved by US FDA&#xD;
      for the treatment of depression. The possible effect of rTMS may result from the&#xD;
      stimulation-related neuronal plasticity. Regarding PD, rTMS also had been found to had some&#xD;
      effect on different motor symptoms, mainly on the bradykinesia and rigidity but not gait. The&#xD;
      present study would like to test the accumulative effect of rTMS on gait disorders of PD,&#xD;
      especially the phenomenon of FOG. All the study subjects will receive rTMS under intermittent&#xD;
      theta burst stimulation (iTBS) mode at supplementary motor area (SMA). Gait analysis and&#xD;
      other motor performance will be assessed before and after the intervention.&#xD;

      The present trial is designed as an open-label, uncontrolled pilot study for evaluating the&#xD;
      effect of rTMS on improvement of freezing of gait (FOG) in people with PD. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the improvement of FOG, and the secondary endpoint is the improvement of motor&#xD;
      symptoms and cognition. All participants need to complete the informed consent before they&#xD;
      are enrolled into the trial. Demographic data includes age, sex, medical history, drug&#xD;
      history, disease duration, modified Hoehn-Yahr stage, and UPDRS score are collected. Gait&#xD;
      function are evaluated with time up and go (TUG), freezing of gait questionnaire (FOG-Q), and&#xD;
      Gait-up device analysis before trial starting. Cognitive function including mini-mental state&#xD;
      examination (MMSE), clocking drawing test, Wechsler memory scale (WMS)-world list test and&#xD;
      spatial span test, trial making test A and B, category fluency test (animal naming), and beck&#xD;
      depression inventory-II are tested by trained neuropsychiatrists. Pre-treatment brain image&#xD;
      examined by magnetic resonance image (MRI) and blood sampling for synapse protein level are&#xD;
      performed. The participants are then arranged to receive theta burst stimulation for 5 days&#xD;
      by Magstim RapidÂ® system (Super Rapid 2) equipped with air cooled coil (D70), stimulating on&#xD;
      supplementary motor area (SMA). After the intervention, post-treatment evaluation including&#xD;
      gait function, motor symptoms, cognition, brain MRI, and blood sampling will be performed&#xD;
      again with the same methods at 1 month later. Any adverse event during the trial period will&#xD;
      also be recorded. The trial is expected to be conducted in Shuang-Ho hospital, Taipei Medical&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
