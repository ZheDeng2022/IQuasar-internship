  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, multicenter study (12 hospitals belonging to the&#xD;
      Italian Cardiology Network) in patients with STEMI ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)&#xD;
      treated successfully with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), that will be&#xD;
      followed for 12 month after the acute event, in order to ascertain the predictive value of&#xD;
      myocardial viability measured with cardiac magnetic resonance (1.5 T; based on the transmural&#xD;
      distribution of late enhancement in the infarcted segments) for the identification of left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) remodelling (REM) 6 months after STEMI.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The present study is divided into 3 appointments following the standard inpatient stay for&#xD;
      the index event (STEMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0: Inpatient stay for index STEMI. Assessment of eligibility for participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STEMI diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation at second-day transthoracic echocardiogram and pre-discharge echocardiogram&#xD;
           of left ventricular dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarker assay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (V1): between 30 and 40 days post-STEMI. Clinical evaluation and performance of&#xD;
      cardiac MRI with paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium) for measurement of infarct&#xD;
      territory size and myocardial viability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (V2): 6 months after STEMI. Clinical evaluation and second cardiac MRI, without&#xD;
      contrast medium, for measurement of left ventricular volumes and consequently for measurement&#xD;
      of the presence of adverse left ventricular remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (V3): 12 months after STEMI. Clinical re-evaluation with collection of data regarding&#xD;
      events of interest for secondary endpoint. Performance of transthoracic echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examinations and follow-up visits included in this study are part of clinical practice&#xD;
      for treatment and risk assessment in patients who suffered STEMI with the exception of&#xD;
      cardiac MRI without contrast medium at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data (1 month and 6 months) will be centrally analyzed post&#xD;
      hoc at the MRI center.&#xD;
