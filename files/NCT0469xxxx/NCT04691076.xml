    <textblock>
      Purpose: 1. To determine the efficacy of low-dose esketamine in painless gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy. 2. To determine the safety of low-dose esketamine in painless gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy. 3. To provide a theoretical basis and new ideas for the application of esketamine&#xD;
      as a new drug in perioperative period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Keeping spontaneous breathing anesthesia can provide patients with comfortable diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment experience during gastrointestinal endoscopy, which is a vital prerequisite for the&#xD;
      large-scale development of this operation as well as the early screening and treatment of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal malignancies. Clinically, fentanyl combined with propofol is the most&#xD;
      commonly used anesthesia regimen for the painless gastroscopy, however its high incidence of&#xD;
      respiratory and circulatory depression will threaten the safety of patients. Instead,&#xD;
      esketamine has a good action in anesthesia and analgesics, a slighter respiratory depression,&#xD;
      as well as with a remarkable improvement in adverse effects than ketamine. What has already&#xD;
      been proved is that low- dose of esketamine can remarkably reduce the dosage of propofol&#xD;
      during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; In our pilot study, we found that not&#xD;
      only the incidence of respiratory depression was significantly lower than that of fentanyl&#xD;
      during endoscopic polypectomy, but also the dosage of propofol was reduced at the same&#xD;
      time,suggesting that esketamine may have a potential superiority in the painless&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy.Our project plans to collect the patients who have received&#xD;
      painless gastroscopy and polypectomy in the hospital, and use a target-controlled infusion&#xD;
      (TCI) of propofol in combination with esketamine, by observing the total dose of propofol ,&#xD;
      the time of recovery and the length of hospital stay, the satisfaction of patients and&#xD;
      endoscopists, drug side effects,adverse events of respiratory and circulatory system and&#xD;
      other indicators ,to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this anesthetic scheme.&#xD;
