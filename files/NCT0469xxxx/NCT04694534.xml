  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a cognitive remediation program&#xD;
      based on a &quot;serious game&quot; on the information processing speed evolution and the process of&#xD;
      learning via episodic memory in multiple sclerosis patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment affects 40 to 70% multiple sclerosis patients. This condition is&#xD;
      characterized by slower information processing, associated with deficits in episodic memory,&#xD;
      attention and executive functions. These disorders appear early, regardless of functional&#xD;
      impairment, in &quot;benign&quot; forms and in clinically isolated syndromes of multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
      These disruptions can have a significant impact in the socio-professional and personal life&#xD;
      of patients and also in the quality of life (job loss risks, daily activities limitations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if these disorders are now well documented, remediation strategies remain less studied.&#xD;
      Some studies show that the &quot;training&quot; methods, often used, do not seem suitable for clinical&#xD;
      monitoring, with benefits that do not persist over time. Despite their impact on daily life,&#xD;
      no specific care for planning abilities, mental inhibition and flexibility, or even social&#xD;
      cognition, have been well studied until today. The same is true concerning metacognitive&#xD;
      abilities. Finally, remedial techniques are time consuming and difficult to adapt to patients&#xD;
      still in professional activity.&#xD;
