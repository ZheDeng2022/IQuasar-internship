  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically, infants with Autism spectrum often display gross motor delays in supine, prone,&#xD;
      and sitting skills in their first year of life. Delay in crawling, walking, and achieving&#xD;
      other motor milestones are frequently observed in toddler hood. In addition, difficulties in&#xD;
      fine motor skills are frequent in individuals with Autism spectrum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies demonstrated that improvements in sensory-motor skills, motor planning, and&#xD;
      reading related skills in children with learning and intellectual disabilities were seen&#xD;
      using sensory integration and fine motor intervention. However, there are limited studies&#xD;
      investigating the effectiveness of sensory integration/occupational therapy on autistic&#xD;
      features (stereotype movement, communication, and social interaction). Fine motor skills and&#xD;
      quality of life of children with Autism spectrum are markedly affected which might be related&#xD;
      to the stereotype movement and limited social interactions. Therefore, this study will be&#xD;
      conducted to investigate and compare between the therapeutic outcomes of sensory SI and fine&#xD;
      motor intervention on autistic features, fine motor skills and quality of life of children&#xD;
      with Autism spectrum.&#xD;

    <measure>Gilliam autism rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Items on the developmental sub scale address behaviors and milestones in the first 36 months of life. The four sub scales are summed to provide an autism index. The higher the autism index, the higher the probability the individual has autism and the more severe the autistic behavior</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fine manual control domain will be assessed in the current study. The fine manual control domains contain two sub tests fine motor precision and fine motor integration. Total motor composite and subtest measures are available as a raw score, standard score, percentile rank and descriptive category (&quot;well below average&quot;, &quot;below average', &quot;average&quot; above average and &quot;well above average&quot;). Gender specific norms were used for scoring as the scale's authors report these as being more accurate than combined gender norms</description>

    <measure>Pediartic Quality of life Inventory Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Arabic version of Pediatric Quality of life Inventory Scale will be used to assess quality of life of children in this study. for ease of interpret ability, items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better performance. To reverse score, transform the 0-4 scale items to 0-100 as follows: 0-100, 1=75, 2= 50, 3= 25 and 4= 0. Finally, the Scale Score for each dimension and Total Scale Score were calculated</description>
