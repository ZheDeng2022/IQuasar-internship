      The Institute for Research on Viral and Hepatic Diseases, Inserm Unit UMR_S 1110, in&#xD;
      Strasbourg, studies hepatic diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (CHC).&#xD;
      These diseases can be induced by hepatitis viruses, B (HBV), C (HCV) and D (VHD), but also a&#xD;
      poor lifestyle combining overeating and the sedentary lifestyle of our current living&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no treatment is available to cure non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis,&#xD;
      and prevent the development of liver tumors. One of the reasons for the lack of specific&#xD;
      treatment is the limited knowledge of the pathophysiology of the liver and the hepatic&#xD;
      microenvironment. In addition, the heterogeneity of HCC and associated underlying liver&#xD;
      diseases, and the lack of adequate preclinical models are at the root of the difficulties in&#xD;
      identifying an effective therapeutic target for these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, new molecular profiling techniques and strategies are needed to meet these medical&#xD;
      needs, in particular the prediction of the response to treatment of HCC, which is still&#xD;
      largely unsatisfactory, and the discovery of new therapeutic targets. Using innovative&#xD;
      approaches, UMR_S 1110 utilizes single cell RNA sequencing, which is a high resolution&#xD;
      technique to analyze gene expression at the individual cell level. This technique represents&#xD;
      the most advanced tool for studying heterogeneous tissues such as cancerous tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in-depth knowledge of HCC and the liver tumor environment at the single-cell level is&#xD;
      crucial for understanding the progression of liver disease, for identifying new therapeutic&#xD;
      targets and improving clinical outcomes by allowing for estimate the response to treatment&#xD;
      and thus improve the patient's vital prognosis, by offering him an adapted personalized&#xD;
      treatment. In order to identify factors determining hepatocarcinogenesis, predictors of&#xD;
      response to treatment and new therapeutic targets, the investigators propose to analyze&#xD;
      tissues from patients with chronic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator aim :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. / to establish ex vivo models of chronic hepatic disease and hepatic tumors, in order to&#xD;
           study and validate the therapeutic targets identified in the laboratory from single cell&#xD;
           RNA sequencing from hepatic tissues obtained from patients. These models include&#xD;
           spheroid cultures and models of mice developing liver tumors from xenografts of tumors&#xD;
           from patients. To ensure the successful establishment of these complex models, the use&#xD;
           of autologous sera is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. / profile the hepatic tumors and the hepatic tissue adjacent to the tumor, the site of&#xD;
           chronic liver disease, using single-cell RNA sequencing in order to study the&#xD;
           heterogeneity and complexity of the tumor, to identify novel therapeutic targets and&#xD;
           tumor phenotypes that correlate with response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-derived preclinical models, developed at unit UMR_S1110, will allow us to better&#xD;
      understand the biology of chronic liver disease and liver tumors at the patient level,&#xD;
      identify the most appropriate treatment for the patient, and evaluate new treatments and&#xD;
      biomarkers to non-invasively diagnose the onset of liver disease, for the benefit of&#xD;
      personalized medicine for the benefit of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples obtained from patients with chronic liver disease will also allow us to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advance knowledge on viral hepatitis, in particular HCV, HBV and HDV;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implement new strategies for the development of a vaccine for HCV;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify new biomarkers of hepatic carcinogenesis by comparing the metabolomic and&#xD;
           inflammatory profiles of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The partnership between Inserm, the University of Strasbourg and the University Hospitals of&#xD;
      Strasbourg makes it possible to create unique synergies that will ultimately help identify&#xD;
      new targets for therapeutic and preventive strategies against these diseases which represent&#xD;
      a major public health problem.&#xD;
