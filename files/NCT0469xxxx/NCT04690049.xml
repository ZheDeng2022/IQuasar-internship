    <textblock>
      Upper limb tendinopathies, especially the so called &quot;shoulder impingement syndrome&quot;, is a&#xD;
      common injury among the population. Its management usually involves active treatments, being&#xD;
      the therapeutic progressive exercise the most important and effective modality. However,&#xD;
      whether a certain criterion is more appropriate than another when progressing the exercise&#xD;
      program remains unclear. We propose a new program based on progressive exercises serving as a&#xD;
      standard approach for the management of shoulder impingement syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a common condition affecting our society. It is estimated that between 7 and&#xD;
      67% of the adult population will suffer from shoulder pain at least once in their lifetime.&#xD;
      Some research suggest that shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) is responsible for 44 to 60%&#xD;
      from the medical consultations regarding shoulder pain with an approximate prevalence of&#xD;
      70-200 per 1000 adults, which implies a remarkable use of health care resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among all the musculoskeletal injuries affecting the shoulder complex, SIS remains as the&#xD;
      most common condition, characterized for leading to loss function and disability. Its&#xD;
      pathogenesis is associated with the affection of diverse structures and tissues like the&#xD;
      subacromial bursa, rotator cuff tendons, acromion, coracoacromial ligament and the long head&#xD;
      of biceps brachii. The etiology of this condition comprises multiple causes, including&#xD;
      capsular tightness, alteration of shoulder kinematics with scapula dysfunction and muscle&#xD;
      imbalance, and also the overuse factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment modalities to deal with SIS embrace both surgical procedures, i.e., arthroscopic&#xD;
      subacromial decompression) and conservative approaches (i.e., physical therapy), becoming the&#xD;
      therapeutic exercise increasingly popular due to arising evidence from the last 30 years.&#xD;
      Furthermore, with regard to potential effects, therapeutic exercise presents itself as a&#xD;
      safer and less aggressive alternative, causing fewer adverse effects than pharmacological or&#xD;
      surgical options, which are relegated preferably as secondary choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a wide evidence supporting the exercise therapy as an effective strategy for the&#xD;
      management of SIS. However, some controversy exists regarding the optimal approach in terms&#xD;
      of intensity, frequency and number of repetitions. Thus, a program acting as a gold standard&#xD;
      for the development and progression of the proposed exercises is still lacking, especially&#xD;
      when attempting to estimate the pure effect of progressive exercise in isolation between&#xD;
      experimental and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior research evaluating the effect of progressive exercise for the management of SIS&#xD;
      usually included programs with a duration of 3 months. However, other studies established&#xD;
      follow-up periods of either one month and a half or, conversely, more than 6 months. That,&#xD;
      together with the wide variety of post-treatment follow-ups, makes it difficult to find the&#xD;
      optimal period where the results derived inherently from the intervention and not from the&#xD;
      natural course of the condition may be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the progression criteria, there seems to be a tendency to consider the modulation&#xD;
      of the painful sensation as the main benchmark from which the exercise may progress in&#xD;
      difficulty, but some other progression sub-criteria can also be found, such as fatigue or&#xD;
      subjective perception. Furthermore, the presence of other conditioning elements, like&#xD;
      proximity to pain threshold or a certain reference value in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),&#xD;
      reduces the homogeneity among the exercise programs and hinders the standardization of the&#xD;
      ideal exercise progression when performing the exercises for the management of SIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this clinical trial is to prove the efficacy of a progressive exercise&#xD;
      program based on strength and resistance training in comparison to an exercise protocol from&#xD;
      the literature to increase neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory capacities and improve the&#xD;
      symptoms in subjects with SIS. In addition, we propose to determine the existence or not of&#xD;
      statistically significant differences between treatment modalities by evaluating whether&#xD;
      these changes occur before, during or after the application of the proposed exercise&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will develop an innovator program consisting in the performance of exercises of increasing difficulty, with movements based on functional tests to analyze the subjects' neuromuscular capacities. Participants will attend to 80 individual, face-to-face physiotherapy sessions, including both supervised and semi-supervised monitoring. From the total, a minimum of 15 sessions will be supervised, including 6 sessions to teach and monitor the exercises, and 9 sessions to perform the tests in order to quantify the load; 37 sessions will be semi-supervised, where subjects will perform the exercises independently, but with the presence of an instructor; additionally, the remaining 28 sessions will consist in non-supervised aerobic work at a 70-80% from maximum heart rate, obtained according to the methodology of Tanaka et al.</description>

    <description>This program will be based on a home exercise protocol considering painful sensation and self-perceived stability as progression criteria: regarding pain management, exercises will be planned in a way that increased pain after their performance reverts to before-exercise levels prior to the next session; regarding self-perceived stability, participants will be asked to maintain a constant sensation of joint stability and control during the execution of the exercises. Participants will perform shoulder rotations (external and internal) and abduction up to 30º by using elastic bands. The resistance of the band will be adjusted by the physiotherapist so that participants perceive the exercises as demanding enough but not too unpleasant, being able to complete the 10 repetitions before taking the rest. Likewise, exercises will progress until a maximum of 90º of shoulder abduction.</description>

    <description>This neuromuscular resistance exercise program will be organized in 5 stages, distributing the different phases in 2, 4, 4, 2 and 2 weeks respectively, with a frequency of 3 sessions/week. In addition, 2 weekly sessions of aerobic work with cycloergometer will be developed. The duration of each session will last 30 minutes. The parameters of load and execution speed will be modified as the exercise program progresses along the phases, with the goal of have an impact on the different aspects of the neuromuscular system.</description>
