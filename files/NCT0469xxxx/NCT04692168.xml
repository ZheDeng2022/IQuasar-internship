  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand the strategies for adapting balance in patients who&#xD;
      have received chemotherapy treatment for gynaecological cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy can cause many side effects, including peripheral neuropathies. Peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathies are primarily sensory impairments that can alter the signals for somatosensory&#xD;
      feedback and thus affect the control of balance in the standing position. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy and peripheral neuropathies on static&#xD;
      balance in the standing position. As balance maintenance is a complex construct involving&#xD;
      different systems, this study will evaluate maintenance strategies during sensory&#xD;
      disturbances in order to better understand post-chemotherapy coping strategies. These sensory&#xD;
      disturbances concern vision (eyes closed) and the alteration of the somatosensory system&#xD;
      (foam under the feet and vibration system). In addition, this study will evaluate balance in&#xD;
      double task situations and dynamic balance. Given the consequent impact of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathies on quality of life, a quality of life questionnaire will also be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline : Static upright balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior and three months after chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The static upright balance will be assessed by a force platform. Three 30-second tests will be performed for each test condition. The test conditions are as follows: eyes open, eyes closed, firm surface, soft surface, with vibrator, without vibrator, with dual task. The test position will be standing with the feet 10 cm apart at heel level and 15 cm apart at hallux level, with the arms along the body, fixing a point on the wall at 0.90 cm. Parameters of center of pressure and strength will be recorded at a frequency of 100Hz.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline : Dynamic upright balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior and three months after chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The static upright balance will be assessed by a force platform with the limits of stability test (LOS).The test position will be standing with the feet 10 cm apart at heel level and 15 cm apart at hallux level, with the arms along the body, fixing a computer at a distance of 0.90 cm. Parameters of center of pressure and strength will be recorded at a frequency of 100Hz.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline : score at the Total Neuropathy Score for the presence of peripheral neuropathy</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior and three months after chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical version of the Total Neuropathy Score will be used to evaluate the presence of peripheral neuropathy. A test of superficial sensitivity, vibration sensitivity, reflexes and strength will be carried out. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 24. A score between 0 and 8 indicates mild peripheral neuropathy, between 9 and 16 a moderate peripheral neuropathy and above 17 a severe neuropathy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline : Quality of life assessed by the questionnaire FACT/GOG-NTX</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior and three months after chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT/GOG-NTX was chosen to assess the quality of life. This questionnaire assesses physical well-being, family/social well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and other concern. Participants will have to answer the different statements by ticking the box corresponding to what they feel is adequate between 0 (not at all) and 4 (a lot). The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 152. The higher the score, the better the QOL.</description>
