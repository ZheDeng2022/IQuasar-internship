  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to observe the natural pattern of usage and metabolic&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes who had access to the new digital tool as a&#xD;
      stand-alone support in addition to usual care. The tool is based on self-affirmation theory&#xD;
      and has large emphasis on self-reflection to enable sustainable lifestyle changes. The&#xD;
      changes in HbA1c, reflecting long-term blood glucose, will be evaluated in patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. Patients are compared to controls on usual care not exposed to the tool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considerable evidence suggest that lifestyle changes can prevent or delay the onset of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, and self-care behaviors largely determine HbA1c. Modifiable lifestyle factors have&#xD;
      been established as key drivers of disease onset, progression, and prognosis, motivating the&#xD;
      use of &quot;lifestyle as medicine&quot;. Despite this, a substantial number of patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D) have difficulties attaining adequate glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital health tools are increasingly incorporated into diabetes care, and have the potential&#xD;
      to improve both behavioral and clinical outcomes on a broad basis. However, low levels of&#xD;
      uptake, reduced user engagement over time, and low acceptance among patients, raise concerns&#xD;
      about their effectiveness. Knowledge on how to design interventions aimed at inducing change&#xD;
      by promoting motivation and personal engagement, as well as a better understanding of patient&#xD;
      interaction with digital health interventions, could help overcome these challenges and&#xD;
      inform the development of a novel and effective health support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective or this study is to evaluate a new web-based tool, developed at the University&#xD;
      Gothenburg, Sweden, that aims to support patient autonomy and motivation to make sustainable&#xD;
      lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that individuals with type 2 diabetes in routine&#xD;
      care who have access to the tool get improved HbA1c relative to baseline as compared with&#xD;
      individuals with type 2 diabetes on usual care not exposed to the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an investigator-initiated single-center study conducted at Scania University&#xD;
      Hospital, Sweden, and will follow participants over three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with type 2 diabetes will be recruited by sending letters with study information&#xD;
      to patients with type 2 diabetes in the region. If HbA1c is 52 mmol/mol or above participants&#xD;
      are included and attend study visits at Scania University Hospital every three months during&#xD;
      the first year and every sixth month during the following two years for blood sampling and&#xD;
      physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 3 months, only half of the participants get access to the tool immediately&#xD;
      and the other half remain on usual care (randomized who get access or not). After 3 months,&#xD;
      all participants get access to the tool and used it during an open-label observation period&#xD;
      of up to three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits: Every physical study visit lasts appr. 20 minutes and includes measurements of&#xD;
      length and weight, blood pressure, and estimations of fat and muscle mass by bioimpedance.&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples are taken for analysis of HbA1c and other cardiometabolic proteins.&#xD;
      Participants will not receive any counselling or lifestyle advice at the study visits.&#xD;
      Technical problems are referred to the study coordinator, who may also respond to requests to&#xD;
      clarify content in a general manner without providing personal advice. Patients are followed&#xD;
      by their ordinary physician throughout the study, i.e. the tool is provided on top of&#xD;
      ordinary anti-diabetic treatment and healthcare contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tool: The tool is web-based and used via a computer or mobile phone. It is used at each&#xD;
      individual's preferred pace but participants are recommended to login at least every other&#xD;
      week. Every round the participants choose a themes (out of appr. 80 possible covering e.g.&#xD;
      food, exercise, stress, self-reflection aspects), which takes appr. 15-30 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Participants then reflect on the content and how it could be implemented in daily&#xD;
      life. When returning for next round participants are asked to reflect on any changes done&#xD;
      since last time. There is no interaction between individual participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: The study has two primary endpoints. One primary endpoint is change of HbA1c&#xD;
      between participants with and without access to the tool during the first 3-month period.&#xD;
      Patients lost to follow-up will not be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard deviation of change of HbA1c is 6 mmol/mol over 3 months. With 80% power at&#xD;
      alpha=0.05, 142 participants are needed to each randomization arm to detect a significant&#xD;
      difference between the groups, assuming that the true treatment effect of the intervention is&#xD;
      2 mmol/mol over 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will continue until the required number of participants are reached, accounting&#xD;
      for those lost to follow-up during the randomization period. The participants use the tool at&#xD;
      their own pace but are within the tool recommended to complete a theme at least every other&#xD;
      week to enable implementation of changes and maintain an awareness of the tool and its&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As another primary endpoint, investigators will during the open-label observation period&#xD;
      compare change of HbA1c at one year relative to baseline between patients using the tool as&#xD;
      recommended (at least every other week) and matched controls on usual care (1:2 ratio between&#xD;
      exposed and controls). The controls are matched on gender, age, BMI and HbA1c from existing&#xD;
      clinical registries in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard deviation of DeltaHbA1c is 7 mmol/mol over one year. With 80% power at&#xD;
      alpha=0.05, 24 participants using the tool as recommended and 48 matched controls are needed&#xD;
      to detect a significant difference between the groups, assuming that the true treatment&#xD;
      effect of the intervention is 5 mmol/mol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subanalysis of MOD patients A data-driven cluster analysis of 9,000 diabetes patients has&#xD;
      been performed in the ANDIS registry in Sweden based on six variables measured at diagnosis:&#xD;
      GAD antibodies, age, BMI, HbA1c (reflecting long-term blood glucose), HOMA2-B (reflecting&#xD;
      insulin secretion) and HOMA2-IR (reflecting insulin resistance). Four clusters of T2D&#xD;
      patients were highlighted, each with different characteristics and risk of complications. One&#xD;
      of these cluster, MOD (Mild Obesity-related Diabetes), is characterized by high BMI and&#xD;
      insulin resistance but relatively well-preserved insulin secretion. It has been suggested&#xD;
      that patients with MOD characteristics would benefit particularly from lifestyle changes. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore hypothesize that patients with MOD characteristics would benefit&#xD;
      particularly well from the intervention. As a subanalysis the investigators will analyse the&#xD;
      interaction between MOD/non-MOD subgroup and exposure to the intervention using a linear&#xD;
      model with a term for the cluster variable, a term for the exposure to the intervention and&#xD;
      an interaction term.&#xD;
