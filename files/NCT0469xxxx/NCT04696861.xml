  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of the proposed research are to develop a brief telehealth counseling&#xD;
      intervention to provide support for people living with HIV and experiencing suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, and to support HIV care engagement. The investigators hypothesize that a brief&#xD;
      telehealth counseling intervention will be safe (participants in the clinical trial will not&#xD;
      have increased risk of suicidal behavior), acceptable (high patient retention and&#xD;
      satisfaction, high fidelity), and will demonstrate preliminary efficacy (reduced suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, improved care engagement, improved mental well-being).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      3-session, nurse-delivered telehealth intervention to reduce suicidality and improve HIV care&#xD;
      engagement among adults living with HIV in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. Suicide is a&#xD;
      leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide and mental health&#xD;
      disorders are key contributors to poor HIV care engagement, lower quality of life, higher&#xD;
      transmission risk, and increased mortality among PLWH. Conversely, connecting PLWH with&#xD;
      targeted mental health support improves these critical health outcomes. Telehealth counseling&#xD;
      represents a cost-effective, innovative approach to mental health treatment in low-resource&#xD;
      settings such as Tanzania, with the potential to expediently extend services. The proposed&#xD;
      study will include Aim 1: Identifying the desired characteristics of a telehealth&#xD;
      intervention for suicidality and HIV care engagement in the Tanzanian clinical context, Aim&#xD;
      2: Refining intervention content with support from a local study advisory board in Tanzania,&#xD;
      and Aim 3: Testing the telehealth model in a pilot randomized control trial. Given emerging&#xD;
      evidence for telehealth approaches to improve access to treatment and reduce health&#xD;
      disparities, the intervention has great potential to support NIMH strategic objectives to&#xD;
      address mental health comorbidities and strengthen the HIV care continuum.&#xD;
