  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at how faster aspart reaches and stays in the blood after injection in&#xD;
      Chinese people with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, compared to the reference product&#xD;
      called NovoRapid®. Participants will get both faster aspart and NovoRapid®. The order in&#xD;
      which Participants get them is decided by chance. Participants will get each study medicine&#xD;
      once during the study meaning that they will get a total of 2 injections with study&#xD;
      medicines. The medicine will be injected under the skin of the lower abdomen. The study will&#xD;
      last for about 19-72 days. Participants will have 5 clinic visits with the study doctor&#xD;
      (including the one in which participants give their consent). Participants will need to stay&#xD;
      overnight for 2 of the 5 clinic visits. Participants will have blood samples taken during&#xD;
      some of the clinic visits. During the visits where participants get the study medicines,&#xD;
      samples of their blood will be taken several times for up to 12 hours after getting the study&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
