    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of EUS-guided combination therapy (EUS-guided PSE&#xD;
      + EUS-guided treatment of varices) to EUS-guided treatment of varices alone in cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients with portal hypertension who have developed gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage and&#xD;
      accompanied with hypersplenism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Partial splenic embolization (PSE) was developed in the purpose of managing two common&#xD;
      complications of portal hypertension including variceal bleeding and hypersplenism. The&#xD;
      procedure is normally performed by clinicians engaged in interventional radiology via a&#xD;
      transcatheter embolization method as the successful embolization of the selected splenic&#xD;
      arteries results in devascularization of a focal lesion followed by splenic infarction and&#xD;
      subsequently reducing the splenic contribution to the portal blood flow. Our previous case&#xD;
      study suggests implanting coil in a branch of splenic artery under the endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      (EUS) -guidance followed by the glue injection was an alternative PSE procedure to control&#xD;
      hypersplenism. Recent advance has also heightened the therapeutic aspect of EUS in managing&#xD;
      varices. We have established the novel approach to manage varices and hypersplenism at the&#xD;
      same time by combining EUS-guided PSE and EUS-guided treatment of varices. This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficiency of EUS-guided combination therapy (EUS-guided PSE + EUS-guided&#xD;
      treatment of varices) to EUS-guided treatment of varices alone in cirrhotic patients with&#xD;
      portal hypertension who have developed gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage and accompanied&#xD;
      with hypersplenism.&#xD;

    <description>Efficacy will be measured by rates of successful technique among all performance. Technical success is defined as complete obliteration of the branch of splenic artery and absence of Doppler flow on EUS, and functional success, defined as improved hematologic parameters and the detectable splenic infarction by CT.</description>

    <description>Procedure: EUS-guided injection of coils with cyanoacrylate glue (CYA) and sclerosing agent.&#xD;
First CT scan will be ordered to determine the patient having esophageal and gastric varices and splenomegaly.&#xD;
Complete blood count (CBC) will be ordered to confirm the deficiency of one or more blood cell lines.&#xD;
A standard diagnostic upper endoscopy will be performed in order to classify the varices according to the classification of Sarin and Kumar. Only GOV II and IGV I varices will be included. Once the patient considered as a candidate will be treated with Coils plus CYA and sclerosing agent (Group A).</description>
