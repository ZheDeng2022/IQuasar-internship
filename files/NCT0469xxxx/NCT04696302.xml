  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two phase feasibility study looked at the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial in&#xD;
      the outpatient and inpatient rehab setting exploring how individuals post stroke respond to&#xD;
      different focus of attention cues. Focus of attention refers to whether individuals in are&#xD;
      thinking about how their body is moving, internal focus, or on the effect their body has on&#xD;
      the environment, external focus, during motor task. This trial will specifically look at the&#xD;
      effect focus of attention has on motor performance and learning in individuals post stroke&#xD;
      during lateral seated weight shifting task.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a two phase feasibility study exploring appropriate management, setting,&#xD;
      participants including inclusion and exclusion criteria, attrition rates, protocol, and&#xD;
      retention. Outcome data for each stage were collected during baseline, acquisition,&#xD;
      short-term, and long-term retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were two primary objectives of this two phase feasibility study. The first was to&#xD;
      uncover some potential short comings in research designs used in this area. The second was to&#xD;
      explore the feasibility of a study in both the chronic and acute stroke populations in a&#xD;
      rural community. Topics of feasibility include recruitment, retention, and specific inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. Extending the work by Muckel and Merholz, this feasibility study&#xD;
      examined performance of individuals post stroke during a seated lateral weight shifting task&#xD;
      and incorporated retention trials, quality of movement exploration, and bilateral weight&#xD;
      shifting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase I, individuals in both groups sat unsupported on a hi-lo mat table which was&#xD;
      adjusted so participants were sitting at 90 degrees hip and knee flexion with feet shoulder&#xD;
      width apart. Tape marks were used to mark initial set up ensuring standardized positioning&#xD;
      for each trial. Following baseline trials, all participants watched the same instructional&#xD;
      video describing lateral weight shifting. The instructions included correct mechanics that&#xD;
      should be used when weight shifting laterally with focus on correct form needed for the&#xD;
      movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing included baseline, acquisition, short term retention (5 minutes later), and long-term&#xD;
      retention (7-10 days later). Participants performed three trials of seated weight shifting to&#xD;
      each side at all timepoints. During acquisition, the internal focus group was instructed to&#xD;
      &quot;shift your weight as much as possible towards your right or left hip without using your&#xD;
      arms&quot;. The external focus group sat with targets one arm length away at shoulder height and&#xD;
      were instructed to &quot;shift your body weight as much as possible towards the blue/orange target&#xD;
      without using your arms.&quot; During baseline and retention trials, adults were instructed to&#xD;
      &quot;lean as far as you can to the right/left without using your arms.&quot; During Phase II, the&#xD;
      protocol was similar except 6 trials were performed for acquisition to potentially improve&#xD;
      motor learning, which was not significant in Phase I per retention data. Other changes to the&#xD;
      protocol included allowing participants to move their feet when weight-shifting. Instructions&#xD;
      were also revised. The external focus group was told to &quot;move your shoulder as close to the&#xD;
      blue/orange target as possible&quot;, while the internal focus group was told to &quot;shift your body&#xD;
      weight as much as possible towards your right/left hip without using your arms.&quot;&#xD;
