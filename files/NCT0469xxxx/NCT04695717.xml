  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an extensive, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study that aimed&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the seasonal inactivated, split virion,&#xD;
      trivalent influenza vaccine (IVACFLU-S) in children from 6 months to under 18 years old and&#xD;
      the elderly over 60 years old in Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main target:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the safety of the single or double dose of seasonal influenza vaccine (IVACFLU-S)&#xD;
      in Vietnamese children aged 6 months to 17 years and adults over 60 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the immunogenicity of the seasonal inactivated, split virion, trivalent influenza&#xD;
      vaccine (IVACFLU-S) after 1st injection on day 22 (+7) for groups ≥ 9 years old or day 49&#xD;
      (+7) for groups of 6 months to 8 years for each antigenic component of the vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The seasonal inactivated, split virion, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) were purified by&#xD;
      the method of super centrifugation to create gradient segments in sucrose sugar produced by&#xD;
      IVAC, or placebo produced by IVAC. Vaccines are produced on eggs, inactivated with&#xD;
      formaldehyde. The dose of the vaccine tested was 15 mcg of HA for each antigen component in&#xD;
      0.5 ml. The influenza virus strains used to produce the 2020-2021 seasonal vaccine will also&#xD;
      be provided by the NIBSC, which will be used according to WHO recommendations, which are&#xD;
      expected to include the following Southern Hemisphere strains:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza A / H1N1 strain: Recombinant strain IVR-190 44250 E12 of the strain (A / Brisbane /&#xD;
      02/2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza strain A / H3N2: strain IVR-197 (H3N2) 44850 E14 recombinant strain (A / South&#xD;
      Australia / 34/2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flu strain B (B / Washington / February 2019). Extensive phase 3 was conducted 2 sites:&#xD;
      District Health Center (DHC) of Vu Thu, Thai Binh, Vietnam; and DHC of Binh Luc, Ha Nam.&#xD;
      Subjects were from two age groups: 6 months-under 18 years and over 60 years. Both safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity were assessed&#xD;
