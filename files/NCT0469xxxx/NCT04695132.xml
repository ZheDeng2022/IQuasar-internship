  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of a psychoeducational intervention&#xD;
      program, Illness Management and Recovery (henceforth abbreviated as IMR), when administered&#xD;
      to inpatient forensic mental health patients. IMR is a treatment program that can be&#xD;
      administered in both a group and an individual format. It is designed for persons suffering&#xD;
      from severe mental health problems and has two principal aims: 1. promoting participants´&#xD;
      capacity to manage and alleviate symptoms and functional impairment and 2. helping&#xD;
      participants in formulating and attaining subjectively meaningful recovery goals. Forensic&#xD;
      mental health inpatients receiving this treatment will be compared to patients who receive&#xD;
      treatment as usual on a variety of outcome measures, such as clinician and self-rated levels&#xD;
      of symptoms, function and perceived levels of hope. Furthermore, clinicians' experiences of&#xD;
      working with the intervention will be investigated using a structured questionnaire regarding&#xD;
      implementation processes and through an interview protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 3 objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigating the effects of the treatment on the chosen outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigating the effects of potential moderators on treatment outcome. These moderators&#xD;
           include: pre-treatment functional status measured by self and informant report,&#xD;
           neuropsychological performance and pre-admission indicators of presence of criminogenic&#xD;
           risk factors and everyday functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigating the experiences of staff working with the intervention, through the lense&#xD;
           of Normalization Process Theory.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The plan is to conduct the study through a cluster-randomized approach. Recruitment will take&#xD;
      place amongst inpatients in the Swedish forensic mental health services. The clusters of&#xD;
      patients randomized to the two study conditions will in effect be inpatient forensic mental&#xD;
      health wards at Swedish forensic facilities. Enrolment and randomizing of clusters will take&#xD;
      place stepwise during the duration of the study. Inpatient wards at participating sites will&#xD;
      be randomized to either the control or the active condition and patients at these wards will&#xD;
      be asked to give informed consent before participating in the study. After training, the&#xD;
      staff at these wards will administer IMR to patients during two group sessions and one&#xD;
      individual session a week. The IMR treatment administered consist of 10 chapters containing&#xD;
      information and exercises pertaining to subjects relevant to mental health and recovery, such&#xD;
      as medication use, social support, problem solving, etc. Translation of the original&#xD;
      IMR-manual into Swedish and adaptions to the forensic mental health setting was done with&#xD;
      permission from the original developers and authors of the treatment protocol. Study&#xD;
      participants at control wards will receive treatment as usual. Data collection takes place at&#xD;
      four times during the study (before start of treatment, four months into treatment, post&#xD;
      treatment and during a three month follow-up). During data collection, participants fill in&#xD;
      self-report measurements of symptom levels, functional impairment and perceived hope.&#xD;
      Clinicians with good knowledge of participants also complete informant questionnaires on&#xD;
      perceived levels of patient symptoms and functioning. During the data collection that takes&#xD;
      place before treatment, participants also complete a neuropsychological test (&quot;Zoo park&quot; from&#xD;
      the Behavioral assessment of dysexecutive syndrome, BADS). Anamnestic data pertaining to the&#xD;
      pre-admission functioning and criminal history of the patients in the active condition will&#xD;
      also be collected from the patient files. The data collection mentioned in the previous two&#xD;
      sentences will be done to investigate potential moderators of treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures used in the study are WHODAS 2.0 (World Health Organization Disability&#xD;
      Schedule 2.0 self-report and informant versions), IMRs (Illness management and Recovery&#xD;
      treatment scale, self-report and informant versions), HoNOS-S (Health of Nation Outcome&#xD;
      Scale-Secure version) and ASHS (Adult State Hope Scale). During the data collection four&#xD;
      months into treatment, only IMRs and ASHS is completed, whereas all outcome scales are&#xD;
      completed during the other data collection points. During the data collection post-treatment,&#xD;
      treatment participants also complete CSQ-8 (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiences of the staff administrating the treatment also will be investigated, with the&#xD;
      purpose of exploring the process of implementing the intervention in this setting. This will&#xD;
      be done using the Swedish version of the NoMAD-questionnaire (Normalization Process Theory&#xD;
      Measure), which is a tool developed to operationalize the theoretical framework of&#xD;
      Normalization Process Theory. The staff will complete this questionnaire after receiving&#xD;
      training in the intervention, three months after treatment commencement and during a&#xD;
      follow-up a year after treatment commencement. During the latter two of these data collection&#xD;
      points staff will also be interviewed in a semi-structured fashion, using the questions in&#xD;
      the NoMAD-questionnaire as a starting point for collection of more in depth qualitative data&#xD;
      on the implementation of IMR. The part of the study pertaining to staff experiences of&#xD;
      working with IMR are exploratory in character and we do not consider NoMAD to be a measure of&#xD;
      treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, certain anamnestic data and neuropsychological performance (measured by&#xD;
      the Zoo-map subtest), will be collected and analyzed as potential moderators of treatment&#xD;
      outcome. The pre-treatment self and informant-report of everyday functioning (measured by&#xD;
      WHODAS 2.0) will also be analyzed as a potential moderator of treatment effects on the other&#xD;
      outcome measures. Of special interest in this regard will be discrepancies between the&#xD;
      participants´ self reported functional status (assessed by WHODAS 2.0 self report) and other&#xD;
      measures of functional status (informant version of WHODAS 2.0, performance on the Zoo&#xD;
      map-test and anamnestic indicators of functioning). This interest is motivated by previous&#xD;
      research indicating that overestimation of own abilities play a part in predicting outcomes&#xD;
      for schizophrenia spectrum patients.&#xD;

    <description>S-NoMAD is a measure developed to measure different aspects of implementation processes within the healthcare sector according to how those processes are conceptualised within Normalization Process Theory. The scale covers the four core constructs of implementation work postulated within Normalization Process Theory (Coherence, Cognitive Participation, Collective Action, Reflexive Monitoring). This measure is administered to staff at wards where IMR is implemented. The purpose of this is to explore staff experiences of working with IMR. During this assessment point, participants also complete a semi-structured group interview based on a qualitative expansion of the S-NoMAD.</description>

    <description>The Illness Management and Recovery treatment programme is a psychosocial treatment aimed at attaining illness management skills and promoting a sense of personal recovery amongst patients with serious mental illness. The original treatment protocol has been translated to Swedish and adapted to a forensic mental health setting. The treatment consists of ten chapters containing information and practical exercises relating to topics relevant for mental health and mental health recovery. These topics include medication use, stress reduction, problem solving, recovery goals and navigating the forensic mental health system. Participants are assigned practical homework and tasks to be completed outside of treatment sessions. Group sessions are conducted to present and discuss treatment material. Individual sessions are used to rehearse treatment content, personalize the treatment and review progress in achieving tasks agreed upon in the group setting.</description>
