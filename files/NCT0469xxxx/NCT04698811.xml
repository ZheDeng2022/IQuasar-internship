      The objetictive is to observe the influence of the enneagram typology on the perception of&#xD;
      anxiety, stress and quality of life through self-knowledge directed in a virtual learning&#xD;
      environment. The study is a clinical, primary, analytical, prospective and longitudinal&#xD;
      study. It will be carried out in a virtual learning environment (VLE) with the collection of&#xD;
      data obtained before and after the beginning of the training on the enneagram. The training&#xD;
      will be divided into three online AVA modules. Casuistry: after orientations and signature of&#xD;
      the term (Informed Consent Form), they will register on social networks where the initial&#xD;
      information will be filled out. to outline the group. Inclusion criteria: participants of&#xD;
      both sexes, Brazilians, over 18 years old; agree to sign the Informed Consent Form; with the&#xD;
      desire to realize self-knowledge with the availability of time and access to the internet to&#xD;
      hold meetings; Non-inclusion criteria: do not have previous information about the enneagram&#xD;
      and speak the Portuguese language; Exclusion criteria: participation in work at any time;&#xD;
      Individuals who have missed the modules and do not do the replacement later. Instruments:&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION - Personality is the set of characteristics that define the individual's&#xD;
      behavior, his relationship with the external world and his way of reacting to the events that&#xD;
      occur in it. Personality is closely related to the development of pathological processes, the&#xD;
      integrity of your biological tissues and the repercussions that this can cause in your lives.&#xD;
      In addition, there is a relationship with levels of anxiety, stress and quality of life. The&#xD;
      enneagram is a tool that groups personalities into nine types, identifies their functioning&#xD;
      patterns and reaction mechanisms. The use is quite widespread today, but still in an&#xD;
      empirical way, requiring a greater scientific basis. OBJECTIVE - to observe the influence of&#xD;
      the enneagram typology on the perception of anxiety, stress and quality of life through&#xD;
      self-knowledge directed in a virtual learning environment. METHODS: clinical, primary,&#xD;
      analytical, prospective and longitudinal study. It will be carried out in a virtual learning&#xD;
      environment (VLE) with the collection of data obtained before and after the beginning of the&#xD;
      training on the enneagram. The training will be divided into three online AVA modules.&#xD;
      Casuistry: after orientations and signature of the term (Informed Consent Form), they will&#xD;
      register on social networks where the initial information will be filled out. to outline the&#xD;
      group. Inclusion criteria: participants of both sexes, Brazilians, over 18 years old; agree&#xD;
      to sign the Informed Consent Form; with the desire to realize self-knowledge with the&#xD;
      availability of time and access to the internet to hold meetings; Non-inclusion criteria: do&#xD;
      not have previous information about the enneagram and speak the Portuguese language;&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: participation in work at any time; Individuals who have missed the&#xD;
      modules and do not do the replacement later. Instruments: World Health Organization Quality&#xD;
      of Life - (WHOQOL-BREF). Stress Perception Scale 10 (EPS-10) The Trait-State Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory: STAI E and T. After the guidance and signature of the ICF, the Organizational&#xD;
      Learning Structure will be presented Statistical Analysis: The data will be tabulated in&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel 2016 and measures will be used central tendency for quantitative variables&#xD;
      and absolute and relative frequency for categorical variables. Pearson's correlation&#xD;
      analysis; multiple regression analysis and Wilcoxon test. The product resulting from this&#xD;
      work will be the Enneagram Online Teaching and Research System (Sep9). KEYWORDS: Personality.&#xD;

After reading and accepting the informed consent form, the initial information for the design of the group will be filled out. The activities will be applied to a minimum group of 135 people. If the number of registrants qualified for the study does not reach 135 individuals, the registration period will be extended by 15 days in order to complete the sample.
