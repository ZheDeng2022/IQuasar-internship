  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dearth of Intensive care units in low resource settings portends for poor outcomes&#xD;
      amongst patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) . To our knowledge, the&#xD;
      effect of CPAP and HFNC on major outcomes has not been assessed in adults with AHRF in&#xD;
      resource-limited settings. The aim of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      trial is to determine whether High-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula (HFNC) or Continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) system can reduce mortality among patients with acute&#xD;
      hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in a limited resource setting (without intensive care&#xD;
      units, trained staff or mechanical ventilators) as compared with standard low flow oxygen&#xD;
      therapy?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The care for the critically ill patient typically takes place in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU). ICU care is quite expensive, even in resource rich countries. The most common reason&#xD;
      for ICU admission globally is respiratory support for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure&#xD;
      (AHRF). In patients with AHRF, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation is associated&#xD;
      with high mortality, especially in low income countries (LICs), given the scarce availability&#xD;
      of invasive mechanical ventilation. Some studies suggest that administration of ventilatory&#xD;
      support through a mask may be effective in resource-limited settings. However, there is no&#xD;
      clinical study data in adults to support this evidence. Human and material constraints are&#xD;
      major barriers for the care of critically-ill patients in resource limited settings ,&#xD;
      advocating the need for a frugal approach. Furthermore, the scarcity of intensive care unit&#xD;
      care in LICs contributes to a high mortality among acutely ill patients. The current corona&#xD;
      virus pandemic has further highlighted the need for frugal acute care interventions in LICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a simple to use and affordable technique for&#xD;
      noninvasive ventilatory support. High-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula (HFNC) may also&#xD;
      offer an alternative in patients with hypoxemia. The high flow rates may also decrease&#xD;
      physiological dead space by flushing expired carbon dioxide from the upper airway, a process&#xD;
      that potentially explains the observed decrease in the work of breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frugal CPAP or HFNC , as compared with standard oxygen therapy, could reduce the mortality&#xD;
      among adults presenting with AHRF in a resource-limited setting.&#xD;
