  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are the most common orofacial pain disorders of non-dental&#xD;
      origin with the prevalence of 6.1-10.2%, and incidence of 3.9%. Observable pathology is&#xD;
      mostly absent, and the etiology often remains unknown. Since some other painful conditions of&#xD;
      unknown origin (eg. fibromyalgia), also imply genetic factors, the aim of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate genetic predisposition in relation to the risk for TMD onset. This will be&#xD;
      achieved through analysis of polymorphisms in the selected genes in TMD patients (DC/TMD) and&#xD;
      matched control subjects. The possibility of involvement of specific polymorphisms in&#xD;
      modulation of therapy response will also be investigated. The hypotheses: (I) the Single&#xD;
      Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) clustering will be dependent on presence or absence of TMD&#xD;
      (comparison of patients with control subjects), and will possibly depend on source of pain,&#xD;
      pain intensity, presence of bone changes, psychological features and previous orthodontic&#xD;
      therapy, and (II) SNPs will influence the treatment response. Along with anamnestic and&#xD;
      clinical examination and occlusal splint therapy, genomic DNA will be analyzed from the&#xD;
      buccal swabs. Isolated DNA will be used for the determination of 19 polymorphisms of selected&#xD;
      genes using Real-Time PCR method. The analysis of salivary oxidative stress markers and&#xD;
      opiorphin will be also performed, as their relationship with TMD has been shown previously.&#xD;
      This time, their concentration will be associated with polymorphisms in the promoters of&#xD;
      genes responsible for their synthesis. The investigators expect to show that particular gene&#xD;
      profile or group of SNPs represent a risk factor for TMD development. Innovative approach of&#xD;
      the concept of determining the genetic predisposition for TMD has the potential for&#xD;
      development of commercial genetic test with potential for risk estimation in relation to TMD&#xD;
      onset. This could enable early interventions and active avoidance of environmental risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline characteristic pain intensity at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6th month</time_frame>
    <description>The characteristic pain intensity (part of Graded Chronic Pain Scale, GCPS) compute mean of items (pain right now, worst pain, average pain), and multiply by 10.&#xD;
Each item ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline spontaneous pain at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6th month</time_frame>
    <description>For evaluation of spontaneous pain from the temporomandibular joint and the masticatory muscles a 100 mm horizontal Visual analogue scale (VAS) is used. Visual analogue scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline range of mouth opening at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6th month</time_frame>
    <description>The pain-free opening is defined as the maximum amount that a patient achieves by opening the mouth without feeling pain and is measured as the distance between the incisal edges of the upper and lower central incisors.&#xD;
Maximum unassisted mouth opening is measured as the distance between the maxillary and mandibular central incisors and defined as the largest amount of opening that a patient can achieve regardless of pain and discomfort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline anxiety at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6th month</time_frame>
    <description>the General anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) (a 7-question questionnaire that assesses the severity of respondents' anxiety symptoms) is used for assessing the severity of anxiety symptoms of the participants. Scale ranges fro 0 to 21, with higher scores mean a worse outcome. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut-points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline depression at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6th month</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is used for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 27, with cut-points 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively.</description>
