  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it is evaluated the effects of laser assisted new attachment procedure (LANAP)&#xD;
      and low level laser therapy (LLLT) and on clinical, biochemical and radiographic parameters&#xD;
      in addition to non-surgical periodontal treatment (NSPT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a randomized-controlled, single-blind and parallel design&#xD;
      consisting of 80 patients with chronic periodontitis. Study consists of 4 groups, with 20&#xD;
      patients in each group. Group 1 received only NSPT, Group 2 received NSPT+LANAP, Group 3&#xD;
      received NSPT+LLLT, and Group 4 received NSPT+LANAP+LLLT. Clinical measurements of patients&#xD;
      and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were taken before treatment and after 1 and 3 months. In&#xD;
      GCF, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor were analyzed.&#xD;
      Standard periapical radiographs were taken for radiographic measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In moderate (4-6 mm) and deep pockets (7 mm and above), it was found that all groups treated&#xD;
      with laser significantly decrease pocket depth (PD) and clinic attachment level (CAL)&#xD;
      compared to Group 1. Group 3 caused significantly less gingival recession than all other&#xD;
      groups. There was no statistical difference between the groups in biochemical markers.&#xD;
      Radiographic analysis revealed that only Group 2 achieved significant bone filling compared&#xD;
      to Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bot LANAP and LLLT application in the deep pockets provide an additional contribution to&#xD;
      NSPT. It has been found that LLLT administration leads to decrease in PD by creating a&#xD;
      minimum recession.&#xD;
