  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous monocentric experiences have already highlighted the role of preoperative cardiac&#xD;
      imaging, in particular of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and tomography (CT), in improving&#xD;
      the ablation results of scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT). A better characterization&#xD;
      of scar obtained with high quality CMR images and post processing data with creation of maps&#xD;
      exploring the heart in concentric layers from the endocardium to the epicardium could allow a&#xD;
      personalized and more precise approach to this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study - Evaluating the feasibility and possible benefit of CMR-guided ablative&#xD;
      approach (group 1: ablation of the &quot;anatomical&quot; channels of heterogeneous tissue within the&#xD;
      scar) compared to CMR-aided approach (group 2: ablation of the &quot;electrical&quot; conduction&#xD;
      channels within the scar) and standard approach (group 3: ablation guided by an&#xD;
      electro-anatomical system without the aid of CMR) in a multi-center Tuscan study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What would add the project to what we know - The achievement of the objectives by the project&#xD;
      would allow to propose a personalized ablation on the basis of the scar characterization and&#xD;
      would allow a better efficacy, efficiency of the procedure and probably also a safer&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;

      State of the art and preliminary data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with structural heart disease (SHD) are at increased risk of VAs that can promote&#xD;
      life-threatening events, for whom a proper treatment has a pivotal role. The use of&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic drugs is limited due to their ineffectiveness in reducing related mortality or&#xD;
      their common side effects. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) can improve survival&#xD;
      in a certain group of patients with SHD, but recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) needing&#xD;
      ICD shocks reduce quality of life and probably patients survival. Moreover, ICD implant is&#xD;
      affected by a noticeable risk of acute and chronic complications, that can reduce the&#xD;
      survival of ICD recipient. Catheter ablation is an effective technique especially for the&#xD;
      management of post-myocardial infarction ventricular tachycardia (post-myocardial infarction&#xD;
      VT) and the recent VANISH trial showed that ablation reduced the composite primary outcome of&#xD;
      death, VT storm or appropriate ICD shocks compared to patients with an escalation of&#xD;
      amiodarone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of a catheter in the ventricular chambers through a vascular access, allows&#xD;
      to map the VT circuit that is usually inside the scar, and perform an ablation of the tissue&#xD;
      responsible of the VAs substrate. The signals recorded by the catheter and the fluoroscopy&#xD;
      images have been used to localize the target since 90s, but in the last decade the emergence&#xD;
      of technological innovations, such as three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping (3D-EAM), has&#xD;
      enhanced our ability to identify ablation targets. Three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping&#xD;
      enables to generate a 3D reconstruction of any part of the heart without needing fluoroscopic&#xD;
      navigation. Integration between anatomic and electrocardiographic (ECG) data it is very&#xD;
      useful in choosing an optimal location for VA ablation, and the use of mapping systems&#xD;
      contributed to reduce procedural, fluoroscopy and radiofrequency time. However, the efficacy&#xD;
      of 3D-EAM can be suboptimal when we decide to follow a strategy of substrate ablation.&#xD;
      Substrate ablation is characterized by an ablation of abnormal electrograms (EGMs) identified&#xD;
      during sinus rhythm or ventricular pacing. In a recent meta-analysis, the combined risk of&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmia recurrence and all-cause mortality during long-term follow-up was&#xD;
      lower when using a substrate-based approach compared to standard ablation of stable VT.&#xD;
      However, efficacy was greatly reduced if the homogenization of the arrhythmic substrate was&#xD;
      incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time integration of anatomical VT substrate from data coming from cardiac image such as&#xD;
      cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and multidetector computed tomography (CT) with EAM seems to&#xD;
      improve efficacy of VA radiofrequency ablations and use of scar integration from imaging was&#xD;
      an independent predictors of VT-free survival after catheter ablation in post-MI VT in recent&#xD;
      papers. However, integration of CMR and CT images in the EAM system hasn't allowed to avoid,&#xD;
      until now, an EAM that is time consuming, often imprecise and allowing only an incomplete&#xD;
      substrate modification. Based on this consideration, we thought that an image integration&#xD;
      taking into account not only the location of scar, but also its quantification and&#xD;
      characterization could increase the efficiency of the ablation procedure, with an improvement&#xD;
      of acute and chronic outcome. For this purpose, CMR has a pivotal role, allowing at&#xD;
      characterizing the scar tissue via color-coded pixel signal intensity (PSI) maps that have a&#xD;
      high correlation with the electroanatomic maps obtained during the ablation procedures.&#xD;
      Particularly, the VT isthmuses found with the EAM correlated with the presence of&#xD;
      heterogeneous tissue channels (HTCs) depicted in the PSI maps. Previous experiences&#xD;
      demonstrated that these PSI maps can be imported in the navigation system to help substrate&#xD;
      ablation, but only if they are obtained from high spatial resolution late gadolinium&#xD;
      enhancement (LGE)-CMR images. One recent publication showed that CMR-aided scar dechanneling&#xD;
      was associated with a lower need for ablation delivery, higher non-inducibility rates after&#xD;
      substrate ablation, and reduced VT recurrences in the follow-up. In brief, in this experience&#xD;
      the target ablation sites were the conducting channels (CC) entrances (i.e. entrances of VT&#xD;
      isthmuses) identified in the substrate EAM, but PSI maps integrated into the navigation&#xD;
      system were used to focus on specific regions of the scar. The authors found 23% of false&#xD;
      negative (CCs evidence outside the HTCs entrances) and 16% of false positives (HTCs only&#xD;
      identified in PSI maps). The HTCs identified only in the PSI maps, without matching with a CC&#xD;
      on the EAM, were not targeted for ablation. Very recently, the same group presented results&#xD;
      about a possible improvement of the outcome (particularly the efficiency, but probably with&#xD;
      extension to efficacy and safety) using a CMR guided ablation, targeting only the HCTs (all&#xD;
      of them). However, both experiences with CMR aided and guided ablation had been performed&#xD;
      with a retrospective design and in a single-centre high volume laboratory, and for this&#xD;
      reason we don't know the potential application of this technique in the real world of&#xD;
      clinical electrophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We sought to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, safety and efficiency of a VT ablation&#xD;
      guided or aided by CMR in comparison with VT ablation guided only by EAM (standard approach&#xD;
      nowadays).&#xD;
&#xD;
      General goal of the Project&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims at developing a network between Tuscany centres for scar-related VT&#xD;
      ablation, based on an accurate patients' selection, an anatomic substrate definition with&#xD;
      radiomics, a qualitative analysis of the radiomic data via an artificial intelligence with a&#xD;
      cardiac shell reconstruction that will be used in the electrophysiological laboratory to&#xD;
      tailor a specific and personalized ablation procedure. To test whether this tailored approach&#xD;
      could improve our clinical approach we built the following experimental design. Briefly,&#xD;
      patients with VT arriving at each hospital of the consortium from either emergency room,&#xD;
      outpatient clinic, or other hospitals, will be evaluated for SHD. Patients with confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of SHD can be enrolled in the study and will be further evaluated to determine&#xD;
      whether there are no contraindications to CMR. If they have contraindications to CMR or CMR&#xD;
      images are suboptimal the patients will undergo EAM-guided VT ablation, vice versa they will&#xD;
      be randomized to a CMR-guided or -aided ablation. Data obtained from LGE-CMR will be&#xD;
      processed with the ADAS-VT software (Galgo Medical, Barcelona, Spain), an artificial&#xD;
      intelligence suite used to create a 3D multi-layer map of the ventricular wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end, we will have 3 groups for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: patients undergoing CMR guided VT ablation (ablation focused only on HTCs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: patients undergoing CMR aided VT ablation (ablation focused only on CCs on EAM,&#xD;
           but with integration of CMR derived shell in the map and with scar projection (with HTCs&#xD;
           on the EAM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 (control): patients with contraindication to CMR (or poor-quality images deemed&#xD;
           unsuitable for further analysis) undergoing EAM-guided VT ablation without any CMR data&#xD;
           about scar (core and border zone)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the feasibility and possible benefit of CMR-guided ablative approach (group 1:&#xD;
      ablation of the &quot;anatomical&quot; channels of heterogeneous tissue within the scar) compared to&#xD;
      CMR-aided approach (group 2: ablation of the &quot;electrical&quot; conduction channels within the&#xD;
      scar) and standard approach (group 3: ablation guided by an electro-anatomical system without&#xD;
      the aid of CMR) in a multi-centre Tuscan study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective (see after)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective (see after)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design (see after)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      103 patients with VT in patients with SHD will be recruited in 7 Tuscan hospitals&#xD;
      participating in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional network of hospitals including tertiary centres with an electrophysiology team of&#xD;
      qualified investigators/physicians with proven experience in performing ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria (see after)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria (see after)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients enrolled without satisfied inclusion criteria or in presence of exclusion&#xD;
           criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Procedure endpoints Acute success will be defined as non-inducibility of any sustained&#xD;
      monomorphic VT at the end of the procedure. Partial success will be considered with the&#xD;
      clinical VT successfully ablated with other monomorphic VTs remaining inducible. Pre-ablation&#xD;
      inducibility is not be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device programming&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients involved in the study, regardless of Group allocation, will have their ICD&#xD;
      programmed following 2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS expert consensus statement on optimal ICD&#xD;
      programming, following the manufacturer specific recommendations about therapy and detection&#xD;
      in patients where VT cycle is known, alongside any anti-bradycardia setting necessary for&#xD;
      therapeutic needs. Particularly, the VT zone with lower rate detection should be set at 10-20&#xD;
      ipm slower than the clinical VT to guarantee a good sensitivity in recurrences diagnosis and&#xD;
      therapy should be programmed in order to reduce unnecessary shocks. 26&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients involved in the study will be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs and any other&#xD;
      medical therapy considered standard of care for the SHD and VT. Particularly, use of&#xD;
      amiodarone is allowed at enrollment but is strongly suggested to stop it at 1 month&#xD;
      follow-up, if not contraindicated, to avoid drug-related toxicity and not to confound trial&#xD;
      results about primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      No extra risks appear to be related to study participation. Risks are related to the&#xD;
      procedure itself, which is explained on the informed consent sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to preprocedural CMR imaging, patients assigned to both interventional groups (1 and&#xD;
      2) could benefit from potentially shorter procedures and lower radiological exposure with&#xD;
      shorter fluoroscopy time. Patients assigned to Group 2 will benefit from an overall shorter&#xD;
      EAM acquisition phase, given the fact that the area of interest will be determined by CMR-LGE&#xD;
      data. Due to the complete absence of EAM, patients assigned to Group 1 could benefit from&#xD;
      even smaller procedural time and radiological exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, patients assigned to CMR-guided ablation (group 1) and CMR-aided ablation (group 2)&#xD;
      could benefit from improved VT substrate identification. CMR-derived PSI maps could improve&#xD;
      CC entrance localization compared to the standard technique based on the voltage map obtained&#xD;
      from EAM. We anticipate that improved scar definition and CC entrance localization could lead&#xD;
      to a significant improvement in substrate elimination, and, ultimately, to better acute and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes. The ablation at HTCs entrance in group 1 could improve acute efficacy&#xD;
      compared to the other groups, as showed by recent unpublished data (Soto Iglesias et al. JACC&#xD;
      EP 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will conclude with the 12-months follow-up of the last enrolled patients (see&#xD;
      sample size), and each patient with 12-months follow-up will exit from the study. Patients&#xD;
      will have the possibility to exit from the study at any time they decide without any&#xD;
      explanation about it. Principal investigator will have the ultimate authority to stop the&#xD;
      trial at any time of enrollment if any harms emerge during trial conduction. Once the study&#xD;
      is completed, principal investigator or delegate will notify the site of closeout and a study&#xD;
      closeout visit will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoint (see after)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any variables evaluated as study endpoint (see above) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate potential differences between different interventional approaches in&#xD;
      health-related quality of life changes, the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) will be&#xD;
      administered at baseline (before ablation) and at the 12-months follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up (FU) will include outpatient clinic visits at 1, 6 and 12 months after the&#xD;
      ablation procedure. If no contraindications, amiodarone (if used) should be stopped at the&#xD;
      1-month FU visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all follow up visits, the following parameters and information will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 lead surface ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transthoracic echocardiography (at 6 and 12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICD interrogation, analyzing any event marked as VT or VF by the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VT recurrence will be defined as any documented sustained VT (more than 30 s) or appropriate&#xD;
      ICD therapy at ICD check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess changes in health-related quality of life, the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)&#xD;
      will be administered at the 12-months follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size To test the primary hypothesis, 103 patients will be necessary with 80% power and&#xD;
      5% type 1 error, considering 50% of group 1-2 (low risk), 50% of group 3 (high risk), 16% of&#xD;
      likelihood of VT recurrences at 12 months in low risk patients and 44% of likelihood in high&#xD;
      risk patients with HR (high risk/low risk of recurrences ) of 2,75 (Cox PH, 2 sided&#xD;
      equality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred to or directly evaluated at one of the participating centres for VT&#xD;
      will be screened for ablation and for study participation. The presence of structural heart&#xD;
      disease will be evaluated on the basis of past medical history and available imaging carried&#xD;
      out during patient evaluation, such as echocardiography, cardiac CT, or previous CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment procedure - Recruitment and agenda&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participant centres are referral centres for VT ablation within their health care&#xD;
      network. All patients who give informed consent for participation and fulfill the inclusion&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be consecutively enrolled. We expect to include all the patients&#xD;
      within a 2-years period. The 12-month follow-up information of the last included patient&#xD;
      should be available approximately 3 years after the first inclusion. A monthly assessment of&#xD;
      screening database will be performed in order to increase the enrollment procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients deemed suitable for CMR according to comorbidities, device MRI-compatibility and&#xD;
      willingness to undergo the examination, will be randomly allocated to groups 1 and 2.&#xD;
      Patients eligible to join the study but unsuitable for CMR or with poor CMR images will be&#xD;
      assigned to Group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed in patients undergoing CMR (Groups 1 and 2) in 1:1 fashion&#xD;
      using the app &quot;Randomizer for Clinical Trial Lite&quot; or equivalent web-based platform. The&#xD;
      scientific coordinator of the study or a delegate should be the unique responsible of&#xD;
      randomization and will be contacted upon all new recruitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blindness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blindness of patients is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine baseline analysis, clinical visit, 12 lead ECG, transthoracic echocardiography,&#xD;
      transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiac CT, CMR (if possible), VT ablation. Patients will&#xD;
      be hospitalized for the ablation procedure and may undergo any clinical, imaging or lab&#xD;
      examination considered necessary for clinical management during their stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator or delegate is responsible of the data collection on the&#xD;
      electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). The principal investigator or delegate will review all&#xD;
      the data on the eCRFs and will sign to verify he has reviewed the data collected. Original&#xD;
      anonymized paper support forms will be stored in a secure place and manner at each&#xD;
      participating centre. Anonymization codes will be stored in a safely manner by the local&#xD;
      principal investigator. Access to the online study data (eCRFs) will be restricted through&#xD;
      passwords. In addition, centre coordinators will only have access to their own centre's data.&#xD;
      Paper files will be physically stored until 5 years after the completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source documents shall be created and maintained by the investigation site team throughout&#xD;
      the clinical investigation. The data reported on the eCRFs shall be derived from, and be&#xD;
      consistent with, these source documents, and any discrepancies shall be explained in writing.&#xD;
      The eCRFs shall be signed and dated by the principal investigator or a delegated&#xD;
      investigator. Any change or correction to data reported on a paper CRF shall be dated,&#xD;
      initialed and explained if necessary, and shall not obscure the original entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traceability of documents and data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator shall ensure accuracy, completeness, legibility and timeliness of the data&#xD;
      reported to the principal investigator on the eCRFs and in all required reports. When copies&#xD;
      of the original source document as well as print outs of original electronic source documents&#xD;
      are retained, these shall be signed and dated by a member of the investigational site team&#xD;
      with a statement that it is a true reproduction of the original source document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol deviation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A protocol deviation is defined as a situation in which there is a non-compliance with the&#xD;
      protocol. The following situations are considered protocol deviations and must be&#xD;
      appropriately documented:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient assigned to Group 1 or 2 and with a good quality CMR is not treated in his&#xD;
           predefined group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient assigned to control group undergo good quality CMR, which is used to plan&#xD;
           ablation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient assigned to control group undergo good quality CMR and eventually a CMR-guided&#xD;
           or aided ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Amiodarone is not discontinued at 1 month Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. ICD is not programmed following guidelines, as previously stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient without SHD, or in presence of other exclusion criteria, is enrolled in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will be required to adhere to the investigational plan, signed investigator's&#xD;
      agreement, applicable national or local, laws and regulations, and any conditions required by&#xD;
      the appropriate Ethics Committees or applicable regulatory authorities. The reporting of all&#xD;
      the deviations will be performed through the electronic case report form (e-CRF) application.&#xD;
      In the event of repeated protocol deviation as determined by the principal investigator, a&#xD;
      clinical research associate or clinical representative will attempt to secure compliance by&#xD;
      one or more of the following actions: 1) contacting the investigator by telephone, or 2)&#xD;
      contacting the investigator in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      All applicable statistical tests will be 2-sided and will be performed using a 5%&#xD;
      significance level. Continuous variables will be reported as mean ± standard deviation, or&#xD;
      median (range or interquartile range if data are skewed) if not normally distributed; these&#xD;
      variables will be compared using Student's t-test if normally distributed, Aspin-Welch test&#xD;
      if normally distributed with unequal variance demonstrated using Variance-ratio F-test, or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test if not normally distributed. Categorical variables will be expressed as&#xD;
      total number (percentage) and will be compared by chi-squared test. As far as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint, data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Survival free&#xD;
      from ventricular arrhythmia, will be evaluated using a time-to-first-event analysis with the&#xD;
      Logrank test and the Kaplan-Meier cumulative event rate. A multivariable Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazards model will be performed to investigate the effects of baseline characteristics in&#xD;
      predicting ablation results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event: any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant that does not&#xD;
      necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reaction: any untoward or unintended response to an investigational therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse event: any untoward medical occurrence that&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  May have caused a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event registration and causal relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events judged by an investigator as having a reasonal possibility of a causal&#xD;
      relationship to an investigational therapy would qualify as an adverse reaction. The&#xD;
      expression &quot;reasonable causal relationship&quot; means to convey, in general, that there is&#xD;
      evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse event will be stored in the eCRF and reported to the principal investigator, the&#xD;
      local Institution Review Board and the Ethics Committee according to the ICH Guideline for&#xD;
      Clinical Safety Data Management and the 2016 EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995 Guideline for good&#xD;
      clinical practice E6(R2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will receive government funding from the only sponsor Regione Toscana according&#xD;
      to the &quot;Bando Ricerca Salute 2018 - D.D n.975, 16/1/2020&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of the sponsor (Tuscan region)&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Regional Law 20/2009 the research project has already undergone initial&#xD;
      evaluation and approval by the sponsor and will undergo further scrutiny during the&#xD;
      preliminary phase, during enrollment and after study completion. Technical financial reports&#xD;
      will be filed to the sponsor mid-enrollment and upon study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will not play any role in patient selection and trial management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Trials insurance will provide protection for the sponsors/organisers of clinical trials,&#xD;
      covering their legal liability to pay compensation in the event of an injury to a trial&#xD;
      participant. The coverage of insurance cost is included in the budget of the funding received&#xD;
      from the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation will be monitored by reviewing the e-CRF submitted by the&#xD;
      investigators. The following activities will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All e-CRFs will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy upon receipt by the principal&#xD;
           investigator or delegate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator (co-investigator) and/or delegate will be contacted by the principal&#xD;
           investigator regarding any missing or unclear data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be conducted after 12 month since the first patient enrollment to&#xD;
      evaluate the enrollment rate, the initial results and other factors which reflect the overall&#xD;
      progress and integrity of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical committee for Data Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitoring of data accuracy will be performed by principal investigator or delegate as&#xD;
      previously stated (see review of data). No external clinical committee are considered for&#xD;
      this task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any modifications to the protocol which may impact on the conduct of the study, potential&#xD;
      benefit of the patient or may affect patient safety, including changes of study objectives,&#xD;
      study design, patient population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant&#xD;
      administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Any amendment to the&#xD;
      protocol will be notified to the Ethical Committee, to the sponsor and to all participating&#xD;
      centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and Disseminations&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is in line with the standard ethic principles for clinic research and good&#xD;
      clinical practice according to the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management and the&#xD;
      2016 EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995 Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2), and must be reviewed&#xD;
      and approved by the local institutional review board (IRB) of each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any subject admitted as outpatient or inpatient at one the participating centres diagnosed&#xD;
      with VT will be scrutinized for study participation. Patients deemed suitable to join the&#xD;
      trial according to eligibility criteria will be asked informed consent for study enrolment.&#xD;
      Patients willing to participate and diagnosed with SHD will be assigned to a Group according&#xD;
      to protocol. Patients under 18 will not be screened according to eligibility criteria.&#xD;
      Patients permanently or temporarily lacking legal capacity will not be screened. Patients&#xD;
      eligible to join an interventional Group (1 and 2) will be randomized within 1 month since&#xD;
      study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study-related information will be stored securely at the study site up to 7 years after&#xD;
      the end of the study. All participant information will be stored in locked file cabinets in&#xD;
      areas with limited access. All laboratory specimens, reports, data collection, process, and&#xD;
      administrative forms will be identified by a coded ID number only to maintain participant&#xD;
      confidentiality. All records that contain names or other personal identifiers, such as&#xD;
      locator forms and informed consent forms, will be stored separately from study records&#xD;
      identified by code number. All local databases will be secured with password-protected access&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflicts of interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Berruezo is a stockholder in Galgo Medical SL and has received financial support from&#xD;
      Siemens Healthcare. The other authors have no other relevant affiliations or financial&#xD;
      involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial&#xD;
      conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the study apart from those&#xD;
      disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After beginning of the project and financial coverage by the Tuscany region, other&#xD;
      investigators will be defined (personnel with fixed-term employment relationships&#xD;
      specifically hired for the project) for data management, study monitoring and Core Lab&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data property&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Principal Investigators will have direct access to their own site's data sets and may&#xD;
      access to other sites' data only by request. To ensure confidentiality, data dispersed to&#xD;
      project team members will be blinded of any identifying participant information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination policy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will be released to the participating physicians, referring physicians,&#xD;
      patients and the general medical community during medical congresses or through publication,&#xD;
      expected after the end of follow-up. The principal investigator of the coordinating centre of&#xD;
      the study will take the decision to submit the report for publication and will have ultimate&#xD;
      authority over all the activities.&#xD;
