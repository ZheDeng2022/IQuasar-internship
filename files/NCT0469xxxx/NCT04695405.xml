  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence (CRTCE) is a healthcare facility&#xD;
      principally focused on providing best practices of intravenous ketamine treatment to adult&#xD;
      patients suffering from treatment resistant depression. Patients who have received IV&#xD;
      ketamine at the clinic are eligible to participate in this study where genetic biomarkers are&#xD;
      correlated with response to IV ketamine.&#xD;

    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report 16-Item</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 1-2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a self-report assessment used to evaluate depression severity in patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode. In total, there are 16 individual questions evaluating 9 DSM domains. The highest score is 27, indicating severe depression, while the lowest score is 0, which would suggest a complete absence of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 1-2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a 7 item self-report assessment used to evaluate symptoms of anxiety. The scale ranges from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). To total score ranges from 0 suggesting a lack anxiety symptoms to 21, indicating severe anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 1-2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SHAPS assessment is a 14 item self report tool used to measure anhedonia. Each item can be have a response of 1 (Definitely agree), 2(Agree), 3(Disagree), and 4(definitely disagree). The total score ranges from 14 to 56, in which higher scores on the assessment indicate higher levels of anhedonia.</description>

    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 4 initial infusions</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS contains 3 items, each ranging between zero to ten. The SDS is a self-reported assessment of disability within the context of depression. The total score ranges from 0, indicating no impairment, to 30, indicating severe impairment.</description>

    <measure>Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 1-2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CADSS is a 23-item assessment administered by a clinician in order to evaluate dissociative symptoms. Each item is evaluated on a scale from 0, suggesting no dissociative symptom, to 4, suggesting extreme dissociation. In total, patients can score between 0 to 92, indicating extreme dissociation.</description>

    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>WPAI is a questionnaire used to evaluate lost productivity due to depression. scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) is a self-report measure that has been used to assess the effects of hallucinogens in laboratory studies. Some studies suggest that mysticism may be associated with a response to ketamine. The MEQ is a 30 item questionnaire, with each item ranging from 0 to 5. A higher score denotes a strong mystical experience.</description>

    <description>The CTQ assesses five types of childhood trauma: 1)Emotional neglect 2) physical abuse 3) emotional abuse 4)physical neglect 5) sexual abuse.&#xD;
Each item being rated in 5 answer choice from 1 to 5 (never, rarely, sometimes, often or very often)</description>

    <measure>UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA)</measure>

    <measure>Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-3D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L measures health outcome self-completed by respondents. It consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each has 5 levels (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). The responses are used to generate Health Status Index (HSI). HSI range is -0.148 to 0.949, is anchored at 0 (dead) and 1 (full health).</description>

    <measure>Perceived Health Questionnaire (PHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is 9-item, self-reported scale assessing 9 symptom domains of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Major Depressive Disorder criteria. Each item is rated on 4-point scale (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several Days, 2 = More than half days, 3 = Nearly every day). The scores are summed for a total score ranging from 0-27. Higher score indicates greater severity of depression. Severity of PHQ-9 categorized as follows: None-minimal (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14), Moderately Severe (15-19), Severe (20-27). The recall period is 2 weeks.</description>
