  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous&#xD;
             carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Progression on or after one or more lines of chemotherapy for management of recurrent&#xD;
             or metastatic disease and is not amenable to curative treatment (eg, systemic&#xD;
             chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST v1.1. Note: A lesion in an area subjected to&#xD;
             prior loco-regional therapy, including previous radiotherapy, is not considered&#xD;
             measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion since the&#xD;
             therapy as defined by RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must submit qualified archival tumor tissue (formalin-fixed&#xD;
             paraffin-embedded block containing tumor [preferred] or approximately 15 [at least 6]&#xD;
             unstained slides) with an associated pathology report, or agree to a tumor biopsy for&#xD;
             determination of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and other biomarker&#xD;
             analyses (fresh tumor biopsies are strongly recommended at baseline in participants&#xD;
             with readily accessible tumor lesions and who consent to the biopsies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant must have adequate organ function as indicated by the screening laboratory&#xD;
             values obtained within 7 days before the first study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, TIGIT or any other antibody&#xD;
             or drug specifically targeting T-cell costimulation or checkpoint pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any active malignancy ≤ 2 years before first dose of study drug except for the&#xD;
             specific cancer under investigation in this study and any locally recurring cancer&#xD;
             that has been treated curatively (eg, resected basal or squamous cell skin cancer,&#xD;
             superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of breast).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Uncontrollable pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring frequent&#xD;
             drainage (recurrence within 2 weeks of intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any major surgical procedure ≤ 28 days before first dose of study drug. Participants&#xD;
             must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the&#xD;
             intervention before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has received any chemotherapy, immunotherapy (eg, interleukin, interferon, thymosin,&#xD;
             etc.) or any investigational therapies within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) before the first dose of study drug or has received palliative radiation&#xD;
             treatment or other local regional therapies within 14 days before the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
