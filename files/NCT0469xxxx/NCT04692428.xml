  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to tow groups: infrainguinal ultrasound guided iliaca fascia&#xD;
      block (FIBSI) and femoral nerve block (FNB) for FIBSI, the probe is placed transversely&#xD;
      between anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the pubic spine. The transducer is&#xD;
      translated laterally to identify the Sartorius muscle. Cephalic inclination of the probe. The&#xD;
      medial end of the transducer faces towards the umbilicus, which is the final position. The&#xD;
      100mm neurostimulation needle is advanced in the In Plan approach to pass through the iliac&#xD;
      fascia. Once the correct position is confirmed, 30 ml of 1% Ropivacaine is gradually injected&#xD;
      between the iliac fascia and the iliac muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For FNB, the probe was placed under the inguinal ligament. The femoral vessels and the nerve&#xD;
      section are visualized; The 100mm neurostimulation needle is advanced in the In Plan approach&#xD;
      and 30ml of 1% Ropivacaine has been injected along the nerve sheath&#xD;

      Patients were randomly assigned to tow groups: infrainguinal ultrasound guided iliaca fascia&#xD;
      block (FIBSI) and femoral nerve block (FNB) for FIBSI,the probe is placed transversely&#xD;
      between the EIAS and the pubic spine,The transducer is translated laterally to identify the&#xD;
      sartorius muscle. Cephalic inclination of the probe: The iliac muscle is located at the&#xD;
      medial border in the shadow of the superior anterior iliac spine.The medial end of the&#xD;
      transducer faces towards the umbilicus, which is the final position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anatomy identified, from superficial to deep, consisting of subcutaneous fat, internal&#xD;
      oblique muscle, transverse abdominal muscle, iliaca fascia covering the iliac muscle. The&#xD;
      100mm neurostimulation needle is advanced in In Plan approach to cross the iliaca fascia.&#xD;
      With the tip of the needle just below the iliaca fascia, 2 ml of local anesthetic was&#xD;
      injected to confirm the location of the tip. Once the correct position is confirmed, 30 ml of&#xD;
      1% Ropivacaine is gradually injected between the iliac fascia and the iliac muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      for FNB,The probe was placed under the inguinal ligament. Femoral vessels and sectional nerve&#xD;
      are visualized. The nerve was located, an 100mm neurostimulation needle is advanced in In&#xD;
      Plan approach, and 30 ml of 1% Ropivacaine was injected along the nerve sheath.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of patient placement in the sitting position</measure>
    <time_frame>after 20 minutes of realization of block</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of patient positioning was subjectively rated as unsatisfactory, good or optimal depending on the ease of positioning for spinal anesthesia</description>

    <measure>The level of sensory block at 20 minutes after realization of block</measure>
    <time_frame>before and 20 minutes after realization of blocks</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of the sensory block was evaluated by the PinPrick Test in the external, internal and anterior part of the thigh in comparison with the same stimulation at the level of the contralateral limb.&#xD;
using a sterile needle at 20 minutes after realization of block on the territory of femoral, obturator and lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>five minutes after the end of the realization of spinal anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction was evaluated after completion of spinal anesthesia by using a two-point score: 1= good, if necessary, I'll repeat it and 2= bad, I will never repeat it again.</description>
