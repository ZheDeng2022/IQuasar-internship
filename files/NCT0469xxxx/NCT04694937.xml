    <textblock>
      The global epidemic of childhood obesity, with the accompanying rise in the prevalence of&#xD;
      endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular comorbidities in youth, represents one of the most&#xD;
      important public health issues of the modern world. Nevertheless, a distinct subgroup of&#xD;
      youth with obesity less prone to the development of metabolic disturbances, called&#xD;
      &quot;metabolically healthy obese&quot; (MHO), has come into focus. Defining the MHO subpopulation&#xD;
      within the youth with obesity is of high importance in order to elucidate the mechanisms&#xD;
      protecting against the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors, and for its clinical,&#xD;
      preventive, and therapeutic decision-making implications. Little is known about the&#xD;
      mechanisms of development of metabolic disturbance in pediatric obesity. Cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      function, which can be measured non-invasively with heart rate variability (HRV), has been&#xD;
      suggested as a potential mechanism underlying the development of metabolic syndrome and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The aims of the present study were to investigate clinical,&#xD;
      anthropometric, and socio-demographic and lifestyle predictors of MHO in this group and to&#xD;
      asses correlation between HRV and the metabolic syndrome progression or improvement , in&#xD;
      order to reveal if HRV can serve as a predictor to metabolic disturbance in pediatric obesity&#xD;
      population Materials and Methods The study will be performed in the Nutrition and Obesity&#xD;
      Clinic of the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit at &quot;Dana Dwek&quot; Children's Hospital. All&#xD;
      children and adolescents that that will be admitted to our clinic between January 2021 to&#xD;
      December 2022 will include in the study. sociodemographic parameters will be collected from&#xD;
      the medical files.Blood will be drawn for complete metabolic assesment. MUO children will be&#xD;
      defined according to the recent international definition. Resting HRV will be measured by&#xD;
      Pulse Oximeter (BM2000A/Shanghai Berry Electronic Tech Co., Ltd.). The measurement will be&#xD;

      Scientific background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global epidemic of childhood obesity, with the accompanying rise in the prevalence of&#xD;
      endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular comorbidities in youth, represents one of the most&#xD;
      important public health issues of the modern world (1-4). The earlier occurrence and increase&#xD;
      in the prevalence of both pediatric obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS) leads to a potential&#xD;
      decline in life expectancy, meaning that the youth of today could be the first generation to&#xD;
      live shorter lives than their parents (2, 4-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of the childhood obesity pandemic, a distinct subgroup of youth with obesity&#xD;
      less prone to the development of metabolic disturbances, called &quot;metabolically healthy obese&quot;&#xD;
      (MHO), has come into focus (7, 8). Despite having obesity, MHO individuals display a&#xD;
      &quot;favorable&quot; metabolic profile, with preserved insulin sensitivity, normal blood pressure and&#xD;
      glucose regulation, normal lipids and liver enzymes, as well as a normal hormonal,&#xD;
      inflammation, and immune profile (9-13). Although MHO status might not necessarily translate&#xD;
      into lower mortality, and can crossover to &quot;metabolically unhealthy obese&quot; (MUO) phenotype&#xD;
      during puberty, defining the MHO subpopulation within the youth with obesity is of high&#xD;
      importance in order to elucidate the mechanisms protecting against the clustering of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors, and for its clinical, preventive, and therapeutic&#xD;
      decision-making implications (4, 7, 13-15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies evaluated predictors and risk factors for MUO (14-15). However, these were based&#xD;
      on variety of definitions and criteria used for defining MHO. moreover, little is known about&#xD;
      the mechanisms of development of metabolic disturbance in pediatric obesity. More data is&#xD;
      needed in order to identify the parameters which have the highest ability to predict&#xD;
      clinically significant outcomes. Cardiac autonomic function, which can be measured&#xD;
      non-invasively with heart rate variability, has been suggested as a potential mechanism&#xD;
      underlying the development of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (16). Autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction characterized by reduced heart rate variability was found to predict coronary&#xD;
      heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and of all-cause and cardiac mortality (17-20) in&#xD;
      adult population. However, the effect of reduced heart rate variability on metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      in pediatric population and the influence of nutritional intervention with weight reduction&#xD;
      on heart rate variability is not known. We aimed to investigate clinical, anthropometric, and&#xD;
      socio-demographic and lifestyle predictors of MHO in this group, to describe HRV in children&#xD;
      with obesity, and to find correlation to the metabolic syndrome or metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      progression or improvement, in order to reveal if HRV can serve as a predictor to metabolic&#xD;
      disturbance in pediatric obesity population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study will be performed in the Nutrition and Obesity Clinic of the&#xD;
      Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit at &quot;Dana Dwek&quot; Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children and adolescents that that will be admitted to our clinic between December 2020&#xD;
      to December 2022 will include in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: All children 10-18 with obesity, males and females, who attend the&#xD;
      obesity clinic in the pediatric gastroenterology unit at &quot;Dana-Dwek&quot; children's hospital, Tel&#xD;
      Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Children with conditions that may affect HRV (e.g. congenital or acquired&#xD;
      heart disease, other inflammatory conditions) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      withdrawal criteria: children and parents that will refuse to participate in the telephone&#xD;
      interview will withdrawl from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data - age and gender, perinatal history, prior medication and hospitalization,&#xD;
      sociodemographic parameters (area of living, parents' education, occupation and lifestyle)&#xD;
      will be collected from the medical files. The obese children's perceptions of their&#xD;
      motivation, health and social status will be ranked in 1-10 scale and documented upon&#xD;
      admission to the clinic, and the parents' life style habits will also be documented during&#xD;
      their first encounter. A parent will be defined as maintaining healthy lifestyle if he or she&#xD;
      reported to maintain a healthy diet and regular exercise Clinical and metabolic evaluation&#xD;
      Weight and height will be measured according to standardized protocols. Body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      percentiles are computed using age- and sex-specific BMI reference values from the World&#xD;
      Health Organization . Body composition will be assessed using bioelectricalimpedence.&#xD;
      Laboratory and radiologic parameters will include liver enzyme profile, lipid profile,&#xD;
      glucose, insulin and HbA1C ,C rreactive protein (CRP) and abdominal ultrasound. MUO children&#xD;
      and adolescent will be defined according to the recent international consensus-based&#xD;
      definition (10). BMI Z score will be documented every 3-month and laboratory parameters will&#xD;
      be repeated after 6 months of dietary intervention Nutritional assessment will be based on 3&#xD;
      days food report, including 2 week days and 1 weekend day, administered by a registered&#xD;
      dietician at baseline visit and every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of HRV Resting HRV will be measured by Pulse Oximeter BM2000A/Shanghai Berry&#xD;
      Electronic Tech Co., Ltd. that is validated for this purpose and is approved by FDA. The&#xD;
      measurement, at the patient's fingertip, takes 5 minutes. The measurement will be performed&#xD;
      twice - at two consecutive visits at the clinic, as part as the routine follow up of the&#xD;
      patient every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV will be correlated to demographic and metabolic parameters between patients. In order to&#xD;
      reveal whether HRV can serve as a predictor to metabolic disease progression or improvement&#xD;
      HRV will be correlated to metabolic parameters in the same patient at two time-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic data and patients' descriptive data available on continuous scales will be&#xD;
      presented with medians, means and standard deviations. Categorical data will be presented as&#xD;
      rates and percentages. Parametric tests will be applied when normality is satisfied.&#xD;
      Regression analysis will be used to assess the impact of independent variables on the&#xD;
      dependent variables. A p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time line:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data analysis will be completed within 2 years.&#xD;
