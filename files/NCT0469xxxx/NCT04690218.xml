  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the sleep quality, anxiety and depression levels in&#xD;
      women with mastalgia using internationally validated scales. Additionally the investigators&#xD;
      aim to question the amount and frequency of consumption of nutritional elements which are&#xD;
      known to aggravate mastalgia. Finally by combining and analyzing the information gathered,&#xD;
      the investigators intend to set light to the etiopathologic and clinic aspects of mastalgia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mastalgia is encountered in 70% of premenopausal women and is one of the most frequent&#xD;
      reasons for attending general surgery clinics. In most of the cases no physical cause is&#xD;
      demonstrated and the etiopathogenesis is still not yet determined. In 1949 Patey, for the&#xD;
      first time, proposed that mastalgia might be a psychologically based problem. In the&#xD;
      following years, research was focused in this issue and some articles were published&#xD;
      demonstrating the relationship of anxiety, depression and high stress levels with mastalgia.&#xD;
      The efforts for finding out the etiopathologic mechanism and defining the risk factors&#xD;
      revealed that smoking and consumption of tea, coffee and carbonated beverages in particular&#xD;
      worsen mastalgia whereas essential fatty acids (especially gamma linoleic acid) provides a&#xD;
      symptomatic relief. Additionally it is known that sleep irregularities cause serious&#xD;
      deterioration in daily life quality as well as can exaggerate some medical, neurologic and/or&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions. More than half of the population experience sleep irregularities from&#xD;
      time to time and chronic sleep disturbances effect 20% of adult population in western&#xD;
      countries. Therefore sleep irregularities might have contributing effects in the&#xD;
      etiopathogenesis and/or symptomatology of therapy resistant conditions like mastalgia.&#xD;

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score</measure>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score is four point likert type scale. It consists of 14 questions. Questions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 address anxiety whereas questions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 address depression. Achievable minimum score of the scale is 0 and the maximum score is 42. The cut-off score for depression is 7 and for anxiety is 10. Scores higher than 7 indicate high anxiety levels and scores higher than 10 indicate the presence of depression.</description>
