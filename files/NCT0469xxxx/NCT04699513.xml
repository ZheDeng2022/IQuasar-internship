  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a mode of mechanical ventilation that&#xD;
      alternates between two levels of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support and&#xD;
      allows spontaneous respiratory effort at either CPAP level. It is considered as an&#xD;
      alternative, life-saving modality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      that struggle for oxygenation. Compared to the classical ventilation, APRV has been shown to&#xD;
      provide lower peak pressure, better oxygenation, less circulatory loss, and better gas&#xD;
      exchange without deteriorating the hemodynamic condition of the ARDS patient. This mode is&#xD;
      believed to help to achieve the target of opening consolidated lung areas (recruitment) and&#xD;
      to prevent repeated opening-closing of alveoli (decruitment). However, there is still&#xD;
      insufficient and limited proof to support this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been proposed that early use of protective mechanical ventilation with APRV&#xD;
      could be used preemptively to prevent development of ARDS in high risk patients. In that&#xD;
      study, APRV prevented clinical and histological lung injury by protecting alveolar epithelial&#xD;
      integrity, preserving surfactant and alveolar stability, and reducing pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the present study was to investigate whether early use of APRV as a&#xD;
      lung-protecting strategy was superior to the conventional methods in a patient population&#xD;
      with high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned as a single-centered, prospective, and randomised-controlled study in&#xD;
      a general intensive care unit with 18 bed capacity. The majority of the general patient&#xD;
      population is made up of trauma and post-operative patients. The local ethics committee&#xD;
      reviewed and approved the study protocol (protocol number: 2016/175) prior to the start of&#xD;
      the investigation. Enrollment for the study was performed between May 2016-October 2018.&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained from each patient's relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation but was not&#xD;
      initially diagnosed with ARDS 9, had a LIPS (Lung Injury Prediction Score) of &gt; 7 10, and&#xD;
      have been staying in the ICU for more than 24 hours. Patient demographic properties, sedation&#xD;
      requirements, inotrope/vasopressor levels, ARDS development status during follow-up,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation times, length of ICU stay, arterial blood gas results, mean airway&#xD;
      pressure (Pmean), peak airway pressure (Ppeak) and tidal volume (Vt) in addition to the&#xD;
      mode-specific mechanical ventilation parameters were recorded. Exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      pregnancy, intracranial hypertension (suspected or confirmed by measurement with external&#xD;
      ventricular drainage catheter), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or type II&#xD;
      respiratory failure, confirmed bronchopleural fistula, documented barotrauma, history of&#xD;
      pneumonectomy, and age below 18 or above 85 years. Consecutive eligible patients were&#xD;
      enrolled block randomization with a 1:1 allocation, randomly assigned to APRV or P-SIMV+PS&#xD;
      groups using opaque, sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilator Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All mechanical ventilation settings were made by intensivists, or trained residents on the&#xD;
      night shifts. Prior to randomization, all patients were treated with VC-SIMV mode. Patients&#xD;
      admitted during the day were ventilated in VC-SIMV mode until the main investigators&#xD;
      evaluated the patient (1-2 hours), and patient admitted in the evening-night shift were&#xD;
      ventilated in VC-SIMV mode until the main investigators took over the shift in the morning&#xD;
      (maximum 16 hours). Assignment to groups was performed after calculation of LIPS score.&#xD;
      Microprocessor-controlled mechanical ventilators (Galileo GOLD; Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz,&#xD;
      Switzerland) and heated humidifiers were used as a standard in all patients. In both groups,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation targets were determined as maintaining plateau airway pressure&#xD;
      (Pplateu) &lt; 30 cmH2O and PaO2 between 60-100 mmHg or SO2&gt;88%. In both groups, arterial blood&#xD;
      gas measurement was performed at least twice a day. Oxygenation and respiratory mechanics&#xD;
      were evaluated by comparing P-SIMV+PS and APRV groups at baseline and on days 1, 2, 3, and 7.&#xD;
      Patients were followed until transfer to CPAP/T-tube and extubation, or a maximum of 28 days.&#xD;
      During this period, follow-up was terminated once at extubation, exitus, discharge from ICU&#xD;
      or ARDS occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P-SIMV+PS group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason behind using P-SIMV+PS as a conventional mode was that it is a pressure controlled&#xD;
      mode like APRV. Pressure level was adjusted in order to get a Vt of 6-8 ml.kg-1.PBW-1&#xD;
      (predicted body weight). Optimal PEEP between 5-10 cmH2O was applied to all patients by&#xD;
      titrating according to O2 requirement. Respiratory rate was adjusted as 12-15 breaths.min-1,&#xD;
      and inspiratory time was initially adjusted to approximately 1.5 seconds. The I:E ratio was&#xD;
      adjusted by either changing inspiratory time, respiratory rate, or both. Inspiratory&#xD;
      triggering sensitivity was adjusted as 2 L.min-1, and was tittered by reaching the minimum&#xD;
      level in the absence of automatic triggering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APRV group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard initial settings were Thigh / Tlow: 4/0.8 secods, Phigh: taking Pplateau value (if&#xD;
      patient is paralyzed) or Pmean in the previous conventional method as reference, Pplateau &lt;&#xD;
      30 cmH20 and target Vt 6-8 ml.kg-1.PBW-1. Plow was always set to 0 cmH2O. T-low was adjusted&#xD;
      according to PCO2 value in blood gas measurement, by evaluating expiratory flow curve (gas&#xD;
      flow wave form), and to get a release duration of 10-14.cycle-1. Tlow range was adjusted as&#xD;
      0.4-1.2 seconds. When needed, Thigh was gradually increased to 12-15 seconds by increments of&#xD;
      1-2 seconds. In case of hypoxemia, the problem was generally solved by increasing Phigh and&#xD;
      FiO2, and as an additional strategy, Thigh was increased. In case of hypercapnia, sedation&#xD;
      was lowered to allow spontaneous breaths. In order to increase the number of releases and&#xD;
      thus, increase the minute-ventilation, Thigh was shortened and Phigh was increased 12,13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning was performed according to the European Respiratory Society Weaning Task Force&#xD;
      recommendations in both groups 14. In APRV group, Phigh was reduced by 2-3 cmH2O and Thigh&#xD;
      increased by 0.5-2.0 sec during weaning as the patient tolerated it. Tlow was kept constant&#xD;
      at the same time. Before transfer to CPAP, Phigh was kept at approximately 14-16 cm H2O or&#xD;
      lower, and Thigh was increased up to level of 10-12 sec. In P-SIMV+PS group, respiratory rate&#xD;
      was reduced by 2 breaths.min-1, and PS level was reduced by decrements of 2-4 cmH2O. In both&#xD;
      groups, spontaneous breathing trial was attempted for 30-60 minutes with T-tube when CPAP was&#xD;
      5-10 cmH2O, and patients were extubated afterwards. For patients with tolerance, the same&#xD;
      trial was repeated the next day. Total MV time was defined as the time passed from intubation&#xD;
      to the last successful extubation. Patients who required tracheotomy during follow-up were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and Supportive Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preferred medications for those patients requiring sedation was midazolam infused at loading&#xD;
      dose: 0.5 to 5 mg every 1 to 5 minutes (if needed), followed by 1 to 8 mg.hour-1 or 0.01 to&#xD;
      0.1 mg.kg-1.hour-1 continuous infusion; titrate infusion rate to clinical effect; for&#xD;
      analgesia, fentanyl infused at 1-2 mcg.kg-1.hr-1 i.v. The sedation goal was a Richmond&#xD;
      Agitation Sedation Scale score of - 2 to 0 15. According to our clinic's sedation policy,&#xD;
      Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale was assessed hourly by the nursing staff, and medication&#xD;
      doses were titrated by the respiratory therapists according to target spontaneous respiration&#xD;
      level. Evaluation of whether patients received sedation and the number of days which they&#xD;
      received sedation were recorded. Sedation doses were not evaluated. None of the patients&#xD;
      received neuromuscular blocker. Fluid management, antibiotic strategy, glucose control and&#xD;
      enteral nutrition were also standardized between the two groups according to the ICU&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis On the primary outcome of developing ARDS in the light of P/F ratio&#xD;
      8[Clinically defined ALI/ARDS developed in the CMV group (mean [SE] PaO2/FIO2 [P/F] ratio,&#xD;
      242.96 [S.E. 24.82]), and this was prevented with APRV (P/F ratio, 478.00 [S.E.41.38]; P &lt;&#xD;
      .05 vs CMV)], power analysis using the Gpower computer program11 indicated that a total&#xD;
      sample of 58 people would be needed to detect large effects (d: 0.888) with 90% power using a&#xD;
      t test between means with 2-tailed alpha at .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data were analyzed using IBM SPSS V23 (Chicago, USA). The Shapiro Wilk test was used to&#xD;
      determine whether the data were normally distributed. Comparisons of data that were not&#xD;
      normally distributed were made with the Kruskal Wallis test and the Mann Whitney U test.&#xD;
      Categorical data were analyzed with the Pearson chi-square test. The groups were compared&#xD;
      with regard to laboratory parameters measured on days 1, 2, 3, and 7. Non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data were presented as median (min-max), while normally distributed data were&#xD;
      presented as mean Â± standard deviation. Categorical data were expressed as frequency and&#xD;
      percentage. Values of p &lt; .05 were considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoint The primary endpoint of the study was to determine whether APRV mode was&#xD;
      protective against ARDS compared to the conventional mode in patients with high risk of ARDS&#xD;
      as determined by LIPS score. The secondary endpoint was to determine whether this mode&#xD;
      provided any improvement in oxygenation, airway pressures, sedation and inotrope&#xD;
      requirements, mechanical ventilation time and length of ICU/hospital stay.&#xD;
