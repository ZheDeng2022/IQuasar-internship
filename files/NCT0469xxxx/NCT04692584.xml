    <textblock>
      Childhood pain can cause long-term and psychologically harmful effects. The most common&#xD;
      childhood pain is associated with vaccinations. Music can reduce pain and anxiety. This study&#xD;
      aimed to investigate the effects of the mother-sung lullaby during vaccine administration on&#xD;
      vaccine-induced pain in babies and anxiety in mothers.&#xD;

      Vaccine injections are the most common and painful procedures experienced during infancy and&#xD;
      childhood. Families concerned about the pain associated with vaccine injections may be&#xD;
      reluctant to vaccinate their children. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the&#xD;
      mother-sung lullaby during vaccine administration on vaccine-induced pain in babies and&#xD;
      anxiety in mothers. Two family health centers in Turkey between March 4, 2020, and August 28,&#xD;
      2020. A total of 60 babies who received the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine and their&#xD;
      mothers.These babies were randomly assigned to one of two groups, including 30 babies in the&#xD;
      lullaby group and 30 babies in the control group. Data on descriptive information for all&#xD;
      babies and mothers were collected through face-to-face interviews with the mothers before&#xD;
      vaccination. Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and crying duration were measured in all babies.&#xD;
      Heart rate and oxygen saturation of the babies were recorded using a pulse oximeter during&#xD;
      and after vaccine administration. The crying time, measured for up to 20 seconds after&#xD;
      vaccination, was recorded as the total cry time (using video seconds). The pain score was&#xD;
      evaluated by two observers using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale, based on video recordings&#xD;
      obtained during and after vaccine administration. In addition, mothers' anxiety scores were&#xD;
      measured using the &quot;State Anxiety Inventory,&quot; both before and after vaccination.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This was an experimental, randomized controlled study. These babies were randomly assigned to one of two groups, including 30 babies in the lullaby group and 30 babies in the control group. Randomization was performed using a sealed envelope method. The video recordings were evaluated by two academicians in the field of child health and disease nursing, including a researcher and a research assistant with a doctorate in child health and disease nursing who were blinded to the group assignment. These observers were blinded to the other's observations and did not discuss the scores.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The video recordings were evaluated by two academicians in the field of child health and disease nursing, including a researcher and a research assistant with a doctorate in child health and disease nursing who were blinded to the group assignment. Video evaluations were performed independently. For each assessment, the observers watched the videos of the babies and conducted NIPS assessments during and after the intervention. These observers were blinded to the other's observations and did not discuss the scores.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was used for the pain assessment. The NIPS consists of 6 behavioral sections, including facial expression, crying, breathing pattern, arm and leg movements, and wakefulness. Although 2 point values (0-1 point) can be scored for behaviors other than crying, 3 point values (0-1-2 points) are scored for crying. The total score ranges from 0 to 7, with higher scores indicated increased pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>State Anxiety Inventory (SAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The SAI was used in this study, which can be used to determines how an individual feels at a certain time and under certain conditions. The SAI consists of 20 questions, with scores ranging from 20-80. A high score indicates high anxiety, whereas a low score indicates low anxiety. The State Anxiety Inventory was used to determine the anxiety levels of the mothers before and after the vaccine administration.</description>

    <description>Heart rate of the babies were recorded using a pulse oximeter placed on the right or left foot or hand of each baby before the intervention. Heart rate levels were recorded during and after vaccination.</description>

    <description>Approximately 15 seconds before the vaccination, each baby's mother began to sing a lullaby. The mothers stood approximately 30 cm from their babies and were allowed to touch their babies during the vaccination process. All the mothers sang the same lullaby, &quot;Sleep and Grow&quot;. This selection was determined by two different faculty members at a State University, Faculty of Education, Department of Fine Arts Education, Department of Music Education. Mothers were reminded of the words to the lullaby before vaccine administration.</description>
