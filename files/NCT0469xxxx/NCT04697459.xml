      Background: Hemodialysis patients have a mortality rate 50 times higher than in the general&#xD;
      population, and the cause remains cardiovascular in more than half of the cases. A&#xD;
      deleterious morphological and functional cardiac remodelling is well established in these&#xD;
      patients, the causes of which are both the presence of factors specific to renal disease&#xD;
      (hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic) and co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, etc. .) but&#xD;
      also to the hemodialysis (HD) procedure itself, due to the sudden hemodynamic changes it&#xD;
      imposes, leading to repeated episodes of intradialytic hypotension (HID) and myocardial&#xD;
      stunning. The latter are now documented as direct contributors to the increased mortality&#xD;
      observed in HD patients compared to the general population. The introduction of intradialytic&#xD;
      physical exercise in the therapeutic program of HD patient is now recommended and practised&#xD;
      routinely in many countries, in Scandinavia in particular. Several meta-analyses have clearly&#xD;
      established its safety. The beneficial role of chronic intradialytic exercise in improving&#xD;
      dialysis efficiency, mental health and quality of life, as well as the inflammatory status of&#xD;
      HD patients is also clearly demonstrated. Chronic intradialytic exercise is also associated&#xD;
      with improvements in overall fitness level, a parameter closely linked to cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality. Applied acutely during dialysis, it could play a cardioprotective role (e.g;&#xD;
      limiting myocardial stunning), allowing haemodynamic and cardiac functional stabilization&#xD;
      during HD. However, to our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the long-term effects&#xD;
      of intradialytic exercise on remodelling and overall and regional heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The main objective is to assess the effects of chronic intradialytic physical exercise&#xD;
      on myocardial remodelling and regional function. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of acute intradialytic exercise on myocardial stunning as well as the effect of&#xD;
      chronic physical exercise on macro and microcirculatory vascular function, inflammation,&#xD;
      physical fitness and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
