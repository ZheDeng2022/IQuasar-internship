  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pragmatic, two-arm, randomized controlled trial study aim to survey the inhaler errors&#xD;
      of add-on tiotropium therapy with ICS+LABA in real-world practice of asthma patients and the&#xD;
      efficacy of recheck stratage of inhaler skills. Patient characteristics and inflammatory&#xD;
      features will be evaluated prospectively for association of asthma control by add-on&#xD;
      tiotropium.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      1. The clinical efficacy of tiotropium as add-on treatment to ICS with a LABA have been&#xD;
           demonstrated in clinical trials in adult patients with symptomatic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Certain patients of daily care, like patients with smoking asthma, late onset asthma or&#xD;
           asthma with chronic airway obstruction are often excluded from clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Studies have shown the cognitive function of patients with COPD is impaired. When mixed&#xD;
           types of inhaler devices are prescribed, the multiple steps of different devices may&#xD;
           ensure complexity and confusion for patients, which may compromise the efficacy of&#xD;
           add-on therapy. The inhaler error of add-on tiotropium treatment in real-world asthma&#xD;
           treatment is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The improvement of step errors after varieties of teaching intervention is around&#xD;
           30~50%. Strategy of recheck inhaler technique recommended by the treatment guideline may&#xD;
           optimized inhaler use. (https://ginasthma.org/gina-reports/).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Factors like responseness of short-acting bronchodilators and cholinergic tone have been&#xD;
           reported as predictors of a positive clinical response of add-on tiotropium. However,&#xD;
           more specific physiological or inflammatory factors. e.g. exhaled nitric oxide test&#xD;
           (FeNo), and para symptomatic function and cardiac-pulmonary interaction have not been&#xD;
           evaluated prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. This pragmatic, two-arm, randomized controlled trial study aim to survey the inhaler&#xD;
           errors of add-on tiotropium therapy with ICS+LABA in real-world practice of asthma&#xD;
           patients and the efficacy of recheck stratage of inhaler skills. Patient characteristics&#xD;
           and inflammatory features will be evaluated prospectively for association of asthma&#xD;
           control by add-on tiotropium.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Brief summary of protocol At visit 1, patients characteristics, lung function, cognition function, HRV, CRC and FeNo will be recorded. Randomization by stratification with cognition function will be done but both arms receive usual verbal instruction of inhaler steps.&#xD;
At visit 2, inhaler step errors will be recorded 1 months after add-on Tiotropium with ICS+LABA and interventions of education start by correct/recheck strategy in study arm and usual verbal instruction in control arm.&#xD;
At visit 3, inhaler step errors will be recorded 3 months after add-on Tiotropium with ICS+LABA as the primary endpoint. Heart rate variability (HRV), cardiopulmonary coupling (CRC) and FeNo will be checked.&#xD;
Other endpoints, e.g. lung function, PEFR, exacerbation will be evaluated at V3 and V4 (6 months after V1), V5 (9 months after V1) and V6 (12month after V1)</intervention_model_description>
