  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study with patients with prescription of portable oxygen therapy, to test the impact on&#xD;
      adherence of a patient-centered empowerment program, with contents on the nature of the&#xD;
      respiratory pathology, the symptom of dyspnea, the benefits of the therapy, adjustment&#xD;
      expectations and beliefs, as well as health habits.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients were summoned to the care center, being evaluated individually by a nurse, and&#xD;
      based on the results, a care plan adapted to the specific needs and objectives was initiated.&#xD;
      This care plan involved monitoring using different channels (face-to-face, telephone), with&#xD;
      the main objective of monitoring the evolution of compliance, adherence and improving the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients. The interventions that were carried out were educational and&#xD;
      formative (using counseling communication skills), and technological (using monitoring tools&#xD;
      in specific cases). The empowerment program was an educational session in which the nurse&#xD;
      discussed content about dyspnea, the benefits of therapy, etc.&#xD;

    <description>The nurse conducts a structured interview that covers the following areas: information on respiratory attraction and the symptom of dyspnea, expectations and beliefs about oxygen therapy, use of oxygen therapy, healthy habits, social support. It also evaluates the patient's perception of oxygen therapy, and the level of dyspnea using the mMRC scale. After this, the nurse evaluates the current level of adherence, and if she considers that the patient needs a reinforcement session, she schedules a workshop with 3 other patients and their main caregivers. This workshop takes place 30 days after this interview. In other patients, depending on the level of adherence, a support call is made, and all patients are visited again at the center at 90 days, performing the same evaluation with a structured interview and the scales that were made on day 1</description>
