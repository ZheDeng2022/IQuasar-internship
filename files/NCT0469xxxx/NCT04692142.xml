    <textblock>
      The aim of the study aim to test the null hypothesis which states that there are no&#xD;
      significant differences in knowledge retention and exam performance of dental undergraduate&#xD;
      students in a Saudi Dental School using two different asynchronous teaching methods . The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to analyse students' perceptions to the two teaching methods.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: The trial is designed as a cross-over clustered randomized trial (each group would be&#xD;
      a cluster), so that each group will act as their own control for their learning performance&#xD;
      and perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: School of Dentistry, Princes Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University/ Riyadh/ KSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consents: Written consent will obtained from the students before commencing of the trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The cohort of the trial includes 33 fourth-year dental students that represents&#xD;
      whole fourth-year undergraduate class in order to eliminate the selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Independent person will use computer-generated randomisation to allocate&#xD;
      participants to one of the two groups. The sequence of random allocation will be concealed&#xD;
      from the researchers who recruited the participants. Participants in the control group will&#xD;
      be taught through the traditional passive online teaching model (PG) using live-video&#xD;
      streaming while participants in the intervention arm (FG) will be taught through flipped the&#xD;
      classroom model. Group 1 will consist of 16 students and group 2 will consist of 17 students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention A total of 4 lectures will be delivered asynchronously using two different&#xD;
      teaching methods as mentioned above. Participants in FG will have a monitored remote access&#xD;
      to the recorded lectures for one week followed by 4 additional small group online discussion&#xD;
      sessions. The students in both groups will remotely attend all pre-recorded and live-video&#xD;
      lectures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention implementation rounds The intervention will be implemented in 3 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks The first lecture that will be taught in the first week will be related to the topic of&#xD;
      Adult Orthodontics (L1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before L1, all students will be asked to complete a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs),&#xD;
      formative exam (i.e. pre-test). Following the test , the lecture will be delivered to the&#xD;
      participants of PG using a passive online teaching format for 60 minutes (i.e., live-video&#xD;
      streaming). After the lecture is completed, students will be asked to re-take the same&#xD;
      pre-test exam and complete questionnaire regarding their experience with the teaching&#xD;
      methods. Consent for recording L1 will be granted from the attendees before recording. Within&#xD;
      24 hours following L1, participants of FG will have an access to the recorded lecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      and they will be taught using an active teaching model known as flipped classroom model. In&#xD;
      this model, participants will have 7 -day monitored remote access to the recorded L1. Similar&#xD;
      to PG, completing the online pre-test formative exam will be preliminary requirement to&#xD;
      access the published recorded L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the expiry of remote access to the recorded lecture, participants from FG will be invited&#xD;
      to attend post-lecture discussion sessions. To enhance the effectiveness of flipped classroom&#xD;
      teaching method, the cohort of FG will be randomly, using computer generated randomisation,&#xD;
      subdivided to two smaller groups in which each group will be consisted of half of the FG&#xD;
      cohort. The same lecturer will moderate the discussions for each group separately. After the&#xD;
      lecture is completed, students will be asked to re-take the same pre-test of L1 and complete&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding their experience with the teaching methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the small groups discussion session, participants of FG will be given a 30-minute&#xD;
      break before the start of second lecture related to the topic of Orthognathic Surgery (L2).&#xD;
      However, the intervention will be crossed over, hence, the cohort of FG in week 1 will act as&#xD;
      a control group while teaching L2 and vice versa. The same protocol of teaching models that&#xD;
      was applied in week 1 will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of both groups will be taught by the same instructor using the same materials,&#xD;
      irrespective of the teaching methods. The lectures will be delivered using the same&#xD;
      presentation platform (PowerPoint, Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) and the same virtual learning&#xD;
      platform (Zoom live-streaming software - Zoom Video Communications, Inc, San Jose,&#xD;
      California, Version 5.4.3). The duration of each lecture will be 60 minutes, while the&#xD;
      post-lecture discussion, in the flipped classroom design, will take 15 minutes . Learning&#xD;
      outcomes will be based on the learning objectives and outcomes of each lecture that align&#xD;
      with what is specified by the National Commission for Academic Accreditation and Assessment&#xD;
      in Saudi Arabia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative MCQs exam Before each lecture, students will complete a set of multiple-choice&#xD;
      questions (MCQs), formatively (i.e. pre-test). These questions will be related to the taught&#xD;
      topics, and will be administered remotely using learning management system (Blackboard).&#xD;
      After each lecture, students will be asked to re-take the same pre-test via Blackboard. This&#xD;
      formative assessment test will measure students' learning gain. Two investigators will&#xD;
      construct the pre-test questions to ensure its content validity and reliability. Content&#xD;
      validity will be tested using test matrix and experts judgment. The reliability test will&#xD;
      estimated using inter-rater reliability. A correlation of more than 0.7 will be considered&#xD;
      acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summative exam At the end of the semester, students will undertake their final summative&#xD;
      written MCQ exam. This summative exam will cover topics taught during the second semester of&#xD;
      preclinical orthodontic course. The summative written exam will include 10 randomly selected&#xD;
      questions from bank of questions relevant to the orthodontic subjects taught in L1 and L2.&#xD;
      The written exam questions will be identical for all students and will be delivered onsite,&#xD;
      under controlled exam conditions. The summative written exam scores specific to L1 and L2&#xD;
      will be traced and collected using an Excel spreadsheet by an independent person, the scores&#xD;
      will be anonymously coded to minimize reporting bias. The maximum achievable score for the&#xD;
      questions relevant to the subjects taught in L1 and L2 will be in accordance with an exam&#xD;
      blueprint specified for the course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students' perception At the end of each lecture, students will be asked to answer a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding their experience with the teaching methods they have received. We&#xD;
      will use the validated Web-Based Learning Environment Inventory (WELEI). In addition to&#xD;
      demographic section, the questionnaire consists of items that captures students' perceptions&#xD;
      of web-based learning environments. Regarding the flipped classroom teaching method,&#xD;
      additional questions adapted from previous studies that examined students' perception of the&#xD;
      flipped classroom will be used. The questionnaire will be distributed online via SurveyMonkey&#xD;
      (San Mateo, California, United States).&#xD;
