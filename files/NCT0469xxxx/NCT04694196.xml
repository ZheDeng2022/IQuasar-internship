      Occlusal plane &quot;the average plane established by the incisal and occlusal surfaces of the&#xD;
      teeth -The glossary of prosthodontic terms. Generally, it is not a plane but represents the&#xD;
      planar mean of the curvature of these surfaces&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct orientation of the occlusal plane plays a vital role in achieving optimal aesthetics,&#xD;
      occlusal balance and function of complete dentures. Faulty orientation of occlusal plane in&#xD;
      fixed or removable prostheses will affect the interaction between tongue and buccinator&#xD;
      muscle resulting in food collection in sulcus and cheek or tongue biting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occlusal plane is normally established anteriorly according to aesthetics of patient and&#xD;
      posteriorly parallel to camper's plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the mandibular arch there are few landmarks which could be used to orient the occlusal&#xD;
      plane like the retromolar pad, commissure of the lips and lateral borders of the tongue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various landmark have been used to orient the occlusal plane in the maxillary arch e.g.&#xD;
      parotid papilla, hamular notch- incisive papilla plane, ala-tragus line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no single method seems entirely accurate to locate the occlusal plane in edentulous&#xD;
      patients. Therefore ,Investigators need a stable anatomic landmark can be used as a guide to&#xD;
      determine occlusal plane (OP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty edentulous patients will be recruited from the Department of Prosthodontics at the&#xD;
      University of Hama Dental School. Record bases had anterior occlusal wax rims at the anterior&#xD;
      region only in maxillary and mandibular. The mandibular posterior occlusal plane was&#xD;
      determined according to the level of coronoid notch{CN} (greatest concavity anterior border&#xD;
      of the ramus) , Then, this plane in patient's mouth was modified to fit the lateral border of&#xD;
      the tongue and the commissure of the lips. The determinants of the registration of the&#xD;
      centric relationship were fixed to the posterior inferior mandibular occlusal wax rims, and&#xD;
      the posterior wax rims of maxillary was made according to the posterior wax rims of&#xD;
      mandibular.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plane of occlusion refers to an imaginary surface that theoretically touches incisal&#xD;
      edges of the incisors and the tips of the occluding surfaces of the posterior teeth&quot;. A plane&#xD;
      usually signifies a flat surface; however, it is not so where the occlusal plane is&#xD;
      concerned. Two areas comprising of anterior and posterior teeth constitute the occlusal plane&#xD;
      and must be considered individually. Anterior tooth position is governed by esthetics,&#xD;
      phonetics and the required anterior guidance. On the contrary, functional needs predominantly&#xD;
      determine the position of posterior teeth and this position is also affected by the&#xD;
      incorporation of the anteroposterior and mediolateral curves. Optimal function, aesthetics&#xD;
      and phonetics following prosthodontic rehabilitation is dependent on the establishment of&#xD;
      physiologically accurate vertical dimensions of occlusion, palatal contours, positioning of&#xD;
      the teeth and the level of occlusal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occlusal plane orientation is lost in patients with mutilated dentitions or those&#xD;
      rendered edentulous and needs to be re-established for optimal function and comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different intra- and extra-oral landmarks used by clinicians to define the level of the&#xD;
      occlusal plane include the upper lip, corners of mouth, lateral margins of tongue, Camper's&#xD;
      plane and interpupillary line, the parotid papilla and the retromolar pad (RMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any discrepancy in establishing the optimal level of occlusal plane causes adverse effects on&#xD;
      periodontal tissues in dentate individuals and may result in vague symptoms such as&#xD;
      headaches, migraines or stiffened shoulders and in edentulous patients, compromising the&#xD;
      stability of the prosthesis, ultimately leading to alveolar bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combination of various landmark along with a judicious clinical judgment should be taken&#xD;
      into account for the location of the occlusal plane in edentulous patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the level of occlusal plane is too high, the tongue is unable to lie on the lingual cusps&#xD;
      of the mandibular denture teeth and hence, fails to counter the movement of the denture. It&#xD;
      may also result in food accretion in the labial and lingual sulci. In contrast, a low level&#xD;
      of occlusal plane will promote tongue and cheek biting. Therefore, it is mandatory for the&#xD;
      prosthodontist to re-establish the lost occlusal plane, both while dealing with multiple long&#xD;
      span posterior restorations as well as in complete denture prosthodontics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited from the Department of Prosthodontics at the University of&#xD;
      Hama Dental School. Forty edentulous patients. Record bases had anterior occlusal wax rims at&#xD;
      the anterior region only in maxillary and mandibular. The mandibular posterior occlusal plane&#xD;
      was determined on the level of coronoid notch (CN) on the anterior part of ramus,. Then, this&#xD;
      plane in patient's mouth was modified to fit the lateral border of the tongue and the&#xD;
      commissure of the lips. The determinants of the registration of the centric relationship were&#xD;
      fixed to the posterior inferior mandibular occlusal wax rims, and the posterior wax rims of&#xD;
      maxillary was made according to the posterior wax rims of mandibular. Then We will measure&#xD;
      the occlusal plane in all forty a participants determined to the level of CN at the anterior&#xD;
      border of ramus in mandible.&#xD;
