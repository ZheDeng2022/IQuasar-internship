  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile intervention called txt4TKI&#xD;
      for the improvement of tyrosine kinase inhibitor management in patients with chronic myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are associated with numerous potential side&#xD;
      effects, including a decrease in bone marrow activity (myelosuppression), nausea, diarrhea,&#xD;
      fatigue, and soft-tissue swelling (edema), especially in the face and lower legs, which are&#xD;
      the primary reasons for patients to discontinue TKI medication. Using a mobile text messaging&#xD;
      (TXT) intervention that emphasizes the importance of TKI compliance may improve TKI adherence&#xD;
      in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

    <measure>Acceptability of Mobile Involvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured through a satisfaction measure and patient interview data. Acceptability will be established by a group median score &gt;= 3 on the 1-4 satisfaction scale. Further, transcripts of the audio recorded post-intervention patient interviews will be analyzed using grounded theory and constant comparative methods. Analysis will examine patient perceptions of the usefulness and satisfaction with the txt4TKI intervention. After the research team reaches a consensus on a coding scheme, the principal investigator (PI) and the project manager will code independently the transcripts, examining patient's satisfaction with and evaluation of the txt4TKI intervention.</description>
