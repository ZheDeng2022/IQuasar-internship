  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of intravenous paracetamol and ibuprofen on postoperative pain and&#xD;
      morphine consumption in patients undergoing hysterectomy surgery and the side effects&#xD;
      associated with opioids.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All surgical procedures are associated with acute pain and inflammation, varying degrees of&#xD;
      severity for the patients, causing significant stres and discomfort. Effective postoperative&#xD;
      pain management in hysterectomy can reduce complications and improve postoperative care. In&#xD;
      postoperative pain, multimodal analgesic techniques are used to provide synergistic effects&#xD;
      through different nociceptive mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysterectomy is the second most common gynecological surgery performed after cesarean&#xD;
      section. It is known that effective postoperative analgesia management decreases&#xD;
      complications and increases patients' comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various analgesics are used for pain. Opioids, frequently used for postoperative pain, are&#xD;
      the most frequently used drug group. The combination of opioids with adjuvant agents may&#xD;
      reduce the opioid consumption used systemically. Side effects such as sedation, respiratory&#xD;
      depression, nausea, vomiting, rash and urinary retention that develop secondary to opioids&#xD;
      may also be reduced by the combination of supplemental analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant agents, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), may be used in&#xD;
      combination with opioids. NSAIDs do not only reduce pain, but also control the underlying&#xD;
      inflammatory process. In addition, combining NSAIDs and opioids can help reduce the side&#xD;
      effects by reducing administration of total opioid consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous ibuprofen is the first and only intravenous NSAID approved in the United States&#xD;
      for both pain and fever control in adults. It has been reported in multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that IV ibuprofen is safe and effective in&#xD;
      postoperative pain management for abdominal hysterectomy and orthopedic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous paracetamol is an analgesic and antipyretic agent used as a first step drug for&#xD;
      pain and fever control in adults and children. It has been clearly shown that IV paracetamol,&#xD;
      with analgesic efficacy and safety profile, reduces analgesic requirements for pain&#xD;
      management. It has also been shown that it provides better analgesic efficacy and reduces the&#xD;
      opioid consumption when used in combination with opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to compare the effects of intravenous paracetamol and ibuprofen on&#xD;
      postoperative pain and morphine consumption in patients undergoing hysterectomy surgery and&#xD;
      the side effects associated with opioids.&#xD;
