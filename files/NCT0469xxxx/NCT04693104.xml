  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group&#xD;
      clinical investigation is aimed to assess the safety and the clinical performance over 6&#xD;
      months of a single intra-articular injection of PVA Hydrogel, novel polyvinyl alcohol&#xD;
      preparation, as compared to hyalan G-F20, (Synvisc-One®) one of the most commonly used and&#xD;
      best performing hyaluronic acid based products, in patients with symptomatic knee&#xD;
      osteoarthitis (OA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of a single intra-articular injection of a novel polyvinyl alcohol&#xD;
      preparation (PVA Hydrogel) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisc-One®) in patients with symptomatic knee&#xD;
      OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with knee OA (ACR clinical and radiological criteria) symptoms for ≥6 months,&#xD;
      insufficient/failed response to analgesics, K&amp;L stage II-III (x-Rays within past 12 months),&#xD;
      a knee pain score of 4-9 (0-10 NRS) in the target knee and &lt;3 in the contralateral knee, will&#xD;
      be enrolled in a randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel group 26-week clinical&#xD;
      investigation to receive a single intra-articular injection of PVA Hydrogel or Synvisc-One®.&#xD;
      Safety (both at the injection site (primary end-point) and overall) and efficacy (change in&#xD;
      pain in the target knee (0-10 NRS), WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index (total and subscales) and&#xD;
      Patient's Global Assessment of knee OA (0-10 NRS)) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing an informed consent, patients will be screened at least 7 days before&#xD;
      randomisation, when they will received a single intra-articular injection of either PVA&#xD;
      Hydrogel or Synvisc-One® (1:1 allocation ratio) and will be then seen for follow-up 1, 2 and&#xD;
      4 days (this latter just in case of AE occurrence at the target knee) and 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and&#xD;
      26 weeks after IA injection.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Given the impossibility of obtaining identical presentations of the compared interventions, double-blind conditions will be ensured by appointing at each site one &quot;injector investigator&quot; in charge only of the administration of the treatments and one &quot;clinical assessor investigator&quot; as Outcome Assessor, in charge of all safety and efficacy assessments, who will remain always blinded to the treatment. Patient blinding will be ensured by avoiding visual access to the injection field by the use of a screen between the patient and his/her knee.</masking_description>
