  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the relative bioavailability, or the degree and rate at&#xD;
      which the drug is absorbed by the body of two cenobamate formulations (200 mg Oral Suspension&#xD;
      and a 200 mg Oral Tablet) and to assess the effect of food on the oral bioavailability of the&#xD;
      200 mg Oral Suspension. This study will also look at the safety and tolerability of the oral&#xD;
      suspension and the oral tablet under both fasted and fed conditions.&#xD;

      This study is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, single-center, three-period,&#xD;
      six-sequence, balanced crossover study in healthy male and female subjects to assess the&#xD;
      relative bioavailability of 200 mg of cenobamate given as an oral tablet or oral suspension&#xD;
      and to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of a 200 mg dose of cenobamate&#xD;
      given as an oral suspension in fasting and fed conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a 28-day screening period, followed by single dose administration of&#xD;
      cenobamate (tablet or suspension) on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 43, an assessment period of 62&#xD;
      days and a follow-up visit on Day 69. All subjects will be confined to the clinical site from&#xD;
      Day -1 (the day before period 1 dosing) until the morning of Day 4, Day 20 (the day of the&#xD;
      last PK sampling for period 1) until the morning of Day 25, and Day 41 (the day of the last&#xD;
      PK sampling for period 2) until the morning of Day 46. Outpatient visits will be performed&#xD;
      regularly until the 456-hour PK sampling for each period. The follow-up visit will occur on&#xD;
      Day 69 (±1 day).&#xD;
