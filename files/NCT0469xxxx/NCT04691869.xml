      The objective of this study is to determine whether patient follow up for osteoporosis is&#xD;
      aided using a quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the QUS measurement could potentially improve osteoporosis follow-up rates, and&#xD;
      in-office patient measurements have been previously shown to increase compliance with&#xD;
      treatment in other conditions. Increased compliance with follow-ups and medication&#xD;
      recommendations have been shown to decrease fracture rates in patients with osteoporosis.&#xD;

      Over 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, which is defined as a chronic, progressive&#xD;
      disease presenting with deterioration of bone tissue and fragility subsequently leading to an&#xD;
      increased fracture risk1. A positive diagnosis for osteoporosis is significantly correlated&#xD;
      with increased age, making geriatrics patients an at-risk group for bone health&#xD;
      complications2. A pathophysiological diagnosis for osteoporosis is done radiographically&#xD;
      based on bone mineral density from a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry assessment (DXA)3. DXA&#xD;
      scans have been used increasingly over time in geriatric populations to screen patients for&#xD;
      osteoporosis4; however, one problem with DXA scans is the radiation dose due to x-ray&#xD;
      radiography4. Therefore, using DXA scans as a preliminary screening method comes with risks,&#xD;
      even though it is the gold standard for diagnosis3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is often referred to as a silent disease because people are not aware that they&#xD;
      have low bone density9. The first sign may be loss of height but can also be a fracture due&#xD;
      to a ground level mechanical fall. As people age, their bones lose their strength (density)&#xD;
      and become more brittle2,10. Unfortunately, fractures can have devastating effects on&#xD;
      people's quality of life causing chronic pain, difficulties with mobility, need for increased&#xD;
      assistance, isolation, increased nursing home placement and rates of death10. Also, once a&#xD;
      person has fallen and had a fragility fracture, they are likely to do so again10. Our goal is&#xD;
      to encourage older adult patients to follow-up with their doctors to discuss osteoporosis&#xD;
      screening, diagnosis, and treatment to help reduce the prevalence of fragility fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis follow-up rates need to be improved in geriatric populations. Increased&#xD;
      compliance with follow-ups and medication recommendations have been shown to decrease&#xD;
      fracture rates in this population5. In-office patient measurements have been previously shown&#xD;
      to increase compliance with treatment. In the case of smoking, carbon monoxide (CO) monitors&#xD;
      increased a patient's willingness to comply with cessation protocols significantly in an&#xD;
      orthopedic fracture population6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative ultrasound scans (QUS) have emerged as a simple point-of-care test for bone&#xD;
      density. 7 For a quantitative ultrasound scan, the patient sits in a chair and places their&#xD;
      heel on specialized ultrasound machine in a manner similar to having the size of the foot&#xD;
      measured at a department store. The machine is portable and can be performed at the bedside.&#xD;
      Prior research has demonstrated that, although QUS cannot replace DXA scans as the gold&#xD;
      standard for diagnosis of osteopenia, it can still be used to immediately identify abnormal&#xD;
      bone density8. Integrating QUS scans into geriatric fracture treatment comes at little risk,&#xD;
      and, similar to home CO monitoring for smoking cessation, may provide additional information&#xD;
      to the patient to encourage further action.&#xD;
