  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While most bereaved individuals cope adaptively with the loss of a loved one, a significant&#xD;
      minority experiences more severe and complicated grief reactions. Complicated grief reactions&#xD;
      is an umbrella term for different types of post-loss complications, including symptoms of&#xD;
      Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. These&#xD;
      post-loss complications may all cause persistent suffering and functional impairment, thus&#xD;
      pointing to a need for efficacious treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a relatively well-documented efficacious&#xD;
      treatment for symptoms of PGD, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress in the period&#xD;
      after a loss, the relative efficacy of a transdiagnostic individually delivered versus&#xD;
      group-based CBT for these types of complicated grief reactions (CBTgrief) remain unknown.&#xD;
      Furthermore, little evidence exists about the relative cost-effectiveness of individually&#xD;
      delivered versus group-based CBTgrief and why and how it works. The theory of CBTgrief&#xD;
      proposes that it works by targeting three maintaining mechanisms in PGD: 1) Insufficient&#xD;
      integration of the loss, 2) negative loss-related cognitions, and 3) depressive and anxious&#xD;
      avoidance. These maintaining mechanisms have also shown to be statistically associated with&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress in the period after a loss, suggesting that&#xD;
      different types of complicated grief reactions might share some of the same maintaining&#xD;
      mechanisms. However, this proposed theory of change has yet to be empirically tested as a&#xD;
      whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These knowledge gaps are crucial for the understanding of efficacious and cost-effective&#xD;
      treatment formats as well as central treatment mechanisms in the psychological treatment of&#xD;
      complicated grief reactions. The present study thus aims to examine the relative efficacy of&#xD;
      an individually delivered versus group-based CBTgrief by means of a randomized&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial. Secondary aims include an investigation of the relative&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of individually delivered versus group-based CBTgrief as well as treatment&#xD;
      mediators. Finally, explorative analyses of potential moderators of intervention effects of&#xD;
      CBTgrief will be conducted.&#xD;

      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the relative efficacy of an individually delivered versus group-based CBTgrief.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of an individually delivered versus group-based&#xD;
           CBTgrief.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the theoretically proposed treatment mediators of CBTgrief.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore loss-related and sociodemographic characteristics as possible moderators of&#xD;
           intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both individually delivered and group-based CBTgrief show statistically significant&#xD;
      reductions in symptoms of PGD, and group-based CBTgrief will show non-inferiority (i.e.,&#xD;
      equal efficacy) compared to individually delivered CBTgrief at post-intervention and at six&#xD;
      months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Both individually delivered and group-based CBTgrief show statistically significant&#xD;
           reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress, and group-based&#xD;
           CBTgrief will show non-inferiority (i.e., equal efficacy) compared to individually&#xD;
           delivered CBTgrief at post-intervention and at six months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group-based CBTgrief will be more cost-effective than individually delivered CBTgrief.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The observed effect of CBTgrief is mediated by changes in theoretically proposed&#xD;
           maintaining mechanisms of complicated grief reactions (i.e. insufficient integration of&#xD;
           the loss; negative loss-related cognitions; depressive and anxious avoidance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gender, level of education, age, baseline grief symptom level, type of loss,&#xD;
           circumstances of the loss, time since loss, and number of additional losses will&#xD;
           moderate the observed effects of CBTgrief.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Additional exploratory analyses include an additional matched comparison group, who have&#xD;
           not received treatment in order to compare the effect of individual and group-based&#xD;
           CBTgrief to a non-treatment group. This group will be extracted from a large-scale&#xD;
           survey study: The Aarhus Bereavement Study (NCT03049007). Here, it is hypothesized that&#xD;
           CBTgrief will have a statistically significant medium size effect on symptoms of PGD,&#xD;
           both at post treatment and six months follow-up compared to a matched comparison group,&#xD;
           who did not receive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The present study is conducted as a randomized non-inferiority trial, with a 1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio to individually delivered versus group-based CBTgrief using block&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants are recruited from the Danish National Center for Grief (DNCG),&#xD;
      which is a Danish national organization that provide specialized psychological therapy to&#xD;
      bereaved individuals who have lost a loved one. The therapists at the DNCG will screen and&#xD;
      treat bereaved elderly people for complicated grief reactions with CBTgrief at their clinics&#xD;
      in Odense and Copenhagen, Denmark. DNCG identifies participants through consultants, local&#xD;
      practitioners, self-referral, and the DNCG grief support line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment points: Participants will be assessed at pre-, mid-, and post-intervention as well&#xD;
      as at three and six months follow-up (T1-T5). Additionally, data on healthcare utilization&#xD;
      will be retrieved from the Danish national registers concerning use of health care services&#xD;
      such as visits to general practitioners, psychologists etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A group sample size of 2x64 will enable us to detect non-inferiority between&#xD;
      individually delivered and group-based CBTgrief with a non-inferiority of -0.5 SD on the&#xD;
      primary outcome, i.e. symptoms of PGD, and a statistical power of 0.80. The true difference&#xD;
      is assumed to be 0.0 and the one-sided significance level (alpha) of the test is 0.025. Based&#xD;
      on an estimated dropout rate of 20% the total number of participants needed to recruit is&#xD;
      N=160 participants.&#xD;
