  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical study at the Dallas Veterans Affairs, is being proposed to test the efficacy of a&#xD;
      novel electrical stimulation platform named the Pro-Sport Ultra® device by AVAZZIA to reduce&#xD;
      pain and increase activity level in patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to document the possible short- and long-term decrease&#xD;
      in pain as scored by participants on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) after use of Avazzia&#xD;
      PRO-Sport Ultra® device with pulsed microcurrent in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a clinical diagnosis of Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee for a minimum of 6&#xD;
      months will be recruited for this study. Their OA has not responded/is not responding to&#xD;
      treatment and continuing symptoms interfere with normal function. Additionally, patients will&#xD;
      have a pain score of 3 or greater on the NRS even with pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include changes in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mobility via a Timed Up &amp; Go assessment (TUG). Participants are timed getting up from&#xD;
           sitting in a standard armchair, walking approximately 3 meters, turning, walking back to&#xD;
           the chair, and sitting down.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-relevant outcomes via the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).&#xD;
           The KOOS is self-administered and assesses five outcomes: pain, symptoms, activities of&#xD;
           daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of pain medication.&#xD;

    <description>Mobility will be assessed via Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG) assessment during visits #1, 12, 13. Participants are timed getting up from sitting in a standard armchair, walking approximately 3 meters, turning, walking back to the chair, and sitting down.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-relevant outcomes will be assessed via the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) during visits #1, 12 and 13. The KOOS is self-administered and assesses five outcomes: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life. KOOS does not use a numerical scale, it uses a qualitative scale with the following options: never, rarely, sometimes, often and always.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in brief pain inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The brief pain inventory (BPI) will be used to assess changes in pain during visits #1, 12, and 13. This scale ranges from 0 to 10. The numerical value 0 can represent &quot;no pain&quot; or &quot;does not interfere&quot;. The numerical value 10 can represent &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or completely interferes&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the use of pain medication</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Medication usage will be recorded during visits #1, 12, 13 and any increase/decrease in pain medications will be assessed.</description>
