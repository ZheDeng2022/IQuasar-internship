  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating an intervention, which the investigators call &quot;Optimize End of Life&#xD;
      (EOL) Care at Home,&quot; that entails remote patient monitoring and home-based supportive care&#xD;
      for patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a single arm pilot feasibility study, which is the first-time&#xD;
      investigators are examining this care at home intervention in patients with advanced&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, questionnaires, remote&#xD;
      patient monitoring (e.g. patient-reported symptoms, home monitored vital signs) and hospital&#xD;
      care at home (e.g. providing maximal supportive care to to address and manage patients'&#xD;
      symptoms) and structured communications oncology clinicians to optimize end of life care for&#xD;
      patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Enrolled patients with advanced hematologic malignancies receiving the end of life (EOL)&#xD;
      care at home intervention; 2) caregivers of these patients; and 3) oncology clinicians caring&#xD;
      for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this research study for approximately six months after consent. It is&#xD;
      expected that about 30 patients, 30 caregivers, and 15 oncology clinicians will take part in&#xD;
      this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medically Home company is supporting this research study by providing funding.&#xD;
