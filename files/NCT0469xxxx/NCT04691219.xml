  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 12-week, open-label, randomized, controlled trial investigating effect of mulberry leaves&#xD;
      plus lifestyle intervention on glycemic control compare with lifestyle intervention alone in&#xD;
      patients with obesity and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes remains a common leading cause of morbidity and mortality among population worldwide&#xD;
      over decades. Obesity, a crucial risk factors for developing T2DM, commonly exists with&#xD;
      insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function. Early management in individuals at high&#xD;
      risk of T2DM should be therefore considered for preventing or delaying the progression of&#xD;
      diabetes and diabetic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), the major antihyperglycemic compound of mulberry leaves,&#xD;
      inhibits alpha-glucosidase activities, ingestion of mulberry leaves results in the&#xD;
      suppression of postprandial hyperglycemia. Long-term effects of mulberry leaves on glycemic&#xD;
      profiles have been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies; however, the results were&#xD;
      controversial. In addition, no study was conducted in patients with obesity. As a result,&#xD;
      this open-label, randomized controlled study aims to investigate efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      mulberry leaves in combination with lifestyle intervention (diet control) on glycemic control&#xD;
      in non-diabetic patients with obesity and patients with early-stage T2DM. Efficacy of the&#xD;
      interventions will be assessed based on the changes in glycemic indexes, expression of&#xD;
      proteins related to insulin resistance and T2DM, and lipid profiles. Meanwhile, safety will&#xD;
      be measured by the changes in renal and hepatic enzymes and patient-self reports. The&#xD;
      outcomes will be monitored at 4-week interval throughout 12 weeks of the study period.&#xD;
