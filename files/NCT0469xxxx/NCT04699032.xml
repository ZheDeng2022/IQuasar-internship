      Study of pharmacokinetics and safety of apraglutide in participants with normal and impaired&#xD;
      kidney function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two stage design, open label, multi-center, non-randomized trial to evaluate the PK and&#xD;
      safety of a single subcutaneous dose of 5 mg apraglutide in subjects with varying degrees of&#xD;
      renal function. The renal function will be calculated by the estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate (eGFR) according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Creatinine&#xD;
      Equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: 8 subjects with severe renal impairment (Cohort 1) and 8 subjects with normal renal&#xD;
      function (Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: 8 subjects with moderate (Cohort 3) and 8 subjects with mild (Cohort 4). Part 2 will&#xD;
      be conducted if the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of AUC-inf or AUC_last for the severe renal&#xD;
      impairment group compared to the control group is ≥2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to apraglutide in subjects with severe renal impairment was not increased compared&#xD;
      to that of healthy subjects. Therefore, Part 2 was not performed.&#xD;
