    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open label, &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation, phase I study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of EXP039 in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      Lymphoma. 10 patients are planned to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect&#xD;
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of EXP039. Following manufacture of the drug&#xD;
      product, subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      prior to EXP039 infusion. All subjects who have received EXP039 infusion will be followed for&#xD;
      up to 12 months.&#xD;
