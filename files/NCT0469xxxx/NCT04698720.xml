  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most serious complications of diabetes and can lead&#xD;
      to amputations in 85% of cases, resulting in physical, psychological, family, social and&#xD;
      economic consequences. Research suggests that psychological factors may play an important&#xD;
      role in DFU healing. Relaxation and hypnosis seem to contribute to faster wound healing. More&#xD;
      research is needed to assess the effectiveness of different types of intervention on&#xD;
      different types of wounds, in particular chronic wounds such as DFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of relaxation and hypnosis, both with guided imagery,&#xD;
      in DFU healing, physiological (inflammatory, metabolic, oxidative stress, angiogenic, and&#xD;
      miRNA biomarkers) of wound healing prognosis and QoL, in patients with diabetic foot and a&#xD;
      chronic ulcer. This study is a Randomized Controlled Study of a Psychological Intervention&#xD;
      that aims to evaluate the efficiency of a muscle relaxation intervention with guided imagery&#xD;
      (experimental group - EG1) compare to a hypnosis intervention with guided imagery&#xD;
      (experimental group - EG2) and a neutral guided imagery placebo (active control group - ACG)&#xD;
      and a group that does not receive any psychological intervention (passive control group -&#xD;
      PCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also examine, qualitatively, the perspectives of patients with DFU on the&#xD;
      hypnosis intervention, in order to check its effectiveness; as well as the perspectives of&#xD;
      informal caregivers on this adjuvant therapy. Participants have a diagnosis of Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus and Diabetic Foot; one or two chronic ulcers active at the time of assessment; and&#xD;
      clinical levels of stress or anxiety or depression. Participants will be randomized by the&#xD;
      four conditions - EG1, EG2, ACG and PCG - and assessed on the day of the first consultation&#xD;
      or nursing treatment for chronic DFU (T0), two months later (T1), and six months later (T2;&#xD;
      follow-up). Two weeks after T1, an interview will be conducted with patients with DFU that&#xD;
      benefited from the hypnosis sessions and to the informal caregivers who provided them the DFU&#xD;
      care. The results of the present study will contribute for a better understanding of DFU&#xD;
      progression, healing, prevention of re-ulceration and future amputations and, consequently,&#xD;
      for the improvement of patients' quality of life.&#xD;

      General Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT aims to assess the effectiveness of a muscle relaxation intervention with guided&#xD;
      imagery (EG1) compared to hypnosis with guided imagery intervention (EG2) and a neutral&#xD;
      guided imagery placebo (ACG) and a group that does not receive any psychological intervention&#xD;
      (PCG), in DFU healing, physiological of wound healing prognosis and Quality of life, in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic foot and a chronic ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also examine, qualitatively, the perspectives of patients with DFU regarding&#xD;
      the interventions (EG1 and EG2) in order to check its effectiveness; as well as the&#xD;
      perspectives of informal caregivers on this adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the impact of both experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) on psychological stress&#xD;
           markers, in DFU healing, physiological indicators (inflammatory, metabolic, oxidative&#xD;
           stress, angiogenic, and miRNA biomarkers) healing prognosis and QoL compared to the&#xD;
           (PCG); between pre and post intervention in the EG1 and EG2, controlling for clinical&#xD;
           and sociodemographic variables, adherence to DFU care and patients' literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualitative study nested in RCT specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess psychological markers (anxiety, depression and stress), physiological&#xD;
           indicators of healing prognosis (markers inflammatory diseases, biochemical parameters,&#xD;
           angiogenic markers, micro RNAs, and T lymphocyte populations), adherence to UPD care,&#xD;
           degree of UPD healing, QOL and family support / care informal, over time in patients&#xD;
           with chronic DFU undergoing EG1 versus patients undergoing EG2 versus patients&#xD;
           undergoing PCG and versus patients undergoing ACG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the evolution of psychological stress markers, physiological indicators of&#xD;
           healing prognosis, adherence to UPD care, QOL and family support / informal care in&#xD;
           patients with chronic DFU undergoing EG1, comparing a case with a positive evolution&#xD;
           (healing of the DFU) with a case with a negative evolution ( DFU healing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the evolution of psychological stress markers, physiological indicators of&#xD;
           healing prognosis, adherence to UPD care, QOL and family support / informal care in&#xD;
           patients with chronic DFU undergoing EG2, comparing a case with a positive evolution&#xD;
           (healing of the DFU) with a case with a negative evolution ( DFU healing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation considering the average effect size of 0.5, a statistical power&#xD;
      of 80% and a significance level of 5%, and the number of variables in structural equation&#xD;
      models, revealed that 12 participants were needed in each of the groups (12X4), totalizing 48&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor or nurse, in the medical appointment, identifies patients that meet the medical&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Patients are invited to participate in the study by the Researcher at the&#xD;
      end of the medical appointment and are informed about the aims of the study and the voluntary&#xD;
      nature of participation through informed and informative consent. If patients agree to&#xD;
      participate, they will sign the consent form. Nurses will then complete RESVECH 2.0 at the&#xD;
      end of the appointment and doctors will complete the clinical questionnaire. Afterwards, the&#xD;
      Researcher will accompany the patient to a room provided by the Hospital in order to&#xD;
      administer the battery of questionnaires in the interview format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After answering the questionnaires, the researcher will score the PSS and HADS instruments to&#xD;
      identify the presence of significant clinical levels of stress, anxiety and depression, and&#xD;
      if the patient is eligible, at the end of that week, the participant will be randomized into&#xD;
      one of four possible groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the next diabetic foot appointment, the respective participant will be informed about the&#xD;
      group to which he or she has been allocated and whether will benefit, if appropriate, from&#xD;
      four sessions of relaxation (EG1), from four sessions of hypnosis (EG2) or neutral guided&#xD;
      imagery (ACG) or a group that does not receive any psychological intervention (PCG). If the&#xD;
      participant is available, the first session will take place on the same day. The following&#xD;
      sessions will be scheduled according to the medical diabetic foot consultations. In each&#xD;
      session, two assessments of blood pressure and heart rate will be performed, before starting&#xD;
      the session and at the end of the session. At the end of the fourth session, the T1&#xD;
      assessment will be performed, with a new administration of the questionnaires. Six months&#xD;
      after T0, the T2 (follow-up) evaluation will take place, with the last administration of the&#xD;
      questionnaires. At T0, T1 and T2 a blood and DFU swab sample will be collected for the&#xD;
      evaluation of the physiology variables. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s&#xD;
      will be separated from the blood samples and frozen at -80ºC for analysis by the biochemical&#xD;
      team member. Blood lymphocyte populations will be analyzed by flow cytometry and the&#xD;
      quantification of blood cell populations will be performed by an automated hematological cell&#xD;
      counter on fresh blood samples. The medical and nurse team member as well as the lab&#xD;
      techniques will not be aware of which group participants belong to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews with patients, who completed the four sessions of (EG1) and (EG2), and with&#xD;
      informal caregivers, will be conducted two weeks after T1, by a different researcher than the&#xD;
      one involved in the intervention, to reduce the bias of social desirability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All standard statistical analyses will be done using the IBM SPSS statistics 24 and IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Amos 24. The comparison between (PCG) and (EG1) and (EG2) and (ACG) over time, will be&#xD;
      analyzed through Generalized Mixed Models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semi-structured interview guide consisting of open-ended questions will be administered to&#xD;
      patients with DFU that benefited from interventions (EG1, EG2) and the informal caregivers&#xD;
      indicated by the patient that help with DFU care. This script will remain unchanged&#xD;
      throughout the interviews. The audio recording of the interviews will be done using a tablet,&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim and anonymized in order to safeguard participants and data&#xD;
      confidentiality. The transcripts of the interviews will be analyzed in the same order as&#xD;
      conducted, using the thematic content analysis technique.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Parallel Assignment This is a Randomized Controlled Study of a Psychological Intervention (Grant et al., 2018). This study will use a mixed-methods approach nested in a 4-arm randomized control design. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected in order to provide better understanding about the effectiveness of the hypnosis intervention in patients with DFU.&#xD;
Participants will be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 for the four conditions - EG1, EG2, ACG and PCG; and will be evaluated on the day of the first chronic DFU appointment or nursing treatment (T0), two months later (at the end of the intervention in EG, EG2 and ACG; T1), as well as six months later (T2) in a follow-up evaluation. Participants from all four groups will undergo standard treatment for the DFU, according to the guidelines of the Portuguese General Health Direction (DGS, 2010) and the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF, 2015).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor) Eligible participants will be randomized into the four groups into blocks of variable size, multiples of three; and will be stratified according to: i) data collection site; ii) Chronic Renal Disease; and iii) Peripheral Arterial Disease; because they are factors of poor prognosis in the DFU healing (Ferreira et al., 2014). This procedure will be performed using an online random number generator, by a researcher external to the team involved in the implementation of this study, in order to ensure the concealment of the allocation of participants by the various groups (Pandis, 2012). After this procedure, it will not be possible to conceal the group to which the patient belongs from the researcher who will perform the psychological intervention. However, health professionals (doctors and nurses) will be blinded during the entire procedure, because they fill in the RESVECH 2.0, which assesses the DFU healing.</masking_description>

    <description>Relaxation intervention session begins with diaphragmatic breathing, followed by Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation, which involves the contraction and subsequent relaxation of the 16 muscle groups of the body (forearm, arm, upper forehead, eye, mouth, jaw and throat, neck, shoulder, chest, stomach, thigh, leg and foot).The contraction is performed for 7 seconds while the relaxation lasts for about 40 to 50 seconds.The relaxation of the foot muscle group is only performed on the healthy foot, because dressing and bandages may bandage the foot with the DFU, which together with the typical joint stiffness of the diabetic foot, make it difficult to perform. After muscle relaxation, begins the guided imagery focused on DFU healing. The patient is instructed to think about his/her current state of health and to imagine the DFU as a dark area and the healing relaxation as a light associated to pleasant sensations, which will focus on the foot with DFU to heal it.</description>

The four sessions train the participants in visual, auditory and kinesthetic perception on ulcer healing. The protocol also promotes medical treatment acceptance.</description>

    <intervention_name>Neutral Guided Imagery</intervention_name>
    <description>This placebo consists on neutral guided imagery focused on themes of the patient's daily life before having DFU. Each session has a theme associated with the patient's life - family, work, friends and leisure. Initially, the patient is asked to think about an event related to the theme of the session of his/her choice, be it positive or negative, which occurred before patient has the current DFU. Then, questions are asked which allow a more detailed reconstruction of the event and the patient is asked to imagine according only to the instructions given. When the whole episode is remembered, the patient is asked to tell what he or she imagined/remembered in each of the questions given.</description>
