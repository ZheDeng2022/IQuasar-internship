  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction continues to be a major source of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients with ESRD. Thrombosis is the most common cause of secondary vascular&#xD;
      access failure Although intimal hyperplasia at the outflow vein is the most common cause of&#xD;
      thrombosis, 20-40% of thrombosis may develop secondary without underlying anatomic&#xD;
      abnormalities. Low-flow states secondary to low BP have been proposed to precipitate access&#xD;
      thrombosis. In previous studies, lower pre- and post- dialysis SBP are associated with a&#xD;
      higher rate of access thrombosis. Nonetheless, high blood pressure is also a well-known risk&#xD;
      factor for arteriosclerosis, intimal hyperplasia, and thrombotic vascular events. In dialysis&#xD;
      patients, the relation between blood pressure and thrombosis seems to be more complex, and&#xD;
      few studies have delineated the effect of blood pressure in a systematic manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the static component of blood pressure, blood pressure variability (BPV) is&#xD;
      increasingly accepted as a novel risk factors for vascular disease. BPV is categorized as&#xD;
      either long or short term. In dialysis patients, long-term BPV is typically defined on the&#xD;
      basis of BP measurements taken at the start of hemodialysis (inter-dialysis BPV); short-term&#xD;
      BPV is usually considered in terms of variability during hemodialysis (intra-dialysis BPV).&#xD;
      BP variability is increased in ESRD patients and is associated with adverse outcomes. To the&#xD;
      best of our knowledge, only one study by Cheung et al focused on intra-dialytic BPV, which&#xD;
      found intradialytic hypotension to be a risk factor for access thrombosis. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      access thrombotic events rarely occur during the dialysis session. It remained unclear that&#xD;
      if inter-dialysis BPV is a more relevant factor for access thrombosis. Answer to this&#xD;
      question is of clinical significance because the optimal BP target after PTA remained&#xD;
      unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of BP variability on the outcomes&#xD;
      of hemodialysis vascular access, major cardiovascular events in maintenance hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. We also aimed to evaluate the determinants of BPV in hemodialysis patients,&#xD;
      including medication, frailty, fluid status and autonomic function. The impact of autonomic&#xD;
      function and frailty on the outcomes of vascular access and cardiovascular events will be&#xD;
      evaluated as well.&#xD;

      Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction continues to be a major source of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients with ESRD1. After the publication of the dialysis outcome quality&#xD;
      initiative guidelines, endovascular interventions gradually replaced surgical revisions as&#xD;
      the primary treatment of dysfunctional dialysis access2. Although percutaneous transluminal&#xD;
      angioplasty (PTA) can achieve a high success rate, recurrent stenosis and thrombosis are&#xD;
      usually inevitable3, 4. As a result, repeated interventions are required and cause a&#xD;
      substantial financial burden on the health care system. Intimal hyperplasia at the outflow&#xD;
      vein is the most common cause of vascular access dysfunction5. Thrombosis may develop&#xD;
      secondary to outflow venous stenosis, but it can also develop without underlying anatomic&#xD;
      abnormalities6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombosis is the most common cause of secondary vascular access failure (i.e., failure of&#xD;
      functioning vascular access) and is associated with luminal stenosis in 60% to 80% of cases.&#xD;
      However, because 20% to 40% of cases of access thrombosis occur in the absence of stenosis,&#xD;
      and because not all stenotic accesses thrombose, other factors must contribute to access&#xD;
      thrombosis.7 Among other factors, low-flow states secondary to low BP have been proposed to&#xD;
      precipitate access thrombosis.8 These putative causes of access thrombosis make intuitive&#xD;
      sense, but few studies have actually examined these factors in a systematic manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relation between blood pressure and access thrombosis is complex. Very few studies have&#xD;
      addressed on this issue. Unlike in the general population, blood pressure is not linearly&#xD;
      associated with adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients. Traditionally, high blood pressure&#xD;
      is a well-known risk factors of intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis. Nonetheless, lower BP may&#xD;
      also lead to decreased access blood flow, which has been shown to independently predict&#xD;
      subsequent access thrombosis.9 In addition to the static component of blood pressure, blood&#xD;
      pressure variability (BPV) is closely associated with adverse outcomes in patients with or at&#xD;
      risk of vascular disease than 'usual' BP.10 They may play a causal role in the progression of&#xD;
      organ damage and in triggering vascular events. BPV is categorized as either long or short&#xD;
      term, based on the time interval over which it is considered.11 Long term BPV is usually&#xD;
      measured as visit-to-visit BPV and can be considered in intervals of days, weeks or months.&#xD;
      In the dialysis patients, the long term BPV is typically defined on the basis of BP&#xD;
      measurements taken at the start of hemodialysis treatment (inter-dialytic BPV). Short-term&#xD;
      BPV is usually measured by ambulatory BP monitoring or during specified short-time intervals.&#xD;
      Among dialysis patients, short-term BPV can be considered in terms of variability that&#xD;
      occurred during hemodialysis treatment (intra-dialytic BPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 BP variability is known to be increased in patients with ESRD.12 Among patients undergoing&#xD;
      hemodialysis, potential causes of high BP variability such as baroreceptor dysfunction,&#xD;
      aortic stiffness, and variations in intravascular volume, as well as plausible outcomes such&#xD;
      as cerebral small-vessel disease, cerebral hemorrhage, and cardiac sudden death are increased&#xD;
      compared to the general population.13, 14 Therefore, increased BP variability may provide a&#xD;
      potential explanation for access thrombosis among patients undergoing hemodialysis.&#xD;
      Currently, only one study by Cheung et al has focused on the effect of BP variability. Lower&#xD;
      pre-and post- dialysis SBP is associated with a higher rate of access thrombosis, consistent&#xD;
      with previous studies.15, 16 More importantly, intradialytic hypotension is also a risk&#xD;
      factor for access thrombosis and may account for some of the 20% to 40% of cases without&#xD;
      obvious structural abnormalities.16 Nonetheless, most access thrombotic events did not occur&#xD;
      during the dialysis session. It remained unclear if inter-dialysis BP variability is also a&#xD;
      risk factor for vascular access thrombosis. The answer to these queries is of therapeutic&#xD;
      relevance because the achievement of the recommended target BP in dialysis patients may be&#xD;
      associated with higher rates of inter- or intra-dialytic hypotension.17 Accordingly, we aimed&#xD;
      to investigate the effect of intra-dialysis BPV, inter-dialysis BPV, and intra-dialysis&#xD;
      hypotension on thrombosis of hemodialysis vascular access.We also aimed to evaluate the&#xD;
      determinants of BPV in hemodialysis patients, including medication, frailty, fluid status and&#xD;
      autonomic function. The impact of autonomic function and frailty on the outcomes of vascular&#xD;
      access and cardiovascular events will be evaluated as well.&#xD;
