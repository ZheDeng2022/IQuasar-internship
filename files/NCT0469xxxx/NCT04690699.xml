  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, single arm basket study evaluating the&#xD;
      administration of PVSRIPO ± anti programmed cell death protein 1 (PD 1)/programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD L1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (which will be referred to throughout this&#xD;
      protocol as &quot;anti-PD-1/L1 therapy&quot;) therapy in adult patients with solid tumor cancers.&#xD;
      Bladder Cancer and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma have been selected as the first&#xD;
      tumor specific cancers of interest for enrollment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each solid tumor cancer, a Phase 1 evaluation of the safety and tolerability of PVSRIPO&#xD;
      monotherapy intratumoral injections will be completed prior to initiation of enrollment in&#xD;
      the Phase 2 portion of the study where the anti-tumor efficacy of PVSRIPO in combination with&#xD;
      anti PD 1/L1 therapy will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      This section focuses on those aspects of the study design specific to patients with bladder&#xD;
      cancer. Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled: Cohort A will include cisplatin refusal or&#xD;
      ineligible patients with resectable MIBC being treated in the neoadjuvant setting and Cohort&#xD;
      B will include patients with bladder cancer being treated in the 1st/2nd line&#xD;
      unresectable/metastatic setting. The Phase 1 portion of the study (PVSRIPO monotherapy) will&#xD;
      only enroll patients from Cohort A. Once the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) has&#xD;
      evaluated the safety of the patients enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study and&#xD;
      determined it is &quot;safe to proceed&quot;, then the Phase 2 portion of the study&#xD;
      (PVSRIPO/pembrolizumab combination) will open. Approximately 6 patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Cohort A), and 50 patients will be enrolled in Phase 2 (25 patients in Cohort A and&#xD;
      25 patients in Cohort B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      This section focuses on those aspects of study design specific to patients with HNSCC. Two&#xD;
      cohorts of patients will be enrolled in this portion of the study. Cohort C will include&#xD;
      patients with resectable, locally advanced HNSCC (LA-HNSCC) being treated in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting and Cohort D will include patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC being&#xD;
      treated in the 1st line setting. The 6 patients to be enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the&#xD;
      study (PVSRIPO monotherapy) may be composed of patients meeting the eligibility criteria for&#xD;
      either Cohort C or Cohort D. Once the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) has evaluated&#xD;
      the safety of the patients enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study and determined it is&#xD;
      &quot;safe to proceed&quot;, then the Phase 2 portion of the study (PVSRIPO/anti-PD-1/L1 combination)&#xD;
      will open. Approximately 6 patients will be enrolled in Phase 1 (Cohort C and D), and 50&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in Phase 2 (25 patients in Cohort C and 25 patients in Cohort D).&#xD;

          3. Received prior treatment with an agent directed to another stimulatory or&#xD;
             co-inhibitory T-cell receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TURBT does not qualify as a major surgery/procedure or open biopsy (see exclusion&#xD;
        criterion in master protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Head and Neck Cancer Specific Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both Cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must have an injectable lesion measuring ≥ 1.0 cm in at least one diameter that is&#xD;
             visible, palpable, or detectable by ultrasound. Lesions located in sites considered to&#xD;
             be of more significant risk for complications from PVSRIPO injection and associated&#xD;
             inflammation are not to be injected. Examples include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Lesions located in the liver, lung, pancreas, bowel, and other visceral organs&#xD;
                  are not considered injectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Lesions encasing or immediately adjacent to major blood vessels including the&#xD;
                  carotid artery are not considered injectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Lesions that have been treated with curative levels of radiation and have not&#xD;
                  healed from radiation-associated toxicities are not considered injectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Documentation of p16-positive or p16-negative disease by CLIA/CAP-approved test to&#xD;
             determine HPV status of tumor for HNSCC of the oropharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Note: If local results are not available, then a sample (tissue on microscopic&#xD;
                  slides, tissue block or a fresh tissue biopsy in formalin) should be sent to the&#xD;
                  central laboratory for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Note: Oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx cancer are not required to undergo HPV&#xD;
                  testing by p16 testing as by convention these tumor locations are assumed to be&#xD;
                  HPV negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimen (from archival or new biopsy&#xD;
             if collection date of archival specimen &gt; 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) with an&#xD;
             associated pathology report documenting the histology of the tumor type of interest&#xD;
             must be confirmed to be available to send to the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Must have a minimum of 15 unstained, freshly cut, serial sections from an FFPE&#xD;
                  tumor specimen (or FFPE block equivalent) available.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If fewer than 15 slides are available at baseline, the patient may still be&#xD;
                  eligible upon discussion with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must have at least 1 lesion amenable to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. The lesion must be safely accessible as determined by the investigator and should&#xD;
             not be located at sites that require significant risk procedures to biopsy. Examples&#xD;
             of sites considered to be of significant risk include but are not limited to: biopsies&#xD;
             of the brain, lung, mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic procedures extending beyond&#xD;
             the esophagus, stomach, or bowel wall.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  drug NOTE: this criterion is an exception to Exclusion Criterion #10 in the&#xD;
                  master protocol (Section 4.2) stating patients with an active HIV infection are&#xD;
                  excluded from enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a history of chronic HCV are eligible to enroll provided the following&#xD;
             criteria have been met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have completed curative antiviral treatment OR been on established antiviral&#xD;
                  therapy for HCV for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Have an HCV RNA viral load below the limit of quantification. NOTE: this&#xD;
                  criterion is an exception to Exclusion Criterion #10 in the master protocol&#xD;
                  (Section 4.2) stating patients with an active HCV infection are excluded from&#xD;
                  enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a history of HBV infection are eligible to enroll provided the following&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Have an HBV DNA viral load below the lower limit of quantification. NOTE: this&#xD;
                  criterion is an exception to Exclusion Criterion #10 in the master protocol&#xD;
                  (Section 4.2) stating patients with an active HBV infection are excluded from&#xD;
                  enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
