  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The cardinal&#xD;
      symptoms of PD are tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and dementia are also one of the key features of the non-motor symptoms of PD. At&#xD;
      present, the mainstream treatment of PD-dementia is the dopaminergic rivastigmine. Repetitive&#xD;
      transcortical magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel non-invasive intervention. Through the&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation, brain neurons could be activated by the electrical current. The&#xD;
      application of rTMS had been approved by US FDA for the treatment of depression. The possible&#xD;
      effect of rTMS may result from the stimulation-related neuronal plasticity. Regarding PD,&#xD;
      rTMS also had been found to had some effect on different motor symptoms and cognition. The&#xD;
      present study would like to test the accumulative effect of rTMS on cognition of PD. All the&#xD;
      study subjects will receive rTMS under intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) mode at&#xD;
      supplementary motor area (SMA). Cognitive bahevorial tests and other motor/depression&#xD;
      assessments will be assessed before and after the intervention.&#xD;

      The present trial is designed as an open-label, uncontrolled pilot study for evaluating the&#xD;
      effect of rTMS on cognitive function in people with Parkinson disease (PD). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the change of cognitive function, and the secondary endpoint is the improvement&#xD;
      of motor symptoms. All participants need to complete the informed consent before they are&#xD;
      enrolled into the trial. Preliminary data including age, sex, education, employment, medical&#xD;
      history, drug history, disease duration, modified Hoehn-Yahr stage, and UPDRS score are&#xD;
      collected. Cognitive function including mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clocking&#xD;
      drawing test, Wechsler memory scale (WMS)-world list test and spatial span test, trial making&#xD;
      test A and B, category fluency test (animal naming), and beck depression inventory-II are&#xD;
      tested by trained neuropsychiatrists. Gait function are evaluated with time up and go (TUG),&#xD;
      freezing of gait questionnaire (FOG-Q), and Gait-up device analysis before trial starting.&#xD;
      Pre-treatment brain image examined by magnetic resonance image (MRI) and blood sampling for&#xD;
      synapse protein level are performed. The participants are then arranged to receive theta&#xD;
      burst stimulation for 5 days by using Magstim machine (Super Rapid 2) equipped with air&#xD;
      cooled coil (D70), stimulating on supplementary motor area (SMA). After the intervention,&#xD;
      post-treatment evaluation including cognition, motor symptoms, gait function, brain MRI, and&#xD;
      blood sampling will be performed again with the same methods at 1 month later. Any adverse&#xD;
      event during the trial period will also be recorded. The trial is expected to be conducted in&#xD;
      Shuange-Ho hospital, Taipei Medical University.&#xD;
