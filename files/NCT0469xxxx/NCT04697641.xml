      This study is designed to study benefit of eradicating Helicobacter Pylori in patients with&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia as compared to symptomatic treatment only. Helicobacter pylori positive&#xD;
      patients with Functional Dyspepsia will be divided into two study groups, one will receive&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy and other will receive symptomatic treatment. Symptom&#xD;
      relief based on Likert scale will be compared in both groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD), is a common problem with many associations. About 50% of the&#xD;
      patients with FD have coexistent Helicobacter pylori (HP) associated gastritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many investigators have tried to treat FD by means of eradication of HP infection. Different&#xD;
      studies have reported various estimates of association between HP eradication and improvement&#xD;
      of dyspeptic symptoms, and whether eradication of HP infection improves dyspeptic symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with FD remains controversial because of scarcity of large randomised controlled&#xD;
      studies, and great heterogeneity in study designs. Also, antibiotic use or misuse is widely&#xD;
      prevalent; the resultant high frequency of antibiotic resistance implies that treatment&#xD;
      regimens for HP eradication may not be effective. On this background, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to conduct a large tertiary centre based study to find the effect of eradicating HP&#xD;
      on the symptoms of FD. Secondarily, the investigators also propose to look for prevalence of&#xD;
      HP in FD and recurrence rate of HP infection at 6 month follow up after the eradication&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that HP eradication is superior to Standard of care symptomatic&#xD;
      management in treating symptoms of FD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To study the effect of HP eradication on symptom profile of Functional Dyspepsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the prevalence of HP infection in patients with Functional Dyspepsia (FD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the efficacy of HP eradication therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the recurrence rate of HP infection and symptom relief at 6 months follow up&#xD;
           after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Centre: The study will be carried out at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be open label randomised controlled study. Study Duration: Study will&#xD;
      be conducted from 1st September 2017 to 31st May 2019, with patient recruitment till 30th&#xD;
      November 2018. Study would start after obtaining requisite Ethical Clearance from&#xD;
      Institutional Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients to be enrolled: Consecutive patients of Functional Dyspepsia, according to ROME-IV&#xD;
      criteria, who attend the gastroenterology Out patient departement at our centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will seek medical care for dyspeptic symptoms present for at least three months&#xD;
      and those who have no history of peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal disease or previous&#xD;
      treatment for HP will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied and final study sample will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood investigations like complete hemogram, liver function tests, renal function tests, TSH,&#xD;
      urine analysis, fasting and post prandial blood sugar levels, HbA1c if required and an&#xD;
      ultrasound abdomen will be done. Those with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c&gt;9mmol/mol)&#xD;
      and uncontrolled thyroid status (TSH&gt;10mIU/l or &lt;0.5mIU/L) will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other participants will be subjected to upper GI endoscopy and those with normal Upper GI&#xD;
      Endoscopy will fulfil the ROME IV criteria of FD. A RUT and HP stool Ag test will be done for&#xD;
      them. A positive result for both the test will be considered as HP positive. This will be&#xD;
      used to find the prevalence of HP in FD. Those with a single positive test will be considered&#xD;
      negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HP negative FD patients will receive the standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Global Overall Symptom (GOS) scale will be used for symptom assessment. The symptoms are&#xD;
      reported on a seven point Likert Scale ranging from 1 = no problem to 7 = very severe&#xD;
      problem. The GOS score is self-reported by the patient over a retrospective period of 28&#xD;
      days. Those with moderate to high intensity (&gt;2 on Likert Scale) of symptoms will be included&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked to rate the severity of 10 specific upper GI symptoms [specific&#xD;
      symptom subtypes (SSS)] using the same 7-point Likert scale as for the GOS scale: epigastric&#xD;
      pain, epigastric discomfort, heartburn, acid regurgitation, upper abdominal bloating,&#xD;
      excessive belching, nausea, early satiety, postprandial fullness and other epigastric&#xD;
      symptoms. Participants will be divided into two symptom subgroups- Epigastric Pain Syndrome&#xD;
      (EPS)- for first four symptoms on GOS; and Post Prandial Distress Syndrome (PDS)- for last&#xD;
      six symptoms on GOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.pylori positive FD patients will be randomised to two arms based on computer generated&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One arm will receive H.pylori eradication therapy in the form of fourteen days of&#xD;
           Tab.Clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day + Tab.Amoxicillin 1000mg twice a day+ Tab.&#xD;
           Pantoprazole 40mg twice a day followed by six more weeks of Tab.Pantoprazole 40mg once&#xD;
           daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other arm would receive the standard of care treatment for FD, i.e, proton pump&#xD;
           inhibitors for eight weeks in case EPS and prokinetics as when required for patients&#xD;
           with PDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first follow up will be four weeks after completion of eight week treatment. On this&#xD;
      follow up, GOS will be administered and rating of 0 or 1 on the Likert Scale will be&#xD;
      considered as symptom relief and treatment success. H.pylori Stool Ag test will be done and&#xD;
      positive H.pylori Stool Ag test will be taken as failure of H.pylori eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second follow up will be after six months of completion of eight week treatment. GOS and&#xD;
      SSS will be asked and H.pylori Stool Ag testing will be repeated. Participants may receive&#xD;
      medications for symptom relief over these six months and a note will be made about the&#xD;
      treatment in their diary. Symptoms hampering their routine daily activities will be taken as&#xD;
      failure of symptom relief.&#xD;
