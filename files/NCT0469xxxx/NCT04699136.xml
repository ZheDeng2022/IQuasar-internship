  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to study the validity of the 6-minute stepper test (ST6) in order to&#xD;
      determine tolerance to effort in cardiovascular patients&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 6-minute stepper test (ST6) is an test used and validated in patients with respiratory&#xD;
      disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in order to evaluate their tolerance to&#xD;
      exercise. It is well tolerated and reproducible in these patients, with the advantage that it&#xD;
      can be performed without spatial constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this test is not yet used in cardiology. This study proposes to validate the ST6, to&#xD;
      evaluate the exercise tolerance of patients suffering from cardiovascular pathologies.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The number of steps taken in 6 minutes with the ST6 will be measured twice on the first day of the cardiovascular rehabilitation and education. The second ST6 will be performed 30 minutes after the first. Internal validity will be studied by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of the number of steps from the two ST6 carried out and its 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The external validity with respect to the (6 minutes walk test) WT6 will be studied by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient and its 95% confidence interval between the number of steps from the ST6 and the distance travelled in meters from the WT6.</description>
