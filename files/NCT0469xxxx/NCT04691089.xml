    <textblock>
      In the Paris (France) Medical Emergency system, in the early phase of Out-of-hospital Cardiac&#xD;
      Arrest (OHCA), the treatment of a Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) consists of delivering an&#xD;
      External Electric Shock (EES) by a rescuer with the use of an Automated External&#xD;
      Defibrillator (AED). This latter realizes a cardiac rhythm analysis every two minutes. This&#xD;
      analysis requires that chest compressions (CC) be interrupted for a while. However, CC&#xD;
      interruptions are potentially harmful due to the brain, and heart perfusions decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the recurrence of VF occurs mostly during the first minute after the&#xD;
      shock, whereas the delay between 2 rhythm analysis is 2 minutes. The consequence is excessive&#xD;
      time spent in VF, which is deleterious in terms of coronary and cerebral perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator implements a new AED algorithm whose operating principle is as follows. One&#xD;
      minute after an EES administration, the AED realizes a cardiac rhythm analysis during which&#xD;
      the rescuers do not need to interrupt the chest compressions (CC): this is called the rhythm&#xD;
      analysis &quot; in presence of CC&quot; The detection of a VF &quot; in presence of CC &quot; needs to be&#xD;
      confirmed, &quot; in absence of CC &quot; The CC's are therefore interrupted for new rhythm analysis.&#xD;
      Once the presence of VF is approved, the AED proposes a shock to be administred&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic Life support care with an AED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the &quot; chest-compression fraction (CCF) &quot; that represents the CPR-time&#xD;
      performance during the ten first minutes of BLS care ( or &lt; 10 min in case of Return Of&#xD;
      Spontaneus Circulation (ROSC))&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) patients suffering from ventricular fibrillation&#xD;
      (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT), BLS care consists of administering external electric&#xD;
      shocks (EES) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, despite successful&#xD;
      defibrillation, VF recurs in 50% of cases. Rescuers are forced to repeat EES as often as&#xD;
      needed, without the recommendations specifying a maximum number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International guidelines recommend a 2-min CPR time between 2 rhythm analysis, that means one&#xD;
      shock every 2 min. Since refibrillation occurs mostly during the first-minute post-shock, the&#xD;
      patient will have to wait until the end of the 2 minutes before receiving the next EES.&#xD;
      During that time, the chest compressions (CC) provide a reduced fraction of physiologic blood&#xD;
      flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new AED algorithm provides the following changes :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After a 60-second post-shock CPR-period, the AED performs an analysis &quot;in presence of&#xD;
           CC&quot; i.e., without CC interruption is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each time the AED detects a VF &quot;in presence of CC&quot; the algorithm requires the CC to be&#xD;
           interrupted to perform an analysis &quot;in absence of CC &quot; to confirm the rhythm&#xD;
           shockability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyses &quot;in presence of CC&quot; are triggered every minute, possibly followed or not by an&#xD;
           analysis &quot; in absence of CC &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at least, the algorithm performs an analysis &quot; in absence of CC &quot; systematically every 2&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new algorithm fits in between two historical CPR algorithms used in western medical&#xD;
      systems - the one-minute and the two-minute CPR cycle- depending on the rhythm shockability&#xD;
      detected &quot; in presence of CC &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to measure the &quot; CC fraction &quot; during the ten first minutes of Fire&#xD;
      Fighter BLS care in OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Report on the available CPR quality parameters (CC frequency, hands-off maximum).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Report on the AED's diagnostic performance when analyzing the rhythm &quot;in presence of CC&#xD;
           &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Report on the AED's diagnostic performance when analyzing the rhythm &quot; in absence of CC&#xD;
           &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Report on the overall AED's diagnostic performance that results from the combination of&#xD;
           two consecutive analyses &quot; in presence of CC &quot; and &quot; in absence of CC&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Report on post-shock rhythms and their incidence (4) Report on the number of EES per&#xD;
      patient (5) Report on the time distribution for the shocks administered per-patient to&#xD;
      describe the rhythmic storm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (5) Report on the incidence of Return Of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC), survival at hospital&#xD;
      admission, and survival at hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (6) Compare these reports to a historical cohort (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The observation window is limited to CPR cycles within the first 10 minutes of BLS care,&#xD;
           or less if ROSC is presumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The choice of 10 minutes is intended to observe the BLS team's action, without&#xD;
           interfering with the ALS team that arrives later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The three following criteria define a presumptive ROSC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1. presence of QRS complexes of broadly similar morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2. synchronous impedance curve variation with the QRS complexes (indicating&#xD;
           intrathoracic movement, in that case, cardiac mechanical activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3. no on-going CC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A CPR cycle is defined by the delay between two &quot; in absence of CC &quot; analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not imply any change in current practice. There is no planned interim&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive participants with inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study size for a before-after comparison, with 2017 as the &quot;before&quot; period and 2020 as the&#xD;
      &quot;after&quot; period has been calculated&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our healthcare system, the average CC ratio was 65% in 2017, whereas the ERC guidelines&#xD;
      recommend a minimum of 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the use of the 2020 algorithm, for CA with shockable rhythm, the CC ratio is expected to&#xD;
      decrease slightly, as the analyses become closer in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed a CCratio in 2020 being &quot; equivalent &quot; to 2017 (65%) and consider that a&#xD;
      difference in CCratio rate as large as 10% in favor of the 2017 period still allows the new&#xD;
      algorithm to be non-inferior (delta = 0.1). The sample size calculation is based on an 80%&#xD;
      power to confirm non-inferiority and a one-sided confidence level of 97.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, the number of subjects to be included in each period is 282, i.e., six months of&#xD;
      observation in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERRUPTION OR STOPPING OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor has the responsibility to report, to the national health authority, any serious&#xD;
      and unexpected adverse events attributable to the new AED algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full report on the risks, the description of incidents, accidents and adverse events will&#xD;
      be the subject of a chapter in the results section and also in the discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINANCING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding for the study is provided by the Paris Fire Brigade (promoter, following acceptance&#xD;
      of the survey under French policy for clinical research projects)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will report on the CC fraction of an AED algorithm designed to analyze &quot;under CC.&quot;&#xD;
