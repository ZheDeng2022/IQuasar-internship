  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer occurring in the UK. Treatment usually involves&#xD;
      surgery, often with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In some cases radiotherapy can be used&#xD;
      instead of surgery, especially if surgery may cause a higher risk of symptoms or a colostomy&#xD;
      bag. Currently, the medical team collects information on patients' symptoms before and after&#xD;
      treatment by direct questions in a clinic setting. It's recognised that patient-reported&#xD;
      symptoms often differ from doctor-documented symptoms. This leads to inaccuracies in doctors'&#xD;
      descriptions of the effects of cancer or treatment to patients. Patients told us an accurate&#xD;
      description of expected symptoms is important when they are choosing their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-Reported outcomes measures (PROMs) may help us identify what affects the QoL after&#xD;
      treatment and develop ways to improve it. The primary aim of the trial is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      patients find it acceptable to use electronic data collection to assess their symptoms. Many&#xD;
      bowel cancer patients are elderly and they may find electronic data system collection more&#xD;
      challenging. The secondary aim is to identify which symptoms impact QoL. This will lead to&#xD;
      the development of treatments to manage these symptoms which will be assessed in CITRuS2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with bowel cancer are entered into the colorectal database to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of cancer treatments and outcomes. Participants will&#xD;
      electronically answer questionnaires at study entry and during follow up. The questions are&#xD;
      related to health and well-being with a holistic approach. The questions will take&#xD;
      approximately 45 minutes to answer the first time and then 15 minutes thereafter. Following&#xD;
      consent, participants gain access to their clinical details on the database. Then they can&#xD;
      use a computer, laptop, tablet or smart phone to access a webpage and answer questions at&#xD;
      monthly intervals over a 2 year period. Email reminders will be sent to prompt log on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This may help discover how bowel cancer and its treatment affect patients and their lives.&#xD;
      This may help doctors describe the effects of treatment more accurately to future patients.&#xD;
      It may also help doctors identify which patients need extra help or support through their&#xD;
      treatment. Electronic data may allow patterns to be identified that may not be seen by&#xD;
      doctors until a later stage. This may enable earlier treatment resulting in less time with&#xD;
      symptoms, which could be physically and economically beneficial.&#xD;

      Currently, the medical team collects information on patients' symptoms before and after&#xD;
      cancer treatment in response to direct questioning in outpatient clinics. It's recognised&#xD;
      that patient-reported symptoms often differ from doctor-documented symptoms. Over time, this&#xD;
      leads to inaccuracies in doctors' descriptions of the effects of cancer or its treatment to&#xD;
      patients. Patients told us accurate description of expected symptoms is important when they&#xD;
      are choosing which treatment to have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use an electronic database to allow colorectal cancer patients to view their&#xD;
      treatment records and to document their symptoms. Patients will answer questions at study&#xD;
      entry and at set intervals during treatment and follow-up. The questions are related to&#xD;
      health and well-being. The questionnaires are patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) which&#xD;
      have been used in paper format in trials with many patients internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information the patients give us will help doctors describe treatment effects more&#xD;
      accurately to future patients and to identify patients who may need extra support during or&#xD;
      after their treatment. Electronic data collection allows patterns to be identified that may&#xD;
      not be seen by doctors until a later stage. The symptoms identified in this study will be&#xD;
      used to develop treatments that may benefit future patients. The electronic database will be&#xD;
      used identify the need for intervention then to deliver the recommended treatments to&#xD;
      patients automatically when they are identified. For example, if questionnaire responses show&#xD;
      a patient has an unplanned loss of 3% of their body weight an information sheet on increasing&#xD;
      calorie intake and eating well with a small appetite would be emailed to them and a dietician&#xD;
      alerted so a follow up call could be made two weeks later.&#xD;
