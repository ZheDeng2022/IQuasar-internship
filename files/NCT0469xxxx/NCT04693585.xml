  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the optimized&#xD;
      MeSSSSage intervention which was developed and revised based on the results of our initial&#xD;
      pilot testing. The investigators will conduct a controlled 4-arm factorial design randomized&#xD;
      study to test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of several&#xD;
      intervention modalities over a 6-month period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most mHealth interventions for maternal and child health (MCH) in low and middle-income&#xD;
      countries, including India, have focused on unidirectional and non-interactive approaches,&#xD;
      primarily text messaging. However, ample evidence suggests that provider-led, interactive&#xD;
      educational programming and social support are key for improving health behaviors and&#xD;
      outcomes. Thus innovative mHealth approaches that promote interactive education and&#xD;
      facilitate social support have great potential to improve MCH outcomes. The two-phase&#xD;
      development of MeSSSSage include sPhase 1: exploratory development on functions and platforms&#xD;
      and Phase 2: a mixed-methods randomized pilot study using a factorial design of specific&#xD;
      intervention functions and platforms confirmed in Phase 1. Study activities described herein&#xD;
      are associated with Phase 1. The study's specific aim is: To test the optimized intervention&#xD;
      to understand the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of several&#xD;
      intervention modalities among postnatal women in rural India. In Phase 2, the investigators&#xD;
      conduct a randomized factorial design to understand the contribution to various intervention&#xD;
      modalities on feasibility, accessibility and preliminary effectiveness. Data are collected&#xD;
      via quantitative participant survey (baseline and endline) including sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics and knowledge about maternal and infant health, self-efficacy, and perceived&#xD;
      social norms regarding MCH-related health promoting behaviors (baseline) acceptability&#xD;
      questions such as women's satisfaction with and perceptions of MeSSSSage, maternal and infant&#xD;
      knowledge-, behavior-, and health-related questions including about breastfeeding,&#xD;
      complementary food introduction, immunization, family planning uptake, maternal physical and&#xD;
      mental health, etc. The investigators will validate self-report with health records. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct in-depth interviews among a purposive sample of 30 women to&#xD;
      understand: mobile technology familiarity prior to intervention, perspectives on intervention&#xD;
      and challenges, structure of intervention (group, individual), content, perspectives on the&#xD;
      text-based component, relationship with other participants, perspective on the moderator,&#xD;
      postnatal period health related concerns, sources of support (social and informational),&#xD;
      recommendations. Other assessment will include technological data from, and group moderator&#xD;
      surveys and interviews.&#xD;
