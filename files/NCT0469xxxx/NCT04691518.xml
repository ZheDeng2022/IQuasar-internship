  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) has been examined in animal and human studies to&#xD;
      gain an understanding of its effect on spinal excitability and synaptic strength.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the investigators have learned that the use of AIH results in new protein&#xD;
      formation and spinal plasticity. The use of acute intermittent hypoxia demonstrates a&#xD;
      potential for therapeutic utilization in individuals with neurologic injuries. However,&#xD;
      little is known about the effect of AIH in healthy individuals. This work is necessary to&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms of AIH-induced plasticity. As such, this research study seeks to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of a single session AIH on upper extremity motor function in healthy&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH), has been demonstrated, through human and animal&#xD;
      studies, to be an effective way of increasing spinal motor excitability and strengthening&#xD;
      residual synaptic connectivity. AIH utilizes short duration (&lt;2 min) exposures to reduced&#xD;
      oxygen levels (~10% inspired oxygen), with alternating exposures to air with normal oxygen&#xD;
      levels (~21% inspired oxygen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous publications demonstrate that AIH is a safe and effective intervention to modify&#xD;
      motor function in individual with chronic incomplete spinal cord injuries. The use of AIH has&#xD;
      been shown to influence the activation in musculature, within 60-120 minutes of&#xD;
      administration. In addition, when coupling AIH with overground gait training, an increase in&#xD;
      functional endurance, as evaluated through the 6 minute walk test, and gait speed, as&#xD;
      evaluated through the 10 meter walk test, were demonstrated. In addition, the use of hypoxic&#xD;
      training has been studied in healthy individuals and athletes; however, literature examining&#xD;
      the effect of a single bout of AIH on performance is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although AIH has proven to be a promising treatment in enhancing spinal excitability and&#xD;
      strengthening existing synaptic connections within individuals with chronic spinal cord&#xD;
      injuries, further examination also needs to be made on the impact of AIH on motor function in&#xD;
      healthy individuals.&#xD;
