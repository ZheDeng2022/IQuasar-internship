  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate occlusal contact may affect the long-term prognosis of prosthodontic&#xD;
      rehabilitation. It is suggested to design light or without occlusal contact on implant&#xD;
      prostheses when the patient bites with light force, and normal occlusal contact when the&#xD;
      patient bites with heavy force. The concept of this &quot;implant-protective occlusion&quot; is based&#xD;
      on the difference of movement between implants and natural teeth. However, how much force&#xD;
      generated during a light bite or a heavy bite is not clearly defined in the literature.&#xD;
      Traditional methods to evaluate the occlusal contacts between antagonist teeth such as wax,&#xD;
      silicone, occlusal paper, and occlusal foil cannot evaluate the occlusal force. Recently,&#xD;
      modern digital occlusion analysis systems (T-Scan, Dental Prescale II) can evaluate occlusal&#xD;
      force on almost normal intermaxillary relation. The objects of this investigation are: (1) to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of difference occlusal forces on the number, distribution and size of&#xD;
      occlusal contacts examined by 8μm occlusal foil and Dental Prescale II System (DPS); (2) to&#xD;
      analyze the relation between EMG activity and occlusal forces and to identify the magnitude&#xD;
      of light and heavy bite force the patients may exert during occlusal examination; (3) to&#xD;
      compare the results between habitual chewing side and the other side. Twenty-four subjects&#xD;
      will be included in this study. With EMG biofeedback, the subjects will exert 35%、70%、100% of&#xD;
      maximum contraction EMG of clenching and the subjects' occlusal contacts will be tested with&#xD;
      the 8μm occlusal foil and DPS. Each condition will be tested three times. The subjects will&#xD;
      chew gums to confirm their habitual chewing side after the occlusal tests. Numbers,&#xD;
      distribution, and size of occlusal contacts will be analyzed and compared. This study may&#xD;
      identify the magnitude of perceptual light and heavy occlusal forces and the maximum occlusal&#xD;
      force. The results are helpful for setting up the protocol and strategy of occlusal&#xD;
      adjustment and to prevent biomechanical complications of dental prostheses.&#xD;
