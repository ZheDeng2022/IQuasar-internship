  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial amyloidosis is a rare disease that mainly affects the nerves and heart, but also&#xD;
      more rarely the eyes and kidneys. This disease is due to a mutation in the gene encoding the&#xD;
      synthesis of transthyretin, resulting in a modification of the translated protein. This&#xD;
      abnormal protein and its derivatives are deposited in the form of a toxic &quot;amyloid&quot; substance&#xD;
      in tissues and organs, altering their functions, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a gastrointestinal perspective, different treatments can be proposed in the absence of&#xD;
      specific recommendations for familial amyloidosis. The hygienic and dietary measures consist&#xD;
      of avoiding tobacco, alcohol and carbonated drinks, limiting fatty meals rich in poorly&#xD;
      digestible fibers, and splitting meals. If this fails, metoclopramide and domperidone are&#xD;
      suggested. As a second-line erythromycin, can be used with caution because of cardiac risks&#xD;
      and drug interactions. Polyethylene glycol-based osmotic laxatives can be used to treat&#xD;
      constipation. Alternating diarrhea and constipation can be treated with ispaghul-based&#xD;
      laxatives, aiming at transit regulation. Finally, refractory diarrhea can be treated with the&#xD;
      administration of loperamide. If this fails, treatment with a somatostatin analogue may be&#xD;
      offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, all these treatments can present significant side effects, therefore natural&#xD;
      alternatives are often sought. Psyllium in particular regulates transit by normalizing stool&#xD;
      consistency: it is effective against digestive disorders such as constipation, but it is also&#xD;
      effective in the event of diarrhea. It allows the formation of a viscous gel by the&#xD;
      hydrophilicity of polysaccharides macromolecules, increasing the fecal bowl which stimulates&#xD;
      peristalsis and facilitates defecation. The WHO has recognized that Psyllium is superior to&#xD;
      wheat bran in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess the effect of daily Psyllium administration on&#xD;
      digestive quality of life in familial amyloidosis patients who suffer from digestive&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
