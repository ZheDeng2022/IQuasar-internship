  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study to investigate NC318 alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, three-arm trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1a and 1b will enroll patients with advanced NSCLC regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression&#xD;
      who have experienced disease progression on or after PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy, given alone&#xD;
      or in combination with other systemic anti-cancer therapy. Patients will be assigned to arm&#xD;
      1a or 1b at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients on arm 1a will receive NC318&#xD;
      alone; those on arm 1b, combination therapy with NC318 and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1a will be based on a Simon two-stage minimax design. In the first stage, 18 patients&#xD;
      will be accrued. If tumor response per RECIST v1.1 is achieved in 2 or fewer patients, arm 1a&#xD;
      will be closed to further enrollment. If tumor response is demonstrated in 3 or more&#xD;
      patients, then 25 additional patients will be accrued (stage 2), for a total of 43 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1a and 1b will start with a safety run-in portion consisting of 6 patients (see 4.1.1).&#xD;
      If deemed safe, each arm will continue to accrue and follow the Simon two-stage design&#xD;
      outlined above. Patients in the run-in portion will be included in stage 1 of the Simon&#xD;
      two-stage design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 will enroll patients with advanced NSCLC and tumor PD-L1 expression less than 50% who&#xD;
      are naïve to PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy. Patients on arm 2 will receive combination therapy&#xD;
      with NC318 and pembrolizumab. Arm 2 will also start with a safety run-in portion identical to&#xD;
      that of arms 1a and 1b (see 4.1.1). If deemed safe, accrual will continue following a Simon&#xD;
      two-stage minimax design. In the first stage, 19 patients will be accrued. If tumor response&#xD;
      per RECIST v1.1 is achieved in 3 or fewer patients, arm 2 will be closed to further&#xD;
      enrollment. If tumor response is demonstrated in 4 or more patients, then 36 additional&#xD;
      patients will be accrued (stage 2), for a total of 54 patients. Patients in the run-in&#xD;
      portion will be included in stage 1 of the Simon two-stage design.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic (i.e.,&#xD;
             Stage IIIB not eligible for definitive chemoradiotherapy, Stage IV, or recurrent)&#xD;
             NSCLC (per the American Joint Committee /AJCC staging system)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions can be&#xD;
             counted as target lesions if clearly progressing after radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arm 1a and 1b: Prior PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, e.g.&#xD;
             nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) either alone or in&#xD;
             combination 9 with other systemic agents, with documented progressive disease. - Arm&#xD;
             2: PD-L1 expression of less than 50 percent (PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy naïve)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with NSCLC known to harbor an ALK rearrangement, ROS1 rearrangement, EGFR&#xD;
             mutation or BRAF mutation known to be sensitive to FDA approved tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors (TKIs), are only eligible after experiencing disease progression (during or&#xD;
             after treatment) or intolerance to respective TKI:&#xD;
&#xD;
             c. Patients with TKI treated EGFR mutant NSCLC harboring the secondary EGFR T790M&#xD;
             tumor must have received prior osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
             d. Patients with crizotinib treated ALK rearranged NSCLC must have received a next&#xD;
             generation ALK inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib or lorlatinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one tumor amenable to incisional, excisional, core or forceps&#xD;
