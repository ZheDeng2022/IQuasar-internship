  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Italian screening program invites the resident population aged 50-74 for Fecal&#xD;
      Immunochemical Test (FIT) every 2 years. Subjects who test positive are referred for&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Maximizing adenoma detection during colonoscopy is of paramount importance in&#xD;
      the framework of an organized screening program, in which colonoscopy represent the key&#xD;
      examination. Initial studies consistently show that Artificial iIntelligence-based systems&#xD;
      support the endoscopist in evaluating colonoscopy images potentially increasing the&#xD;
      identification of colonic polyps. However, the studies on AI and polyp detection performed so&#xD;
      far are mostly focused on technical issues, are based on still images analysis or recorded&#xD;
      video segments and includes patients with different indications for colonoscopy. At the best&#xD;
      of our knowledge, data on the impact on AI system in adenoma detection in a FIT-based&#xD;
      screening program are lacking. The present prospective randomized controlled trial is aimed&#xD;
      at evaluating whether the use of an AI system increases the ADR (per patient analysis) and/or&#xD;
      the mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy in FIT-positive subjects undergoing screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Therefore Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria are randomized (1:1) in two&#xD;
      arms: A) patients receive standard colonoscopy (with high definition-HD endoscopes) with&#xD;
      white light (WL) in both insertion and withdrawal phase; all polyps identified are removed&#xD;
      and sent for histopathology examination; B) patients receive colonoscopy examinations (with&#xD;
      HD endoscopes) equipped with an AI system (in both insertion and withdrawal phase); all&#xD;
      polyps identified are removed and sent for histopathology examination. In the present study&#xD;
      histopathology represents the reference standard.&#xD;

    <description>all patients receive colonoscopy examinations (with HD endoscopes) equipped with an Ai system (CAD-EYE, Fujifilm Co, Tokyo, Japan) in both insertion and withdrawal phase). This system is a real-time computer-assisted image analysis that allows automatic polyp identification without modifications to the colonoscope or to the actual endoscopic procedure. When CAD EYE identifies a polyp, both a visual (a green blinking box surrounding the identified polyp, called the detection box) and an acoustic alarm pop up and attract the endoscopist attention. Around the endoscopic image a visual assist circle is shown and lights up in the direction where the suspicious polyp is detected.All polyps identified are removed and sent for histopathology examination.</description>

    <description>A dedicated CNN-based AI system (CAD EYE, Fujifilm Co, Tokyo, Japan) has been recently developed. The Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) CAD EYE system is a real-time computer-assisted image analysis that allows automatic polyp identification without modifications to the colonoscope or to the actual endoscopic procedure. When CAD EYE identifies a polyp, both a visual (a green blinking box surrounding the identified polyp, called the detection box) and an acoustic alarm pop up and attract the endoscopist attention. Around the endoscopic image a visual assist circle is shown and lights up in the direction where the suspicious polyp is detected.</description>
