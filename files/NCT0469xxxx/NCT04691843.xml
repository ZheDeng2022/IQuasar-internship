  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the relationship between iron deficiency and neurological outcome of&#xD;
      extremely premature infants. Premature birth occurs during a critical period of brain&#xD;
      development and maturation, and before adequate transfer of iron across the placenta.&#xD;
      Nutrition has a significant impact on ultimate outcome of survivors of prematurity. One of&#xD;
      the biomarkers of nutrition in the premature infant is iron, and iron supplementation is&#xD;
      essential for growth and brain development at low gestational age. As a result, the Committee&#xD;
      on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends daily oral iron&#xD;
      supplementation, of at least 2-4 mg/kg/day from 2 weeks of age, to prevent iron deficiency in&#xD;
      extremely premature infants. Nevertheless, studies have shown that even with this regular&#xD;
      care dose of iron, started from 2 weeks of age, a significant number of premature infants&#xD;
      will still develop iron-deficiency. Our hypothesis states that starting high dose iron&#xD;
      supplementation early will improve neurological development and outcome in extremely&#xD;
      premature infants (those born at less than 28 weeks gestational age). This study will provide&#xD;
      data showing whether individualized iron supplementation using higher doses of iron, started&#xD;
      earlier (after the first week of life) when guided by periodic screening of their body's iron&#xD;
      status with ferritin levels, will mitigate iron deficiency and promote improved&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome in this vulnerable infant population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, controlled study of early, high-dose iron for&#xD;
      neuroprotection in extremely preterm infants born between 24 0/7 weeks and 30 6/7 weeks&#xD;
      gestation. This study has chosen to study newborns between 24-0/7 and 30-6/7 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation because of (1) high likelihood of poor outcome, (2) highest risk of iron deficiency&#xD;
      and potentially most likely to benefit from intervention based on their stage of brain&#xD;
      development, (3) previously studied to assess safety of this iron regimen in Preterm&#xD;
      Erythropoietin Neuroprotection Trial (PENUT) protocol, and (4) absence of therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions to improve neurodevelopmental outcome. Study sample size is 90 patients; to be&#xD;
      enrolled at Ann &amp; Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital-Prentice Women's Hospital. We expect to&#xD;
      evaluate 82 infants at 10-14 months and 22-26 months corrected age, our primary endpoints.&#xD;
      There is no enrollment restriction based on race, ethnicity or gender. Enrollment is expected&#xD;
      to take 18-24 months, with each subject with each subject participating through 24-26 months&#xD;
      corrected age when final neurodevelopmental outcomes are assessed. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized locally to regular-dose iron as recommended by AAP or early, high-dose iron.&#xD;
      High-dose iron will continue until 36 weeks corrected age. Serial measurements of hemoglobin,&#xD;
      reticulocyte count, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent and ferritin levels will be obtained,&#xD;
      starting 2 weeks after starting iron supplementation, with final measurement obtained at 40&#xD;
      weeks corrected age or prior to discharge, whichever is first. Data will be abstracted&#xD;
      regarding interval medical history from the electronic medical record. After discharge,&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) developmental follow-up will occur at 12 months and 24&#xD;
      months corrected age, at which time standardized neurodevelopmental assessments will be&#xD;
      performed. The outcome measure is neurodevelopmental outcome at 10-14 months and 22-26 months&#xD;
      of age. Our estimated sample size is based on the assumption that early high dose iron&#xD;
      supplementation will reduce abnormal neurological outcome by 16%-29%, and taken together with&#xD;
      an estimated 10% anticipated loss due to unrelated deaths, the total sample size was&#xD;
      calculated at 90 infants (45 in each arm of the study).&#xD;
