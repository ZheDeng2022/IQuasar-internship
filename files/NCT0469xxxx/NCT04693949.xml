  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of resin-bonded fixed dental&#xD;
      prostheses (RBFDPs) pretreated with nanostructured alumina coating (NAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study adopts a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind design contrasting the&#xD;
      use of NAC to air-borne particle abrasion (APA) (control) as a surface pretreatment method of&#xD;
      zirconia RBFDPs used for replacing missing central or lateral incisors. The primary outcome&#xD;
      evaluated is the retention/survival of the zirconia RBFDPs pretreated with APA and NAC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zirconia resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses (RBFDPs) have been regarded as a promising&#xD;
      minimally invasive alternative for the replacement of missing central and lateral incisors,&#xD;
      offering several advantages to orthodontic space closure or tooth replacement with&#xD;
      implant-supported restorations. Debonding of the zirconia RBFDPs represents the main&#xD;
      technical complication since clinically established airborne particle abrasion (APA) of an&#xD;
      inert zirconia surface does not always provide sufficient resin-bond strength. Further, APA&#xD;
      can also impair the mechanical properties of zirconia restoration affecting its long-term&#xD;
      success. Nano-structured alumina coating (NAC) presents an alternative non-invasive zirconia&#xD;
      surface pretreatment. The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to study the&#xD;
      effect of NAC coated bonding surface of zirconia RBFDPs affecting its debonding and clinical&#xD;
      survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study adopts a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind design contrasting the&#xD;
      use of NAC to air-borne particle abrasion (APA) as a surface pretreatment method of zirconia&#xD;
      RBFDPs. Healthy patients in need of a missing central or lateral incisor replacement are&#xD;
      screened and rated to be eligible by two calibrated dentists. RBFDPs are randomly allocated&#xD;
      into two groups and inserted by the same operator. The first group, where the bonding surface&#xD;
      is pretreated with APA serves a control group. In the second group the restorations are&#xD;
      pretreated with NAC. The participants and the operator are blinded to the group assignment in&#xD;
      a double-blinded trial design. The primary outcome evaluated is the retention/survival of the&#xD;
      RBFDP. Non-parametric tests and Kaplan-Meyer analysis will be used to determine differences&#xD;
      between both study groups.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Prior to the beginning of the study 50 identification numbers were divided into 2 groups on the basis of a computer generated tables (www.randomization.com). The two groups were then randomly allocated to the zirconia pretreatment method using a random generator. The randomization process was conducted by a staff member not involved in the research protocol. For each identification number, the selected pretreatment is written on a card contained in an opaque sealed envelope. The envelopes are stored by a study supervisor. Each envelope is opened by a dental technician after the RBFDP's zirconia framework is milled and then once again stored by the study supervisor until the conclusion of a study.</masking_description>
