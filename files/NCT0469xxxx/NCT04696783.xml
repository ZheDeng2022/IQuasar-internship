  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the high incidence of GERD among seafarers and its continuing impact on the life&#xD;
      quality of seafarers, it is necessary to use preventive treatment. At the same time, because&#xD;
      both mental and psychological factors and changes in intestinal flora may play a certain role&#xD;
      in the development and treatment of GERD, this project intends to take the seafarers involved&#xD;
      in this scientific expedition as the participants to explore the effect of PPI discontinuous&#xD;
      therapy in preventing gastroesophageal reflux disease of seafarers, a special occupational&#xD;
      group and the changes in the mental and psychological status and intestinal flora of this&#xD;
      group of people after PPI therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the common digestive system diseases.&#xD;
      However, at present, there are only sporadic reports on the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      seafarers' gastroesophageal reflux disease in the world, and there is a lack of systematic&#xD;
      research and standardized diagnosis and treatment, especially in the prevention of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seafarers work and live in a special marine environment for a long time and belong to a group&#xD;
      of specific occupations. Studies have shown that the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux&#xD;
      disease can be as high as 27% after 8 weeks of sailing, which is significantly higher than&#xD;
      the prevalence of GERD worldwide. When single or multiple factors such as mental illness,&#xD;
      high-fat diet, and changes in intestinal flora are combined, they have a significant additive&#xD;
      effect and jointly promote the occurrence of GERD. In addition, the main treatment for&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease is proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but long-term use of PPI may&#xD;
      cause many adverse reactions. Because PPI can significantly increase the potential of&#xD;
      hydrogen (PH) value in the stomach, long-term use of PPI to treat gastroesophageal reflux&#xD;
      disease may cause changes in the microbiota colonized in the small and large intestines, and&#xD;
      cause some symptoms related to intestinal flora disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GERD is a chronic and recurrent disease that seriously affects the life quality. In addition&#xD;
      to symptoms, gastroscopy and 24-hour esophageal pH testing are the main basis for diagnosis.&#xD;
      However, during the voyage, the above procedures could not be carried out in time, resulting&#xD;
      in delayed diagnosis and aggravated illness. Moreover, gastroscopy is generally suitable for&#xD;
      people with alarm symptoms and it is not feasible for all people to receive gastroscopy,. In&#xD;
      addition, although the 24-hour pH test is the gold standard for gastroesophageal reflux&#xD;
      disease, it is generally used for people with negative gastroscopy and poor response to&#xD;
      conventional treatment given the fact that it is invasive and there are not many hospitals&#xD;
      that carry out the test. Because gastroesophageal reflux disease can be diagnosed clinically,&#xD;
      in recent years, the gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire (Gerd Q) has been used for&#xD;
      the preliminary clinical diagnosis of GERD. Studies have shown that with Gerd Q, family&#xD;
      physicians and gastroenterologists have moderate or similar accuracy in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      GERD. Many studies have shown that it has good authenticity and reliability. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study did not use gastroscopy and 24-hour esophageal pH testing in the research steps, and&#xD;
      the more practical Gerd Q scale was used for the diagnosis and evaluation of seafarers' GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage: record all seafarers'disease history/past history, demographic data, eating&#xD;
      habits (whether there is high sugar, high fat, strong tea preference；whether drinking or&#xD;
      smoking), vital signs, physical examination results, complete blood count, liver function,&#xD;
      blood biochemistry, Gerd Q scale test and anxiety and depression scale evaluation, collect&#xD;
      all seafarers' fecal samples before going to sea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage: After successful enrollment and intervention, the two groups of seafarers&#xD;
      will be scored with Gerd Q and anxiety and depression scale every week, and fecal specimens&#xD;
      of the two groups of seafarers will be collected for intestinal flora analysis. During the&#xD;
      voyage, fecal specimens were collected in 5ml non-enzymatic drying tubes and stored in the&#xD;
      -80℃ refrigerator on board. The entire intervention process continued until the end of the&#xD;
      voyage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third stage: The efficacy evaluation stage.&#xD;
