  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study was performed to evaluate the usability, credibility and expectancy of an&#xD;
      intelligent, activity-based client-centred training system (i-ACT), and the motivation&#xD;
      towards its use in neurological rehabilitation over a short period of time.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A mixed-method study was performed in four rehabilitation centres in Belgium. An homogenous&#xD;
      convenience sample was recruited among persons with central nervous system disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received 3 x 45 minutes of training with the i-ACT system during six weeks,&#xD;
      additional to conventional care. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was&#xD;
      used to collect and evaluate patients' individual goals towards rehabilitation. These goals&#xD;
      were discussed with the therapists before implementing movements and exercises for each&#xD;
      patient in the i-ACT system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following demographic data were obtained from the medical files: age, gender, and&#xD;
      diagnosis. Outcomes measures were collected at baseline (T0), after 2 (T1), 4 (T2) and 6 (T3)&#xD;
      weeks of training and at 9 weeks follow-up (T4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures were the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), the System&#xD;
      Usability Scale (SUS), Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ), the Canadian Occupational&#xD;
      Performance Measure (COPM), and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). The secondary measures were&#xD;
      the Manual Ability Measure-36 (MAM-36), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Trunk&#xD;
      Impairment Scale (TIS), and Active Range of Motion (AROM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After final training with i-ACT, a semi-structured interview was performed to gather more&#xD;
      information about the participants' perception towards i-ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantitative data, within-group differences of all the assessments were analysed using&#xD;
      Friedman's ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Alpha was set at 0.05; No Bonferroni&#xD;
      correction was applied as it is not compulsory in an exploratory study and furthermore,&#xD;
      results are regarded as hypothesis for further investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative data was collected and recorded with a voice recorder. No specific analysis&#xD;
      was used as the interview collected data to support or oppose the findings of the&#xD;
      quantitative data.&#xD;
