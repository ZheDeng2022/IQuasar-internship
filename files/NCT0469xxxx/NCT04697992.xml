  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both vitamin C 20% and tranexamic acid 5mg/ml combined with microneedling were used for&#xD;
      treatment of periorbital hyperpigmentation in a comparative pattern and both resulted in&#xD;
      significant improvement of periorbital hyperpigmentation by dermoscopic and clinical&#xD;
      evaluation with no statistically significant difference between them in addition to&#xD;
      improvement of patients' visual analogue score (VAS) and dermatology life quality index&#xD;
      (DLQI).&#xD;

      Sixty patients with periorbital hyperpigmentation were enrolled, patients were divided into 2&#xD;
      groups; 30 each. clinical grading according to sheth et al.,2014 , dermoscopic evaluation,&#xD;
      visual analogue score (VAS) and DLQI were done at week 0. Group A one side was treated with&#xD;
      vit.c 20% + microneedling, other side saline+ microneedling (placebo). group B one side was&#xD;
      treated with tranexamic acid 5mg/ml + microneedling, other side saline+ microneedling&#xD;
      (placebo). A total of 4 sessions were done 2 weeks apart and follow up was one month after&#xD;
      the last session (week 10) at which patient was evaluated using above mentioned parameters in&#xD;
      addition to evaluation by 2 blinded investigators. At week 10 there was significant&#xD;
      improvement of clinical grading and as evaluated by blinded investigators, VAS, DLQI,&#xD;
      significant dermoscopic improvement in both vascular and pigmentary components of dark halos&#xD;
      in sides treated with vit c and tranexamic acid compared to placebo but there was no&#xD;
      statistically significant difference between both groups. The study concluded that tranexamic&#xD;
      acid is a new safe effective modality in treatment of periorbital hyperpigmentation with&#xD;
      results comparable to vitamin C.&#xD;
