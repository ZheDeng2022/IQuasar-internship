      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose (RP2D) of EVER4010001 in combination with Pembrolizumab in Patients with&#xD;
      Advanced Solid Tumors. And in phase II to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of EVER4010001 in&#xD;
      combination with Pembrolizumab in treating selected indications using appropriate biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, single arm, multicenter study of EVER4010001 combination with&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumor patients. The primary endpoint of phase I will be&#xD;
      Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in combined administration of EVER4010001 and&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab. And the primary endpoint of phase II will be the ORR per RECIST v1.1 in all&#xD;
      treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated until progression requiring discontinuation of further treatment,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or death, whichever comes first. Tumor response and&#xD;
      progression will be assessed using RECIST v1.1 and assessment by investigator at the trail&#xD;
      center will be sufficient for decisions on continuation of treatment. All patients will visit&#xD;
      the investigator at regular intervals for assessment of safety parameters and AEs.&#xD;
