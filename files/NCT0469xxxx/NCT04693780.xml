  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an online resource developed to aid health&#xD;
      consumers in making health decisions and better support them to seek quality evidence before&#xD;
      other evidence is effective in the context of inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who consent to participate in the study will be randomly allocated to either the&#xD;
      intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once logged into the website, participants in the intervention group will navigate health&#xD;
      information through an annotated structured guide to health evidence (see Appendix 2) which&#xD;
      is designed to inform participants where to find specific health information but it will also&#xD;
      provide information to understand why such content is more valuable than other content. This&#xD;
      structured annotated guide to evidence will also outline the value of pre-appraisal and will&#xD;
      help them navigate to products produced for them. These products have been produced by the&#xD;
      research team and include a collection of web resource ratings, evidence summaries and blog&#xD;
      posts modelled after those developed and presented on the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once logged into the website, participants in the control group will navigate health&#xD;
      information through a structured one-page guide (see Appendix 1) that does not include&#xD;
      pre-appraisal information. Instead it will list the main organizations in the field that&#xD;
      produce citizen content with descriptions of the type of content they produce with links to&#xD;
      their individual websites. This will be presented to participants when they login to the&#xD;
      platform. None of the citizen content produced specifically for the study will be provided to&#xD;
      them prior to crossing-over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive periodic reminders to access the content in the form of an&#xD;
      email sent every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the intervention and control groups will continue for three months. After three months,&#xD;
      the control group will be sent a message highlighting some additions to the content provided&#xD;
      to them. From his point forward when they login to the system they will be presented with the&#xD;
      same content that was previously only available to the intervention group. Providing those in&#xD;
      the control group access to the same material as the intervention group for a period of the&#xD;
      study will allow for direct within- group comparison as well as a direct comparison between&#xD;
      groups. Both groups will continue in this manner for an additional three months.&#xD;
