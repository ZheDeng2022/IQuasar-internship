  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri-containing probiotic suspension as an adjunct to scaling and root&#xD;
      planing (SRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: Twenty sites from twelve chronic periodontitis patients were recruited&#xD;
      and monitored clinically and microbiologically at baseline, three, and six months after&#xD;
      therapy for plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD) and&#xD;
      clinical attachment level (CAL) and microbiologically or Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.&#xD;
      gingivalis) load. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were scheduled within one week for&#xD;
      two sessions of SRP performed using ultrasonic scalers and hand instrumentation. After SRP,&#xD;
      oral hygiene measures were reassured and then sites were randomly allocated to one of the two&#xD;
      groups 10 sites each. group I (SRP only) and group II (SRP + probiotic). Group II received&#xD;
      SRP and sub-gingival delivery of 1ml of probiotic L. reuteri suspension at baseline&#xD;
      (immediately after SRP), one, two and four weeks using blunt syringe. Periodontal dressing&#xD;
      was applied after placement of the drug.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Probing pocket depth</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline. 3 months. 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Individual acrylic stents were prepared to serve as the constant points to align the probe consistently and to reduce errors associated with probe placement. Probing pocket depth was assessed using a manual probe (UNC-15). The distance from the free gingival margin to the bottom of the pocket was recorded at six sites for each examined tooth. The probe was inserted in line with the long axis of the tooth and walked circumferentially around each surface of each tooth to detect and record the area of the deepest probe penetration. The mean probing pocket depth was obtained by summing the scores for the six sites and dividing it by six.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plaque index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This index distinguishes clearly between the severity and the location of soft debris aggregates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bleeding on probing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding on probing was performed through gentle probing of the orifice of the gingival crevice. If bleeding occurs within 10 seconds, the number of positive sites is recorded and then expressed as a percentage of the number of sites examined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical attachment level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The distance from cementoenamel junction to the bottom of the pocket was measured in the same way as described for probing</description>

After placement of the drug, patients were instructed to keep away from chewing hard or sticky food, brushing near the treated areas, or using any interdental aids for 24 hours.</description>
