  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-Related Problems (DRP) are a variety of events or circumstances that can interfere with&#xD;
      the expected results of a treatment. They may be due to the drug itself, its association with&#xD;
      other treatments, its incompatibility with the patient, its misuse... When these situations&#xD;
      result in harm, they are referred to as adverse drug events (ADEs). DRP and particularly ADE&#xD;
      represent a major public health problem in healthcare institutions because of their impact on&#xD;
      morbidity and health costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRPs are largely preventable and actions can be set up to detect and correct them. It is in&#xD;
      this context that clinical pharmacy has expanded, with the development of new activities to&#xD;
      help secure drug management. In our institution, the investigators have implemented several&#xD;
      activities in different care services, including&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medication reconciliation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an ADE detection. These activities have interesting and encouraging results in terms of&#xD;
           impact on the prevention of DRP. However, they can only be carried out on a limited&#xD;
           number of patients, depending on the pharmaceutical resources available. The&#xD;
           investigators therefore need tools to prioritize our activities on the most at-risk&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators seek to identify DRP risk factors and develop DRP risk&#xD;
      scores, with the objective to improve the detection and even prevention of DRP.&#xD;
