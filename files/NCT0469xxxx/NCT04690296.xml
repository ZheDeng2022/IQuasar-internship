  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective randomized study. After prior approval by the Ethics Committee, we&#xD;
      included all patients aged over 18 years- old who were admitted to the intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) and who required a central venous catheterization (CVC) outside the emergency's&#xD;
      context. Non-inclusion criteria were thrombosis of the vein or coagulopathy. All&#xD;
      catheterizations were done by the same non-experimented practitioner. Patients were&#xD;
      randomized into two groups according to the catheterization's technique of subclavain vein:&#xD;
      real-time long axis ultrasound guidance (US group) and anatomical landmarks ( LM group). The&#xD;
      main outcome was success. The secondary outcomes were: success' rate at first puncture,&#xD;
      number of punctures, rate of redirections, number of redirections, access's time, preparation&#xD;
      and spotting time and rate of complications (arterial puncture, hematoma, pneumothorax, wrong&#xD;
      position of the catheter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis was performed using the SPSS® software version 20: The Student's &quot;t&quot; test was&#xD;
      used to compare the normally distributed quantitative variables, the Mann-Whitney's test for&#xD;
      non-normally distributed quantitative variables and the Chi-square and Fisher tests for&#xD;
      qualitative data. A value of p &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was a prospective randomized study, conducted in the ICU after obtaining approval by the&#xD;
      local ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We enrolled all patients older than 18 years and requiring a CVC in non emergent conditions&#xD;
      after obtaining a written informed consent from the patient or trusted person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were the vein thrombosis and the existence of a coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided according to computer generated randomized table into&#xD;
      twogroups: a group underwent real time USG-SCV catheterization (US group) and a group in whom&#xD;
      anatomical LM method was used (LM group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures were performed by the same novice operator trained in CVC placement, each of&#xD;
      whom had performed at least 10 catheterization using both techniques on cadavers before&#xD;
      standing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were mechanically ventilated, they underwent ultrasound scanning of the&#xD;
      infraclavicular area to detect an eventual venous thrombosis and they put in trendelenburg&#xD;
      position with a block under the homolateral shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anterosuperior region of the chest was prepared in a sterile way for both approach In the&#xD;
      LM group, we chose the Aubaniac technique to cannulate the SCV(10) . The needle was inserted&#xD;
      1 cm inferior and laterally to the junction of the medial one-third and lateral two-thirds of&#xD;
      the clavicle, it was passed below the clavicle and above the first rib and it was advanced&#xD;
      parallel to the floor, through the subclavian muscle, until it entered the subclavian vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intravascular position of the catheter was approved by venous blood's reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the US group, we chose the infraclavicular approach with long axis view(11). A portable&#xD;
      ultrasound unit (Mindray M7®, Shenzhen, China) equipped with a 12 MHz linear transducer was&#xD;
      used. The probe was covered with ultrasonic gel and wrapped in a sterile sheath. The first&#xD;
      step was to visualize the SCV and the artery in a short axis view. Then, maneuvers of the&#xD;
      transducer were performed to expose the axillary vein and in its continuation till the SCV on&#xD;
      the longitudinal axis to achieve an optimum plane of catheterization.The probe was handled by&#xD;
      the non-dominant hand. The needle was introduced slowly with the dominant hand so that its&#xD;
      tip's trajectory could be detected superficially. It was advanced in real-time toward the&#xD;
      lumen of the vein, on the longitudinal axis, while it was directed toward the acoustic shadow&#xD;
      of the thoracic rib underneath. This leads to minimize the risk of damaging the pleurae and&#xD;
      the lung in case of an vein's transfixion. Hence, the needle entered the lumen of the vessel&#xD;
      either at the level of the axillary vein or at the level of its medial continuation by the&#xD;
      SCV . After that,venous blood returned in the syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the both technique, the guidewire and the catheter were advanced according to the&#xD;
      Seldinger's technique (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest X-ray was used to evaluate the position of the catheter's tip and to detect&#xD;
      pneumothorax. Hematoma was detected by ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics, presence of risks factors for difficult venous catheterization&#xD;
      and side of cannulation were recorded for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the successful insertion of the catheter. Failure was defined by a&#xD;
      number of attempts greater than or equal to five.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary and comes were: the success's rate in the first attempt, the number of&#xD;
      attempts, redirections rate, number of redirections, access time (defined as the time between&#xD;
      the skin puncture and the return of venous blood) and complications such as hematoma,&#xD;
      pneumothorax, arterial puncture and malposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated assuming a difference of proposition of success rate at 20% with a&#xD;
      statistical power of 0.85 (alpha = 0.05). The precise sample size estimation was 33 per group&#xD;
      and 66 in totals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis were performed using SPSS 200 software. Normal distributions of&#xD;
      continuous variables were compared using Student t-test .Mann-Whitney U test was used for&#xD;
      continuous variables without normal distribution. Categorical variables were compared using&#xD;
      the χ2 test and Fisher exact test. Data were expressed as mean ± SD or as median (25th&#xD;
      percentile - 75th percentile). A p value (two-sided in all tests) of 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      significant. A linear regression was used to evaluate the relation between access's time and&#xD;
      patient's range.&#xD;
