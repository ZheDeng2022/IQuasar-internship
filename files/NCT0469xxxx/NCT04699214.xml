  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of Endostar (recombinant human&#xD;
      endostatin) combined with AI chemotherapy in adjuvant treatment after radical resection of&#xD;
      recurrent soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with stage IIB/III soft tissue sarcoma after surgical treatment for local&#xD;
      recurrence were randomly divided into three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Endostar combined chemotherapy AI Endostar: Endostar 45mg/d, D1-5 iv, Q3W, that is,&#xD;
      continuous intravenous pump injection for 120 hours for 5 consecutive days, one cycle.&#xD;
      Endostar takes 15 medicines per cycle, and a Baxter pump per single cycle. Subjects buy and&#xD;
      use them at their own expense every two cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AI: Doxorubicin (ADM) 60mg/m2 iv D1+ Ifosfamide (IFO) 2g/m2/d D1-5+ Mesna 400mg/m 2&#xD;
      (ifosfamide start infusion, time after infusion 4 hours, 8 hours injection) D1-5, Q3W.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B:Chemotherapy AI AI: Doxorubicin (ADM) 60mg/m2 iv D1+ Ifosfamide (IFO) 2g/m2/d D1-5+&#xD;
      Mesna 400mg/m 2 (ifosfamide start infusion, time after infusion 4 hours, 8 hours injection)&#xD;
      D1-5, Q3W.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Observation group Best supportive treatment, observation and follow-up. The dose of&#xD;
      Endostar is not adjusted, and the specific adjustment plan of the chemotherapy regimen is&#xD;
      adjusted according to the clinical experience of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with no disease progression (local tumor recurrence, distant metastasis, or the&#xD;
      appearance of new lesions of the same tumor subtype) and the adverse reactions can be&#xD;
      tolerated, continue to use the drug for 6 cycles, and cannot receive other anti-tumor&#xD;
      treatments. During the medication, if the disease progresses or the researcher believes that&#xD;
      the patient is not suitable for continuing medication, the medication will end.&#xD;
