    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to introduce and clinically evaluate prolonged normothermic&#xD;
      machine perfusion (PNMP) to preserve and assess high-risk donor kidneys prior to&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently kidney transplantation is the only viable option for patients with kidney failure&#xD;
      to regain quality of life and health. The number of organs available for transplantation is&#xD;
      insufficient with a widening gap between supply and demand. Nowadays, centers accept older&#xD;
      and higher risk donor organs with co-morbidity, often leading to non-function, complications&#xD;
      and with half of the patients back on dialysis within 15 years. Furthermore, many donor&#xD;
      kidneys have to be discarded as too damaged and beyond repair. Increasing the quality and&#xD;
      therefore transplantability of these high-risk donor organs could significantly increase the&#xD;
      donor kidney pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using prolonged normothermic perfusion of marginal donor organs, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      kick start regeneration in the kidney before transplantation, improving function and survival&#xD;
      long-term. Furthermore, the choice to accept or decline a donor kidney organ is currently&#xD;
      based on subjective criteria and causes great uncertainty amongst clinicians. There is a dire&#xD;
      need for tools to aid in decision making and reduce this uncertainty. Biomarkers predictive&#xD;
      of graft regeneration are lacking. Samples from perfused kidneys and donor recipients will be&#xD;
      collected and analysed to allow the formulation of a kidney fitness index.&#xD;

    <description>Eligible and consenting patients who will receive a donor kidney will be included for participation in this study. Current practice is to preserve donor kidneys on hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP). In this study, donor kidneys (n=18) will be taken off the HMP after arrival in the transplant center. These will then be perfused with oxygenated perfusate using the NMP device following an optimised NMP protocol.</description>

    <description>First, a cohort of DCD kidneys (n=6) will be subjected to 1 hour of NMP and subsequently transplanted [NMP1]. Before extending the duration, secondary endpoints will be evaluated. Thereafter, the duration of NMP will be prolonged to 3 hours (n=6) [PNMP3] and consequently 6 hours (n=6) [PNMP6].</description>
