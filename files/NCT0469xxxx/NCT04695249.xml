  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the feasibility and efficacy of an individualized exposure&#xD;
      intervention using 360-degree videos for social anxiety and agoraphobia. A multiple single&#xD;
      case design is followed with a pre-post-follow up assessment and multiple baselines. In&#xD;
      addition, an experience sampling method is used to explore the role of dysfunctional beliefs&#xD;
      and self-efficacy in the efficacy intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that supports the use of Virtual Reality (VR) to address anxiety&#xD;
      disorders such as social anxiety and agoraphobia. The main advantage of VR is to expose&#xD;
      participants to their fears in a controlled and safe environment. However, the access to VR&#xD;
      remains costly for health professionals who need to pay licenses for the use of a limited&#xD;
      number of environments. Therefore, these standardized environments only address the symptoms&#xD;
      of standard anxious patients. As a way to provide an accessible tool that can be tailored&#xD;
      according to patients' specific difficulties, the proposed approach builds on 360-degree&#xD;
      videos as an alternative to VR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of an individualized&#xD;
      expo-sure intervention using 360-degree videos. In addition, the role of cognitive processes&#xD;
      (i.e., dysfunctional beliefs and self-efficacy) in the exposure efficacy is examined. The&#xD;
      intervention includes eleven sessions including five sessions of exposure in 360-degree&#xD;
      videos de-signed especially for each patient difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multiple single-case design (n=5) is adopted with three types of evaluations: (1)&#xD;
      traditional assessment scale of primary/secondary outcomes and aspects related to the&#xD;
      therapy, (2) daily ambulatory assessment with a multiple baseline design, (3) experience&#xD;
      sampling of cognitive processes about feared situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each video will also be assessed by the participants after exposure sessions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline : up to 4 weeks before intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The French version of the LSAS-SR was used to assess the levels of anxiety and avoidance associated with social situations. The LSAS-SR consists of 24 items describing four types of situations: (1) social interactions, (2) public speaking, (3) eating and drinking in public, (4) being observed. Each item is rated on a 3-point scale according to both the level of fear (0 = &quot;no fear&quot; to 3 = &quot;severe&quot;) and the level of avoidance (0 = &quot;never&quot; to 3 = &quot;Usually&quot;). A general total score can be obtained by summing all items and specific score of avoidance and fear as well as scores for specific type of situations can be obtained by summing specific items.</description>

    <description>A non-validated French version of the AABS-2 was used to assess dysfunctional beliefs known to be aetiologically related to anxiety. The AABS-2 consists of 33 beliefs concerning (1) Exposure to judgement, (2) Body vigilance, (3) Thought manifestations and (4) Anxiety. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 100 with anchor points at 20, 40, 50, 60, 80%. The four specific scores and one general score are obtained by adding the relevant items. Higher scores indicate greater adherence in beliefs associated with anxiety.</description>
