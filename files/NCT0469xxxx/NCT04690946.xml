  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common mental illness which is costly for both society and for those&#xD;
      affected. There is a need for effective treatments of depression and there is a need to make&#xD;
      sure that the treatments that are given are based on scientific findings. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators want to examine and compare two common treatment models for depression -&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Emotion-Focused Therapy. The investigators want to&#xD;
      investigate what characterizes these treatments when they are successful, and seek to better&#xD;
      understand what it is like for patients to receive these treatments. Also, the investigators&#xD;
      will investigate the experience of patients who abruptly discontinue treatment. To&#xD;
      investigate these questions, self-report measures, interviews and analysis of session&#xD;
      recordings will be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a widespread mental disorder which can result in severe impairment and reduced&#xD;
      quality of life for those affected. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the approach with&#xD;
      strongest empirical support, and is often recommended as treatment for depression, as in the&#xD;
      NICE Guidelines for Depression from 2009. However, research indicates that not all patients&#xD;
      respond to CBT, indicating a need to expand the range of available evidence-based&#xD;
      psychotherapies, and mapping the mechanisms of change in existing treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotion focused therapy (EFT) is one promising treatment for depression with empirical&#xD;
      support for its efficacy. A previous study found equal outcome in CBT and&#xD;
      Process-Experiential treatment/EFT for depression, but more studies are needed to replicate&#xD;
      these findings across cultural contexts. The main aim of this study is to investigate whether&#xD;
      there are significant differences in the therapeutic effect of EFT compared to that of CBT&#xD;
      for patients with moderate and major depressive disorder in a Norwegian outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several psychotherapeutic approaches have shown efficacy in the treatment of&#xD;
      depression, no psychotherapeutic interventions is beneficial for all patients. There is a&#xD;
      need for research that investigates what treatments works for whom, based on patient&#xD;
      characteristics and preferences. The present study will investigate whether patient&#xD;
      characteristics moderate treatment outcome, both within and between treatment conditions. In&#xD;
      addition, qualitative interviews will be conducted to get a deeper understanding of what&#xD;
      clients find helpful and challenging within the CBT and EFT condition, and to explore the&#xD;
      experience of patients who drop-out of the treatment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to further develop psychotherapeutic treatments and increase their effectiveness,&#xD;
      there is a need to identify processes that are related to good and poor outcome.&#xD;
      Process-outcome studies are commonly used for this purpose. The present study will&#xD;
      investigate and compare characteristics of psychotherapy processes in both the CBT and EFT&#xD;
      conditions and how these are related to outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in order to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of EFT to CBT. RCT's are considered the gold standard for efficacy studies.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Norwegian mental health program &quot;Return to work&quot;, a&#xD;
      publicly funded treatment program where patients with common mental health issues receives&#xD;
      outpatient psychotherapeutic treatment to reduce and prevent sick leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will address the following research hypothesis and questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EFT and CBT will not result in significantly different outcome in the treatment of&#xD;
           patients with moderate and major depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient characteristics (severity of depression, adverse childhood experiences and&#xD;
           clients' initial ability to make sense of their experience) will moderate treatment&#xD;
           outcome for both conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Will therapeutic processes (therapeutic alliance, therapist empathy, clients' ability to&#xD;
           make sense of their experience and emotional processing) mediate treatment outcome&#xD;
           equally for both conditions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What do patients in both conditions describe as helpful and unhelpful aspects of&#xD;
           treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How do patients in both conditions describe their own change or lack or change after&#xD;
           treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How do patients that choose to drop out of treatment describe the processes leading to&#xD;
           that decision?&#xD;
