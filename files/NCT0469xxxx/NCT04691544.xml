  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) do not experience adequate symptom relief&#xD;
      with current treatments. The pathophysiology of IBS is diverse, controversial and not&#xD;
      completely understood. The next disruptive frontier would be to find a cure where the effect&#xD;
      is predictable and lasting. The study groups phase 2 pilot trial was the first indication of&#xD;
      a possible benefit from treating IBS with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) (Number&#xD;
      needed to treat only five) (Fecal microbiota transplantation versus placebo for&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndrome: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, single-centre trial he Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology 2018).&#xD;
      Additional results from the same trial show that the treatment response may be predicted&#xD;
      (unpublished data), and that the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the treatment response&#xD;
      also can be identified (Effects of fecal microbiota transplantation in subjects with&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome are mirrored by changes in gut microbiome, Gut Microbes 2020). This&#xD;
      study is the first phase 3 trial of FMT for IBS worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the trial is that donor FMT is more effective than placebo FMT in treating&#xD;
      IBS, with little adverse events or complications. Patients ≥18 years with IBS are enrolled at&#xD;
      five Norwegian Hospitals in this double blind randomized, placebo controlled, parallell-group&#xD;
      multi center trial. Participants are randomized to FMT from a healthy donor (intervention&#xD;
      group), or their own feces (placebo group). The primary outcome is the proportion of patients&#xD;
      with ≥75 points decrease in the Irritable bowel Symptom Severity score 90 days after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Scores on the IBS-SSS can range from 0 to 500 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The IBS-SSS has five items. Subjects can be categorized as having mild (75-175), moderate (175-300), or severe (&gt;300) IBS. A decrease of 50 points is associated with a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 90 after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS-QoL is a validated self-report questionnaire specific to IBS to evaluate quality of life over the past 30 days. It consists of 34 items, each with a five-point Likert scale. The individual response to the 34 items are summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS specific quality of life. The cut-off for meaningful clinical improvement is set at ≥14 points. There are also eight subscale scores for the IBS-QOL (Dysphoria, Interference with Activity, Body Image, Health Worry, Food Avoidance, Social Reaction, Sexual, Relationships)</description>

    <time_frame>Day 69, 76, 83 and 90 after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A. Adequate relief is determined by the patient question &quot;How would you rate your IBS signs and symptoms overall over the past 7 days?&quot;. Criteria A. is fulfilled when participants score 1 or 2 on a 7-point numerical rating scale.&#xD;
B. Abdominal pain is determined by the question &quot;How would you rate your abdominal pain overall over the past 7 days?&quot; The patient answer on a 11-point numerical rating scale, where 0 is &quot;No pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;Worst possible pain''. Criteria B. is fulfilled when participants experience a 30% decrease in the scale score after treatment, compared to the score before treatment.</description>

Mean stool consistency score is measured by Bristol Stool Scale (&quot;How would you rate the stool consistency overall the last 24 hours?&quot;).&#xD;

    <description>Items on the MFIS can be aggregated into three subscales (physical (range 0 to 36), cognitive (range 0 to 40), and psychosocial (range 0 to 8)), as well as into a total MFIS score (range 0 to 84). All items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a person's activities.</description>
