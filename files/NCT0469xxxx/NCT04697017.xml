      The contribution of genetics to dental caries, oral habits and occlusal traits in children of&#xD;
      multiple births in different age groups: A comparative study&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the study groups comprised MZ and DZ twin pairs, triplets and singletons&#xD;
      between the ages of 2 and 17 who attended the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at Suleyman&#xD;
      Demirel University between January 2018 and September 2020. Twins and triplets who had&#xD;
      developmental anomalies such as cleft lip and palate, premature tooth loss, systemic diseases&#xD;
      or syndromes that could influence oral health or had already undergone or were undergoing&#xD;
      orthodontic therapy, as well as those whose family did not give consent, were excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children were assessed by the same experienced pedodontist (E.O.) to avoid interexaminer&#xD;
      variability. The oral examination was performed using sterile mouth mirror and probe. The&#xD;
      prevalence of dental caries was recorded using dmft index (decayed, missing and filled teeth)&#xD;
      in primary dentition and DMFT index (Decayed, Missing and Filled teeth) in permanent&#xD;
      dentition. When evaluating patients over 6 years old, the missing tooth component was not&#xD;
      included in the primary dft scores. The depth of caries lesions in children of single and&#xD;
      multiple births was estimated visually using the World Health Organization (WHO) periodontal&#xD;
      probe (D1: clinical detectable enamel lesion with intact surfaces, D2: clinical detectable&#xD;
      cavities limited to enamel, D3: clinically detectable lesions in dentin with or without&#xD;
      cavitations of dentin, D4: lesion into pulp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral hygiene practices, such as tooth brushing frequency and the children's past or present&#xD;
      oral habits (digit sucking, nail biting, tongue thrust, bruxism, lip biting, pencil biting,&#xD;
      cheek biting and mouth breathing), were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary molar relationships were evaluated as flush terminal plane and mesial and distal&#xD;
      step. The permanent molar relationships were recorded as Class I, Class II (Division 1 and 2)&#xD;
      and Class III. Occlusal traits such as increased overjet, deep bite, open bite and anterior&#xD;
      and posterior crossbite were recorded as present (1) or absent (0) with the help of a dental&#xD;
      probe&#xD;
