  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30 healthy older participants were enrolled in the study and were randomly classified into&#xD;
      two groups. In the experimental group (n = 15) participants received 10-week Tai Chi Chuan&#xD;
      practice intervention, in the control group (n=15) participants were asked do not change&#xD;
      their living habits in 10 weeks. All participants had no practice Tai Chi Chuan before.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants had to proceed with familiarization with cognitive function tests before all&#xD;
      measurements and evaluation. Study protocol began in the early morning after overnight&#xD;
      fasting (10.7 ± 4.7 h). Firstly, participants were asked to lay in the supine position for 15&#xD;
      minutes in rest to measure resting heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) during&#xD;
      the last 10 minutes and blood pressure afterward. Subsequently, participants completed PSS-10&#xD;
      and HADS questionnaires, and then a venous blood sample was taken for BDNF and irisin&#xD;
      concentrations measurements. Then measurements of cognitive functions and motor learning were&#xD;
      performed. After baseline assessments, participants were randomized to the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups. The experimental group subjects (n=15; 13 women) participated in 10 weeks Tai&#xD;
      Chi practice. In the control group, participants (n=15; 13 women) were instructed do not to&#xD;
      engage in any additional sports practice. All tests and measurements were repeated after 10&#xD;
      weeks in the same order as it was at the beginning of the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale - PSS-10</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this scale is to assess the degree of stress in subjects' lives. It consists of questions about the frequency of feeling and thoughts during the past time period. Potential answers: 0-never; 1-almost never; 2-sometimes; 3-fairly often and 4-very often. The scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the four positive items:for example, 0=4, 1=3, 2=2, etc. and then summing across all items. Scores for the 10-item form range from 0 to 40,with higher scores indicating greater perceived stress</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the level of anxiety and depression of subjects was used HADS scale. The scale consists of totally 14questions with the answers valued from 0 to 3. Half of questions addressed to estimate anxiety and rest - depression.The total scoring and conclusion for the both categories of questions: 0-7 = Normal; 8-10 = Borderline abnormal(borderline case); 11-21 = Abnormal (case)</description>

    <description>Venous blood samples from the median antecubital vein were collected in 5 ml vacuum tubes with a gel separator and was separated by centrifugation (15 min at 1200g) to make blood serum. Samples were aliquoted and stored at -20°C until analysis. The serum concentration of Human Free BDNF was measured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit(R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, USA).</description>
