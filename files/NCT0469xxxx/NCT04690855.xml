  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study designed to assess efficacy and safety of talazoparib, high dose&#xD;
      radiation, and atezolizumab in patients with metastatic TNBC that is PD-L1 positive. A total&#xD;
      of 23 gBRCA pathogenic variant negative patients will be enrolled. All patients will be&#xD;
      treated with induction talazoparib of 1mg PO daily starting Day 1. Patients will then receive&#xD;
      8 Gy x 3 fractions to 2-4 metastatic lesions beginning Day 12,13, or 14 and given QOD. 840 mg&#xD;
      of atezolizumab will be given intravenously (IV) on Day 15 of the 1st cycle and then on Day 1&#xD;
      and Day 15 of the remaining cycles. The sequence of administration is not specified on the&#xD;
      days in which talazoparib and atezolizumab are given on the same day. Each cycle equals 28&#xD;
      days. Treatment will continue until progression or severe toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety lead in of up to 6 patients will be performed. Immune-related and non-immune related&#xD;
      adverse events will be tracked up to 12 weeks post initiation of atezolizumab, as the&#xD;
      majority of treatment-related toxicities from talazoparib, radiation, and atezolizumab occur&#xD;
      within this time period.&#xD;
