  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of immunocheckpoint inhibitors and anti-angiogenesis therapy has synergistic&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect and is a reasonable method to improve the prognosis of patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      in this study, it is hoped that antinib hydrochloride combined with Sinidilizumab can&#xD;
      overcome immunotherapy resistance, improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, and further improve&#xD;
      the survival of patients, so as to provide more clinical evidence for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC patients with negative driver gene after first-line treatment with anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most cancer cells that do not respond to a single immune checkpoint inhibitor escape through&#xD;
      the innate immune escape mechanism, allowing them to grow and survive. Different from the&#xD;
      inherent resistance mechanism, some patients who initially responded to immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors developed disease progression after a period of treatment and follow-up,&#xD;
      suggesting acquired resistance. Therefore, clinical strategies continue to be applied to&#xD;
      overcome inherent and acquired resistance to improve the clinical efficacy of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors. Combining an immune checkpoint inhibitor with another drug that has&#xD;
      both immune regulation and anti-tumor properties can enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of any&#xD;
      one drug when used alone. Studies have shown that tumor angiogenesis participates in&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune regulation and will aggravate the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment,&#xD;
      and anti-angiogenesis therapy can normalize the abnormal vascular structure and function of&#xD;
      tumors, and help the recruitment and infiltration of effector T cells. , Reduce the&#xD;
      accumulation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, relieve the immunosuppressive state,&#xD;
      thereby improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. The combination of anti-angiogenic drugs and&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitors has become a promising treatment strategy.&#xD;
