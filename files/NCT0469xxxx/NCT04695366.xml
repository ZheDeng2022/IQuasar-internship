  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually some 450 patients are diagnosed with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), in&#xD;
      Denmark. The majority of these patients are cured with immunochemotherapy, but up to 30 %&#xD;
      will relapse, pointing to the need for targeted surveillance and follow-up strategy. However,&#xD;
      this strategy is constantly under debate illustrated by the missing data supporting scheduled&#xD;
      face-to-face meetings with a clinician and routine surveillance scans in order to detect&#xD;
      relapse. On top of the clinical problems comes the psychological burden for patients enrolled&#xD;
      in routine surveillance. This points to the need for the development of evidence-based&#xD;
      follow-up programs both in terms of content, regularity and assignment of responsibility&#xD;
      between the health system and the patient. In a prospective cohort study, the investigators&#xD;
      will collect Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures investigating if questionnaires can be&#xD;
      used to detect relapse in DLBCL patients. Furthermore psychological aspects of follow-up are&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Western world, DLBCL is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In&#xD;
      Denmark, approximately 450 patients are diagnosed with DLBCL every year. Treatment with&#xD;
      anthracycline-based immunochemotherapy (most commonly rituximab, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) is curative in the majority of DLBCL patients but a&#xD;
      significant number of patients (up to 30 %) do not achieve a complete response (CR), and an&#xD;
      additional subset of patients ultimately relapse after CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second-line treatment with salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplantation (auto-HCT) is potentially curative, therefore surveillance for relapse is&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of relapse is declining after two years and for patients achieving event-free survival&#xD;
      for 24 months (post treatment), survival beyond this timepoint is close to equivalent to that&#xD;
      of the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However optimal means of follow-up for patients with DLBCL remain controversial and have been&#xD;
      a somewhat overlooked and contentious issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, routine follow-up in DLBCL patients consists of face-to-face meetings with a&#xD;
      specialist in an outpatient clinic, with varying intervals and a mixture of surveillance&#xD;
      components, such as clinical examinations, blood tests or imaging procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To illustrate the lack of consistency in this patient group, the ESMO guidelines recommend&#xD;
      follow-up with 4 visits in the first year, every 6 months the next 2 years and then annually,&#xD;
      whereas The British Society of Hematology guidelines recommend clinical follow-up for 2 years&#xD;
      followed by discharge. Guidelines from the Danish Lymphoma Group (DLG) reflect the&#xD;
      recommendations outlined in the Lugano classification. Patients with International Prognostic&#xD;
      Index (IPI) 0-1 who have obtained complete remission (CR), are recommended to be followed&#xD;
      every 3 to 4 months the first year, then every 6 months for 2 years, without routine use of&#xD;
      image diagnostics. For patients with IPI&gt; = 2, clinical follow-up is recommended every 3 to 4&#xD;
      months the first 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years. CT scan is used 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years the value of post-therapy surveillance scans in DLBCL has been questioned.&#xD;
      Only a minority of relapses are detected solely via imaging and no survival advantage&#xD;
      associated with the use of surveillance imaging has been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another argument against scheduled follow-up is, that the majority of relapses are probably&#xD;
      identified outside the scheduled follow-up visits, and by patients themselves rather than by&#xD;
      the physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data is information reported through questionnaires, directly&#xD;
      by patients, about how they observe symptoms, physical function and quality of life. During&#xD;
      recent years, PRO has experienced much attention due to the increasing evidence of the&#xD;
      positive effect of clinical responses to PRO measures, that are applied as intervention aids&#xD;
      both in terms of relieving the symptom burden, improvements in the overall psychosocial&#xD;
      function of the patient and survival benefits in two studies. It has been argued that the use&#xD;
      of PRO offers an opportunity to facilitate a transition to a more patient centred approach by&#xD;
      strengthening the role of patients in observing themselves. But there are several barriers&#xD;
      for the implementation of PRO, such as accessibility, user-friendliness, processing the&#xD;
      collected information, difficulties for patients having few resources and finally the&#xD;
      interpretation of the PRO data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigator's knowledge, no study has investigated, if collection of PRO data is&#xD;
      useful in detection of relapse in DLBCL or other lymphoma subtypes. As of today, most studies&#xD;
      in this patient group have focused on HRQOL, late-effects or unmet needs in survivorship&#xD;
      after treatment of lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To solve this dilemma between ineffective, scheduled follow-up visits and the constant need&#xD;
      for identifying patients at risk of relapse, it has been suggested, that PRO measures offer a&#xD;
      potential for use by clinicians as a decision aid in identifying patients in need for&#xD;
      clinical consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial distress (anxiety, fear and depressive feelings) have been described to be&#xD;
      significant in lymphoma survivors and associated to a more frequent use of Health Care&#xD;
      services. One explanation is that lymphoma survivors need for psychosocial support is not met&#xD;
      in the current follow-up program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another explanation, is that there may be a psychological burden to routine surveillance and&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up visits in the outpatient clinic. Anxiety symptoms, depressive feelings&#xD;
      and fear of recurrence (FCR) in long-term lymphoma survivors are especially prevalent in the&#xD;
      time leading up to surveillance scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fear of relapse might be a rational response after treatment of a life-threatening disease,&#xD;
      but FCR have been associated to lower quality of life, increased psychological distress,&#xD;
      dissatisfaction with care, and severe FCR even with an inferior overall survival compared&#xD;
      with survivors without severe FCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, it has been argued whether FCR is a consequence or a cause of anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and lower quality of life. Maybe cancer survivors with certain anxiety traits&#xD;
      and/or a tendency of negative views about their health and quality of life are more at risk&#xD;
      of experiencing FCR during their survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic data such as female gender, younger age, living alone or poor social&#xD;
      support have been associated with increased risk of FCR, but also poorer health conditions&#xD;
      and advanced cancer stage (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigator's knowledge, no study has investigated the association between&#xD;
      socio-demographic data, comorbidities, health literacy and psychosocial distress during&#xD;
      follow-up of lymphoma patients. It offers the potential to identify patients in need of more&#xD;
      or less support during follow-up and to move in the direction of a more personalized care of&#xD;
      lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to create a PRO questionnaire and test feasibility and the potential&#xD;
      to detect relapse in DLBCL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, PRO data is collected on patient experiences during follow-up and psychological&#xD;
      aspect of survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's hope for the future is to move towards a more patient centred and&#xD;
      individualized follow-up after treatment of lymphoma patients.&#xD;
