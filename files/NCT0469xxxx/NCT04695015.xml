      The purpose of this study is to establish a standardized process for obtaining digital&#xD;
      pathological image information of ocular tumors; use modern pathological techniques to obtain&#xD;
      the co-expression information of multiple biomarkers in the pathological tissues of ocular&#xD;
      tumors, and finally construct standardized digital ocular tumors with biomarkers Pathology&#xD;
      image database.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective study. Patients with common and representative ocular tumors in&#xD;
      the Department of Ophthalmology, Peking University Third Hospital, will be selected and&#xD;
      enrolled after informed consent to collect basic clinical information, preoperative blood&#xD;
      samples, and ocular tumors Obtain pathological image annotation data and genomics-related&#xD;
      data from ocular tumor tissue specimens, use blood samples for genomics information analysis,&#xD;
      provide multi-dimensional data for the development of artificial intelligence algorithms, and&#xD;
      establish artificial intelligence-assisted image data for eye tumors Standardize the process&#xD;
      and establish a multi-modal ocular tumor standardized database of &quot;clinical&#xD;
      information-tissue samples-pathological images-genomics data&quot;. The database and the diagnosis&#xD;
      system are correlated with each other to provide optimal image data for later machine&#xD;
      learning and related algorithm establishment, and finally the investigators will be completed&#xD;
      the design of a new artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis system for eye tumors.&#xD;

      After the blood samples are treated with EDTA anti coagulation, the second-generation&#xD;
      sequencing is performed from the DNA level and the RNA level to collect relevant genomics&#xD;
      information, and establish an ocular tumor fusion genome database. Investigators will&#xD;
      establish a complete sequencing data annotation database based on the existing tumor&#xD;
      sequencing data annotation and analysis of soft nail sets and tumor sequencing data related&#xD;
      public databases (such as the cosmic database).&#xD;
