    <textblock>
      Excessive anxiety among elementary students is highly prevalent and associated with&#xD;
      impairment in academic, social, and behavioral functioning. The primary aim of this project&#xD;
      is to evaluate the initial efficacy of a brief nurse-delivered intervention (CALM: Child&#xD;
      Anxiety Learning Modules), relative to a credible comparison (CALM-R, relaxation skills only)&#xD;
      and a waitlist control for reducing anxiety symptoms and improving education outcomes at post&#xD;
      intervention and at a 1-year follow-up. In addition, the research team will assess the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of CALM versus CALM-R and the waitlist control and examine potential&#xD;
      predictors, moderators, and mediators of CALM's impact on child outcomes based on the&#xD;
      proposed theory of change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive anxiety among elementary age students is common, severely impairs academic, social,&#xD;
      and behavioral functioning, and is associated with significant educational and health care&#xD;
      costs. Despite the high burden of anxiety, less than half of children with anxiety receive&#xD;
      the services they need to succeed in school. School clinicians can and do support these&#xD;
      youth, however, their caseloads are high and their time to provide individualized services is&#xD;
      limited. Consequently, there is a critical need to expand the network of providers who can&#xD;
      assist students with anxiety and address this malleable obstacle to student academic success.&#xD;
      Because somatic complaints, such as headaches and stomach aches, are a hallmark feature of&#xD;
      excessive anxiety, school nurses are often the first school-based personnel to identify&#xD;
      problematic anxiety in students. However, school nurses currently lack training in&#xD;
      evidenced-based anxiety reduction interventions. The current study leverages findings from a&#xD;
      three-year IES Development award (R305A140694), through which our team developed and assessed&#xD;
      the feasibility of training elementary school nurses to use a brief intervention to reduce&#xD;
      student anxiety; it was demonstrated that the training and intervention (i.e., Child Anxiety&#xD;
      Learning Modules; CALM) was indeed feasible to implement and resulted in positive changes in&#xD;
      student outcomes. CALM is now a fully developed intervention with ready-to-use intervention&#xD;
      components and materials, training and coaching procedures, and is ready for an initial&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation in authentic school settings. Toward that end, the primary purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CALM in a fully powered randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. CALM will be delivered by elementary school nurses in rural, suburban, and urban&#xD;
      elementary schools in Connecticut and Maryland to enhance the generalizability of findings&#xD;
      across socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and neighborhood settings (as approximately 80% of&#xD;
      schools in the US have a school nurse). The efficacy of CALM will be tested using gold&#xD;
      standard methods (e.g., independent evaluators to assess primary outcomes). The study's&#xD;
      primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of CALM, compared to a credible comparison condition&#xD;
      (CALM-R; a school nurse delivered relaxation skills only intervention that parallels CALM in&#xD;
      time and format) as well as a waitlist control, for reducing anxiety symptoms and improving&#xD;
      educational outcomes at post-intervention and a one year follow-up. The secondary aim is to&#xD;
      examine the cost effectiveness of CALM relative to CALM-R and the waitlist control. An&#xD;
      exploratory aim is to examine potential predictors, moderators, and mediators of student&#xD;
      outcomes based on the proposed theory of change. If efficacious, CALM will be the first&#xD;
      evidenced-based school nurse delivered intervention to assist youth with excessive anxiety,&#xD;
      filling an important gap in current practices.&#xD;

Nine scores can be derived from the SDQ. (1-5) Five subscales, each of which corresponds to 5 domains: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, prosocial problems. Subscale scores are summed. (6) The total score is generated by summing the scores from all the scales except the prosocial scale. (7-8) Externalizing scores (conduct and hyperactivity) and internalizing scores (emotional and peer problems) are also provided.

    <description>The CAIS is a 27-item child- and parent-report measure of anxiety-related interference in social, academic and family functioning. Children and parents respond to items using a 4-point Likert scale (not at all, just a little, pretty much, very much); higher scores represent greater interference of anxiety in child functioning. The CAIS-C has a total score (27 items, score range 0-81) and three subscales: school (10 items, score range 0-30), social (11 items, score range 0-33), and home/family (6 items, score range 0-18).</description>

    <description>The SAS is a 16-item teacher questionnaire that assesses anxiety in the school setting, with a specific focus on social and generalized anxiety symptoms relevant to classroom participation. Teachers rate student anxiety on a 4-point Likert scale that ranges from &quot;never (0)&quot; to &quot;always (3).&quot; The SAS-TR contains a total score (16 items, range of 0 to 48) and two subscales: social anxiety (7 items, range of 0-21) and generalized anxiety (9 items, range of 0 to 27). Higher scores represent higher levels of anxiety; scores of 8 and more on the social anxiety, 10 or more on the generalized anxiety, and 17 or more on the total anxiety is considered to represent high anxious condition.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks after baseline, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The ADIS-V is a structured interview that assesses anxiety diagnoses and severity in youth. Impairment ratings are generated for each diagnosis using the Clinician Severity Rating (CSR, range = 0-8; higher CSRs indicate higher severity of anxiety disorders, a CSR of 4 is required to assign a diagnosis). Diagnoses are derived separately from the child and parent report, which yields a Composite Diagnosis that is one measure used to determine study eligibility.</description>

Youth and parents respond to items using a 3-point Likert-type scale describing the degree to which statements are true (0 = not true or hardly ever true, 1 = somewhat true or sometimes true, 2 = very true or often true). Higher scores represent higher levels of anxiety. Six scores can be derived from the SCARED: one total score (41 items, score range 0-82) plus five subscale scores: panic/somatic (13 items, score range 0-26), generalized anxiety (9 items, score range 0-18), (3) separation anxiety (8 items, score range 0-16), social anxiety (7 items, score range 0-14), and school phobia (4 items, score range 0-8).</description>

    <description>The CALM and CALM-R Intervention Fidelity, Adherence, Differentiation, and Competence forms contain key points/principles that should be covered during each CALM and CALM-R module and assesses whether they were covered (yes/no), the quality of administration (using a 4 point scale where 1 = poor to 4 = very good), and non-specific factors (e. g., maintains a positive working relationship). For adherence, a yes indicates nurses adhere to the manual; no indicates nurses did not adhere for that particular item.

    <ipd_description>Publications: we will submit all publications to the ERIC within 12 months of the publisher's official date of final publication. We will also email copies of publications to interested parties upon request.&#xD;
Data Access/Sharing: We will provide timely access to the final research data (including data file in SPSS format and a variable codebook). We will share only cleaned, de-identified or synthetic data. These data include surveys/interviews and school records. We will create a data documentation file (i.e., description of all original and derived/summary variables and definitions) to accompany the data file. The documentation will include a description of the study, data collection forms, study protocol/procedures, descriptions of variable recoding performed, and a list of major study publications and investigators.</ipd_description>
