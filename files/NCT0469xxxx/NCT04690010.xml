  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in eight human beings will develop kidney stones during their lifetime. Of these, roughly&#xD;
      20% require surgery. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the standard minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgical procedure for removal of large kidney stones. In the standard PCNL technique, a&#xD;
      drainage tube connecting the kidney to a bag on the outside of the body (nephrostomy tube) is&#xD;
      left in place after surgery. Patients are admitted to hospital for one to two days for&#xD;
      observation at which time the nephrostomy tube is removed before discharge. The presence of&#xD;
      the nephrostomy tube is associated with pain, increased use of opioids, and slower recovery&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory PCNL has been proposed as a way to potentially speed recovery, reduce pain,&#xD;
      decrease time in hospital, and decrease cost. Initial studies of ambulatory tubeless PCNL&#xD;
      have shown favourable results. However, these studies were performed in a small subset of&#xD;
      healthy patients with favourable stones that do not represent the majority of patients who&#xD;
      undergo PCNL. In this technique, patients are discharged home the same day as surgery usually&#xD;
      with a small drainage tube on the inside of the body called a stent that is removed 1-2 weeks&#xD;
      later and no nephrostomy tube (tubeless). The stent itself can be painful and may require a&#xD;
      second procedure for removal. There is increasing evidence for the safety of totally tubeless&#xD;
      PCNL (in which no nephrostomy tube or ureteric stent is placed) or placement of a stent on a&#xD;
      string for a short period of time. Given that current recommendations for stone management in&#xD;
      the times of COVID-19 include minimizing use of stents, the investigators believe it is an&#xD;
      optimal time to evaluate safety and efficacy of using a minimal stenting technique (either no&#xD;
      stent at all or stent on string) in ambulatory PCNL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to determine if ambulatory tubeless PCNL is safe and effective&#xD;
      compared to inpatient PCNL with a nephrostomy tube in a more representative patient&#xD;
      population including obese patients, patients with moderate medical comorbidities, and&#xD;
      patients with large kidney stones. A secondary aim is to determine if a minimal stent&#xD;
      technique (stent on a string for 5 days or less or no stent) is safe and effective as an exit&#xD;
      strategy in ambulatory PCNL patients. The study hypothesis is that ambulatory tubeless PCNL&#xD;
      will have similar complication and stone free rates as inpatient PCNL with benefits over&#xD;
      inpatient PCNL including improved patient quality of life, decreased use of opioid pain&#xD;
      medications, shortened hospital admission, faster return to work, and lower cost.&#xD;

    <description>The Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life Questionnaire is a validated, disease specific quality-of-life instrument that has been used in the acute, chronic, and post-operative setting and is currently the most commonly used questionnaire for kidney stone disease.The survey is a 28-item instrument with a 5-point Likert scale for each item. There is a total of 140 points, and a difference of 10 points is considered clinically significant.</description>
