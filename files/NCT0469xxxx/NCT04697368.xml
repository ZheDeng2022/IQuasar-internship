  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of arm function is a common and distressing consequence of stroke. Neurotechnology-aided&#xD;
      rehabilitation could be a promising approach to accelerate the recovery of upper limb&#xD;
      functional impairments. This multicentre randomized controlled trial is aimed at assessing&#xD;
      the efficacy of robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation in subjects with sub-acute stroke&#xD;
      following a stroke, compared to the traditional upper limb rehabilitation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the most common cause of complex adult disability in high-income countries [1].&#xD;
      Loss of arm function affects 69% of people who have a stroke [2]. Only 12% of people with arm&#xD;
      weakness at the onset of stroke make a full recovery [3]. Improving arm function has been&#xD;
      identified as a research priority by stroke survivors, carers, and health professionals who&#xD;
      report that current rehabilitation pays insufficient attention to arm recovery [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robot-assisted training enables a greater number of repetitive tasks to be practiced in a&#xD;
      consistent and controllable manner. Repetitive task training is known to drive Hebbian&#xD;
      plasticity, where the wiring of pathways that are coincidently active is strengthened [5, 6].&#xD;
      A dose of greater than 20 h of repetitive task training improves upper limb motor recovery&#xD;
      following a stroke [7] and, therefore, robot-assisted training has the potential to improve&#xD;
      arm motor recovery after stroke. We anticipate that Hebbian neuroplasticity, which is&#xD;
      learning dependent, will operate regardless of the post-stroke phase. We, hereby, describe&#xD;
      the protocol for a multicentre randomized controlled trial to determine whether&#xD;
      robot-assisted training improves upper limb function following a stroke in the sub-acute&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation, and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery, and to plan and assess treatment. In this study, we will consider the motor performance items of Upper extremity (0-66), only.</description>

    <description>The Box and Block Test (BBT) measures unilateral gross manual dexterity. It is a quick, simple, and inexpensive test. The BBT is composed of a wooden box divided in two compartments by a partition and 150 blocks. The BBT administration consists of asking the client to move, one by one, the maximum number of blocks from one compartment of a box to another of equal size, within 60 seconds. The box should be oriented lengthwise and placed at the client's midline, with the compartment holding the blocks oriented towards the hand being tested. In order to practice and register baseline scores, the test should begin with the unaffected upper limb. Additionally, a 15-second trial period is permitted at the beginning of each side. Before the trial, after the standardized instructions are given to clients, they should be advised that their fingertips must cross the partition when transferring the blocks and that they do not need to pick up the blocks that might fall outside of the box.</description>

    <description>The Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) is used to measure finger dexterity in patients with various neurological diagnoses.&#xD;
Description:&#xD;
Administered by asking the client to take the pegs from a container, one by one, and place them into the holes on the board, as quickly as possible; Scores are based on the time taken to complete the test activity, recorded in seconds; Alternative scoring - the number of pegs placed in 50 or 100 seconds can be recorded. In this case, results are expressed as the number of pegs placed per second; Stopwatch should be started from the moment the participant touches the first peg until the moment the last peg hits the container.</description>

    <time_frame>Session 1 (Baseline-day1, T0), Session 25 (end of treatment-day 35, T1) and a follow-up (6 months since the acute event T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Scale/Index (BI) is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL). Ten variables describing ADL and mobility are scored, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently following hospital discharge. Time is taken and physical assistance required to perform each item is used in determining the assigned value of each item. The Barthel Index measures the degree of assistance required by an individual on 10 items of mobility and self-care ADL (consisting in: feeding, personal hygiene, bathing, dressing, chair-bed transfer, toileting, bladder continence, bowel continence, ambulation, or wheelchair use, and stair climbing.).&#xD;
Scoring (Pellicciari et al, 2020):&#xD;
The item scores are summed across them in order to compute the total score; a score of 0 indicates total assistance, while a total score of 100 indicates total independence. T</description>

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. It has become the most widely used clinical outcome measure for stroke clinical trials.&#xD;
The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.&#xD;
0 - No symptoms.&#xD;
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.&#xD;
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.&#xD;
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.&#xD;
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.&#xD;
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.&#xD;
- Dead.</description>

    <description>In a subgroup of subjects in EG, the cerebral electrical activity will be recorded by EEG (0.3-100 Hz bandpass, sampling frequency: 512 Hz) from 32 up to 128 electrodes positioned according to the International System 10-20 increased during rest conditions: closed and open eyes(3 minutes each). To monitor eye movements, horizontal and vertical electroculogram (0.3-70 Hz bandpass) will be recorded. The delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta1 (13-20 Hz), beta2 (20-30Hz) and gamma (30-40Hz) frequency bands will be analyzed. The EEG data will be normalized and the activation current density of the cortical sources on 6239 voxels will be calculated using standardized Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA). Cerebral Connectivity will be calculated with the eLORETA on 84 regions on the basis of the 42 Brodmann areas (right and left hemispheres). Through the 84 regions of interest of eLORETA, the Lagged Linear Coherence will be calculated.</description>
