    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the short-term and long-term safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      effectiveness of immunopheresis with the LW-02 column in removal of sTNFRs from plasma of&#xD;
      patients with advanced, refractory NSCLC and to detect a potential disease control signal&#xD;
      when employed in combination with low dose chemotherapy (ie, paclitaxel), immunotherapy (ie,&#xD;
      atezolizumab) in patients who already failed first-line therapy, or as monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients who already have failed second-line therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 2a pilot study of Immunicom's LW-02 column- combined with&#xD;
      low-dose chemotherapy or immunotherapy in patients who have failed first-line treatment or&#xD;
      employed as monotherapy in patients who have failed second-line therapy-to evaluate the&#xD;
      short-term and long-term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of these approaches in&#xD;
      removing sTNF-Rs and the potential for disease control in advanced, refractory NSCLC&#xD;
      patients. Along with LW-02 column immunopheresis, patients enrolled in Arm 1 will receive&#xD;
      combination immunotherapy with atezolizumab and patients enrolled in Arm 2 also will receive&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel. Patients in Arm 3 will be treated with LW-02 column&#xD;
      immunopheresis alone as a third-line treatment regimen, assuming the first-line treatment&#xD;
      included a platinum salt. Following study qualification, patients will be assigned to the&#xD;
      appropriate treatment. All patients may receive up to 48 LW-02 column-based immunopheresis&#xD;
      treatments over a 16-week (4-month) period with up to 3 treatments per week). Importantly,&#xD;
      each LW-02 immunopheresis treatment should last up to 3 hours and process, approximately, 2&#xD;
      times the patient's plasma volume (2PV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient assigned to the treatment with LW-02 column-based immunopheresis will require&#xD;
      central vascular access for the procedure. In general, a cuffed, tunneled dual-lumen catheter&#xD;
      will be inserted into a central vein and remain in situ throughout the 16-week treatment&#xD;
      phase (or longer if additional treatment is clinically indicated). The catheter will be used&#xD;
      to connect the inlet and return lines of the apheresis system to the patient. Immunopheresis&#xD;
      treatments will be performed using the LW-02 column used inline with a centrifugal apheresis&#xD;
      system that allows for secondary plasma processing system (eg, the Terumo BCT Spectra Optia&#xD;
      Apheresis System® or alternate apheresis system). Proper anticoagulation of the centrifugal&#xD;
      apheresis device is generally provided by utilizing acid citrate dextrose formula A (ACD-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed and clinically evaluated for two-years posttreatment. In Year 1,&#xD;
      patients will be clinically evaluated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from the end-of-treatment&#xD;
      (EOT) visit. In Year 2 quarterly (every 3 months) telephone contacts will be made to&#xD;
      determine overall survival.&#xD;
