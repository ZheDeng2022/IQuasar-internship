        Inclusion Criteria for Patients in the External Control Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosed with AdvSM, with known subtype including SM-AHN, ASM, or MCL&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Received at least one line of systemic therapy for AdvSM, which may include but not&#xD;
             limited to regimens containing:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Midostaurin Cytoreductive therapy: cladribine, interferon alpha, azacitidine,&#xD;
             decitabine Selective TKIs: imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib Hydroxyurea Antibody&#xD;
             therapy: brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adult (≥18 years of age) at the initiation of first systemic line of therapy at the&#xD;
             participating site&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Had available performance status (e.g., ECOG score or Karnofsky score)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Had an index date at least 3 months prior to the start of data collection (in order to&#xD;
             include patients with at least 3 months of follow-up after index date), unless date of&#xD;
             death occurred less than three months from index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Had an approved waiver of informed consent or signed informed consent for&#xD;
             participation in the retrospective chart review study, if no institutional waiver from&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for Patients in the External Control Arm&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Malignancy that is not in remission at time of SM diagnosis, or new non-hematological&#xD;
             malignancy diagnosed after SM diagnosis, except for: completely resected basal cell&#xD;
             and squamous cell skin cancer, curatively treated localized prostate cancer, and&#xD;
             completely resected carcinoma in situ of any site&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Among patients with SM-AHN, presence of either of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients in whom the SM component is consistent with an indolent systemic&#xD;
                  mastocytosis (ISM) or SSM or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  the AHN component is a lymphoid malignancy, or one of the following myeloid&#xD;
                  malignancies: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that&#xD;
                  is very high-or high-risk as defined by the IPSS-R, or a Philadelphia chromosome&#xD;
                  positive malignancy or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  there is a known FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene (including those with CHIC-2 deletion&#xD;
                  and partial deletion of PDGFRA), independent of KIT mutational status&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Received avapritinib as the first line of systemic therapy for AdvSM at participating&#xD;
             site, or prior to initiation of first systemic therapy at participating site.&#xD;
