  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study is the validation and cultual adaptation of the Turkish translation of&#xD;
      the London Speech Evaluation Scale (LSE-T), so that it would be used as an assessment tool&#xD;
      for Turkish head and neck cancer patients. There is no validated Turkish version of LSE to&#xD;
      measure severity of perceptual speech in head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The speech function is a multidirectional process that depends on complex neuro-muscular&#xD;
      network. The function can be evaluated using instrumental, such as voice analysis computer&#xD;
      programmes, scales, or well structured questionnaires. There are many scales for assessment&#xD;
      of perceptual speech but there is no validated for head and neck patients. The study will&#xD;
      assess the construct validity and adaptation of the Turkish translation of Speech Specific&#xD;
      Perceptual Speech Evaluation as known as London Speech Evaluation Scale. The investigators&#xD;
      developed the Turkish translation of this scale (LSE-T), according to the cross-cultural&#xD;
      adaptation guidelines. Two translators translated the LSE into Turkish and a native English&#xD;
      language speaker reverse-translated it into English. The back translation was sent to the&#xD;
      original author for proofreading. The LSE scale consisted of 6 parameters and 4 scores&#xD;
      related with perceptual speech in head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;

    <description>In outpatients clinic, the first group consists of 60 head and neck cancer patients who were treated by ours. The participants will given the document consists that &quot;bit, bet, but&quot; words and also a brief part of &quot;Diyet passage&quot; who written by Omer Seyffettin. The speech record of patients who read to document, will evaluated by three judges (otorhinolaryngologist). Three judges will scoring to Turkish translation of London Speech Evaluation Scale (LSE-T), consists of 6 parameters. After the six weeks, the records were scored again as randomisely.</description>
