  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men and women with high-grade gliomas. Glucose (sugar) is thought&#xD;
      to be a contributor to tumor growth. The ketogenic diet (a high fat, low carbohydrate diet)&#xD;
      and metformin (a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat type 2 diabetes)&#xD;
      are both known to lower blood glucose levels. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability of a ketogenic diet in conjunction with metformin and whether maintaining and&#xD;
      the diet with metformin will have any effect on participants. Participants will prepare their&#xD;
      own meals with the help of a nutritionist. Participants will continue on treatment as long as&#xD;
      they are responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable side effects&#xD;

    <description>Ketogenic diet is high-fat, low carbohydrate diet. Ketogenic diet will be maintained on a continuous basis. The diet will begin at an approximately 3:1 fat to carbohydrate + protein ratio for 5 days. If the patient does not show urine ketosis (1.5 mmol/L or 27.0 mg/dL), the ketosis diet will be advanced to approximately 4:1 ratio for 5 days. If the patient still does not attain ketosis a 24 hour fast will be done to promote ketosis. The diet will encourage at least 30 ml per day of Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) oil to enhance ketosis.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed high-grade glioma (e.g. glioblastoma,&#xD;
             gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic mixed&#xD;
             glioma or other anaplastic gliomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have an MRI performed within 21 days prior to beginning the study diet&#xD;
             and on a fixed dose of steroids for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients cannot be taking insulin or other oral hypoglycemic. Must be at least 6 weeks&#xD;
             from last oral hypoglycemic or insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must not have known type 1 or type 2 diabetes and expected to need either insulin&#xD;
             and/or an oral hypoglycemic agents within the next 6 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise&#xD;
             the patients' ability to tolerate this therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients having undergone recent resection or progressive tumor will be eligible as&#xD;
             long as all of the following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. They have recovered from the effects of surgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for&#xD;
                  eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease&#xD;
                  postoperatively, a MRI should be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  At least 4 weeks post-operatively, and&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Within 14 days of registration, and&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If the 96-hour scan is more than 21 days before registration, the scan needs&#xD;
                       to be repeated. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging&#xD;
                       and registration, a new baseline MRI is required on a stable steroid dosage&#xD;
                       for at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, diabetes&#xD;
             requiring oral hypoglycemic drugs and/or insulin, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients known to have a malignancy that has required treatment in the last 12 months&#xD;
             and/or is expected to require treatment in the next 12 months (except nonmelanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer or carcinoma in-situ in the cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The effects of a Ketogenic diet or metformin on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with current alcoholism.&#xD;
