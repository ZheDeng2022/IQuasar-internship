  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gingival marginal tissue recession is the displacement of the soft tissue margin apical to&#xD;
      the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) with exposure of the root surface. It is a common clinical&#xD;
      finding in patients with high standards of oral hygiene and can be found in more than 90% of&#xD;
      patients. Buccal exposure of roots leading to esthetic concerns and dentinal hypersensitivity&#xD;
      are the most frequent reasons for patients to seek treatment for the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival recession therapy is still challenging for clinicians. The ultimate goal of root&#xD;
      coverage procedures is the complete coverage of the recession defect with an esthetic&#xD;
      appearance comparable to adjacent healthy soft tissues in combination with physiological&#xD;
      probing pocket depths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various treatment modalities have been put forth for the correction of gingival recession.&#xD;
      These include free gingival autograft, subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG),&#xD;
      coronally advanced flap (CAF) and various combinations. Coronally advanced flap (CAF) in&#xD;
      conjunction with the connective tissue graft (CTG) is considered the gold standard of&#xD;
      treatment of gingival recession due to its high predictability of the treatment results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several authors have explored the use of biological agents or like enamel matrix derivative&#xD;
      (EMD), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), which&#xD;
      are a group of proteins capable of inducing gene or cell activation for cell recruitment,&#xD;
      matrix biosynthesis, and cellular differentiation, in an attempt to regenerate the lost&#xD;
      periodontium to enhance its long term stability Hyaluronic acid (HA) is one such biologic&#xD;
      agent that demonstrates future for periodontal regeneration. It is a major component of the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix in almost all tissues. The primary role of HA is to bind water and to&#xD;
      allow the transportation of key metabolites and therefore to maintain the structural and&#xD;
      homeostatic integrity of these tissues. HA suppresses tissue breakdown activating&#xD;
      metalloproteinase inhibitors. It represents one of the most hygroscopic molecules known in&#xD;
      nature. As a physical background material, it functions as space filler, lubricant and a&#xD;
      protein excluder as well. In vitro studies and animal studies have demonstrated that HA&#xD;
      significantly increases the tensile strength of granulation tissue, stimulates clot&#xD;
      formation, induces angiogenesis, increases osteogenesis, and does not interfere in the&#xD;
      calcification nodules during bone formation. Furthermore, HA facilitates cell migration and&#xD;
      differentiation during tissue formation and repair of both soft and hard tissues. It improves&#xD;
      ligament cell viability and early osteogenic differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the fact that HA has positive effects on wound healing, we hypothesized that it&#xD;
      may also improve the results of root coverage by CAF+CTG. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) will be to evaluate the potential benefit of the&#xD;
      adjunctive use of HA in combination with CAF+CTG and to compare the outcomes with CAF+CTG&#xD;
      alone, when treating single Miller class I and class II/RT1gingival recessions.&#xD;

      -  After administration of local anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two oblique and divergent releasing incisions extending beyond the mucogingival junction&#xD;
           (MGJ) will be performed. An intra-sulcular incision was performed at the buccal aspect&#xD;
           of the involved tooth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second surgical site will be prepared to obtain the subepithelial CTG using single&#xD;
           incision technique as described by Hurzeler and Weng.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the control group, only CAF+CTG will be performed. For the test group, cross-linked&#xD;
           HA will be applied over the exposed root surface before the placement of CTG and CAF&#xD;
           closure. HA will be presented as individual cartridge for single use only. For the&#xD;
           application on the denuded root surface, the cartridge will be inserted into a cartridge&#xD;
           syringe with 23G needles, as the fabricant recommended. HA will be applied on the root&#xD;
           surface until completely covered, the harvested CTG will be placed and stabilized with&#xD;
           sutures . Finally, the flap will be coronally displaced and sutured covering the CEJ.&#xD;
           Interrupted sutures will be placed at the vertical releasing incisions in apical-coronal&#xD;
           direction to reduce the tension and to facilitate the coronal displacement to perform&#xD;
           the last coronal sling suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative pain and edema will be controlled with anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients&#xD;
           received Ibuprofen 400 mg thrice daily for 3 days19 and Amoxicillin 500mg thrice daily&#xD;
           for 5 days.28 For patients allergic to penicillin Clindamycin 300 mg 4 times daily for 5&#xD;
           days will be prescribed.29&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 60s rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate was prescribed two times per day for the&#xD;
           first 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be instructed to intermittently apply an ice bag on the operated&#xD;
           area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recalled after a period of 14 days for suture removal. After this&#xD;
           period patients will be reinstructed in mechanical cleaning of the treated teeth and use&#xD;
           of a soft toothbrush and roll technique of brushing for one month.3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recalled for reinforcement of oral hygiene instructions and light&#xD;
           debridement supragingivally will be carried out. Clinical parameters will be recorded at&#xD;
           6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after surgical procedure.18&#xD;

    <description>Root coverage esthetic score: a system to evaluate the esthetic outcome of the treatment of gingival recession through evaluation of clinical cases. ...

    <measure>Pocket probing depth</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the pocket depth of the groove between your gums and teeth by placing a dental probe beside your tooth beneath your gumline, usually at several sites throughout your mouth. In a healthy mouth, the pocket depth is usually between 1 and 3 millimeters (mm). Pockets deeper than 4 mm may indicate periodontitis.</description>

    <measure>clinical attachment level (CAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>CAL is calculated from a fixed reference point (cementoenamel junction or CEJ), and it is computed by calculating the distance from the CEJ to the base of the pocket. When the gingival margin is coronal to the CEJ, you subtract (from the probing depth) the distance from the CEJ to the gingival margin.</description>

    <description>Place your probe on the outside of the tissue and measure from the gingival margin to the mucogingival junction. Now measure the sulcus or pocket depth (probing depth). Subtract the probing depth from the outside measurement of the gingiva, and you will have the width of attached gingiva.</description>
