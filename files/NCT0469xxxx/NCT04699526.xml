  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate a universal prevention curriculum&#xD;
      (UPC) training for Peruvian school administrators and teachers to reduce substance use among&#xD;
      students. Twenty-eight schools were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions&#xD;
      (14 per condition). Substance use outcomes were assessed with repeated cross-sectional&#xD;
      samples of students in 2018 and 2019. Multi-level analyses were conducted to assess&#xD;
      intervention effects on students' substance use and related problems.&#xD;

      students. Twenty-eight schools were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions&#xD;

      implement evidence-based school policies and positive school climate activities, and a&#xD;
      classroom substance use prevention curriculum. Substance use outcomes were assessed with&#xD;
