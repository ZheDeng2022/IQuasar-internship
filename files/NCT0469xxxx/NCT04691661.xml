      This is a safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and efficacy study in subjects with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is will be conducting to determine if Radotinib is safe and can be tolerated by&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to learn if Radotinib can be potential therapeutic&#xD;
      agents for the treatment of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radotinib has been approved by Ministry of Food &amp; Drug Safety of Korea to treat Chronic&#xD;
      Myeloid Leukemia (CML) but it has not been approved for PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In nonclinical efficacy study, therapeutic effect of Radotinib HCl, c-Abl inhibitor, which&#xD;
      exhibits improved pharmacokinetic properties and BBB penetration compared to nilotinib and&#xD;
      other c-Abl inhibitors, was tested in a preclinical α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) model&#xD;
      of sporadic PD. As a result, the treatment of Radotinib HCl protects the α-synuclein&#xD;
      PFFs-induced neuronal toxicity, reduces the PFFs-induced LB/LN-like pathology, and inhibits&#xD;
      the PFFs-induced c-Abl activation in neurons. In vivo studies demonstrate that administration&#xD;
      of Radotinib HCl prevents dopamine neuron loss and behavioral deficits following α-synuclein&#xD;
      PFFs-induced toxicity. Taken together, these findings indicate that Radotinib HCl has&#xD;
      beneficial neuroprotective effects in PD and provides strong evidence that selective and&#xD;
      brain permeable c-Abl inhibitors can be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data are very compelling to evaluate the effects of Radotinib in a phase II,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with PD.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a clinimetric assessment of subjective and objective symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease created by the Movement Disorder Society.&#xD;
The MDS-UPDRS has four parts: Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living), Part II (motor experiences of daily living, Part III (motor examination) and Part IV (motor complications). Only Parts I, II and III will be completed in this study.&#xD;
MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The subscale has a 0-4 rating, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. Higher MDS-UPDRS scores reflect worse tremor/motor function. Larger differences will infer greater effect size for the intervention. Score drops over time imply improvement in tremor/motor function.</description>

The PDQ-39 Single Index (SI) score is the weighted addition of scores on all 8 dimension and ranges from 0 (no disease impact) to 100 (severe disease impact).</description>

The 2nd item proposes to the Investigator to evaluate the overall improvement of the subject compared to his/her condition at the admission to the research. As before, this item has 7 quantified degrees (from 1 = &quot;very strongly improved&quot; to 7 = &quot;very strongly aggravated&quot;).</description>
