      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and multicenter clinical trial.&#xD;
      Three hundred sixty postoperative patients with colon cancer stage IIa-IIIc will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into treatment group I, treatment group II and placebo-control group, taking Huangqi&#xD;
      Guizhi Wuwu granules, Danggui Sini granules and the mimetic granules of Yiqi Wenjing granules&#xD;
      respectively. All subjects will receive mFOLFOX6 or FOLFOX4 or XELOX chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      along with traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) or placebo treatment per day for at least three&#xD;
      months and one year follow up. EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 will be used to assess the degree of&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy as the primary outcome measure. Grades of OIPN evaluated by NCI-CTCAE&#xD;
      5.0, quality of life evaluated by EORTC QLQ-C30, chemotherapeutic efficacy evaluated by&#xD;
      RESIST 1.1, and the number of completed chemotherapy cycles are selected as the secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>The degree of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy will be evaluated according to the score of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-CIPN twenty item scale(EORTC QLQ-CIPN20, 20-80 scores, higher scores mean a worse outcome), which is graded by the subject. In order to observe the dynamic change of OIPN, this trial sets multiple measure time points.</description>

    <description>The grades of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy will be evaluated according to the grades of National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE 5.0, 0-5 grades, higher grade means a worse outcome), which is graded by the doctor. In order to observe the dynamic change of OIPN, this trial sets multiple measure time points.</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be evaluated according to the score of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, 28-112 scores, higher scores mean a worse outcome).
