      The cohort registry is both retrospective and prospective, multicenter surveillance of&#xD;
      subjects who underwent a prior hiatal hernia repair and anti-reflux surgery with either&#xD;
      Magnetic Sphincter Augmentation (MSA) using LINX placement or fundoplication construction&#xD;
      more than 2 years prior to initial study visit. Subjects will be enrolled by invitation only&#xD;
      by participating investigators. Enrollment will consist of 300 LINX MSA patients and 150&#xD;
      fundoplication patients with a total of 450 from 4 sites within the United States. Data will&#xD;
      be collected for up to 6 years.The primary objective of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      long-term incidence of hiatal hernia recurrence in patients who undergo hiatal hernia repair&#xD;
      of a large (&gt;3 cm) hernia with LINX速 device placement, and to compare this with hiatal hernia&#xD;
      recurrence rates in patients who underwent hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>LINX Reflux Management System</intervention_name>
    <description>The LINX Reflux Management System consists of a series of titanium beads each with a magnetic core connected with independent titanium wires to form an annular shape when implanted. The attractive force of the magnetic beads is designed to provide additional strength to keep a weak lower esophageal sphincter (LES) closed. During swallowing, the magnetic beads slide away from each other on the independent titanium wire &quot;links&quot; to allow esophageal distention as the bolus passes by.</description>

        This clinical evaluation will be conducted at four U.S. investigational centers with up to&#xD;
        one hundred and fifty(150) subjects per center (goal of 450 total). Corhort 1 will consist&#xD;
        of 300 subjects who were implanted with the LINX速 Reflux Management System in the manner&#xD;
        described above more than 2 years prior to enrollment to this study. Cohort 2 will consist&#xD;
        of 150 subjects who underwent a fundoplication more that 2 years prior to enrollment into&#xD;
        this study with similar hiatal hernia size and similar effective esophageal motility.&#xD;
