      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design study of&#xD;
      BLU-5937 for the treatment of chronic pruritus in adult subjects with atopic dermatitis (AD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a 37-day Screening period (including a 7-day Run-In period), a&#xD;
      4-week Treatment period followed by a Follow-Up visit approximately 2 weeks after the last&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS]&#xD;
The WI-NRS is a single item questionnaire assessing the patient-reported severity of itch at its most intense during the previous 24-hour period on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'the worst itch imaginable'. Higher scores indicate worse severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by Average Itch Numeric Rating Scale [AI-NRS]&#xD;
The AI-NRS is a single item questionnaire assessing the patient-reported severity of itch overall (on average) during the previous 24-hour period on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'the worst itch imaginable'. Higher scores indicate worse severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Itching Quality of Life Survey (ItchyQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by Itching Quality of Life Survey [ItchyQOL]&#xD;
The ItchyQOL is a 22-item questionnaire assessing the pruritus-specific disease burden on 3 domains: symptoms, functions and emotions. The responses to the frequency items are scored on a 1 (never) to 5 (all the time) scale. The recall period in ItchyQoL is the past week. Higher scores indicate a more adverse impact on quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects in each category of the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by Patient Global Impression of Change [PGIC]&#xD;
The PGIC consists of 1 self-administered item that assesses the subject's impression of change in the severity of pruritus using a 7-point scale from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Higher scores indicate a worsening of the severity.</description>
