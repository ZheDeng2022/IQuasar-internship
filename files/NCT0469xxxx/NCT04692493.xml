  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2015 ACR RA treatment guideline, based on widely acknowledged low to moderate quality&#xD;
      evidence, recommends adding TNFi-biologic, non-TNFi biologic or a tsDMARD to MTX in MTX-IR&#xD;
      patients with active RA.24 In practice, most patients receive a TNFi-biologic first. This is&#xD;
      not based on solid evidence, but on arbitrary algorithms often proposed by health insurance&#xD;
      plans, physician experience (first TNFi launched 22 yrs ago vs. first tsDMARD 8 yrs ago).&#xD;
      This study will fill a critical knowledge gap by generating CER data for important PROs&#xD;
      between these treatment options, adding TNFi-biologic or a tsDMARD to MTX in MTX-IR patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of RA with a biologic or tsDMARD was associated with improved function, quality of&#xD;
      life, and productivity. Similar to another review of biologic vs. placebo, in our Cochrane&#xD;
      systematic review of MTX-IR RA patients (48 studies; 16,355 patients),the addition of a&#xD;
      TNFi-biologic to MTX was associated with clinically meaningfully and statistically&#xD;
      significantly improved HAQ vs. MTX/DMARD or placebo, with a mean difference of -0.25 (95% CI,&#xD;
      -0.28 to -0.22), greater than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.22.&#xD;
      TsDMARDs were similarly effective. No meaningful differences were noted in TNFi-biologic vs.&#xD;
      tsDMARD, but head-to-head studies of biologics are lacking. HAQ is a sensitive outcome for RA&#xD;
      trials. A PCORI systematic review for early RA treatment concluded that &quot;Evidence was&#xD;
      insufficient to evaluate any differences between biologics for their impact on either&#xD;
      functional capacity or HRQOL&quot;, a key knowledge gap our study will fill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2015 ACR RA treatment guideline, based on widely acknowledged low to moderate quality&#xD;
      evidence, recommends adding TNFi-biologic, non-TNFi biologic or a tsDMARD to MTX in MTX-IR&#xD;
      patients with active RA. In practice, most patients receive a TNFi-biologic first. This is&#xD;
      not based on solid evidence, but on arbitrary algorithms often proposed by health insurance&#xD;
      plans, physician experience (first TNFi launched 22 yrs ago vs. first tsDMARD 8 yrs ago).&#xD;
      This study will fill a critical knowledge gap by generating CER data for important PROs&#xD;
      between these treatment options. This will facilitate informed decision-making, since PROs&#xD;
      may be more sensitive to different mechanisms of action, and are highly relevant to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will also provide needed evidence for real-world treatment decisions made&#xD;
      by public and private payers. This head-to-head pragmatic trial will be the first to provide&#xD;
      CER data for improvement in key PROs with recommended strategies in MTX-IR RA, and addresses&#xD;
      PCORI and IOM priority areas by comparing the two most commonly used RA treatment strategies&#xD;
      for MTX-IR. This research is patient-centered, as study outcomes were identified by patients&#xD;
      and payers. Currently, treatment choices are based on physician experience and insurance&#xD;
      payer limitations. Investigators will generate evidence to help patients make decisions for&#xD;
      themselves based on outcomes they care most about based on the relative efficacy for&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will: (1) compare improvements in PROs with RA treatment strategies to each&#xD;
      other using a state-of-the-art real-world pragmatic effectiveness study design, which will&#xD;
      for the first time include most RA patients with comorbidities;(2) compare their toxicity in&#xD;
      a real-world population for TNFi-biologic vs. tsDMARD. To our knowledge, no previous RCT&#xD;
      comparing these drugs has examined a PRO as a primary outcome in RA, which our study will&#xD;
      pioneer by using HAQ. HAQ is sensitive to change with effective treatments.&#xD;
