      Introduction: Cancer rectum and sigmoid is increasing nowadays. Resection and anastomosis is&#xD;
      done laparoscopic approach with various techniques of anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study: to compare between open side to end colorectal anastomosis versus&#xD;
      laparoscopic end to end colorectal anastomosis in Non-emergent colo- rectal Cancers in adults&#xD;
      as regard anastomotic leak, intestinal function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: Randomized controlled trial was performed on patients with Non-emergent&#xD;
      colo rectal cancers between September 2016 and September 2018.&#xD;

      ICancer rectum prevalence comes next to bronchogenic and prostatic malignant neoplasms in&#xD;
      male, but it is the second cancer in female following cancer breast. [1] despite the fact&#xD;
      that 1,000,000 patients notably every year and mortality by thousands, yet patients that live&#xD;
      from this cancer is surging in the last years due to both sumptuous appliance of&#xD;
      investigation and novel intervention techniques. Over two thirds of rectal cancer patients&#xD;
      survived 5 years. [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal surgery principles target to merge the fulfillment of well-balanced free margin&#xD;
      resection with bowel, urinary and potency activities. [3]. Laparoscopic rectal surgery for&#xD;
      cancer had a famed corner in recent surgery that besieged open approach [4]. Rectal surgery&#xD;
      has many troubles. The most troubled complication is anastomotic leakage. The prevalence of&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage following rectal resection and anastomosis may wave to 15% of cases with&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality [5].The inauguration of the stapler in rectal surgery assisted&#xD;
      the anastomosis to be in a homogeneous design, decrease strain on the suture, speedy surgery,&#xD;
      no intra-abdominal contamination, no intrusion of anastomotic site perfusion and narrow the&#xD;
      prevalence of anastomotic leakage. [6]. Resection of rectum is linked to low anterior&#xD;
      resection syndrome (LARS) that usually affects quality of life [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Aim of the work, gap statement and strength of the study: During rectal cancer surgery, no&#xD;
      conclusive path of resection and anastomosis and usually followed by the surgeons according&#xD;
      to their experience. In the current study, we have organized a randomized clinical trial to&#xD;
      analyze the outcomes in two groups of patients with colo rectum cancers with two different&#xD;
      laparoscopic approaches for resection and anastomosis. The primary aim was to correlate the&#xD;
      prevalence of anastomotic leak after both interventions. The secondary aim was to appraise&#xD;
      intestinal functional outcome and quality of life between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Study design and study power: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial managed&#xD;
      in the colorectal surgical units of our University Hospitals (solitary-center) between&#xD;
      September 2016 to September 2018. A total of 74 patients diagnosed as colorectal cancer&#xD;
      underwent openrectal cancer surgery. The patients were randomly labeled into two groups:&#xD;
      Group (A): included 37 patients: open side to end colorectal anastomosis (SEA) and Group (B):&#xD;
      included 37 patients: openend to end colorectal anastomosis (EEA). As percentage of leakage&#xD;
      from previous paper [8] was 29% VS 5.4% so sample will be 37 in each group with power 80% and&#xD;
      confidence level 95% would be suitable to reach statistical significance (p&lt;0.05). It is a&#xD;
      simple random sample with a balance. Patients were randomly allocated using a random sequence&#xD;
      computer. Patients were randomly numbered in closed envelopes, which were opened just before&#xD;
      accomplishing the anastomosis intraoperative. Patients were unaware to the any group until&#xD;
      after the study. It is the role of registration office.&#xD;
