    <textblock>
      Metatarsalgia is a common set of symptoms in the forefoot, characterized by pain under one or&#xD;
      more metatarsal heads. The invention of a utility model, the U202030700, designed by the&#xD;
      study's principal investigator aims to protect the metatarsus and prevent the appearance of&#xD;
      foot pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this research project is based on the fact that using our proposed sock&#xD;
      with metatarsal discharge plate will bring advantages in terms of pain reduction, increased&#xD;
      comfort, temperature reduction and change in plantar pressures received in the second and&#xD;
      third metatarsals joint area versus the use of control socks (without discharge plate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be subjects with pain in the plantar metatarsal area that will answer few&#xD;
      questions and a podiatric exam to determine if meet the study requirements and then a plantar&#xD;
      pressures, foot temperature and confort wit the two kind of socks will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confort survey, thermal pictures and plantar pressures will be taken (in first term) before&#xD;
      and after a brief walk (5 to 10 minutes) and in a second experiment (second term) after a&#xD;
      long walk (more than 1 hour).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Metatarsalgia is a common set of symptoms in the forefoot, characterized by pain under one or&#xD;
      more metatarsal heads. First option should opt for conservative treatments, among these it is&#xD;
      noteworthy the application of pressure relief elements from these anatomical zones. These&#xD;
      elements, usually made of soft materials such as felt or foams of different compositions, are&#xD;
      arranged covering the entire metatarsal area, with the exception of the compromised sector,&#xD;
      that is, overloaded and painful, giving rise to discharge elements with a geometry similar to&#xD;
      a U. In this way, the other areas of the metatarsus support the discharge element leaving&#xD;
      exposed the overloaded area, so that it reduces or avoids its direct support on the support&#xD;
      surface, thus mitigating the excess pressure in the compromised area and therefore, pain.. It&#xD;
      is therefore desirable to have unloading elements of the metatarsal area, easy to use by a&#xD;
      user and that do not involve major alterations in their usual clothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different types of socks are known with configurations which give them beneficial effects on&#xD;
      health. However, these existing models have not specifically focused on the plantar part of&#xD;
      the sock, there is therefore no simple and economical solution for the protection of the&#xD;
      metatarsus and the mitigation of pain and discomfort usually caused by its pathologies. This&#xD;
      has been solved by the invention of a utility model, the U202030700, designed by the study's&#xD;
      principal investigator and his research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this research project is based on the fact that using our proposed sock&#xD;
      with metatarsal discharge plate will bring advantages in terms of pain reduction, increased&#xD;
      comfort, temperature reduction and change in plantar pressures received in the second and&#xD;
      third metatarsals joint area versus the use of control socks (without discharge plate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To record the differences of plantar pressures, thermal and general confort with control&#xD;
      socks and experimental socks after a briefs walks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of intervention will be randomly assigned, meaning neither participant nor the&#xD;
      secondary researchers knows the sock worn. The principal investigator (Alfonso Martínez Nova)&#xD;
      will perform the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Subjects with pain in the plantar metatarsal area are suitable to participate&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer few questions and a podiatric exam to determine if meet the study&#xD;
      requirements and then:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answering a survey on health status and pain in the metatarsal area mainly. Collection of the&#xD;
      necessary data (plantar pressures, foot temperature and confort wit the two kind of socks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials: Experiment socks and control (same fiber, fabric, weight). Pressure platform&#xD;
      Footscan. Flir e60bx thermographic camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confort survey, thermal pictures and plantar pressures will be taken (in first term) before&#xD;
      and after a brief walk (5 to 10 minutes) and in second term, before and after a long walk&#xD;
      (more than 1 hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new sock aimed to protect the metatarsus and prevent the appearance of foot pain.&#xD;
