    <textblock>
      This is a phase II non-randomized, multi-center study. The primary end point of this study is&#xD;
      the objective response rate (ORR) at 24 weeks, using response evaluation criteria for solid&#xD;
      tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, for the combination therapy of continuous daily oral lenvatinib&#xD;
      with three-weekly intravenous pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent clear cell carcinoma&#xD;
      of gynecological origin (CCGC). The statistical design is Simon's minimax two-stage design&#xD;
      and the present study aims to complete stage 1 of the Simon's two-stage design.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Objective: To determine the efficacy as measured by the objective response rate (ORR) at&#xD;
      24 weeks using RECIST 1.1 criteria when patients with recurrent CCGCs are treated with&#xD;
      lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The ORR (complete response plus partial response) at 24 weeks seen in recurrent&#xD;
      CCGC patients treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab combination therapy will be improved&#xD;
      compared to historical control (hypothesized ORR of 30% with combination therapy compared to&#xD;
      historical ORR of ORR of 10% with chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: The ORR at 24 weeks using RECIST 1.1 criteria when patients with recurrent&#xD;
      CCGCs are treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective: To determine the efficacy of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in recurrent&#xD;
           CCGCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: The ORR by immune RECIST (iRECIST) criteria, progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
           rate and clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response plus partial response plus&#xD;
           stable disease) at 24 weeks, as well as duration of response and PFS observed in&#xD;
           recurrent CCGC patients treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab combination therapy&#xD;
           will be improved compared to historical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endpoint: To determine the ORR using iRECIST criteria at 24 weeks when patients with&#xD;
           recurrent CCGCs are treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endpoint: To assess the duration of response when patients with recurrent CCGCs are&#xD;
           treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endpoint: To assess the PFS when patients with recurrent CCGCs are treated with&#xD;
           lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endpoint: To determine the 24 week PFS rate of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in this&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endpoint: To determine the CBR at 24 weeks of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in this&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective: To describe the adverse event (AE) profile of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab&#xD;
           in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical Objectives: To evaluate the effect of potential prognostic factors (baseline&#xD;
           patient and tumor characteristics, notably: initial performance status, stage at&#xD;
           diagnosis and platinum-free interval), on the efficacy of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab&#xD;
           in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Translational Objectives: To evaluate the pre- to post-treatment changes in the&#xD;
           frequency of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in patients receiving lenvatinib plus&#xD;
           pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Translational Objectives: To evaluate the pre- to post-treatment changes in the&#xD;
           frequency and gene expression profile of different lymphocyte (e.g. CD4, CD8, Treg, B&#xD;
           cells) and myeloid (e.g. DCs, MDSCs) subsets in patients receiving lenvatinib plus&#xD;
           pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Translational Objectives: To identify predictive biomarkers of response in patients&#xD;
           receiving lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1/VEGF expression).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Translational Objectives: To evaluate the pre-to post-treatment changes in the&#xD;
           concentration of relevant cytokines/chemokines (e.g.: GM-CSF, G-CSF, VEGFA, IL2, IL12,&#xD;
           IL13, IL6, Interferons) in patients receiving lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             19. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within&#xD;
             the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120&#xD;

&#xD;
             23. Has known bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe&#xD;
             hemorrhage. The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g.&#xD;
             carotid artery) should be considered because of the potential risk of severe&#xD;
             hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             24. Has &gt; 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing unless a 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
