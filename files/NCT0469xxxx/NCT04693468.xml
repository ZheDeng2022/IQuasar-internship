      This phase Ib trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      talazoparib when given in combination with palbociclib, axitinib, or crizotinib in treating&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced)&#xD;
      or other places in the body (metastatic). PARPs are proteins that help repair damaged DNA,&#xD;
      the genetic material that serves as the body's instruction book. PARP inhibitors, such as&#xD;
      talazoparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may&#xD;
      stop growing. Palbociclib, axitinib, and crizotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving talazoparib in combination with&#xD;
      palbociclib, axitinib, or crizotinib may help control locally advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability, and establish the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of the combination of talazoparib tosylate&#xD;
      (talazoparib) with palbociclib isethionate (palbociclib) (Arm A), axitinib (Arm B), and&#xD;
      crizotinib (Arm C) in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of the combination of talazoparib with&#xD;
      palbociclib (Arm A), axitinib (Arm B), and crizotinib (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the combination of&#xD;
      talazoparib with palbociclib (Arm A), axitinib (Arm B), and crizotinib (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain a preliminary assessment of the antitumor activity of the combination of&#xD;
      talazoparib with palbociclib (Arm A), axitinib (Arm B), and crizotinib (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination of&#xD;
      talazoparib with palbociclib (Arm A), axitinib (Arm B), and crizotinib (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 or 1-28 and&#xD;
      palbociclib PO QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patient may continue treatment even if there is&#xD;
      progression of disease as long as the patient remains clinically stable, per the treating&#xD;
      physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive talazoparib PO QD on days 1-28 and axitinib PO twice daily (BID) on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patient may continue treatment even if there is progression of disease as long as&#xD;
      the patient remains clinically stable, per the treating physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive talazoparib PO QD on days 1-28 and crizotinib PO BID on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patient may continue treatment even if there is progression of disease as long as the patient&#xD;
      remains clinically stable, per the treating physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days and then every&#xD;
      12 weeks until progression of disease, receipt of another cancer drug, or for another two&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
