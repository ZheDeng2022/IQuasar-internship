      This is a Phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of norovirus -specific T-cell&#xD;
      (NST) therapy for chronic norovirus infection in participants following hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HSCT) or with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) who have not&#xD;
      undergone HSCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase I study of norovirus-specific T-cell immunotherapy for treatment&#xD;
      of participants with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) and chronic norovirus. This&#xD;
      study is designed to assess the safety of norovirus-specific T-cell (NST) infusion in this&#xD;
      population. There are two arms in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arm A: Participants who receive donor derived NST therapy after HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arm B: Participants who receive partially HLA matched NSTs. The following participants&#xD;
           apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants with PID who have not undergone HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants who undergo HSCT but do not have available donor derived NSTs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants who have donors from whom NSTs cannot be generated due to norovirus&#xD;
                seronegativity Participants will be monitored for infusion-related reactions and&#xD;
                GVHD for 1 year following first infusion. During this time, participants will be&#xD;
                accessed with regard to the length and quantity of norovirus shedding in stool, and&#xD;
                gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms will be scored by clinicians and&#xD;
                participants. Correlative studies of T-cell immune reconstitution against&#xD;
                norovirus, norovirus genomic sequences, and composition of the fecal microbiome&#xD;
                will also be accessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this phase I study is to assess the safety of administering&#xD;
      donor-derived or partially HLA-matched NSTs in immunocompromised participants with chronic&#xD;
      norovirus infections. Related and unrelated donors of participants who have chronic norovirus&#xD;
      infection after HSCT will be enrolled for screening and production of NSTs from peripheral&#xD;
      blood. Following product manufacturing, participants who have undergone HSCT (Arm A) will&#xD;
      receive donor-derived NSTs. For participants with PID who have not undergone HSCT (Arm B),&#xD;
      high-resolution HLA typing of the participant will be utilized for an inquiry of the NST bank&#xD;
      to determine if a partially HLA-matched NST product exists that has antiviral activity&#xD;
      mediated through one or more shared HLA alleles. Participants who have undergone HSCT but&#xD;
      either do not have available donors for NST generation, or who have donors from whom NSTs&#xD;
      cannot be generated due to norovirus seronegativity will also be eligible for inquiry for&#xD;
      treatment with partially HLA-matched NSTs if available under study Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a dose escalation study with two arms. Participants who have undergone HSCT will&#xD;
      be enrolled on Arm A and receive NSTs derived from their HSCT donor. Participants with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of PID who have not undergone HSCT, or participants who have undergone HSCT but do&#xD;
      not have available donor-derived NSTs will be enrolled on Arm B and receive partially-HLA&#xD;
      matched NSTs. Investigators will test three doses: 1 x 10^7 /m^2, 2 x 10^7 /m^2, and 4 x 10^7&#xD;
      /m^2. Investigators will have a 45-day safety monitoring period for immediate toxicities&#xD;
      following infusion.&#xD;

             levels should be obtained to ensure drug clearance (≤0.16 pg/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who have received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), chimeric antigen&#xD;
             receptor T-cell infusion, or other experimental cellular therapies within 28 days&#xD;

             infection. Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability, worsening&#xD;
             physical signs, or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever&#xD;
             without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For bacterial infections, participants must be receiving definitive therapy and&#xD;
                  have no signs of progressing infection within 7 days prior to NST infusion and or&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. For fungal infections, participants must be receiving definitive systemic&#xD;
                  anti-fungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection within 7 days&#xD;

             bacterial infections with C. difficile, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella,&#xD;
             or enteroinvasive or enterotoxigenic E. coli.&#xD;

             infusion, and must include: i. Crytosporidium/Giardia testing via antigen or PCR&#xD;
             testing ii. Stool viral testing for rotavirus and adenovirus via antigen or PCR&#xD;
             testing iii. Stool bacterial culture iv. C. difficile toxin PCR b. Determination of&#xD;
             active infection versus chronic carriage / shedding will be made by the investigators&#xD;
             and clinical providers, and will depend on the presence of clinical symptoms&#xD;
             corresponding with the timing of positive test results, presence of a clinical&#xD;
             response to targeted therapy, and by histological or other testing if clinically&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants with active and uncontrolled relapse of malignancy (if applicable).&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Secondary graft failure is defined as &lt;5% donor chimerism (CD3+ or CD34+) or&#xD;
                  permanent loss of neutrophil and/or platelet engraftment (ANC&lt; 500/ul and/or&#xD;
                  platelets&lt;20 K/ul) at any time after primary engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants with symptomatic gastrointestinal conditions aside from norovirus,&#xD;
             including active inflammatory bowel disease or graft versus host disease (grade&#xD;
