    <textblock>
      Taking the patients with chronic respiratory failure caused by COPD as the research object&#xD;
      and the acute exacerbation of COPD as the main outcome index, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      establish the syndrome differentiation and treatment scheme of COPD treated by traditional&#xD;
      Chinese medicine, reduce the acute exacerbation of AECOPD, improve the clinical symptoms,&#xD;
      improve the quality of life, reduce the mortality, preliminarily explore the mechanism of&#xD;
      action, and lay the foundation for further research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic respiratory failure of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease belongs to the category&#xD;
      of &quot;lung distention&quot;, &quot;asthma syndrome&quot;, &quot;dyspnea&quot; and &quot;phlegm drink&quot; in traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the pathology of this disease is mainly&#xD;
      the dysfunction of lung ventilation. The basic pathogenesis is that the viscera are&#xD;
      repeatedly affected by evil, the lung qi is damaged due to long-term disease, the lung&#xD;
      function is damaged, the air mechanism is blocked, the application is publicized, the phlegm&#xD;
      is turbid, the blood stasis is inevitable for a long time, and the lung qi is further&#xD;
      damaged. The main clinical manifestations are shortness of breath, wheezing, shortness of&#xD;
      breath, superficial shortness of breath and &quot;drama of wheezing when moving&quot;, which may be&#xD;
      accompanied by cough, expectoration, chest tightness, palpitation, lips, purple darkness,&#xD;
      swelling of floating limbs, etc. The treatment of chronic respiratory failure patients with&#xD;
      COPD can be significantly improved clinical symptoms such as shortness of breath and&#xD;
      wheezing, reduce the number of acute exacerbations of patients, but there is still a lack of&#xD;
      high-level evidence-based medicine research. Therefore, this project puts forward the&#xD;
      hypothesis that &quot;syndrome differentiation therapy can reduce AECOPD of COPD&quot;.It is proposed&#xD;
      to adopt a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design, taking the&#xD;
      patients with chronic respiratory failure caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as&#xD;
      the research object. The patients who meet the inclusion criteria, are divided into heart&#xD;
      lung qi deficiency and lung kidney qi deficiency according to syndrome differentiation. The&#xD;
      participants are randomly divided into the experimental group of 60 cases and the control&#xD;
      group of 60 cases. The control group is given placebo treatment, and the experimental group&#xD;
      is given Chinese medicine granules. The patients were followed up for 26 weeks. The main&#xD;
      outcome indicators include the number of times of acute exacerbation of COPD, and the&#xD;
      secondary outcome indicators include all-cause mortality, severity of acute exacerbation of&#xD;
      COPD, clinical symptoms, CCQ score of COPD clinical questionnaire, quality of life score,&#xD;
      dyspnea score, 6MWD, arterial blood gas analysis index, incidence and use time of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, use time of oxygen therapy, serology index, health and economy Learning&#xD;
      indicators, safety indicators, etc. To establish the TCM treatment scheme of chronic&#xD;
      respiratory failure of COPD, reduce the acute aggravation of AECOPD, improve the clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, improve the quality of life, reduce the mortality rate, preliminarily explore the&#xD;
      mechanism of action, and lay the foundation for further research.&#xD;
