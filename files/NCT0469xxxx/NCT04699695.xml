      This is a prospective, multicenter, sample collection study using DermTech's non-invasive&#xD;
      skin collection kits to evaluate genomic biomarkers and microbiome information from pediatric&#xD;
      and adult subjects with atopic dermatitis(AD). Samples collected will be analyzed to detect&#xD;
      gene signatures and microbiome populations associated with AD and sub-populations of AD.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multicenter, sample collection study using DermTech's non-invasive&#xD;
      skin collection kits to evaluate genomic biomarkers and microbiome information from pediatric&#xD;
      and adult subjects with atopic dermatitis. Samples collected will be analyzed to detect gene&#xD;
      signatures and microbiome populations associated with atopic dermatitis and sub-populations&#xD;
      of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 500 pediatric and adult subjects with moderate to severe AD will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this study. Non-invasive skin samples will be collected at baseline, before drug&#xD;
      administration 16 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) after treatment with biological therapy and a final&#xD;
      visit at 26 weeks ((+/- 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will enter the Screening Period once the informed consent and/or assent process has&#xD;
      been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patient eligibility is confirmed, non-invasive skin samples will be collected using&#xD;
      DermTech's non-invasive sample collection kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected from the following areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target Lesion - lesional skin for genomic analysis. Please note the location for&#xD;
           subsequent collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lesional skin for microbiome analysis similar in size and severity to the target lesion&#xD;
           noted above. Please note the location for subsequent collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-lesional skin at least 5 cm from any active lesion. The intervals for subsequent&#xD;
           sample collection, if applicable, will be determined based on standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
           treatment and the subject's willingness to undergo repeat non-invasive sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected includes eczema area and severity index (EASI), patient oriented eczema&#xD;
      measure (POEM), investigator global assessment (IGA), peak pruritus numerical rating scale&#xD;
      (PPNRS), and transepidermal water loss (TEWL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographic documentation of the site(s) sampled should be obtained to confirm consistent&#xD;
      sampling of the lesional and non-lesional sites. Each non-invasive sample collection will&#xD;
      consist of sequential application of 4 individual patches to a site. If during active&#xD;
      treatment the skin lesion disappears during active treatment, skin samples will still be&#xD;
      obtained from the same location.&#xD;
