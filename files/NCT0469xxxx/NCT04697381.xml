        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female participants with documentation of genetically confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
             PWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No plan to initiate a new treatment that may affect the body composition, such as&#xD;
             gonadal hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Currently on appropriate diet and exercise programs and willing to continue throughout&#xD;
             the study period at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants, and if required by local/site regulations their parent(s)/legal&#xD;
             guardian(s) must be willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of a personally signed and dated ICD (and written assent where applicable&#xD;
             based on age and country regulation) indicating that the participant or a legally&#xD;
             acceptable representative/parent(s)/legal guardian has been informed of all pertinent&#xD;

             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For inclusion of GH naïve pediatric cohort, participants must meet criteria 6 to 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. 18 years or younger.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Naïve to GH treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Tanner stage 1 (for testes in males, for breasts in females).&#xD;
&#xD;
             For inclusion of GH treated pediatric cohort, participants must meet criteria 9 and&#xD;
             10:&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Continued GH treatment for at least 2 years with stable dose for the last 6 months and&#xD;
             being on GH at time of inclusion. The recent dose should be higher than 0.084&#xD;
             mg/kg/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participants who are about to complete GH treatment for his/her short stature (eg, due&#xD;
             to meeting the treatment stopping criteria defined as a height SDS more than -2.5 for&#xD;
             Japanese adult standards).&#xD;
&#xD;
             For inclusion of adult cohort, participants must meet criteria 11 to 13:&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. 18 years of chronological age or older at Day 1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Off from GH treatment for at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Serum IGF-I level within +2 SDS, adjusted for age and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half- lives preceding the first dose of study&#xD;
             intervention used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Investigator site staff or Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the&#xD;
             study, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and their respective&#xD;
