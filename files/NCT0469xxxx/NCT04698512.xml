  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with End Stage Renal Failure (ESRF), the surgical creation of an Autogenous&#xD;
      Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) or Autogenous Arteriovenous Graft (AVG) is the recognised&#xD;
      standard for providing vascular access. A functioning dialysis vascular access is essential&#xD;
      to facilitate hemodialysis (HD) treatment. Advantages include improved hemodialysis&#xD;
      initiation time, improved dialysis quality, better maintenance of accesses and generally,&#xD;
      better outcomes in patients. Unfortunately almost 50% of AVF and AVG fail after a median&#xD;
      lifetime of 3 to 7 years and 12 to 18 months respectively. Vascular access dysfunction is a&#xD;
      major cause of morbidity and hospitalisation for ESRF patients, costing the healthcare system&#xD;
      USD 18 million globally. Venous stenosis and scarring are caused by trauma from surgical&#xD;
      access creation when the circuit comes arterialized and from repeated percutaneous punctures&#xD;
      from subsequent hemodialysis. This study is performed to evaluate Sirolimus-coated balloon&#xD;
      efficacy and safety using MagicTouch™ Drug coated balloon catheter (Concept Medical Inc,&#xD;
      Tampa, FL, US) on AVF patency with de novo and recurrent stenosis.&#xD;
