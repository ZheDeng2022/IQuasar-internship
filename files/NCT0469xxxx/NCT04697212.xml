  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, 14% of all adults report a speech, language, voice, and/or hearing&#xD;
      disability (collectively known as communication disabilities, CD). Patients with CD,&#xD;
      experience inequities in receipt of and access to high-quality healthcare services, including&#xD;
      primary care. Poor patient-provider communication is a significant contributor to these&#xD;
      disparities. When healthcare providers use evidence-based communication strategies, patients&#xD;
      with CD have improved communication outcomes and satisfaction. Unfortunately, providers&#xD;
      rarely use the strategies in practice. The objective of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and implementation of two interventions to increase primary care providers' use&#xD;
      of communication strategies, improving the quality of their communication with patients with&#xD;
      CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a stepped-wedge study design and guided by the RE-AIM framework, we will compare a&#xD;
      healthcare team-directed intervention (training) to a healthcare team-directed intervention +&#xD;
      patient-directed intervention (patient-prompt list). In the healthcare team-directed&#xD;
      intervention, the team will receive training on evidence-based communication strategies for&#xD;
      patients with CD. In the patient-directed intervention, patients with CD will complete a&#xD;
      &quot;patient prompt&quot; list that elicits strategies that they prefer the healthcare team to use&#xD;
      during their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of the interventions on&#xD;
      patient-reported experience in primary care practices across 4 healthcare systems using a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Patients with CD will report a higher quality of health, more positive&#xD;
      experience, and greater self-efficacy when they use the patient-directed tool (intervention&#xD;
      A+B) as compared to patients with CD in the healthcare team education-only phase&#xD;
      (intervention A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. Providers will use more patient-centered communication and strategies with the&#xD;
      patient-directed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to examine the adoption, implementation, and short-term sustainability of&#xD;
      the interventions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 40 million people have a communication disability (CD), which includes hearing, speech,&#xD;
      language, and voice disabilities. Compared to non-disabled patients, patients with CD are&#xD;
      more likely to have a greater number of chronic conditions, and have higher rates of asthma,&#xD;
      hypertension, emphysema, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and arthritis. Approximately one&#xD;
      third of people with CD report the quality of their health as fair/poor as compared to only&#xD;
      11% of patients without CD. Patients with CD are 2-4 times more likely to report difficulty&#xD;
      finding a provider than those without CD. When they do access care, they report that the&#xD;
      quality of care and communication they receive is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication strategies that patients with CD require may vary, and providers need to elicit&#xD;
      and then adapt to patients' preferences for communication strategies. Provider education and&#xD;
      patient-prompt tool interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in general populations.&#xD;
      Provider communication education significantly improves their patient-centered communication.&#xD;
      Patient-prompt tools empower patients to identify topics and communication styles they prefer&#xD;
      and then share this information with their healthcare provider. While provider education and&#xD;
      patient-prompt tools have been proven effective, their effectiveness has not been compared in&#xD;
      the primary care setting for patients with CD. Therefore, the aim of this study is to adapt&#xD;
      these two types of interventions for patients with CD in the primary care setting and then&#xD;
      compare their effectiveness at improving patient-reported health related quality of life and&#xD;
      experience with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will conduct a stepped-wedge randomized control trial design. The study will&#xD;
      take place at 4 sites that have unique contributions that will add to the generalizability&#xD;
      and dissemination of the results. They are diverse in their geographic location, include&#xD;
      academic and community clinics, represent urban and suburban locations, and include racially&#xD;
      and ethnically diverse patients. Eight clinics, 2 at each site, will be part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating clinic sites will receive the healthcare team-directed intervention&#xD;
      (intervention A) and then will be randomized as to when they begin implementing the&#xD;
      patient-directed tool (intervention B). The A versus A+B study design ensures all&#xD;
      participating healthcare team members receive the training, as national policies require&#xD;
      healthcare team members receive training on effective communication with patients with CD. We&#xD;
      will randomize at the clinic-level cluster to eliminate spillover intervention effects&#xD;
      amongst providers within the same clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating healthcare team members will all receive the healthcare team-directed&#xD;
      intervention (a general overview training about communication disabilities and communication&#xD;
      strategies that can be used with patients) during the month preceding trial roll-out. Clinics&#xD;
      will be randomized as to when they begin implementing the patient-directed tool, with a new&#xD;
      clinic beginning every two months. One month prior to implementation, the healthcare team&#xD;
      members will receive a booster education training, be introduced to the patient-directed&#xD;
      tool, and alerted that they will be handed the completed tool by patients with CD during the&#xD;
      patients' clinical encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure patient and provider perceptions, both groups will complete a survey after the&#xD;
      clinical encounter. A subset of encounters will be videotaped, and content analysis will&#xD;
      document providers' use of patient-centered strategies and any adaptations made to the&#xD;
      intervention strategies. Chart review will document patients' healthcare utilization over&#xD;
      time. To understand providers' experiences with both interventions and perceptions of&#xD;
      feasibility, healthcare team members will participate in qualitative focus groups and&#xD;
      interviews at 3 time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes from this study may help create patient and provider training and tools that, if&#xD;
      proven successful, could be disseminated to other healthcare arenas to improve&#xD;
      patient-provider communication and ultimately improved health outcomes for this vulnerable&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
