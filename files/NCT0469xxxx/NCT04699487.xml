  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis (OM) can affect up to 90% of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT). The Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of&#xD;
      Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) recommends&#xD;
      the use of photobiomodulation (PBM) in the prevention of OM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBM is the application of lasers or non-coherent light sources such as LEDs, to beneficially&#xD;
      influence cellular metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though PBM has proved its efficacy, this therapeutic option is currently limited by lack&#xD;
      of standardization, accuracy and reproducibility. CareMin650 has been developed to overcome&#xD;
      these issues, since it allows a reproducible delivery of light, independently of the&#xD;
      operator. Additionally, it is easy to use and user-friendly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrOMiSE is a prospective, interventional, one-group, open-label, multicentric, international&#xD;
      study conducted in European sites, specialized in radio-oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) starting RT and with no oral mucositis (OM) lesion&#xD;
      at the time of inclusion, will be eligible. They will be treated by PBM using CareMin650&#xD;
      during the whole period of radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis (OM) can affect up to 90% of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) and/or chemotherapy (CT). It can be as severe as WHO grade 3 / 4 in&#xD;
      35% to more than 50% of cases. The pathobiology of OM relates to injuries that occur in the&#xD;
      epithelial and connective tissues, as a response to a complex cascade of biological events,&#xD;
      involving all the tissues and cellular elements of the mucosa (Sonis et al., 2004). OM may&#xD;
      result in dysphagia, pain, risk of infection, weight loss, interruption or modification of&#xD;
      anticancer therapy, or hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As OM is a major and frequent side effect of RT, the Mucositis Study Group of the&#xD;
      Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral&#xD;
      Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) has published clinical practice guidelines for mucositis prevention&#xD;
      secondary to cancer therapy. In addition to meticulous oral hygiene, MASCC/ISOO also suggests&#xD;
      several therapeutic preventive strategies: growth factors, cytokines, anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      agents, natural agents, … In the 2020 guidelines, photobiomodulation (PBM) formerly known as&#xD;
      Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), has obtain a full recommendation for the prevention of OM in&#xD;
      patients undergoing RT, with or without concomitant CT, for HNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBM is the application of lasers or non-coherent light sources such as LEDs, to beneficially&#xD;
      influence cellular metabolism. In a Cochrane review that included 32 clinical trials, PBM was&#xD;
      the only treatment that demonstrated a reduction in the risk of severe mucositis. In 2011, a&#xD;
      meta-analysis included 11 placebo-controlled randomized trials in 415 patients treated with&#xD;
      CT or RT for head and neck cancer (HNC) or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. According&#xD;
      to MASCC/ISOO recommendations, PBM is now recommended to prevent OM in HNC patients receiving&#xD;
      RT with or without chemotherapy . The 2014 recommendations have been endorsed by the AFSOS&#xD;
      (Association Française pour les Soins de Support en Oncologie) in France. Finally, the&#xD;
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) determined that PBM for OM shows no&#xD;
      major safety concerns and that evidence on efficacy is adequate in quality and quantity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these data show that PBM is an efficacious and safe option to prevent and/or&#xD;
      treat radiotherapy-related OM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though PBM has proved its efficacy, delivery of PBM in OM is currently limited by lack&#xD;
      of standardization, accuracy and reproducibility. In particular, the distance between the&#xD;
      lighting source and the mucosa or skin is difficult to assess and control accurately.&#xD;
      Therefore, the amount of energy delivered may vary from one session to another, as well as&#xD;
      from one operator to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CareMin650 has been developed to overcome these issues. CareMin650 allows a reproducible&#xD;
      delivery of light, independently of the operator. As light is emitted by a flexible surface&#xD;
      in contact with the mucosa or the skin, the dose delivered will be controlled. Additionally,&#xD;
      it is meant to be easy to use and user-friendly. An interim analysis of SafePBM, a pilot&#xD;
      study performed in France provided preliminary data on safety and efficacy. Among 186&#xD;
      CareMin650 sessions performed to prevent (n=152) or treat (n=34) OM in patients with HNC, no&#xD;
      treatment-emergent adverse event was considered related to the device and no adverse event&#xD;
      led to CareMin650 discontinuation. Only one out of 7 (14%) HNC patients treated in the&#xD;
      preventative setting developed OM grade 3. However, this patient had started PBM 6 days after&#xD;
      the initiation of RT, instead of starting at day 1 of RT. These encouraging results suggest&#xD;
      that CareMin650 is both well tolerated and efficient to prevent severe OM in these high-risk&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to show the efficacy and safety of the CareMin650 medical&#xD;
      device, in the prevention of severe OM in HNC patients receiving radiotherapy. The rate of&#xD;
      severe OM will be compared to severe OM rate reported in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, interventional, one-group, open-label, multicentric, international&#xD;
      study that will be conducted in Belgian and German sites, specialized in radio-oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photobiomodulation will be delivered to all included patients with the CareMin650&#xD;
      (NeoMedLight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied Device CareMin 650 consists in a lightbox and a light applicator that delivers&#xD;
      red light at 650nm to the oral mucosa and the neck. The applicator is composed of a&#xD;
      connector, a fiberoptic beam of about 1 meter long and a light textile part. Appropriate&#xD;
      non-sterile single use disposable sleeves will be added by the operator to cover the part in&#xD;
      contact with the patient's mucosa or skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device is CE marked and is used in this study in its intended indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis is planned.&#xD;
