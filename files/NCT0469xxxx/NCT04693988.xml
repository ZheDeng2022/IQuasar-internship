  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an exercise-based lifestyle program for patients&#xD;
      who have experienced a myocardial infarction, systolic heart failure, percutaneous&#xD;
      revascularization or cardiac surgery. CR plays a key role in secondary prevention, which is&#xD;
      the prevention of subsequent cardiac events. CR has been shown to reduce both cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality and one year hospital readmissions as well as improve quality of life, exercise&#xD;
      capacity, and physical function. Although the benefits have been clearly established for&#xD;
      cardiac patients, women are much less likely to attend CR than men. Based upon our own&#xD;
      preliminary data (and the medical literature), attendance at CR is determined by factors that&#xD;
      vary in their importance between men and women. These findings demonstrate that older age and&#xD;
      poor social support are particular barriers to CR participation in women. This information&#xD;
      can guide efforts to increase CR participation and adherence in women, areas which have&#xD;
      received little study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case management (CM) has been effective at reducing cardiovascular risk and reducing&#xD;
      hospitalizations amongst cardiac patients. Further, CM has been effective at promoting&#xD;
      attendance in a variety of health related programs (for example, diabetes treatment or&#xD;
      cocaine dependence treatment). The primary aim in this randomized controlled trial is to&#xD;
      examine the efficacy of early CM to promote participation and adherence in CR. The CM model&#xD;
      can identify individualized determinants of health and social needs to identify potential&#xD;
      barriers which may hinder CR enrollment. Additionally, the case manager will conduct a home&#xD;
      visit and provide individual counseling to address lifestyle changes including physical&#xD;
      activity. Thus, a component of CR and physical activity can be still be delivered for those&#xD;
      unable to attend CR. The concept of CM to improve CR participation and adherence has not been&#xD;
      specifically tested in women, a vulnerable patient population. This intervention, therefore,&#xD;
      has the potential to increase utilization of CR and significantly improve health outcomes in&#xD;
      female cardiac patients.&#xD;
