      This study is a clinical study of CD276 CAR-T in the treatment of patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. The purpose is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of targeting CD276&#xD;
      auto-chimeric antigen receptor T cells in the treatment of CD276-positive advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

    <description>Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (car-t) is one of the most effective therapies for malignant tumors (especially hematological tumors). Like other immunotherapies, the basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to clear cancer cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (car) is the core component of car-t, which endows T cells with the ability to recognize tumor antigens in an independent manner, which enables car modified T cells to recognize a wider range of targets than natural T cell surface receptors (TCR). The basic design of car includes a tumor associated antigen binding region (usually derived from scFv segment of monoclonal antibody antigen binding region), transmembrane region and intracellular signal region. The selection of target antigen is a key determinant for the specificity and effectiveness of car and the safety of genetically modified T cells.</description>
