  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, 2 arms study concerning patients with high-grade bone&#xD;
      sarcoma (HGBS) without complete remission after standard treatment at diagnosis or first&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first arm, patients will be treated with regorafenib + best supportive care (BSC) for&#xD;
      a maximum of 12 months as maintenance therapy after standard line therapy completion, whereas&#xD;
      in the second arm, patients will be treated with placebo + BSC (standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison between this two arms will allow to determine whether or not regorafenib and&#xD;
      BSC is efficient for disease control, in terms of Progression-Free Survival improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, prospective, comparative,&#xD;
      multicentre phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with measurable unresectable residual disease will be accrued after they completed&#xD;
      standard of care, consisting of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At diagnosis: multimodal treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and adjuvant&#xD;
           chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At first relapse: chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned (1:1) into one of the&#xD;
      following treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental arm: regorafenib + best supportive care (BSC) maintenance (12 months&#xD;
           maximum)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard arm: placebo + BSC (12 months maximum)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization procedure (centralized implementation of concealed random permuted blocks)&#xD;
      will be used to obtain a balanced distribution of the setting of the disease (stratification&#xD;
      factor): residual disease at diagnosis or at relapse after standard multimodal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their eligibility has been confirmed, patients will receive regorafenib or its matching&#xD;
      placebo until disease progression, or for a maximum of 12 months, or unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      willingness to stop, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of radiological disease progression during treatment period, patients from the&#xD;
      standard arm (placebo) who have unresectable disease will be allow to switch to experimental&#xD;
      arm (regorafenib). After the switch, patients will be treated with regorafenib until disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity or willingness to stop which occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the maintenance therapy (12 months) patients will be followed-up&#xD;
      until the first radiological disease progression, unless a premature disease progression&#xD;
      occurred. All patients will be followed-up until the data cut-off (12 months after the last&#xD;
      randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vital status will be updated once for all patients at the end of the study, based on&#xD;
      patient's medical file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the study will be 24 months after the last randomisation or at the end of&#xD;
      treatment of the last patient under treatment (either blinded or open label) whichever occurs&#xD;
      last.&#xD;
