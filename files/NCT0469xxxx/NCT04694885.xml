    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial, taking place at the University Hospital Basel&#xD;
      (CH). It aims at the alleviation of breast cancer patients' life quality during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will participate in 10 sessions of structured hypnotherapy during the&#xD;
      course of chemotherapy in addition to the standard of care. The control group will have&#xD;
      access to the standard of care without any additional treatment. The main goal of the study&#xD;
      is to investigate whether quality of life is higher among patients in the intervention group.&#xD;
      Additionally, it will be analyzed if the interventions have a positive effect on chemotherapy&#xD;
      side effects, symptoms of anxiety and depression and the immune system. Finally, the relative&#xD;
      dose intensity (RDI) as well as treatment schedule adherence will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks to be expected from the intervention itself. In the case of positive&#xD;
      findings, the standard of psycho-oncological care can be updated by integrating structured&#xD;
      hypnotherapeutic interventions into the treatment of patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy are likely to experience lower life quality,&#xD;
      side effects like nausea and vomiting and symptoms of anxiety or depression. At the same time&#xD;
      their immune system is down regulated by a stress reaction following cancer diagnosis and&#xD;
      also by the chemotherapy itself. Decrease of several immune factors is associated with lower&#xD;
      survival expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnotherapy uses methods like relaxation, symptom-control techniques, imagination and&#xD;
      working with inner resources. They can be used to bring positive change for patients both&#xD;
      mentally as well as physically. Self-hypnosis techniques are used to bring back a feeling of&#xD;
      self-efficacy which is impaired in most cancer patients who report to lose control over their&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence shows the effectiveness of hypnotherapy in reducing side-effects of medical&#xD;
      treatments and improve mental health and quality of life of cancer patients. It was shown&#xD;
      that hypnotherapy has a positive effect on several immune factors. But up to now it is not&#xD;
      clear if there is also a positive effect on the immune system during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Chemotherapy it is important that patients adhere as much as possible to the treatment&#xD;
      schedule and to the optimal dosage. Due to chemotherapy side-effects or other reasons it&#xD;
      happens regularly that treatment needs be delayed or dosage reduced which in turn lowers the&#xD;
      efficiency of the chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate if hypnotherapy has a positive effect on quality of life,&#xD;
      side-effects of chemotherapy, symptoms of anxiety and depression, the immune system and the&#xD;
      relative dose intensity (RDI) of female breast cancer patients during the course of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Flow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients have been diagnosed with primary breast cancer and were assigned to either&#xD;
      adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy they are asked if they want to participate in the study&#xD;
      and are given all the necessary information and consent form. If they agree, they will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the control group or the intervention group following a computer&#xD;
      generated randomization list. Before the first session of hypnotherapy they will be given the&#xD;
      first questionnaires (T0). Those assigned to the intervention group will be contacted by a&#xD;
      therapist to fix a date for the first session, if possible before the first chemotherapy&#xD;
      cycle or shortly after the first cycle, when the side effects are not yet present. During 4,5&#xD;
      months, patients will receive 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 10 session of hypnotherapy. They&#xD;
      will have access to the standard of psycho-oncological care during the study. The control&#xD;
      group will not receive any Hypnotherapy but also has access to the standard of&#xD;
      psycho-oncological care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0 (Baseline) = After diagnosis and before the first chemotherapy cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1 = First cycle of chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2 = Second cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      T3 = Third cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      T4 = Fourth cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      T5 = Fifth cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      T6 = Sixth cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of one cycle will be approx. 3 weeks, depending on the individual chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen.This means that the total time for the chemotherapy of one patient will last around&#xD;
      18 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks to be expected from the intervention itself. In the case of positive&#xD;
      findings, the standard of psycho-oncological care can be updated by integrating structured&#xD;
      hypnotherapeutic interventions into the treatment of patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a monocentric randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. All participants will be recruited in the University Hospital Basel (CH). They must be adult, female, diagnosed with first time breast cancer and undergoing adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. During chemotherapy, the control group as well as the intervention group will be offered the standard of psycho-oncological care. This means they can chose how much psychological support they want to use. Additionally, participants in the intervention group participate in 10 structured sessions of hypnotherapy aimed to alleviate quality of life. These therapeutic sessions will take place approximately every two to three weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Side effects of chemotherapy will also be captured with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). It contains three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting) and single items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea and financial problems). All symptom scales range from 1-4 with higher values representing higher levels of symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Intervention includes 10 structured hypnotherapy sessions lasting 45 to 60 minutes. During hypnosis, patients reach a trance-like state comparable to a deep relaxation. The therapist guides the patient verbally and also communicates with the patient.&#xD;
Patients will be supported to use their own imagination without suggesting any imagery. By repeatedly asking what the patient is perceiving, and by verbally repeating what the patient is saying, the therapist can help the patient to go deeper into trance. In these trance states the patient learns to reduce negative side effects of the chemotherapy and increase the quality of life by activating both physical and mental resources using imagination and focusing on positive memories and feelings.</description>
