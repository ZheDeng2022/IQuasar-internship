  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the minimum safety, tolerability and acceptability&#xD;
      data needed to support the use of cabotegravir long-acting injection (CAB LA) in an&#xD;
      adolescent population, potentially transforming the field of HIV prevention for young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adolescents assigned male at birth, including&#xD;
      men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women (TGW), and gender non-conforming people.&#xD;
      The total participant commitment for the entire study is approximately 1.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in three steps. In Step 1, participants will receive daily oral&#xD;
      CAB tablets for 5 weeks. In Step 2, participants will receive a series of five intramuscular&#xD;
      (IM) injections of CAB LA, administered at 8-week intervals after a 4-week loading dose&#xD;
      (injections at Weeks 5, 9, 17, 25 &amp; 33). A safety visit will follow each injection to&#xD;
      ascertain safety data, including injection site reactions. In Step 3, all participants who&#xD;
      have received at least one injection will be followed quarterly (every 3 months) for 48 weeks&#xD;
      after their last injection. Participants will receive oral TDF/FTC for daily use for 48 weeks&#xD;
      or may be provided the opportunity to enroll in a local open label study of CAB, if&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend about 18 study visits throughout the study. Visits may include&#xD;
      physical examinations, blood collection, urine collection, rectal and oral pharyngeal swab&#xD;
      collection, risk reduction and adherence counseling, and behavioral or acceptability&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety endpoint: Proportion of participants experiencing any Grade 2 or higher clinical adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities among participants who receive at least one injection of CAB LA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured through participant's last study visit, up to 1.5 years after study entry.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability endpoint: Proportion of participants who receive at least 1 injection and who discontinue receiving injections prior to the full course of injections due to intolerability of injection, frequency of injections or burden of study procedures.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured through participant's last study visit, up to 1.5 years after study entry.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability endpoint: Proportion of participants who complete all scheduled injections and proportion of participants who receive at least one injection whom would consider using CAB LA for HIV prevention in the future.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured through participant's last study visit, up to 1.5 years after study entry.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma CAB Drug Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured through participant's last study visit, up to 1.5 years after study entry.</time_frame>
    <description>CAB drug concentrations will be measured in plasma to generate CAB-LA concentration-time profiles among study participants. Measurements will occur at study visits during the injection phase of the study as well as during the pharmacologic &quot;tail&quot; phase.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participant-study visits above the protein-adjusted inhibitor concentration (90%; PA-IC₉₀)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured through participant's last study visit, up to 1.5 years after study entry.</time_frame>
    <description>CAB drug concentrations will be measured throughout the study, to determine the proportion of visits in which a participant remains above the 1x (0.166 mcg/mL), 4x (0.664 mcg/mL) and 8x (1.33 mcg/mL) PA-IC₉₀. Concentrations above the 3 PA-IC₉₀ are associated with rectal protection in a non-human primate study, and concentrations above the 8x PA-IC₉₀ are expected to be associated with protection in humans.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters, mean and median drug concentrations at each injection visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from the initial injection through Week 33.</time_frame>
    <description>CAB drug concentrations will be measured throughout the study, and the study team will characterize variability in concentrations at each visit by determining mean and median concentrations, as well as associated deviations and %CVs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Terminal half-life estimates for CAB-LA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured through participant's last study visit, up to 1.5 years after study entry.</time_frame>
    <description>CAB drug concentrations will be measured during the tail phase of the study, up to one year after a participant's last visit. This will allow the study team to estimate the terminal half-life of CAB-LA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Characterize CAB drug concentrations in individuals who acquire HIV.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured through participant's last study visit, up to 1.5 years after study entry.</time_frame>
    <description>CAB drug measurements will be conducted in all participants, including those who acquire HIV; these data will be used to determine the CAB drug concentration at the first HIV positive visit, and serve as a possible explanatory variable in potential HIV acquisition. Drug concentrations will be evaluated within the context of CAB's PA-IC₉₀.</description>
