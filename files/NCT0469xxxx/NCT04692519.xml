      Caregiver-child language interactions in the first three years of life predict early language&#xD;
      development, school readiness, and academic achievement. Despite the importance of these&#xD;
      factors, there are disparities in the frequency and quality of children's early language&#xD;
      interactions. Although there is within-group variability, children from low-income families,&#xD;
      on average, have fewer and lower-quality language experiences than their middle- or&#xD;
      high-income peers. The current study addresses a need in the community for an early language&#xD;
      intervention accessible to low-income families who speak Spanish. This study will build upon&#xD;
      research conducted in a previous study, &quot;Enhancing the Communication Foundation-The Duet&#xD;
      Project&quot;, by piloting the English and Spanish modules with families through a light-touch,&#xD;
      remote intervention delivery model. Temple University Health System's Department of&#xD;
      Pediatrics will aid in identifying participants. Baseline and follow-up measures will be used&#xD;
      to evaluate caregiver knowledge of child development, psychosocial perceptions, demographics,&#xD;
      caregiver-child language interaction quality, and child language skills. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that dyads who receive the intervention will make greater gains in early interaction quality,&#xD;
      knowledge of child development, and child language skills than the delayed-access control&#xD;
      group. This work has the potential to shape early intervention design and implementation for&#xD;
      people in underserved communities across the country.&#xD;

      Objectives and Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Duet 2.0- a light-touch, public health&#xD;
      model of remote intervention delivery 1) increases caregiver knowledge about children's&#xD;
      language development, 2) improves caregiver-child language interaction quantity and quality,&#xD;
      and 3) enhances children's language skills. It is hypothesized that dyads who receive the&#xD;
      Duet 2.0 intervention will make greater gains in knowledge of child development, early&#xD;
      interaction quality, and child language skills than the delayed-access control group.&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will be conducted to examine if and how parent (e.g., self-efficacy) and&#xD;
      child (e.g., child language abilities) characteristics relate to each other, baseline&#xD;
      measures, and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early language skills are fundamental to language, cognitive, and socioemotional development&#xD;
      and are the single best predictors of later academic success. Caregiver-child language&#xD;
      interactions in the first three years of life not only predict early language development,&#xD;
      but also influence school readiness skills and academic achievement. High-quality early&#xD;
      language interactions are characterized by rich and diverse vocabulary, responsive talk&#xD;
      (i.e., language following the child's attention), decontextualized language (e.g., language&#xD;
      beyond the here and now context, &quot;Remember we went to a party last night&quot;), communication&#xD;
      foundation (e.g., use of verbal and gestural symbols, engaging in back-and-forth&#xD;
      conversations), and question use. In fact, early reading outcomes are particularly contingent&#xD;
      on strong language skills that go beyond and accompany strong decoding skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the importance of these factors, there are large disparities in the frequency and&#xD;
      quality of children's early language interactions. Although there is great within-group&#xD;
      variability, children from low-income families on average have fewer and lower-quality&#xD;
      language experiences than their middle- or high-income peers. Early disparities in language&#xD;
      experiences can lead to gaps in language skills and academic achievement that persist into&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duet 2.0 will adopt an innovative and scalable approach-remote delivery and coaching. This&#xD;
      design reflects arguably the strongest evidence for successful intervention. Remote coaching&#xD;
      and telehealth are becoming accepted models for public health intervention in domains like&#xD;
      nutrition, fitness, heart health, and diabetes. There is also growing support for remote&#xD;
      delivery parent and teacher training programs. For instance, remote coaching has effectively&#xD;
      improved Head Start teachers' language and literacy practices. This intervention model has&#xD;
      also been used successfully to promote mental health in parents of infants, train parents in&#xD;
      domains such as child socioemotional development, and support language and communication in&#xD;
      young children with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the support of the William Penn Foundation and the Bezos Family Foundation, the PIs&#xD;
      spent three years designing and piloting a caregiver- implemented early language intervention&#xD;
      program-The Duet Project: Early Engagement, Future Success. Using community-based&#xD;
      participatory research (CBPR) framework with partners at the Maternity Care Coalition (MCC),&#xD;
      the PIs created Duet training materials that are evidence-based and culturally sensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot work with Duet yielded promising findings despite low sample sizes. These preliminary&#xD;
      results support the efficacy of the Duet modules. Duet participants included some Spanish&#xD;
      speakers; however, all participants had to be able to receive services in English. This&#xD;
      significantly limited recruitment-nearly 25% of infants and toddlers in Philadelphia are of&#xD;
      Latino/Hispanic origin. Furthermore, the percent of Hispanic/Latino people living in poverty&#xD;
      is disproportionately high-they make up 21% of the population living in poverty but only&#xD;
      14.4% of the total population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translating the Duet modules into Spanish and developing a more efficient delivery system&#xD;
      will maximize their scalability and positive impact on low-SES families. Establishing an&#xD;
      efficient communication foundation, will enhance language learning and literacy development&#xD;
      with the goal of narrowing the achievement gap in future generations. Given the undeniably&#xD;
      powerful link between early language competencies and later literacy skills, this&#xD;
      intervention has the potential to have long-lasting and widespread benefits both at local and&#xD;
      national levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duet 2.0 Intervention and Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective research participants will be identified and recruited through the Department of&#xD;
      Pediatrics at Temple University Health System(TUHS) and possibly by sharing recruitment&#xD;
      materials with local community organizations (e.g., Early Head Start centers). Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited and screened. If they meet study requirements during screening, they will&#xD;
      then be consented and enrolled. Families who are randomly selected into the intervention&#xD;
      group will complete the modules at home on their own time and receive remote coaching from an&#xD;
      interventionist or coach (terms used interchangeably). Families in the delayed-access control&#xD;
      group will receive access to the modules at the end of the study, but will still complete&#xD;
      data-collection sessions. Approximately once a week after enrollment, Interventionists will&#xD;
      support the intervention-group families remotely in comprehending and implementing what they&#xD;
      have learned from the modules. Interventionists may also be involved in remote data&#xD;
      collection. All participants will be scheduled for follow-up data collection sessions via&#xD;
      phone or video conference.&#xD;

    <description>The Duet 2.0 intervention is comprised of six training modules, which include behavioral strategies, real-life and animated examples of high-quality early language interactions, and interactive scenarios. Modules were translated into Spanish. Participants will watch one Duet intervention module a week and have up to 3 months to complete all 6 modules. As intervention families review the modules on their own time at home, they will receive remote coaching from an assigned interventionist and weekly module-specific fidelity/comprehension questions. Interventionists will check-in weekly via phone or video (~30-60 minutes), whichever is more convenient for the family. During the check-in, interventionists will do teach-back about the module, guide the family on how to incorporate the strategies into their daily lives, and provide feedback. Intervention participants will be scheduled for follow-up data collection at 3 months, 6 months, and pending funding, 1-year after baseline.</description>

    <description>The Duet 2.0 intervention modules promote the following guiding principles that help build effective communication. Below are the 5 principles covered in the six Duet modules: 1) General Awareness: Awareness and knowledge of child development 2) Creating Opportunities: Opportunities for communication during everyday activities 3) Conversational Duets: Rhythmic and reciprocal early language interactions 4) Scaffolding: Providing just enough help to support child independence 5) Harmonizing: Using the strategies together. These modules, which include behavioral strategies, real-life and animated examples of high-quality early language interactions, and interactive scenarios. The modules were informed and narrated by community members and carefully designed to address specific needs of high-risk communities. The modules have also been translated into Spanish, making sure to encompass specific cultural and dialect needs. Translation accuracy was verified by a qualified Spanish translator.</description>
