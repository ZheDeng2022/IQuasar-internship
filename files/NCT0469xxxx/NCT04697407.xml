  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) has long been considered a disease mediated primarily by CD4+ T&#xD;
      cells. However, recent clinical trials demonstrating significant efficacy of B-lymphocyte&#xD;
      depletive therapies have highlighted the major role of this cell population in the&#xD;
      development of MS. Among B-Ls, regulatory (&quot;anti-inflammatory&quot;) B-Ls (Bregs) have protective&#xD;
      functions in autoimmune diseases including MS, however the mechanisms that regulate the&#xD;
      development and function of Bregs are poorly characterized. In our research laboratory&#xD;
      (INSERM UMR1236), one of the lines of research focuses on the role of interleukin-2 (IL-2)&#xD;
      signaling in the fate of the B lymphocyte. Numerous studies conducted in both human and mouse&#xD;
      models of MS demonstrate the major role of this IL-2/IL2R signaling pathway in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that IL-2/IL2R pathway could contribute, by a mechanism intrinsic to B&#xD;
      lymphocytes, to the development of autoimmune diseases such as MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a defect in IL-2 signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MS, the impact&#xD;
      of this defective signaling on regulatory B lymphocyte populations, which has been shown to&#xD;
      play a protective role in the development of the disease, has never been studied. This study&#xD;
      could help establish a new mechanism predisposing patients to develop the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is&#xD;
      the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. Pathophysiopathologically, MS&#xD;
      has long been considered a disease mediated primarily by CD4+ T cells. However, recent&#xD;
      clinical trials demonstrating significant efficacy of B-lymphocyte (B-lymphocyte) depletive&#xD;
      therapies have highlighted the major role of this cell population in the development of MS.&#xD;
      Thus, it has been shown that these cells, in addition to their ability to secrete pathogenic&#xD;
      antibodies, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in this disease, and an imbalance between&#xD;
      these potentially pathogenic pro-inflammatory B-Ls and regulatory (&quot;anti-inflammatory&quot;) B-Ls&#xD;
      (Bregs) has been suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bregs have protective functions in autoimmune diseases including MS, however the mechanisms&#xD;
      that regulate the development and function of Bregs are poorly characterized. In our research&#xD;
      laboratory (INSERM UMR1236), one of the lines of research focuses on the role of&#xD;
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling in the fate of the B lymphocyte. Our team has thus&#xD;
      demonstrated that this cytokine, essentially produced by CD4+ T lymphocytes, triggers the&#xD;
      differentiation of na√Øve human B cells in vitro into plasma cells. And, more recently, the&#xD;
      analysis of the early response of BLs in mice disabled for the IL-2 receptor specifically in&#xD;
      mature BLs (Il2rbfl/flCD19cre/+) suggests a role of IL-2 in the acquisition of&#xD;
      suppressive/regulatory functions. In addition, numerous studies conducted in both human and&#xD;
      mouse models of MS demonstrate the major role of this IL-2/IL2R signaling pathway in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that IL-2 signaling induces the polarization and/or regulatory function of&#xD;
      Bregs in vivo and that deregulation of this IL-2/IL2R pathway could contribute, by a&#xD;
      mechanism intrinsic to B lymphocytes, to the development of autoimmune diseases such as MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a defect in IL-2 signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MS, the impact&#xD;
      of this defective signaling on regulatory B lymphocyte populations, which has been shown to&#xD;
      play a protective role in the development of the disease, has never been studied. This study&#xD;
      could help establish a new mechanism predisposing patients to develop the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is the analysis of the Bregs population in the blood of MS&#xD;
      patients (at the diagnostic stage and in different forms) who are untreated compared to&#xD;
      controls who are healthy in various aspects.&#xD;
