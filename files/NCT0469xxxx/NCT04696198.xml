  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, genetic disease of the body's mucus-producing glands&#xD;
      that primarily affects the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. There are no studies that have&#xD;
      examined anatomical changes, the connection between structure and function in the ribcage and&#xD;
      the effect of symptom-relieving manual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is therefore to investigate chest mobility in people with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The study is conducted in three parts; a / A retrospective longitudinal part whose&#xD;
      purpose is to investigate possible changes in the chest configuration in relation to&#xD;
      deterioration of lung volumes in a cohort of CF patients. Chest configuration will be&#xD;
      measured standardized and blinded on computed tomography (CT) images and related to results&#xD;
      from spirometry examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b / A prospective, consecutive cross-sectional study of the same cohort. The aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the extent of stiffness and pain that is examined standardized (number of&#xD;
      pain-free / normal moving structures) and its relation to objective examination of&#xD;
      respiratory movements, respiratory muscle strength and spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c / A randomized controlled single-blind study aimed at evaluating the effect of manual&#xD;
      treatment for pain and reduced mobility in patients with these symptoms. The treatments&#xD;
      consist of standardized manual therapy with passive joint mobilization without impulse and&#xD;
      soft tissue treatment. Evaluation will be done via the examination protocol in sub-study b /&#xD;
      as well as objective measurements of respiratory movements (primary variable), respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength and spirometry which will be performed by a blinded tester both before and&#xD;
      immediately after the intervention / control period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance When it comes to CF care, great medical advances have been made and for&#xD;
      Swedish patients, the physiotherapeutic active treatment has proven to have very good&#xD;
      effects. However, there are areas where care can be improved. The results from our study will&#xD;
      provide additional breadth to strategies in CF care&#xD;
