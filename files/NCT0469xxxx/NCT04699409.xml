    <textblock>
      FAST and Stroke-112 are two campaigns to reduce the emergency room arrival time of stroke&#xD;
      patients. No study has evaluated the effectiveness of these campaigns. This study aimed to&#xD;
      compare recalling capacity of people in these two campaigns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral vascular accidents have been one of the leading causes of death in Taiwan in recent&#xD;
      years. In the modern medical system, treatment for hyperacute stroke including intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolysis and intra-arterial thrombectomy. The faster patient received treatment, the&#xD;
      better outcome he has.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehospital delay of acute stroke treatment has been an important issue in modern medical&#xD;
      system. Awareness of stroke symptoms and calling for medical help immediately is the most&#xD;
      important part of stroke health education. The most used educational campaign is FAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, there is another stroke educational campaign called STROKE 112. Previous&#xD;
      study had showed it has greater acceptance, since the number is easier to remember then&#xD;
      letter, especially in non-English speaking countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators had conducted a hospital-based randomized study in 2019, which revealed&#xD;
      that STROKE 112 had similar, but not superior effectiveness with FAST. However, more study is&#xD;
      needed for community-based population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare and explore the effectiveness of two stroke educational campaigns,&#xD;
      FAST and STROKE 112, on community-based population by using the questionnaire, in Yunlin,&#xD;
      Taiwan. The result will been compared and analyzed with previous study, help us modify and&#xD;
      enhance our current stroke educational program, shorten the prehospital delay, and improve&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with acute stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomized into either group: FAST or STROKE 112. Then the investigator&#xD;
      will give a 15min eduacation. The evaluation will be arranged 5 days and 30 days after the&#xD;
      first education, and the outcome is the recalling capacity of the stroke symptoms in the&#xD;
      educational campaign.&#xD;
