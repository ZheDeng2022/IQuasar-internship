      The study consists of two arms: 1) intervention group using eggs as supplementary food given&#xD;
      from 2nd trimester of pregnancy to birth, and 2) observational group of pregnant mothers. it&#xD;
      aims to assess the effectiveness of improving dietary quality during pregnancy on the&#xD;
      epigenetic and stunting related outcomes (growth and development) in infants, who will be&#xD;
      followed up until 24 months old&#xD;

      The study aims to assess the impact of improving dietary quality during pregnancy on the&#xD;
      epigenetic and stunting related outcomes in infants. The open-label intervention study would&#xD;
      be conducted alongside the observational study in the same study setting by recruitment of&#xD;
      additional number (n=153) of pregnant women. Thus, a total of 653 pregnant women would be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study; 153 women would be randomized to intervention arm and 500 to the&#xD;
      control arm who would form an observational cohort of women and newborns as described above.&#xD;
      The intervention group women will be provided one egg three times per week from recruitment&#xD;
      (2nd trimester) until term. The control group women will receive standard intervention in the&#xD;
      form of Ante Natal Care from village midwives or Public Health Centre (IFA tablet, calcium&#xD;
      tablet, nutrition counselling).&#xD;
