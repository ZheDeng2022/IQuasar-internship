    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome(PFPS) treatment is basically conservative, but there is no&#xD;
      general consensus on the most appropriate therapeutic approach. The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      examine the misalignment of the patellofemoral joint with MRI and compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of McConnell patellar taping and femoral lateral rotational taping techniques applied to&#xD;
      exercise function on pain, patellar maltraction, functional status, balance and quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with PFPS.&#xD;

      This is a single blinded randomized controlled trial, will be conducted at Ankara Yıldırım&#xD;
      Beyazıt UniversityYenimahalle Education and Research Hospital. Evaluations regarding the&#xD;
      parameters and inclusion criteria at the stage of diagnosis will be carried out by the&#xD;
      Specialist Physician, exercise therapy and taping practices by the Specialist&#xD;
      Physiotherapist, and the MRI measurements by the Specialist Radiologist. Fixed probability&#xD;
      stratified randomization method will be preferred in order to ensure proportional gender&#xD;
      distribution in the formation of groups and participants will be divided into 3 groups. An&#xD;
      exercise program that includes stretching, strengthening and balance exercises accompanied by&#xD;
      physiotherapist in the clinic will be applied to all individuals participating in the study&#xD;
      for 2 times/week X 6 weeks (12 sessions). Only the exercise program will be applied to the&#xD;
      first group. To the second group; McConnell patellar taping technique will be applied using&#xD;
      rigid tape(Leukotape® P Rigid Strapping Tape, 38 mm X 10 m, USA) in addition to the exercise&#xD;
      program in each session.To the third group; femoral lateral rotation taping technique will be&#xD;
      applied using rigid tape in addition to the exercise program. Patients' patellar maltraction,&#xD;
      pain function, balance, and quality of life will be assessed before and after treatment with&#xD;
      MRI and clinical testing.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bisect offset index (BOI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline BOI at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A reference line is drawn through the posterior of the femoral condyles in the axial plan. A line is drawn from the widest diameter of the patella. A perpendicular third line drawn from the deepest point of the trochlear groove divides the widest diameter of the patella into 2 parts (α, β). Bisect offset is defined as the ratio of the lateral part of the patella to the patellar width and is calculated by the formula [α / (α + β) x100]. Being above 57° is a risk factor for pain and patellofemoral joint degeneration.</description>

    <description>It is the angle between the line connecting the top points of the femoral condyles and the line drawn along the lateral facet of the patella. In general, the patellofemoral angle is more than 8 ° and is open laterally. Medial patency monitoring or an angle less than 8 ° is considered an abnormal slope.</description>
