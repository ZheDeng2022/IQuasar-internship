  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venipuncture is one of the most common stressful procedures in children. Managing pain and&#xD;
      fear of venipuncture procedure recommended strongly because it may change children's memory&#xD;
      for procedural pain and the subsequent acceptance of later health care painful interventions.&#xD;
      Prior painful experiences can reduce the acceptance of later health care, hence making it&#xD;
      more difficult for both patients and nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was clear evidence that the distraction method is the most performed as a psychological&#xD;
      technique performed to decrease venipuncture-related pain and distress and supporting its&#xD;
      efficacy in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study to investigate the effectiveness of TICK-B on children's pain and&#xD;
      anxiety during venipuncture procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure the pain and fear of children by parents and observer. A rating of 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst or most severe pain. The VAS is a valid, reliable, and frequently used measure of procedural distress in children 6 to 18 years of age.</description>
