      1. Normal diet：Starting from May 20, 2018, the subjects will eat a normal diet for 4 days,&#xD;
           with no restriction on calories and food types. The subjects are required to record&#xD;
           their daily diet and dietary intake of calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fast diet of High control ：From May 24, 2018, the method of fast diet was adopted on&#xD;
           alternate days. According to the dietary records of normal diet, the normal caloric&#xD;
           intake of each subject was calculated. Fast diet was carried out according to 2/3, 1/2,&#xD;
           1/3 and 1/4 of the original normal caloric intake.Each caloric stage last for 4 days,&#xD;
           and the total cycle of fast diet was 31 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fast diet of Low control ：After the intervention of fast diet of high control, the&#xD;
           subjects were allowed to continue the diet fast diet every other day. It was suggested&#xD;
           that the daily caloric intake was 600kal/ day for males and 500kal/ day for females.&#xD;

      1. Normal diet: the course of treatment was 4 days. The subjects were asked to record the&#xD;
           daily diet and dietary intake in the daily observation scale (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High control diet intervention: the course of treatment was 31 days. According to the&#xD;
           actual intake of calories, 2 / 3, 1 / 2, 1 / 3 and 1 / 4 of the actual intake of the&#xD;
           subjects were calculated as the light fasting calories. The treatment course of each&#xD;
           calorie stage was 4 days. The subjects recorded the daily diet and dietary intake, and&#xD;
           the nutritionists calculated the daily calorie intake and dietary types of each subject&#xD;
           according to the daily calorie intake of each subject's normal diet. During the period&#xD;
           of high control diet intervention, the diet on the day of light fasting was provided by&#xD;
           the research group. Besides the diet provided by the research group, other foods (except&#xD;
           water without calories) were strictly prohibited on the day of light fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low control diet intervention: the course of treatment was 31 days. It is suggested that&#xD;
           the calorie intake of men and women should be 600 kcal / day and 500 kcal / day on the&#xD;
           day of light fasting. The diet type can refer to the recipe made by the nutritionist.&#xD;
