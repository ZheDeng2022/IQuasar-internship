  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of both cancer and anticancer drugs but the&#xD;
      consequences of such events remain poorly known and are not adressed in both phase III&#xD;
      oncological trials and cardiological guidelines. The objective of this study is to create a&#xD;
      prospective multicenter international registry of adult patients with an active cancer and&#xD;
      experiencing atrial fibrillation to study major cardiovascular events occurrence during a 1&#xD;
      year follow-up.&#xD;
