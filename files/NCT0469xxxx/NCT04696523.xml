      An investigator-initiated clinical drug study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore neuroprotective properties of xenon in patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage (SAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Global fractional anisotropy of white matter of diffusion tensor imaging&#xD;
      (DTI). Hypothesis: White matter damage is less severe in xenon treated patients, i.e. global&#xD;
      fractional anisotropy is significantly higher in the xenon group than in the control group as&#xD;
      assessed with the 1st magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of aSAH and obtaining a signed assent subjects will be randomized to the&#xD;
      following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Standard of Care (SOC) group: Air/oxygen and Normothermia 36.5-37.5°C; Xenon&#xD;
      group: Normothermia 36.5-37.5°C +Xenon inhalation in air/oxygen for 24 hours. Brain magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging techniques will be undertaken to evaluate the effects of the intervention&#xD;
      on white and grey matter damage and neuronal loss. Neurological outcome will be evaluated at&#xD;
      3, 12 and 24 months after onset of aSAH symptoms Investigational drug/treatment, dose and&#xD;
      mode of administration: 50±2 % end tidal concentration of inhaled xenon in oxygen/air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative drug(s)/placebo/treatment, dose and mode of administration: Standard of care&#xD;
      treatment according to local and international consensus reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment: 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data Information that characterizes the participant's condition prior to initiation&#xD;
      of experimental treatment is obtained as soon as is clinically reasonable. These include&#xD;
      participant demographics, medical history, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and concentration&#xD;
      of oxygen administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute data The collected information will contain quantitative and qualitative data of aSAH&#xD;
      patients, as recommended by recent recommendations of the working group on subject&#xD;
      characteristics, and including all relevant Common Data Elements (CDE) can be applied.&#xD;
      Specific definitions, measurements tools, and references regarding each SAH CDE can be found&#xD;
      on the weblink here:&#xD;

      Assessments of efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A brain Computer tomography angiography (CTA) and / or 3 D Digital subtraction&#xD;
           angiography (DSA) (whenever possible instead of 2D DSA) will be performed at hospital&#xD;
           arrival and whenever clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 1st 3 Tesla MRI 72 ± 24 hours after onset of aSAH symptoms; 2nd 3 Tesla MRI 42 ± 4 days&#xD;
           after onset of aSAH symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 3D DSA: Computational fluid dynamic simulations (CFD), artificial intelligence and&#xD;
           machine learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Brain Positron emission tomography (PET): The 1st 4 ± 1 weeks and the 2nd at 3 months&#xD;
           after onset of aSAH symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Biochemical assessment: A blood samples of 20 ml for determination of plasma&#xD;
           catecholamines, plasma metabolomics (see details of metabolomics in section 18.4.7),&#xD;
           cardiac enzyme release (P-hs-troponin-T and heart fatty-acid binding protein), selected&#xD;
           biomarkers will be analysed at intensive crae unit (ICU) arrival and at 24h, at 48h and&#xD;
           at 72h after onset of SAH symptoms. In addition, a sample of spinal fluid will be&#xD;
           collected through external ventricular drainage (EVD) at ICU arrival or as soon as it is&#xD;
           in place and at 24h, at 48h and at 72h after onset of SAH symptoms for assessment of&#xD;
           metabolomics&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Electrocardiograph (ECG) at ICU arrival and at 24h, at 48h and at 72h after onset of&#xD;
           aSAH symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Neurological evaluation: at 3, 12 and at 24 months after aSAH with GOSe, Modified&#xD;
           ranking score (mRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: 1) Basic statistical tests (t-tests, Mann-Whitney, Chi square, etc); 2)&#xD;
      Survival analysis methods; 3) An analysis of variance for repeated measurements; 4) A sample&#xD;
      size of 100 is estimated on the basis of a recent studies in SAH patients to provide 80%&#xD;
      power with a 2-sided α level of 0.05 to detect a mean difference of 0.02 (SD 0.035) in the&#xD;
      global fractional anisotropy of white matter between the xenon group and the control group&#xD;
      (98). Accordingly, this mean difference is estimated to have a predictive value for DCI and&#xD;
      poor neurological outcome (i.e. mRS 3-6).Significance level of 0.05 and an estimation of 95 %&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be used in the statistical analyses.&#xD;
