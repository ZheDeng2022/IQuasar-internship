    <textblock>
      -  Prospective non randomized interventional study on 60 eyes of 40 patients with&#xD;
           previously diagnosed macular edema secondary to type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus and 60&#xD;
           eyes with central retinal vein occlusion will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted from January 2021 to June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For transition to suprachoroidal injection of Triamcinolone Acetone (TAAC) a diagnosis&#xD;
           of resistant DME is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling one or more of the following criteria will be considered to have&#xD;
      resistant diabetic macular edema (DME) after at least 3 consecutive monthly anti vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections in the previous 6 months: central macular&#xD;
      thickness greater than 300 μm by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT),&#xD;
      reduction of retinal thickness by less than 10% of baseline retinal thickness, or suboptimal&#xD;
      visual improvement (failure to gain at least 3 lines on the Snellen chart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects included in the research will undergo the following tests and&#xD;
           investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Visual acuity testing (uncorrected and best corrected).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Intra ocular pressure (IOP) by applanation tonometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Anterior segment examination by slit lamp&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Posterior segment examination by indirect ophthalmoscope and 78 D lens&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Spectral domain Optical coherence tomography (OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Ocular fundus photography and fluorescein angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Previous intraocular surgery (except cataract surgery done more than 6 months&#xD;
                before the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Coincident retinal pathology as choroidal neovascular membrane and age related&#xD;
                macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Previous laser photocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Prior ocular inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The presence of retinal degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Patients who didnot complete 6 months of follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative control of (Diabetes Mellitus)DM is essential before injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informed consent was obtained according to the ethical committee after discussing&#xD;
           extensively with each patient about the benefits, risks and possible side effects of the&#xD;
           procedure .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient was prepared by topical fluoroquinolone eye drops (Moxifloxacin&#xD;
           hydrochloride 0.5% Vigamox ,Alcon, USA) 4 times daily for three days before injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were dilated before suprachoroidal injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide (SCTA)&#xD;
      and indirect ophthalmoscope was placed at hand to examine fundus after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We used 30 gauge 1cc insulin syringe. Other dispensable included 24 gauge intravenous&#xD;
      branula. Needle was withdrawn from branula and branula was cut in such a way that only 1000um&#xD;
      of insulin syringe was exposed from the edge of branula. 0.1 ml (4 mg ) of Triamcinolone&#xD;
      Acetonide (TAAC) will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the injection topical antibiotic drop was applied (Moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%&#xD;
      Vigamox, Alcon, USA) and the eye was patched for several hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery patients were instructed to administer antibiotic drop four times daily for 3&#xD;
      days .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Privacy of the patients must be guaranteed ,the data acquired from the participants will&#xD;
           stay confidential through:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Putting a code number to every patient, with hiding the patient's name.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Photographing faces will not be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The results of the research will be only used in scientific aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any unexpected risks like subconjunctival hemorrhage, syncope, vitreous hemorrhage,&#xD;
           retinal detachment and endophthalmitis appeared during the course of the research will&#xD;
           be cleared to the participants and the ethical committee on time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical care will be carried out to complications like syncope, subconjunctival hemorrhage&#xD;
      and surgical treatment by pars plana vitrectomy will be done in case of occurrence of&#xD;
      vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment or endophthalmitis.&#xD;
