  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, cerebral vasospasm (cVS) is the main cause of delayed cerebral infarction (DCI),&#xD;
      which leads to high disability and mortality rate after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;
      As a consequence, the key of reducing DCI is to prevent cVS. But unfortunately, despite years&#xD;
      of efforts, the prevention and treatment of cVS is still a major clinical dilemma and various&#xD;
      ways of treatment are still being explored. Recent studies have shown that stellate ganglion&#xD;
      block (SGB) can dilate cerebral vessels and alleviate the impact of existing cVS. However,&#xD;
      there is no study to evaluate the effect of early application of SGB on the improvement and&#xD;
      prevention of cVS after aSAH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral vasospasm refers to the extensive segmental or diffuse contraction of cerebral&#xD;
      vasculature after aSAH, and cerebral blood flow is significantly reduced, which can lead to&#xD;
      delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or delayed ischemic neurological dysfunction (DIND). Past&#xD;
      studies have shown that if cerebral vasospasm occurs in patients with aSAH, the proportion of&#xD;
      ischemic brain injury can be as high as 20%-30%.Obviously, prevention and treatment of CVS&#xD;
      are the key to reducing the disability and mortality of aSAH.&#xD;

    <description>After the patient entered the operating room, the average fastest blood flow velocity of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries was measured for the first time, and then an experienced anesthesiologist performed a SGB on the ipsilateral side of the lesion. The dose and concentration of local anesthesia: 0.5% ropivacaine 8-10ml. In order to reduce puncture complications, B-ultrasound visualization technology was used to perform SG block. Criteria for successful block: the patient developed Horner's syndrome, characterized by miosis, ptosis, eyeball caved in, nasal congestion, conjunctival congestion, reddish face and no sweat on the face</description>
