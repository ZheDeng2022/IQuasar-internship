  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer is not usually considered curative. Recent&#xD;
      retrospective studies have demonstrated that resection of the breast tumor in patients with&#xD;
      primary metastatic breast cancer is associated with a significant improvement of the&#xD;
      prognosis. In all these aforementioned studies, the decision to perform surgery could have&#xD;
      been influenced by favorable prognostic factors, such as younger age, the presence of only&#xD;
      one metastatic site, or good response to systemic therapy. To rule out the impact of&#xD;
      potential confounders, most studies adjusted for age, tumor size, number and sites of&#xD;
      metastases and hormone receptor status. In addition, some studies also adjusted for&#xD;
      comorbidity or surgical margins. For example, in the study of Bafford et al., the benefit of&#xD;
      surgery seemed confined to patients operated upon before diagnosis of metastatic disease and&#xD;
      there was no survival advantage in patients who received an operation of the breast tumor&#xD;
      after the diagnosis of the metastatic disease had taken place. This phenomenon was referred&#xD;
      to as the stage migration bias. In a study by Leung et al., the benefit from surgery&#xD;
      disappeared in the multivariate analysis when taking into account the use of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Finally, in a study by Cady et al. coding errors in the retrospectively collected dataset&#xD;
      were found to explain part of the survival advantage. 4Therefore, this randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) has been initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, several retrospective studies noted that 35-60% of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis received local treatment of primary lesions, which&#xD;
      resulted in a positive impact on survival. However, an analysis of 16,023 patients presenting&#xD;
      with stage IV disease and an intact primary tumor compared outcomes between patients having&#xD;
      surgery of the primary tumor to negative margins or no surgery. In a multivariate analysis&#xD;
      adjusting for known prognostic factors, surgery reduced the HR for death to 0.61 (95% CI =&#xD;
      0.58 to 0.65). Multiple other retrospective studies from single institutions, registries, and&#xD;
      population-based cohorts have confirmed this initial observation, but it is uncertain whether&#xD;
      these studies reflect a real benefit for surgery or consistent selection bias. Three&#xD;
      prospective randomized trials are examining the role of surgery in patients presenting with&#xD;
      stage IV disease and an intact primary tumor. While awaiting the results of these trials, it&#xD;
      is not known precisely how or when to integrate such surgical management into a standard&#xD;
      medical therapy for metastatic breast cancer or which patients, in particular, are most&#xD;
      likely to benefit from such treatment. 1 The aim of this study is to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of surgery of the primary tumor in breast cancer patients with distant metastatic disease at&#xD;
      initial diagnosis. According to the controversies in previous studies design of a study with&#xD;
      the least confounding factor to decrease the bias seems to be necessary.&#xD;

      After the diagnosis of primary distant metastatic breast cancer, patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two groups: A. systemic therapy followed by surgery if the disease is not&#xD;
      progressive; B. Systemic therapy Patient selection criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria for the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - primary distant metastatic breast cancer (M1); - an anticipated survival of at least 6&#xD;
      months; - a histologically proven diagnosis of the breast tumor; - a known hormonal and&#xD;
      HER2Neu status; - TNM classification: T1-T3, resectable T4 status, and N0-N3; - performance&#xD;
      status and comorbidity should allow surgery and/or systemic therapy; - age ≥ 18 years;-&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - primary invasive breast cancer in the medical history; - another malignancy within the last&#xD;
      10 years, besides basal cell carcinoma of the skin or early-stage cervical cancer; - surgical&#xD;
      treatment and/or radiotherapy of the breast tumor before randomization; - irresectable T4&#xD;
      breast tumor; - synchronous bilateral breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Centralized randomization will take place immediately after the diagnosis of&#xD;
      primary distant metastatic breast cancer, using computer-generated randomization. dominant&#xD;
      location of distant metastases (bone, soft tissue (lymph nodes and subcutaneous metastases)&#xD;
      and visceral metastases), hormonal receptor status (ER and/ or PR positive or both negative)&#xD;
      and HER2Neu status (overexpression yes or no) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings and location The study is a randomized controlled trial, which will be conducted at&#xD;
      Tehran University of medical sciences, imam Khomeini hospital Treatment options During the&#xD;
      study patients can be treated with surgery of the primary tumor (depending on randomization),&#xD;
      systemic therapy The different treatment modalities are described below. Patients who are&#xD;
      randomized to upfront surgery of the breast tumor will receive a lumpectomy or mastectomy&#xD;
      depending on patient and tumor characteristics. Both types of surgery may be conducted as&#xD;
      long as the intention is complete resection of the primary tumor, which is defined as having&#xD;
      succeeded in obtaining free resection margins for the invasive component. The choice to&#xD;
      perform an axillary lymph node dissection is left to the discretion of the treating physician&#xD;
      but is highly recommended if palpable and/or tumor positive lymph nodes in the axillary&#xD;
      region are present. If patients are randomized for systemic therapy, they may still be&#xD;
      candidates for surgery of the primary tumor. In the case of local progression, breast surgery&#xD;
      is allowed at any time to gain local control. Surgery for this group is primarily indicated&#xD;
      when the treating physician beliefs the tumor may cause wound problems in near future,&#xD;
      despite the use of systemic therapy. Patients will be treated with systemic therapy according&#xD;
      to the guidelines. The choice of initial chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and endocrine therapy&#xD;
      depends-among others-on ER and PR and HER2Neu status, dominant site of distant metastases,&#xD;
      age, performance status, and comorbidity; but may also depend on the chance to reach a&#xD;
      complete remission for example in minimal metastatic disease. In patients with a hormone&#xD;
      receptor-positive tumor, hormonal treatment is indicated. In the case of rapid progression,&#xD;
      chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. In HER2Neu positive disease and the use of an&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor, it is possible to add HER2Neu targeted therapy. Chemotherapy is offered&#xD;
      to patients with hormone receptor-negative status, with extensive and fast-growing visceral&#xD;
      metastases. For this study, we advise using at least an anthracycline, a taxane, and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide for the first 2-3 lines of treatment, if necessary in combination with&#xD;
      targeted therapy, such as HER2- Neu targeted therapy, according to local practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary endpoint is the two-year survival. This is&#xD;
      defined as the percentage of patients who survive two years after randomization. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are quality of life, overall survival, number of unplanned local therapies, i.e.&#xD;
      surgery or radiotherapy, number of axillary lymph node dissections or axillary radiotherapy,&#xD;
      determination of pathological resection margin (margin status) in patients treated by surgery&#xD;
      of the primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Sample size calculation We are planning a randomized controlled trial with an&#xD;
      equal number of patients in both treatment arms, an accrual interval of 36 months. Sample&#xD;
      size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Calculation of the number of events with the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      α=0.05 zα/2= 1.96 β=0.20 Zβ=0.84 π1=π2= 1/2: Equal allocation HR =0.50 Event =66&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step2: Calculation of the number of Patients with the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this step, we assume the 40% of patients will die during the 2-years follow-up of the&#xD;
      study. So the total number of desired patients will be 212. Therefore we need 106 patients in&#xD;
      each group. Considering a 10% loss of patients, we should enter 118 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following calculations were conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period= 2 years Suppose Incidence Rate (IR) = 25 events/person-2 years λt=0.5 at t=&#xD;
      2-year S(t)= exp{-λt}= exp{0.5}=0.60 1-0.60= 0.40 It means 40% of patients will die during 2&#xD;
      years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S1(2)= exp{-0.5}=0.60 S2(2)=exp (-0.5* HR}=0.78 Pr {event} = 1- {(0.60+0.78)/2}=0.31 N=&#xD;
      66/0.31=212 Total number n=106 each group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number after considering 10% loss =118 /group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Investigators will enter the information required by the protocol into the Case&#xD;
      Report Forms (CRFs). The data from all investigators will be pooled and summarized with&#xD;
      respect to demographic and baseline characteristics and efficacy and safety observations.&#xD;
      Data will be presented for the complete intent-to-treat population. The primary endpoint will&#xD;
      be analyzed in a Cox regression model, with the minimization factors as covariables. Interim&#xD;
      analysis&#xD;
