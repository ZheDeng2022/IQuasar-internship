  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study develops and tests an instrument to measure opportunity costs called the Oncology&#xD;
      Opportunity Cost Assessment Tool (OOCAT) in cancer patients. Patients experience significant&#xD;
      costs, both direct financial as well as indirect costs, associated with seeking cancer&#xD;
      treatment. While the direct financial impact of care on patients is receiving increased&#xD;
      attention, other important consequences, such as opportunity cost, remain largely unmeasured.&#xD;
      Opportunity cost is an economics term that refers to the loss of potential benefits from&#xD;
      other options when one option is chosen - if resources are used for one purpose, they are no&#xD;
      longer available for the next best option. The information and knowledge gained from this&#xD;
      study may help researchers develop the OOCAT, which may allow them to understand the&#xD;
      opportunity cost of treatment for each patient. The OOCAT may then be used to determine not&#xD;
      just the best medications for patients, but also the best comprehensive treatment plan that&#xD;
      will allow them to get the right treatment in the right place at the right time.&#xD;
