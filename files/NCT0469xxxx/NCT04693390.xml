  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence delirium (ED) (also called emergence agitation) can be defined as a &quot;dissociated&#xD;
      state of consciousness in which the child is irritable, uncompromising, uncooperative,&#xD;
      incoherent and inconsolable crying, moaning, kicking or thrashing&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) is a routinely performed operation. Emergence&#xD;
      agitation is a frequent phenomenon in children recovering from general anesthesia for&#xD;
      tonsillectomy, and increases risk of self-injury. It's not unusual for the post-anesthesia&#xD;
      care unit (PACU) staff look that a child, who was asleep just minutes before, starts&#xD;
      screaming, pulling out his intravenous line, looks like he's about to fall out of his bed.&#xD;
      This condition requires sedatives that may cause undesirable side effects. The cause of&#xD;
      emergence delirium and the mechanism of agitation following general anesthesia is unknown.&#xD;
      Probably the volatile agents work on some pathways, possibly in the locus coeruleus or&#xD;
      amygdala, in the setting of a specific neurodevelopmental stage of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While emergence delirium can be seen into adulthood, its peak incidence is in younger&#xD;
      children (2-7 years of age). The incidence of ED is unclear: anywhere from 2-80%, but when&#xD;
      confounders like pain, nausea etc. are controlled, the incidence is probably around 20-30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited data suggest that acupuncture may be a safe, nonpharmacological treatment for the&#xD;
      reduction of pain and agitation in term and preterm infants and that may be an alternative&#xD;
      method for preventing ED. In particular a prospective, randomized, double-bind controlled&#xD;
      study demonstrated a reduction of the ED in many surgeries, after the electrical stimulation&#xD;
      of the heart 7 acupuncture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly 400 acupuncture points are known on the body surface and they belong to 14 meridians,&#xD;
      running along the human body. After the needle peeling, the nervous free terminations release&#xD;
      some polypeptid (the most important is the substantia P) and it increases the excitability of&#xD;
      the near nervous free terminations which cause vasodilatation. It has a myorelaxant effect,&#xD;
      decreases the level for pain tolerance and make stronger the inhibitor effect of descendent&#xD;
      fibers, with production of endogenous endorphins. This is the reason why acupuncture is&#xD;
      considered valid in prevention and control of ED.&#xD;

The FLACC tool assesses changes in five categories of behavior (namely: Face, legs, Activity, Crying and Consolability), rating each one on a scale of 0-2. Ten is the maximum score indicating severe pain and a score &lt;2 generally indicates absence of pain. A FLACC score higher than 4 is considered as indicator of moderate pain.</description>
