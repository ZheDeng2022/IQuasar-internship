  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to one out of five patients with breast cancer will develop lymphedema in the upper&#xD;
      extremity after cancer treatment. Patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL)&#xD;
      suffer from pain, heaviness, tightness, and a decreased range of motion. Photobiomodulation&#xD;
      therapy (PBMT) is a non-invasive therapy based on the application of visible and/or&#xD;
      near-infrared light produced by a laser diode or a light-emitting diode. The scientifically&#xD;
      proven biologic effects of PBM are improved wound healing, and a reduction in pain,&#xD;
      inflammation, and oedema. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of PBMT on the management of BCRL.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of PBMT in combination with the&#xD;
      institutional therapy on the management of BCRL. Therefore, we hypothesize that PBMT in&#xD;
      combination with manual lymphatic drainage is able to reduce the limb circumference and the&#xD;
      associated pain and improve the QoL of patients with BCRL during treatment and up to 12&#xD;
      months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 1: Arm circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study seeks primarily to determine the effectiveness PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage&#xD;
      in reducing the arm circumference in patients with established BCRL during PBM treatment and&#xD;
      up to 12 months post-PBMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 2: Activity and participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PBMT and manual&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage in the enhancement of the patients' activity and participation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 1: Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage can reduce&#xD;
      the BCRL-related pain during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 2: Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage can&#xD;
      improve the patients' QoL during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 3: Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage can&#xD;
      improve the patients' mental status during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 4: Patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if patients are satisfied with PBMT and manual&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage as a treatment for BCRL during the treatment sessions and up to 12 months&#xD;
      post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 5: PBM safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of PBM in oncologic patients up to 5&#xD;
      years post-PBMT.&#xD;
