  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Investigator's ongoing studies of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in older&#xD;
      adults, it has been found that older adults with PTSD frequently meet the criteria for&#xD;
      comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Moreover, relative to trauma-exposed healthy&#xD;
      controls (TEHCs), elders with PTSD manifest executive function deficits, fatigability, and&#xD;
      mobility and physical function deficits that are consistent with what the investigator has&#xD;
      observed in depressed older adults. Yet, the investigator has found that very few older&#xD;
      adults with combined PTSD/MDD have received appropriate antidepressant treatment for their&#xD;
      condition. These findings give rise to the questions of (1) how effective is antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment for depressive symptoms in the context of PTSD/MDD and (2) are cognitive and&#xD;
      physical function deficits in PTSD/MDD patients reversible with effective antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic PTSD in older adults leads to increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and ulcerative gastrointestinal disease. PTSD&#xD;
      appears to promote aging-associated syndromes such as frailty, and older patients with PTSD&#xD;
      exhibit faster cognitive decline and have twice the risk of dementia compared to individuals&#xD;
      without PTSD. In addition, laboratory studies report accelerated biological signatures of&#xD;
      aging in PTSD patients, including shortened leukocyte telomere length, increases in&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased oxidative stress. PTSD is associated with similar&#xD;
      anatomical brain changes to those occurring with cognitive aging, including bilateral&#xD;
      hippocampal volume reductions, specifically affecting the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3&#xD;
      subregion, and increased microvascular lesions (white matter hyperintensities [WMH]). These&#xD;
      observations suggest that the adverse health and functional outcomes associated with chronic&#xD;
      PTSD in older patients may be explained by a deleterious interaction between pathophysiologic&#xD;
      changes underlying PTSD and the biology of aging, the end result of which is to accelerate&#xD;
      senescence throughout the body and particularly in the brain. However, no prior study has&#xD;
      explicitly tested this hypothesis by examining indices of aging in older adults with and&#xD;
      without PTSD. In our ongoing IRB #7489, The investigator hypothesize that chronic PTSD, over&#xD;
      and above other contributing factors, accelerates biological aging in the brain and body,&#xD;
      leading to adverse behavioral consequences such as frailty and cognitive decline. To test&#xD;
      these hypotheses, 150 individuals are being recruited who are agedâ‰¥50and diagnosed with PTSD.&#xD;
      A control group of 150 age-, sex-, and trauma exposure-matched subjects without PTSD are&#xD;
      being recruited and assessed. Included subjects undergo comprehensive neuropsychological&#xD;
      assessment and cerebral blood volume functional magnetic resonance imaging (CBV-fMRI) to&#xD;
      assess regional hippocampal metabolic activity and function. Structural MRI is performed to&#xD;
      quantify WMH, regional brain volume, and cortical thickness while resting-state fMRI measures&#xD;
      functional connectivity within hippocampal networks. PTSD subjects and controls are compared&#xD;
      on measures of aging within the following domains: neural (DG CBV, WMH, morphology),&#xD;
      cognitive (processing speed, memory, executive function, pattern separation), somatic&#xD;
      (peripheral inflammatory markers, leukocyte telomere length, and measures of oxidative&#xD;
      stress), and behavioral (grip strength, gait speed, fatigue levels). By elucidating the&#xD;
      interaction of chronic PTSD with aging processes, data from this project may contribute to&#xD;
      the development of rationally designed, personalized, and age-appropriate novel treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analyses of PTSD subjects in this study demonstrate a high degree of comorbidity with&#xD;
      MDD. Among participants with PTSD enrolled to date, 67.1% meet the criteria for MDD and the&#xD;
      mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) is 18.1. The most prominent cognitive&#xD;
      differences observed to date in our study between PTSD and TEHC subjects is executive&#xD;
      dysfunction, which is common in late-life depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD subjects have dramatically increased fatigability and prevalence of frailty criteria&#xD;
      compared to TEHCs, abnormalities which are also frequently seen in our older MDD samples.&#xD;
      Yet, the investigator has found that less than 25% of these individuals are currently&#xD;
      receiving an adequate dose and duration of first-line pharmacotherapy for MDD, while only&#xD;
      one-third report any past medication treatment. These data raise the question of whether&#xD;
      patients with combined PTSD/MDD could benefit from adequate antidepressant medication&#xD;
      treatment and to what degree their cognitive and physical function deficits would be&#xD;
      reversible with this therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Our target is depressive symptomatology as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). The HRSD is a 24-item questionnaire used as an indication of depression and a guide to evaluating recovery. Total scores range from 0-74, not including atypical symptoms sub-scale. A score above 16 is typically considered to indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. Higher scores indicate greater severity.</description>
