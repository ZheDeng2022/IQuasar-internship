      This is a single center, single arm, open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;

      This Phase I study is designed as a pilot trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cell therapy in subjects with refractory and relapsed B-NHL. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -5, -4&#xD;
      and -3 followed by infusion of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells. Safety and efficacy of CD19/CD20&#xD;
      Dual-CAR-T cells therapy will be monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and safety of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells therapy in patients with&#xD;
      refractory and relapsed B-NHL.&#xD;
