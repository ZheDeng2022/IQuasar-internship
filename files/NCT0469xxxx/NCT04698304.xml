      Based on the development of new tools, including drug coated balloon, paclitaxel eluting&#xD;
      stent, interwoven stents, debulking tools, more challenging femoropopliteal arterial lesions&#xD;
      have been treated with endovascular procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TASC D lesion ,especially with popliteal artery involved are often excluded in&#xD;
      prospective clinical trials. Therefore, a well-designed real world study that track clinical&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the TASC II guidelines, TASC D lesions was recommended for primary endovascular&#xD;
      revascularization, TASC C lesions for surgical revascularization in patients with appropriate&#xD;
      perioperative risk and available conduit. However, Based on the development of new tools,&#xD;
      including drug coated balloon, paclitaxel eluting stent, interwoven stents, debulking tools,&#xD;
      more challenging femoropopliteal arterial lesions have been treated with endovascular&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite The shift of Endovascular- first strategy has been documented in recent literature.&#xD;
      There still lack evidence to support either approach have a significant advantage over the&#xD;
      other. And TASC D lesion ,especially with popliteal artery involved are often excluded in&#xD;
      prospective clinical trials. Therefore, a well-designed real world study that track clinical&#xD;
      relevant outcomes, are required to determine the optimal therapies for patients with complex&#xD;
      femoropopliteal lesions.&#xD;

    <description>All the patients are treated by endovascular therapy, through contralateral femoral artery approach, ipsilateral antegrade femoral artery approach or brachial artery approach. If the lesion is difficult to pass in antegrade approach, retrograde puncture at the distal artery of the lesion can be performed. Surgeons can choose treatment methods according to the characteristics of the lesions. For example: (a) Plain old balloon angioplasty; (b) Drug-coated balloon angioplasty; (c) Drug-coated balloon angioplasty + provisional stenting; (d) Bare-metal stent implantation; (e) Stent graft implantation; (f) Directional atherectomy + drug-coated balloon angioplasty, (g) Drug -eluting stent.</description>
