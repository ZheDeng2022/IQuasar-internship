  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is an increasingly prevalent condition among futsal athletes.&#xD;
      Mobilization with Movement (MWM) is a conservative rehabilitation strategy commonly used in&#xD;
      this condition. Even so, the effects of two MWM dorsiflexion techniques on sports performance&#xD;
      are not known. The aim is to analyze the immediate effect of two MWM techniques on the&#xD;
      dorsiflexion range of motion, the dynamic balance and the performance variables in futsal&#xD;
      athletes with CAI. Also, to analyze the impact of performing them in a different order.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Receiving concurrent physiotherapy treatment in the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
