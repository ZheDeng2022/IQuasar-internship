  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, multi-center, open label Phase Ib/II trial in adult patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)(Stage II-IV). The Diagnosis of MCL (Stage II, III, IV)&#xD;
      is supported by histology and over expression of cyclin D1 or by FISH (fluorescent in situ&#xD;
      hybridization). In the proposed study, the primary endpoint is to estimate the biological&#xD;
      response rate of the combination of Umbralisib at dose 800 mg with Ublituximab&#xD;
      (900mg)-Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine and Prednisone (CHOP), but a phase Ib&#xD;
      portion with dose de-escalation at two does level (800 and 600 mg) will be built in to&#xD;
      further confirm its safety and tolerability. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis in 3-week (21 day) cycles. Once Umbralisib dose is defined in phase Ib, the study will&#xD;
      expand to phase II portion after SMC/DSMB (Safety monitoring committee/Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee) agreement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive and incurable hematologic malignancy with&#xD;
      incidence of MCL increases with age (average age is 68 years) and is more common in males.&#xD;
      Majority of the patients presents with advanced systemic and symptomatic disease requiring&#xD;
      aggressive chemotherapy. Although some patients with MCL can have indolent course, majority&#xD;
      of them pursue an aggressive course. Most patients with MCL presents with non-bulky&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy and advanced stage with frequent extra-nodal involvement. In general, MCL&#xD;
      carries an aggressive course with very poor outcome. MCL has wide spectrum of clinical&#xD;
      presentation ranging from indolent disease to symptomatic aggressive disease. The initial&#xD;
      treatment of MCL depends on many disease and patient related factors. Advanced, biologically&#xD;
      aggressive ( by histology markers) disease in a young and fit patient needs&#xD;
      aggressive/intense induction, Autologus stem cell transplant (ASCT) consolidation and&#xD;
      maintenance treatment. While unfit patient usually is offered less intense treatment followed&#xD;
      by maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational drugs ublituximab &amp; umbralisib are highly active in various B cell lymphomas.&#xD;
      Umbralisib is a highly-specific and orally available dual inhibitor of&#xD;
      phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) delta (δ) and casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε) with nanomolar&#xD;
      inhibitory potency, and high selectivity over the alpha, beta, and gamma Class I isoforms of&#xD;
      PI3K. The PI3Ks are a family of enzymes involved in various cellular functions, including&#xD;
      cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, intracellular trafficking and&#xD;
      immunity. The delta isoform of PI3K is highly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, and&#xD;
      strongly upregulated, and often mutated in various hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ublituximab is a novel third generation chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody bioengineered&#xD;
      for potent activity, exhibiting a unique glycosylation profile with a low fucose content,&#xD;
      designed to induce superior antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). Ublituximab exhibits&#xD;
      competitive complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), on par with rituximab, and has also been&#xD;
      demonstrated to induce programmed cell death (PCD) upon binding to the CD20 antigen on&#xD;
      B-lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Clinical Development Of Ublituximab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antitumor effect of ublituximab was compared to that of rituximab with chemotherapy in&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) xenograft murine models. Single&#xD;
      agent ublituximab demonstrated dose-related anti-tumor activity with 100% tumor growth&#xD;
      inhibition in the FL xenograft at a dose of 100mg/kg, and a superior tumor growth delay (21&#xD;
      days) compared to rituximab. Ublituximab also demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      compared to rituximab against MCL xenografts at all dose levels (Esteves IT, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ublituximab in Combination with Umbralisib :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Ublituximab and Umbralisib is being evaluated in various clinical trials.&#xD;
      The preliminary data suggests that the combination is safe and well tolerated. Results of a&#xD;
      Phase I/Ib study of the combination of ublituximab + umbralisib (U2) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma(NHL) and Chronic lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL) have&#xD;
      been reported. Overall, results from this study suggest that the U2 regimen is well tolerated&#xD;
      and active in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Single arm, multi-center, open label Phase II trial with safety lead in Adult&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)(Stage II-IV). MCL majority, is an&#xD;
      aggressive and incurable lymphoma. As it is the lymphoma of elderly, aggressive treatment&#xD;
      approaches like aggressive induction treatments and ASCT may be more risky in this&#xD;
      population. Majority of these patients are treated with less intense approach like&#xD;
      Rituximab-Bendamustine (BR), R-CHOP or VR-CAP. Nearly all the patients are treated with&#xD;
      Rituximab maintenance after these induction approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will explore combination of novel CD20 monoclonal antibody (Ublituximab)&#xD;
      with CHOP and a novel highly active PI3K inhibitor (Umbralisib) in ASCT ineligible untreated&#xD;
      advanced MCL. Umbralisib is highly active in various B cell lymphomas. The combination of&#xD;
      Ublituximab and Umbralisib is being evaluated in two signature clinical trials. The&#xD;
      preliminary data suggests that the combination is safe and well tolerated. To improve upon&#xD;
      the back bone of R-CHOP, we want to explore U2-CHOP (Ublituximab with Umbralixib)-CHOP&#xD;
      followed by U2 maintenance in ASCT in eligible patients. Both the study agents (U2) are&#xD;
      highly active in lymphomas. Study hypothesis is to improve rates of complete response at the&#xD;
      end of induction treatment with this novel combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of Umbralisib and Ublituximab in combination with CHOP&#xD;
           chemotherapy for newly diagnosed MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of U2-CHOP in terms of Complete Response rates (CRR) in&#xD;
           patients with untreated MCL after induction phase (6 cycles of U2-CHOP) by PET/CT&#xD;
           response assessment criteria by Cheson 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the toxicity profile of U2-CHOP induction followed by U2 maintenance in&#xD;
           newly diagnosed Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine rates of Overall response rate, disease control rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival and progression free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rates at the end of induction&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
