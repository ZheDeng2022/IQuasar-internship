  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of educational information, with and without&#xD;
      a general practitioner recommendation to exercise, on willingness to undertake&#xD;
      exercise/physical activity for knee osteoarthritis. Eligible participants will be aged 45+&#xD;
      years and will not currently have osteoarthritis, knee pain, or any condition that makes them&#xD;
      unable to exercise. Participants will be asked to complete an online survey, during which&#xD;
      they will be randomised to one of three groups and shown different types of educational&#xD;
      information to read. Outcome measures will be collected as part of the survey before and&#xD;
      after participants read the educational information presented to them.&#xD;

      3-arm superiority online randomised controlled trial (delivered within one survey).&#xD;
      Participants will complete an online survey, during which they will be presented with a&#xD;
      hypothetical scenario asking them to imagine that they had recently developed knee pain and&#xD;
      have gone to see their general practitioner. Participants will then be randomised to one of 3&#xD;
      different groups (described below). Each group will be shown different types of educational&#xD;
      material and asked to read the information carefully. Once they have finished reading the&#xD;
      material, they will be asked to complete follow-up outcome measures to determine whether&#xD;
      their beliefs about osteoarthritis management strategies have changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 trial groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Control group: asked to read a single-A4 page of brief osteoarthritis information (&quot;what&#xD;
      is osteoarthritis&quot;); II. Treatment options group: asked to read brief osteoarthritis&#xD;
      information + two A4 pages of information on treatment options (&quot;osteoarthritis treatment&#xD;
      options&quot;), and; III. Treatment options + recommendation group: asked to read brief&#xD;
      osteoarthritis information + information on treatment options + receive a hypothetical GP&#xD;
      recommendation for exercise&#xD;
