  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a wide range of physiological and&#xD;
      neuropsychological symptoms. Over 75% of MS patients complain about fatigue, which for many&#xD;
      is one of their most debilitating symptoms, having a substantial impact on their quality of&#xD;
      life and ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Previous investigations on the effectiveness&#xD;
      of different types of psychotherapy on MS fatigue are extremely limited. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to investigate the added value of cognition-targeted exercise versus&#xD;
      symptom-targeted exercise for Multiple Sclerosis fatigue&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with fatigue symptoms (score of â‰¥5 on Fatigue Scale) will be randomly assigned into&#xD;
      experimental (n=30) and control (n=30) groups. The subjects in the experimental group will&#xD;
      receive eight 50-minute sessions of weekly cognitive behavior therapy based on van Kessel's&#xD;
      model in addition cognition-targeted exercise program , whereas the patients in the control&#xD;
      group will receive eight 50-minute sessions of weekly CBT in addition to standardized&#xD;
      physiotherapy program . A standardized program of physiotherapy exercises will consist of&#xD;
      twice-weekly supervised general aerobic, strengthening and flexibility exercise sessions.&#xD;
      This exercise program is reflective of the general exercises typically undertaken within&#xD;
      routine clinical practice.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Modified Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment , at 4-week,and after three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale is a modified form of the Fatigue Impact Scale based on items derived from interviews with MS patients concerning how fatigue impacts their lives. Items on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale are aggregated into three subscales (physical, cognitive, and psychosocial), as well as into a total Modified Fatigue Impact Scale score. All items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a person's activities.</description>

    <time_frame>pre-treatment , at 4-week,and after three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Work and Social Adjustment Scale , which assessed fatigue-related impairment in relation to a number of areas of the person's life. The maximum score is 40 .lower score is better</description>

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment , at 4-week,and after three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , a commonly used self-report instrument for detecting states of depression and anxiety in patients with medical illnesses. scores of less than 7 indicate non-cases and high scores indicate more anxiety and depression</description>

    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment , at 4-week,and after three months</time_frame>
    <description>the Perceived Stress Scale will be included to assess whether the degree to which patients appraised situations in their lives as stressful changed after the intervention. Individual scores on the Perceived Stress Scale can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.</description>

    <description>The patients in this group will receive cognitive behavior therapy in addition to cognition-targeted exercise .&#xD;
Cognitive behavior therapy will be designed on the basis of van Kessel's model . The main objective of this treatment will be challenging all external factors (e.g. behavioral, cognitive, and affective factors) envisioned to play a role in the development and persistence of fatigue in MS patients. The treatment sessions will be directed individually.&#xD;
For Cognition- targeted exercise , all standardized physical therapy exercises will be performed in a time-contingent rather than in a symptom-contingent way .</description>

    <description>All Standardized physical therapy exercises will be performed in a time-contingent .&#xD;
Goal setting is essentially done together with the patient, focussing on functionality instead of fatigue relief. Progression to a next level of (more difficult) exercises will be preceded by an intermediate phase of motor imagery.&#xD;
The treating physical therapist will be advised to address patients' cognitions about their problems during the cognition-targeted exercise training, so that patients will have positive perceptions regarding their illness and treatment outcome.&#xD;
The treating physical therapist will be advised to discuss the patient's perceptions about each exercise. This include discussion of the anticipated consequences of the exercises and challenging the patient's cognitions in relation to the exercises</description>

The third and fourth sessions will be devoted on the introduction of behavioral strategies. The fifth session will introduce cognitive strategies to decrease fatigue.
