  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In intensive care units (ICU), critically ill patients require various venous access devices&#xD;
      for fluid resuscitation, drug therapy, or renal replacement therapy (RRT). These include&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVC), specialized venous ports like central venous&#xD;
      catheters (CVCs), and hemodialysis ports. The investigators plan to do this pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention study to know the effect of intensive training and education of HCW&#xD;
      (doctors and nurses) on the condition of venous access devices in critically ill patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1, pre-intervention: The first twelve weeks will include 25 random visits to main ICU&#xD;
      and point observations of all venous access devices under parameters like condition of&#xD;
      dressing, connectors and documentation. This will also include the comparison of incidence of&#xD;
      CLABSI in the pre and post intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2, intervention: Next four weeks will be an intervention in the form of intensive&#xD;
      training and education of the HCW (doctors and nurses). The intensive training will be in the&#xD;
      form of an online presentation in which the investigators would have videos on care and&#xD;
      maintenance of venous access devices, and the importance of documentation of days of&#xD;
      insertion and change of dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3, post-intervention: Another twelve weeks, post-intervention, again 25 random visits&#xD;
      will be done to collect point observations about the same parameters of venous access devices&#xD;
      and documentation as done in phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Each of these point observation parameters (for central or peripheral&#xD;
      venous access) will be finally categorized as appropriate/inappropriate as per guidelines for&#xD;
      best practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compiled data from pre and post intervention phases would be compared. All the&#xD;
      categorical parameters (appropriate/inappropriate) will be compared using chi-square test.&#xD;
      All the quantitative parameters (e.g. incidence of CLABSI) will be compared using a paired&#xD;
      t-test&#xD;
