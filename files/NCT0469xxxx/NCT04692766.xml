    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of RPH-104 Treatment in&#xD;
      patients in comparison to placebo with Idiopathic Recurrent Pericarditis&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The study will include the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. screening period (up to 4 weeks); During the screening period, the patients' eligibility&#xD;
           for the study will be evaluated based on the inclusion/non-inclusion criteria. Those&#xD;
           patients who are considered eligible for participation in the study will be enrolled in&#xD;
           the run-in treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. run-in treatment period (12 weeks, Days 0-84 - for the patients receiving NSAIDs and/or&#xD;
           colchicine as the therapy for recurrent pericarditis (underlying disease), or 24 weeks,&#xD;
           Days 0-168 - for the patients receiving CSs) will include open-label treatment with&#xD;
           RPH-104 80 mg SC once in two weeks for all patients, the procedures of efficacy and&#xD;
           safety monitoring;&#xD;
&#xD;
           The response to therapy during the run-in treatment period is defined as resolution of&#xD;
           the recurrence observed at the moment of patients' enrolment to the study, absence of&#xD;
           any new recurrence of pericarditis in patients who were enrolled in the study with signs&#xD;
           of pericarditis recurrence, absence of any new recurrence of pericarditis in patients&#xD;
           who were enrolled without signs of a recurrence. In case there is no response to therapy&#xD;
           by Day 14 of the study and later on during the run-in treatment period, RPH-104 will be&#xD;
           discontinued and treatment with other drugs at the discretion of the Investigator&#xD;
           initiated. The patients who demonstrate response to therapy with RPH-104 during the&#xD;
           run-in treatment period, will be transferred to the randomized withdrawal period&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. randomized withdrawal period (24 weeks: Day 0 since the randomization - Day 168 since&#xD;
           the randomization) includes treatment with RPH-104 or placebo depending on the&#xD;
           randomization group (1:1 ratio) once in 2 weeks and the efficacy and safety monitoring&#xD;
           procedures; Patients will be receiving therapy for a period of 24 weeks: the study drug&#xD;
           group (to receive RPH-104 80 mg SC) or placebo group (to receive an equivalent volume of&#xD;
           placebo SC).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In case of pericarditis recurrence during the randomized withdrawal period (assessed as&#xD;
           the lack of response), the treatment group will be unblinded. Patients from the placebo&#xD;
           group will be prescribed open-label therapy with RPH-104 80 mg in SC injections once in&#xD;
           two weeks; assessment of response to therapy will be conducted 14 days after the&#xD;
           switching to the study drug, and every 4 weeks thereafter until the end of the treatment&#xD;
           period in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients from the RPH-104 group (as well as patients from the placebo group who were&#xD;
           switched to the study drug therapy due to a disease recurrence, those in whom the&#xD;
           recurrence did not resolve within 14 days, or patients who developed a new recurrence&#xD;
           after the resolution of the previous one) will be switched to treatment with other drugs&#xD;
           at the discretion of the Investigator; these patients will have to come to a follow-up&#xD;
           safety visit in 2 and 8 weeks after the administration of the last dose of the study&#xD;
           drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, after the end of randomized withdrawal period, the patients who responded to&#xD;
           therapy with RPH-104 will be asked to transfer to the open-label study to evaluate the&#xD;
           long-term safety and efficacy of RPH-104. Non-responders, as well as patients who do not&#xD;
           agree to participate in the open-label study of safety and efficacy, have to come to&#xD;
           follow-up safety visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. safety follow-up period includes monitoring of safety for 8 weeks after the last dosing&#xD;
           of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the maximum duration of treatment in this study will be 36 weeks (for patients who were&#xD;
      receiving NSAIDs and/or colchicine at the study enrollment) and 48 weeks (as a monotherapy or&#xD;
      in combination with NSAIDs and/or colchicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total maximal duration of the study will be approximately 60 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis are planned to be randomized&#xD;
      into the study. Taking into account potential dropouts during the screening and therun-in&#xD;
      treatment period, the number of screened patients (signing the Informed Consent Form) can be&#xD;
      as large as 25.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For patients demonstrating signs of disease recurrence - stable therapy(i.e. constant&#xD;
             doses and dosing regimen) with NSAIDs/CSs for at least 3 days and/or colchicine for at&#xD;
             least 7 days prior to the screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients without signs of disease recurrence - continuous therapy with&#xD;

             ability to become pregnant)) to use highly effective contraceptive methods throughout&#xD;
             the study, starting from the beginning of the screening (signing of the Informed&#xD;
             Consent Form) and for at least 8 weeks after discontinuation of the study drug; and&#xD;

&#xD;
        Highly effective methods of contraception include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;

             months prior to the initiation of the study treatment; b) placement of an intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); c) barrier methods of contraception: a&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to the study drug (RPH-104), and/or its components/excipients and/or&#xD;
