  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current methods for assessing circadian timing require sampling over hours (or even up to a&#xD;
      day) while the patient is in controlled conditions. The investigators aim to develop a method&#xD;
      that can estimate individual circadian time with a single blood sample taken at any time of&#xD;
      the day or night. To do this, the investigators will use two state of the art methods, a&#xD;
      plasma proteomics-based method to identify a panel of rhythmic proteins (extending our&#xD;
      preliminary data) and a whole blood-derived monocyte-based method using a panel of 15&#xD;
      transcripts (to validate and extend a recent study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test both methods in a series of patients with circadian rhythm sleep disorders. We&#xD;
      will validate separately the proteomics-based biomarker and the monocyte-based transcript&#xD;
      biomarker, and also explore whether combining them can improve the accuracy of our timing&#xD;
      estimates. In all cases, circadian phase estimates from the biomarker panels will be compared&#xD;
      with those derived from plasma or saliva melatonin (the current &quot;gold-standard&quot; circadian&#xD;
      phase marker).&#xD;

      Adults who meet ICSD-3 criteria for Advanced Sleep Wake Phase Disorder or Delayed Sleep Wake&#xD;
      Phase Disorder will be studied at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Stanford University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outpatient protocol will consist of two segments: clinic visit and in-home saliva sample&#xD;
      collection. For the first segment, the patient participant will be scheduled for a daytime&#xD;
      visit to the sleep clinic where they will have blood drawn for protein and monocyte analysis&#xD;
      after having kept a sleep diary and worn a wrist activity monitor for at least 1 week. The&#xD;
      patient participant will be provided with an at-home saliva sampling kit and instructed in&#xD;
      its use, in particular how to maintain appropriate dim light conditions. For the second&#xD;
      segment, the patient will be instructed to collect the series of saliva samples on that same&#xD;
      evening, collecting a saliva sample each hour beginning 7 hours before their usual bedtime&#xD;
      and ending one hour after their usual bedtime. As each sample is collected, the patient&#xD;
      participant will document the tube number and clock time on a log that the investigators&#xD;
      provide them, and the patient participant will store each sample in a zip lock bag in their&#xD;
      home freezer until the next day. After waking the next day, the patient will pack their&#xD;
      samples in the insulated shipping box they were provided, along with their sample collection&#xD;
      log and freezer packs they were provided, and then they call a courier to pick up the box,&#xD;
      which is sent directly to the assay facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, patients may be given the opportunity to come for a single extended visit at&#xD;
      the laboratory or clinic. This visit will include the blood sampling for protein and monocyte&#xD;
      analysis, followed by 8 hours in which they remain in dim lighting conditions in the lab or&#xD;
      clinic and provide a saliva sample each hour. The saliva sampling segment will begin 7 hours&#xD;
      before their usual bedtime and ending one hour after their usual bedtime. After the final&#xD;
      saliva sample the study will be over and the patient will be allowed to go home.&#xD;
