  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to directly characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of&#xD;
      plazomicin following administration of a single oral dose before and after IHD in subjects&#xD;
      with ESRD. This PK assessment will be used to provide appropriate plazomicin dosing&#xD;
      recommendations for patients with ESRD receiving IHD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the PK of a&#xD;
      single dose of plazomicin (30-minute IV infusion at 2.5 mg/kg) when administered prior to and&#xD;
      after IHD in subjects with ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days and two treatment periods, with&#xD;
      at least a 7-day washout between dosing in each treatment period. The start of the study is&#xD;
      defined as the date that the first subject is screened following signing of an informed&#xD;
      consent form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Period 1 (Week 1), the dosing day will be concomitant with the 3rd weekly IHD session,&#xD;
      which must be at least 72 hours before the 1st weekly IHD session of the subsequent Week. All&#xD;
      subjects will receive a single dose of plazomicin (30 minute IV infusion at 2.5 mg/kg) within&#xD;
      1 hour after IHD is completed. PK samples will be collected at specified time points from 0.6&#xD;
      hours to 72 hours after completion of the plazomicin infusion. Collection of all PK samples&#xD;
      must be completed prior to the next scheduled IHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Period 2 (Week 2), the dosing day will occur on the day of the 3rd weekly IHD session,&#xD;
      which must be at least 7 days after the first dose and at least 72 hours before the 1st&#xD;
      weekly IHD session of the subsequent Week. All subjects will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      plazomicin (30 minute IV infusion at 2.5 mg/kg) before IHD is started. The plazomicin&#xD;
      infusion should be completed within 30 minutes of IHD initiation. During IHD, the total&#xD;
      dialysate will be collected in a large collection container and pooled at 1-hour intervals&#xD;
      (0-1, 1-2, 2-3, etc. for the duration of the IHD session). From each hourly interval&#xD;
      (including any partial interval at end of dialysis), an aliquot sample of dialysate will be&#xD;
      collected for PK analysis. PK samples will be collected at specified time points from 0.6&#xD;
      hours to 72 hours after completion of the plazomicin infusion. Collection of all PK samples&#xD;
      must be completed prior to the next scheduled IHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include physical examination findings, vital signs (blood pressure,&#xD;
      pulse rate, respiration rate, and oral temperature), clinical laboratory evaluations, and&#xD;
      monitoring of adverse events (AEs). Adverse events will be assessed from the time the subject&#xD;
      signs the ICF until exit from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site will attempt to contact all subjects (including subjects who terminate the study&#xD;
      early) via phone call approximately 14 days after the last dose of study drug to determine if&#xD;
      any AE has occurred since the last study visit. Subjects reporting AEs may be asked to return&#xD;
      to the site for further assessment.&#xD;
