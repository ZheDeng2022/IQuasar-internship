      TakoTsubo Syndrome (TTS) constitutes an increasingly recognised, heterogenous clinical entity&#xD;
      which is associated with considerable short-term mortality. In addition, emerging evidence&#xD;
      suggests that, in the long term, TTS can induce the expression of a phenotype similar to&#xD;
      HFpEF . Apart from the typical (apical left ventricular) type, the current TTS definition has&#xD;
      been expanded to also include the mid-ventricular, the basal and the focal type. Several&#xD;
      previous studies on the typical form of the syndrome demonstrated that the principal&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology is sympathetic overactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The aim of this study is to investigate the potential association between the&#xD;
      sympathetic tone and the acute phase clinical features of TTS. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      aim at exploring possible correlations between the sympathetic tone activity and the&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction, a reported complication occurring one year after the acute phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study enrolling patients aged 18-85 years who fulfill the&#xD;
      InterTaK diagnostic criteria and whose CMR within 14 days of the onset is not suggestive of&#xD;
      an alternative diagnosis. All patients will be treated on individual basis according to the&#xD;
      recent expert consensus statement for TTS. During the baseline evaluation the sympathetic&#xD;
      tone will be assessed by means of Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity study (MSNA), heart rate&#xD;
      and blood pressure variability parameters. Additionally, in a subgroup of participants&#xD;
      sympathetic activity and cardiac sympathetic enervation will be evaluated with radioactive&#xD;
      Iodine Metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy (mIBG). Sequential echocardiography and CMR&#xD;
      indices will be used for heart function and geometry assessment. The investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the correlation between the sympathetic tone and the severity of cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction (systolic and diastolic) during the acute phase. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      will examine differences of the sympathetic tone effect in association with the localisation&#xD;
      of the wall motion abnormality. Stress levels and quality of life will be assessed with&#xD;
      respective validated questionnaires. The participants will be followed-up with quarterly&#xD;
      clinic reviews for 12 months after the acute event. Baseline measurements will be repeated at&#xD;
      the end of the follow-up period. Ethics approval has been obtained from the hospital ethical&#xD;
      committee board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results are expected to determine the role of the sympathetic tone on the extend,&#xD;
      the severity and the localisation of cardiac dysfunction during the acute phase. They are&#xD;
      also expected to demonstrate the role of the sympathetic tone on the long-lasting disorder&#xD;
      that persists for months following the acute event.&#xD;

      TakoTsubo syndrome is the acute cardiac disorder which mimics an acute coronary syndrome and&#xD;
      presents with signs of acute heart failure. It refers to a reversible regional dysfunction of&#xD;
      the left ventricular contractility which cannot be attributed to coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance is generally recommended as superior to echocardiography as the&#xD;
      method to differentiate subjects with myocarditis or subendocardial infarction, but also to&#xD;
      detect limited areas of reduced contractility and intracardiac thrombi. Usually, the&#xD;
      condition follows an intense stressful event (physical condition or emotional distress). The&#xD;
      affected area is usually regional, however cases of focal or global dysfunction of the left&#xD;
      ventricle as well as others with right heart involvement have been also described. To date,&#xD;
      many potential pathophysiologic processes have been suggested. These are the epicardial&#xD;
      spasm, the self-limited acute myocardial infarction, the coronary microcirculatory&#xD;
      dysfunction, the left ventricular outflow obstruction and the direct toxicity of the&#xD;
      circulating catecholamines. Despite the comprehensive study of this entity during the last&#xD;
      three decades, none of the aforementioned mechanisms has been adequately validated. On the&#xD;
      other hand, there is increasing evidence regarding the leading role of the sympathetic tone&#xD;
      as a main contributor. This has been shown in studies with 123mIBG which demonstrate that&#xD;
      during the subacute phase of the syndrome the regional sympathetic enervation appears to be&#xD;
      dysfunctional and improves after the recovery of the left ventricular systolic function. On&#xD;
      the contrary, the sympathetic tone appears to be increased during the acute phase. There are&#xD;
      no data available regarding the sympathetic innervation later than the period of three months&#xD;
      from the episode. The MSNA, despite being a useful method to evaluate the sympathetic tone,&#xD;
      has been used in TakoTsubo syndrome published series only twice. The available results are&#xD;
      conflicting as there was a group of patients whose estimated sympathetic tone, being&#xD;
      evaluated with MSNA appeared to be lower during the subacute phase compared with the follow -&#xD;
      up period after the systolic recovery of the left ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some years ago, despite its initial severity on presentation, the syndrome was regarded as&#xD;
      having a benign course. New data, support that Takotsubo syndrome is accompanied by&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality. Its incidence is estimated at around 2% of the acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes. It is exceptionally high in post-menopausal women. The available data&#xD;
      support that short-term mortality ranges around 4-6% and is comparable to the one of the&#xD;
      acute coronary syndromes. The disappointing short-term prognosis reflects the increased&#xD;
      epidemiological data of in-hospital morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the International Takotsubo Registry, the men to women ratio is 9:1. The two&#xD;
      genders share similar clinical and demographic characteristics, however in men, the stressful&#xD;
      preceded event is more often physical but in women emotional. Typically, Takotsubo patients&#xD;
      compared with others suffering from acute coronary syndromes suffer more frequently from&#xD;
      depression and anxious disorder. Of great interest are the results which refer to the&#xD;
      long-term morbidity. In detail, there are data for patients one year after the episode of&#xD;
      Takotsubo syndrome who despite the left ventricular systolic recovery, express symptoms,&#xD;
      functional status and laboratory results compatible with cardiac dysfunction. These findings&#xD;
      are accompanied by increased myocardial fibrosis measured in CMR studies and abnormal&#xD;
      metabolic function shown in cardiac magnetic spectroscopy. Moreover, it is suggested that the&#xD;
      remaining diastolic dysfunction predisposes to worse outcomes. In general, Takotsubo syndrome&#xD;
      is exceptionally heterogenous in terms of clinical expression and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study The main target of this study is to evaluate the sympathetic tone in&#xD;
      patients with Takotsubo syndrome and particularly its potential prognostic value regarding&#xD;
      its clinical severity on admission but also the left ventricular remodeling (structural and&#xD;
      functional) one year after the event. It will be the first registry held in Greece and will&#xD;
      try to re-evaluate the value of MSNA as a way to estimate the sympathetic tone in this&#xD;
      population. Moreover, the sympathetic tone and sympathetic innervation integrity will be&#xD;
      evaluated in patients with other than the typical - apical form of the syndrome according to&#xD;
      the recent classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a prospective, non-interventional observational study which will enroll&#xD;
      patients 18-85-year-old, who fulfil the InterTAK diagnostic criteria. The diagnosis will be&#xD;
      confirmed with CMR and ECHO which will show the LV systolic recovery. The sympathetic tone&#xD;
      will be assessed with heart rate and blood pressure variability, MSNA and 123mIBG. Baseline&#xD;
      measurements will be done during a 14-day interval from the acute onset. These will be&#xD;
      repeated one year after the event. Signed consent form will be obtained and cases that the&#xD;
      symptoms were attributed to myocarditis or subendocardial infarction (CMR result) will be&#xD;
      excluded. Patients with severe chronic kidney disease (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min), severe valvular&#xD;
      disease, contraindication to perform any of the aforementioned measurements, chronic atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, permanent pacing, autonomic failure, pregnant or breastfeeding women,&#xD;
      psychiatric disease which does not allow adequate co-operation or patients with life&#xD;
      expectancy less than a year will not be enrolled. The enrolled cases will be followed up for&#xD;
      one year. Data will be collected in a specific form (CRF). These include demographic and&#xD;
      somatometric data, past medical history, hemodynamics and sympathetic tone measurements. In&#xD;
      detail, the following parameters will be measured. Gender, height, body weight, waist - hip&#xD;
      and neck circumference, stress levels (validated questionnaire), tobacco exposure, history of&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, family history of cardiovascular disease. Additionally,&#xD;
      the investigators will collect information about the concomitant coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, peripheral artery&#xD;
      disease, sleep apnea, stroke. Moreover, vital signs on admission, ECG findings, ECHO results&#xD;
      on admission, cath lab results and laboratory results (estimated renal function, lipids,&#xD;
      serum glucose levels, uric acid levels, liver function tests, thyroid function tests,&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia biomarkers, natriuretic peptids and inflammatory markers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sympathetic tone estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Î. MSNA. After patient's stabilization the test will be performed and the derived data will&#xD;
      be the number of bursts per min and the average bursts per 100 beats. The test will be&#xD;
      repeated one year after the acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. 123 MIBG. Lugol solution will be administered prior to the scan for thyroid protection.&#xD;
      After the MIBG administration planar view will be obtained at 15-20 min and this will be&#xD;
      repeated 4 hours later together with tomographic scan with Î³ camera. The measured parameters&#xD;
      will be the early and late heart to mediastinum ratio and the washout ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure monitoring. Heart rate variability will be&#xD;
      analyzed via Kubios software for linear parametric characterization of short-term and&#xD;
      long-term heart rate variability. Blood pressure short-term variability will be expressed as&#xD;
      SD, wSD, ARV, CV, tame rate of BP variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The left ventricle geometry and function will be assessed with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. CMR (pre enrollment and one year after the episode). LV, RV: ESV, EDV, RWMA, atrial&#xD;
      volumes, tissue tracking: GLS, RS. T2W-Triple IR/STIR, early and late gadolinium enhancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. ECHO (acute phase of Takotsubo syndrome, one year after the event). LVEF, E, A, E', A', LA&#xD;
      vol, GLS&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data analysis, SPSS 24.0 software will be used. Continuous parametric data will be&#xD;
      expressed as mean and SD. For categoric parametric data results will be presented in means of&#xD;
      frequency and percentage. Comparisons between categoric parameters will be done with test x2.&#xD;
      Comparisons between the mean values for continuous parameters with normal distribution will&#xD;
      be done via unpaired student's test. Comparisons between categoric parameters will be done&#xD;
      with Mann Whitney U test. Normal distribution will be checked with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;
      Correlation analysis will be done via Pearson Phi coefficient or Spearman Rho. Statistically&#xD;
      significant will be differences with p value &lt; 0.05. Evaluation of correlations between&#xD;
      selected variables and cardiovascular events and mortality will be via Kaplan Maier curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study limitations Sympathetic tone evaluation is not feasible during the hyper-acute phase of&#xD;
      the syndrome. Systolic and diastolic function of left ventricle prior to the event will not&#xD;
      always be available for comparison. Patients with severe comorbidities will probably not be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study as it will be difficult to perform the necessary testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated research outcome The present study estimates to include patients who express apart&#xD;
      from the typical - apical form of the syndrome, as described in previous diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      (revised Mayo) patients with basal, mid-ventricular and focal distribution of the systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction of the left ventricle. It is interesting to investigate whether the currently&#xD;
      available data regarding the sympathetic tone and the typical form of the syndrome apply for&#xD;
      the atypical forms. As for the MSNA method, the investigators estimate to re-evaluate it as a&#xD;
      means for sympathetic tone evaluation in takotsubo patients but also its potential prognostic&#xD;
      value for the severity of syndrome on presentation and long-term morbidity. Regarding the&#xD;
      MIBG scan, the investigators expect to reevaluate its value as an index of topical&#xD;
      innervation integrity in patients who fulfil the new diagnostic criteria. Moreover, to test&#xD;
      whether the hypokinetic area is related with impaired innervation during the subacute phase&#xD;
      and permanent changes as expressed with fibrosis in CMR one year after the event.&#xD;
