      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of APX3330 to improve Early Treatment&#xD;
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Score (DRSS) in one hundred&#xD;
      (100) subjects with moderately severe to severe NPDR or mild PDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with moderately severe to severe NPDR and mild PDR will be selected for study&#xD;
      participation and be screened for study eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible eye with the highest DRSS, as assessed by the central reading center, will be&#xD;
      designated as the study eye for the primary efficacy analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject meets all eligibility criteria, then the subject will be randomized into the&#xD;
      study and receive study medication. Blood will be drawn for biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total length of subject participation is approximately 26 weeks, with 5 clinic visits, 4&#xD;
      telephone safety calls, and one telephone call follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The execution of the entire study (first subject screen through last randomized subject&#xD;
      completed) is expected to be approximately 12 to 15 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized, Phase 2 study in approximately 100 subjects with moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), or mild proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), evaluating safety and efficacy following administration of APX3330 twice daily for 24 weeks.&#xD;
The study will have a 1:1 randomization (placebo: APX3330). Randomization will be stratified by level of disease severity (NPDR or PDR). Subjects with mild PDR will be capped at 20% for each arm.</intervention_model_description>
