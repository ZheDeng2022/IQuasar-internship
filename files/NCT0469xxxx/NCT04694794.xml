  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is a lack of patient education materials regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
      side effects, research supported treatments, and the utilization of CAM by cancer patients at&#xD;
      Penn State Cancer Institute. The investigators aim to develop an educational brochure, which&#xD;
      educates patients about the chemotherapy side effects they may experience, and provide them&#xD;
      with the tools to address the problem themselves, know when to contact their medical&#xD;
      oncologist, and understand when it is appropriate to go to the Emergency Department. By&#xD;
      educating patients regarding these problems, patient anxiety may decrease, the number of&#xD;
      calls into the oncologist office may decrease, and Emergency Department visits may decrease,&#xD;
      which would decrease costs for the patient, the hospital, and the health system. If this&#xD;
      intervention is found to be useful and impactful, it can be further utilized within the&#xD;
      Cancer Institute by other disease teams, by other Penn State institutions, or by other&#xD;
      institutions across the country.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of cancer is a life-altering event which can cause a large amount of distress&#xD;
      in patients. One of the several factors that impacts a patient's level of distress, is their&#xD;
      fear of the diagnosis and their lack of information in the beginning their cancer journey.&#xD;
      Understandably, many patients turn to easily accessible but disreputable resources, such as&#xD;
      the internet, to learn and mentally prepare themselves for this journey. Friends and family&#xD;
      members may also provide advice or recommendations which may not always be scientifically&#xD;
      supported. Disreputable resources often have incorrect information that can scare or mislead&#xD;
      a patient, which can severely impact their health and fight against cancer. In order to help&#xD;
      patients fight these fears and become properly equipped for the cancer journey, care teams&#xD;
      must address the education of patients, especially the education about the chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment process and potential side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine the utility of a brochure to educate&#xD;
      breast and gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy about the side&#xD;
      effects of treatment, in addition to providing them with tools and recommendations to lessen&#xD;
      the impact of these side effects on their quality of life. A questionnaire-based approach and&#xD;
      the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (PEMAT) will be employed to evaluate&#xD;
      participant's responses in a variety of domains, such as understandability, actionability,&#xD;
      and utility of the brochure. The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) will be used to&#xD;
      capture the specific chemotherapy side effects that each patient is experiencing throughout&#xD;
      their treatment. Emotional Thermometer Scales (ETS) will be utilized to assess patients'&#xD;
      feelings of depression, anxiety, anger, and distress at the beginning and end of their&#xD;
      treatment. Survey questions will be utilized at interval time points (baseline plus 6 and 12&#xD;
      weeks) to evaluate the overall impact of the brochure on their quality of life and symptom&#xD;
      management. All patients will receive the brochure and fill out the associated assessment&#xD;
      scales and tools. The investigator's hypothesis is that a brochure providing information and&#xD;
      tools to address the side effects of breast and gastrointestinal cancer cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy will have utility in cancer clinics and allow patients to improve their quality&#xD;
      of life by following the scientifically supported recommendations within the brochure.&#xD;
