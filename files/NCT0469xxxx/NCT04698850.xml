    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomised study comparing two intravitreal antiVEGF drugs -&#xD;
      brolucizumab and aflibercept - in the treatment of retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP).&#xD;
      Patients with RAP confirmed on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and on OCT angiography&#xD;
      (OCTA) will be randomised in two groups and followed for 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the first group will receive aflibercept - 3 injections monthly for the first 3&#xD;
      months and then in treat-and-extend regimen with minimal interval of 8 weeks and maximal&#xD;
      interval of 16 weeks. Extension or shortening of the therapeutic interval will be possible in&#xD;
      2 or 4 week increments based on the visual acuity and disease activity assessed on OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the second group will receive brolucizumab - 3 injections monthly in the first 3&#xD;
      months and then every 2 or 3 months based on the visual acuity and disease activity assessed&#xD;
      on OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT) on OCT and number of&#xD;
      injections will be compared between both groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) is one of the variants of wet form of age-related&#xD;
      macular degeneration (wAMD). Neovascularization in RAP grows from the retinal deep capillary&#xD;
      plexus into the subretinal space where it forms subretinal and later choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization. It is often accompanied with high macular edema and pigment epithelium&#xD;
      detachment (PED). As with other forms of wAMD, treatment with intravitreal antiVEGF drugs is&#xD;
      highly effective. In our study, we would like to compare the efficacy of 2 antiVEGF drugs -&#xD;
      aflibercept and brolucizumab - in the treatment of RAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomised, comparative study comparing the best corrected visual&#xD;
      acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) in&#xD;
      the 16th, 26th and 52nd week of the study between patients with RAP treated with aflibercept&#xD;
      and brolucizumab. In the 52nd week, the total number of injections between both groups will&#xD;
      be also compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit - 14 to 1 day prior to baseline. Informed consent will be signed prior to any&#xD;
      other study procedures. Ocular and medical history will be written down. BCVA of both eyes&#xD;
      will be tested on ETDRS charts. Non-contact intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured. Slit&#xD;
      lamp anterior segment examination and fundus biomicroscopy of both eyes will be performed in&#xD;
      artificial mydriasis. OCT and OCTA of both eyes will be performed. Colour fundus photograph&#xD;
      (FP) and red-free (RF) FP of the macula of both eyes will be performed. Based on the&#xD;
      examination results, patients eligibility for the study will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline - day 1 - VFQ-25 questionnaire will be done with the patient. BCVA of both eyes will&#xD;
      be tested on ETDRS charts. Non-contact intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured. Slit lamp&#xD;
      anterior segment examination and fundus biomicroscopy of both eyes will be performed in&#xD;
      artificial mydriasis. OCT of both eyes will be performed. Based on the examination results,&#xD;

      be performed in artificial mydriasis. OCT of both eyes will be performed. OCTA of the study&#xD;
      eye (SE) will be performed. Study medication will be given. Next treatment visit will be&#xD;
      scheduled based on the disease activity on the OCT, the ocular examination findings and the&#xD;
      BCVA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. group - aflibercept - treatment interval can be left on 8 weeks or extended by 2 or 4&#xD;
           weeks based on the presence or absence of subretinal or intraretinal fluid or PED on the&#xD;
           OCT, on the BCVA and on the presence of other signs of disease activity on the fundus&#xD;
           examination (e.g. haemorrhage, hard exudates). Final decision is on the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. group - brolucizumab - aflibercept - treatment interval can be left on 8 weeks or&#xD;
           prolonged to 12 weeks based on the presence or absence of subretinal or intraretinal&#xD;
           fluid or PED on the OCT, on the BCVA and on the presence of other signs of disease&#xD;
           activity on the fundus examination (e.g. haemorrhage, hard exudates). Final decision is&#xD;
           on the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 24 to week 48 - adverse events connected to study drugs or study procedures will be&#xD;
      assessed. BCVA of both eyes will be tested on ETDRS charts. Non-contact intraocular pressure&#xD;

      Study medication will be given. Next treatment visit will be scheduled based on the disease&#xD;
      activity on the OCT, the ocular examination findings and the BCVA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. group - aflibercept - treatment interval can be extended or shortened by 2 or 4 weeks&#xD;
           based on the presence or absence of subretinal or intraretinal fluid or PED on the OCT,&#xD;
           on the BCVA and on the presence of other signs of disease activity on the fundus&#xD;
           examination (e.g. haemorrhage, hard exudates). Maximal treatment interval can be 16&#xD;
           weeks, minimal 8 weeks. Final decision is on the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. group - brolucizumab - aflibercept - treatment interval can be set to 8 or 12 weeks&#xD;
           based on the presence or absence of subretinal or intraretinal fluid or PED on the OCT,&#xD;
           on the BCVA and on the presence of other signs of disease activity on the fundus&#xD;
           examination (e.g. haemorrhage, hard exudates). Final decision is on the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      W26 - adverse events connected to study drugs or study procedures will be assessed. BCVA of&#xD;
      both eyes will be tested on ETDRS charts. Non-contact intraocular pressure (IOP) will be&#xD;
      measured. Slit lamp anterior segment examination and fundus biomicroscopy of both eyes will&#xD;
      be performed in artificial mydriasis. OCT of both eyes will be performed. OCTA of the study&#xD;
      eye (SE) will be performed. Study medication will be given and next treatment visit will be&#xD;
      scheduled based on the disease activity on the OCT, the ocular examination findings and the&#xD;
      BCVA if planned based on patients treatment schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      W52 - VFQ-25 questionnaire will be done with the patient. BCVA of both eyes will be tested on&#xD;
      ETDRS charts. Non-contact intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured. Slit lamp anterior&#xD;
      segment examination and fundus biomicroscopy of both eyes will be performed in artificial&#xD;
      mydriasis. OCT of both eyes will be performed. OCTA of the study eye (SE) will be performed.&#xD;
      Colour fundus photograph (FP) and red-free (RF) FP of the macula of both eyes will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT - performed on Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). CRT&#xD;
      will be assessed from automatic retinal thickness analysis in 9 ETDRS subfields including the&#xD;
      central subfield. 49 horizontal scans in the angle of 20x20Â° 123 um apart in High resolution&#xD;
      mode with noise reduction set to ART=4 will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCTA - performed on Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). 512&#xD;
      horizontal scans in the angle of 20x20Â° 11 um apart in High speed mode with noise reduction&#xD;
      set to ART=5 will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease activity assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the decision of the investigator. Shortening of the treatment interval is&#xD;
      recommended when the BCVA decrease of more than 5 ETDRS letters is observed, in case of&#xD;
      intra- or subretinal fluid or PED reappearance or increase on the OCT or when new haemorrhage&#xD;
      or hard exudates are observed in the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension of the treatment interval is recommended in the absence of intra- and subretinal&#xD;
      fluid and PED on the OCT with better or stable BCVA, or in case the BCVA and OCT findings are&#xD;
      stable after 3 injections in the shortest possible interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranibizumab may be given as a rescue therapy in case of patients with study drug related&#xD;
      sight threatening adverse events or with worsening of BCVA and OCT findings even on the&#xD;
      shortest treatment interval when resistance to study drug is suspected. Switch to rescue&#xD;
      therapy must be consulted with and approved by principal investigator.&#xD;
