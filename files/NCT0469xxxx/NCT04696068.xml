  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of undernutrition in hospitals is estimated between 30 and 40% and up to 50%&#xD;
      in the elderly. The consequences of undernutrition are significant: complications, delayed&#xD;
      healing, higher risk of infections, pressure ulcers, lengthening of the length of stay,&#xD;
      higher readmission rate, increased mortality, reduced quality of life, etc. In addition, the&#xD;
      cost of hospital malnutrition is high for the health system. As a result, undernutrition is&#xD;
      one of the axes of action of the french National Health Nutrition Program 2019-2023 (PNNS4).&#xD;
      It can appear during hospitalization or be pre-existing and worsen during hospitalization. It&#xD;
      is due to an unfavorable balance between expenditure and energy intake. One of the causes is&#xD;
      incomplete consumption of meals served in hospital. Studies have shown that the appearance of&#xD;
      the meal is a hindrance to patients feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Caen Normandie University Hospital, meals have been served to patients in plastic&#xD;
      trays for thirteen years. The presentation of the meals is a significant factor in not&#xD;
      consuming meals in the hospital. In addition to the problem of the presentation of meals,&#xD;
      plastic trays pose ergonomic problems: their height hinders the cutting and the gripping of&#xD;
      food, which is difficult for patients with gripping problems; they can also be difficult to&#xD;
      open for these same patients. They also pose environmental problems: the waste generated is&#xD;
      not currently recycled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that presenting the main course on porcelain plates would&#xD;
      reduce undernutrition and limit food waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a study with the aim of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the assessment of the perception of dietary intakes of patients receiving dishes&#xD;
           presented on porcelain plates (experimental group) with that of patients receiving&#xD;
           dishes in plastic trays (current system - control group) on D6 ± 1 day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the evolution of indicators of nutritional status or risk in elderly patients&#xD;
           receiving meals presented in porcelain plates (experimental group) compared to those&#xD;
           receiving meals presented in plastic trays (control group);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate food intake and food waste in each of the two groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare patient satisfaction with meals in the two groups.&#xD;
