  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy plays an important role in multidisciplinary treatment of esophageal cancer.&#xD;
      However, about half patients received radiotherapy occurred relapse. Once relapse occurred,&#xD;
      there is no better treatment strategy. Genomic study of relapsed esophageal cancer is seldom.&#xD;
      So the investigators attempt to collect relapsed tissue to conduct with whole exome&#xD;
      sequencing in order to investigate the genome landscape of recurrence esophageal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor tissue of patients received radiotherapy with diagnosis of recurrence between Jan 1,&#xD;
      2010 and Dec 1, 2020 were collected retrospectively. Recurrence tumor tissue is collected&#xD;
      between Dec 31, 2020 and Dec 31, 2022 prospectively. Blood and preradiotherapy tumor tissue&#xD;
      were also collected to be as contrast. A total of 100 paired blood, preradiotherapy tumor&#xD;
      tissue and relapse tumor tissue were collected. What is more, a total of 100 paired blood and&#xD;
      preradiotherapy tumor tissue with diagnosis of no recurrence were collected. All samples were&#xD;
      conducted with whole exome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators define recurrence period as within 2 years and no recurrence period as&#xD;
      more than 3 years after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of relapse: (1) pathologic diagnosis is squamous carcinoma before radiotherapy;(2)&#xD;
      received radiotherapy; (3)pathologic diagnosis is also squamous carcinoma after radiotherapy;&#xD;
      (4) clinical symptoms including feeding obstruction etc; (5) imaging evidence showed disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
