  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The approach of this intended research is to help pregnant women practice constructive coping&#xD;
      and proactive skills that focus on positive adaptation for safe motherhood through our&#xD;
      developed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this two phases Randomized Control Trial is to develop contextually based&#xD;
      &quot;SM-ART&quot; intervention [Safe Motherhood ART: Accessible Resilience Training] and evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of &quot;SM-ART&quot; intervention in a sample of pregnant women living in low&#xD;
      socioeconomic urban areas of Karachi, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the SM-ART intervention will enhance resilience and marital harmony&#xD;
      and decrease symptoms of depression, anxiety in pregnant women.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of perinatal depression and anxiety in South Asia are among the highest in the&#xD;
      world. In Pakistan, approximately 18% to 60% of women experienced depressive symptoms at some&#xD;
      point during their pregnancy. Early intervention for the management of mental illness in&#xD;
      pregnancy is imperative as the effects of perinatal mental ill-health is not only limited to&#xD;
      mothers but also can negatively impact child health outcomes. In a public health context,&#xD;
      positive psychological interventions should be promoted as it reduces the burden of&#xD;
      treatment, and enhance cost effective approaches in resource poor countries such as Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in Pakistan, no program has been planned and tested to enhance the positive psychological&#xD;
      wellbeing among pregnant women that is based on individual strengths, that can be learnt,&#xD;
      sustained and low cost as well. Hence, this study aims to facilitate pregnant women in&#xD;
      practicing constructive coping and proactive skills which will help them to focus more on the&#xD;
      positive approach of life rather than looking for the negative situations that is carried out&#xD;
      in their daily lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will carried out in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: The objective of phase one is study is to develop &quot;SM-ART&quot; intervention [Safe&#xD;
      Motherhood ART: Accessible Resilience Training]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: The objective of phase two is to test the effectiveness of &quot;SM-ART&quot; intervention&#xD;
      [Safe Motherhood ART: Accessible Resilience Training] to improve resilience, marital harmony&#xD;
      and decrease depression and pregnancy related anxiety in a sample of pregnant women&#xD;
      presenting to Koohi Goth Hospital of Karachi, Pakistan&#xD;
