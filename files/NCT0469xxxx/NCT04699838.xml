  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this single arm study is to estimate the progression free survival&#xD;
      of previously-untreated patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Patients will&#xD;
      receive initial chemo-immunotherapy followed by maintenance therapy with durvalumab and oral&#xD;
      ceralasertib.&#xD;

               -  For non-potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, the decision to allow a patient&#xD;

                  common azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, and other medications listed in&#xD;
                  the concomitant medications section. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
                  procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
                  agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient&#xD;
                  is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Exposure of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 may be reduced and&#xD;

               -  The use of herbal supplements or 'folk remedies' (and medications and foods that&#xD;
                  significantly modulate CYP3A activity) should be discouraged. If deemed&#xD;
                  necessary, such products may be administered with caution and the reason for use&#xD;
                  documented in the CRF.&#xD;
