      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human amygdala is part of primary olfactory cortex, in that it receives direct&#xD;
      monosynaptic input from the olfactory bulb1-4. This suggests an important role for the&#xD;
      amygdala in olfactory processing, yet the anatomical and functional properties of olfactory&#xD;
      inputs to the human amygdala are largely unexplored. The overarching goal of this proposal is&#xD;
      to elucidate the role of amygdala subregions in human olfactory processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The olfactory bulb projects in parallel to multiple cortical areas, each of which is thought&#xD;
      to play a unique role in olfactory processing5-10. Within the amygdala, several distinct&#xD;
      subregions receive direct, monosynaptic bulb input, suggesting distinct roles, yet their&#xD;
      olfactory functions are not fully understood. Rodent studies have begun to explore potential&#xD;
      roles for these subregions in olfactory-guided social and approach/avoid behaviors11- 15,&#xD;
      with the first-ever recordings of the posterolateral cortical amygdala accomplished&#xD;
      recently16. However, our understanding of these areas is still incomplete. Notably, most&#xD;
      rodent studies on the olfactory amygdala subregions have focused on the accessory olfactory&#xD;
      system, which humans lack. Furthermore, most human studies have not considered olfactory&#xD;
      amygdala subregions separately17-21. This is a critical consideration, both because the&#xD;
      majority of amygdala subregions do not receive olfactory inputs and because those that do&#xD;
      likely play distinct roles in olfactory processing. These roles cannot be understood without&#xD;
      analyzing the subregions separately. Thus, there is a strong need for more research into the&#xD;
      role of the human amygdala subregions in olfaction. Importantly, olfactory amygdala&#xD;
      subregions have been implicated in SUDEP22-26, the leading cause of death in temporal lobe&#xD;
      epilepsy. Understanding the anatomical and functional properties of these regions is&#xD;
      therefore of clinical importance as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will study human olfactory amygdala subregions using a multi-faceted, rigorous&#xD;
      approach. It will combine specialized high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging,&#xD;
      high-resolution amygdala-targeted fMRI, rare direct electrical stimulation of the human&#xD;
      amygdala (purely clinically prescribed) and human psychophysics, each suited to address a&#xD;
      different question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To anatomically and functionally characterize the primary olfactory cortical regions&#xD;
      of the human amygdala. Experiments for this aim will carefully characterize human primary&#xD;
      olfactory amygdala subregions at the anatomical and functional levels. Experiment 1A will use&#xD;
      specialized diffusion- weighted imaging to localize olfactory tracts projecting to and from&#xD;
      amygdala subregions. Experiment 1B will use resting fMRI and k-means clustering algorithms to&#xD;
      parcellate and characterize amygdala subregions based on distinct whole-brain functional&#xD;
      connectivity profiles. Experiment 1C will use event-related fMRI to functionally localize&#xD;
      odor-responsive subregions of the amygdala. The hypothesis is that the medial, cortical and&#xD;
      periamygdaloid subregions of the amygdala will exhibit structural connectivity with the&#xD;
      olfactory bulb, enhanced odor-responsiveness compared to other subregions, and distinct&#xD;
      whole-brain functional connectivity profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that activity in distinct amygdala subregions reflects distinct&#xD;
      olfactory behaviors. Experiments for this aim will use fMRI-derived ensemble patterns and&#xD;
      time-series to explore distinct olfactory roles for amygdala subregions, with excellent&#xD;
      spatial resolution and simultaneous coverage of the entire amygdala. The use of fMRI ensemble&#xD;
      patterns is ideal, since olfactory cortical areas including the amygdala use a distributive&#xD;
      mode of coding16. Experiment 2A will use fMRI to measure activity across all amygdala&#xD;
      subregions while presenting identical odors under different ecologically relevant contexts&#xD;
      (social, spatial and food). Experiment 2B will use fMRI to examine correlations between&#xD;
      amygdala fMRI patterns and olfactory approach/avoid behaviors. The hypothesis is that, as in&#xD;
      rodents, activity in the medial amygdala will reflect olfactory-guided social perceptual&#xD;
      decisions and that activity in the cortical amygdala will reflect olfactory-guided&#xD;
      approach/avoid behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess the necessity of olfactory amygdala subregions in distinct olfactory&#xD;
      behaviors. To assess the necessity of olfactory amygdala subregions in the distinct olfactory&#xD;
      behaviors described above in Aim 2, Experiment 3 will use intracranial electrophysiology&#xD;
      methods to record directly from, and deliver electrical stimulation directly into, human&#xD;
      olfactory amygdala sub-regions during the olfactory tasks from Aim 2. Stimulation will not&#xD;
      deviate from clinical protocols, and will be performed by clinicians only. This method&#xD;
      provides direct recordings of neural activity, and allows disruption of neural activity to&#xD;
      test the necessity of specific regions for particular behaviors. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      disruption of oscillatory activity in the cortical amygdala will disrupt olfactory&#xD;
      approach/avoid behaviors, while disruption of oscillatory activity in the medial amygdala&#xD;
      will disrupt olfactory social perceptual decisions.&#xD;
