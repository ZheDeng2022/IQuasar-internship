      The purpose of having this database is to collect data related to endoscopic ultrasound RFA&#xD;
      procedures performed by Indiana University EUS physicians for the treatment of tumors or&#xD;
      adenopathy. This database is a repository database only, all information will be obtained in&#xD;
      the electronic medical record. No additional clinical procedures will be performed outside&#xD;
      current standard of care for endoscopic ultrasound. The patient will have already signed an&#xD;
      informed consent for the endoscopic ultrasound. Subjects will be entered into the database&#xD;
      for up to 10 years after the most recent procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a well-established therapeutic option for ablation of&#xD;
      dysplastic and neoplastic tissue by the use of local thermal coagulative necrosis. Options&#xD;
      for administration include percutaneous or a surgical approach. Percutaneous RFA is effective&#xD;
      and safe, but it is unfeasible in cases of lesions with interposition of organs and/or&#xD;
      vessels. For lesions such as the pancreas, surgery-assisted RFA has been described but&#xD;
      requires general anesthesia and is associated with a substantial risk of thermal injuries to&#xD;
      major vessels or adjacent structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-guided RFA is a minimally invasive approach that offers high-quality real-time imaging&#xD;
      guidance during selective ablation of benign (1-5) or malignant (6-7) pancreatic lesions.&#xD;
      Treatment in small case series has shown to produce local necrosis with minimal adverse&#xD;
      events. Other sites treated include the liver and metastatic adenopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This database will collect data related to endoscopic ultrasound RFA procedures performed by&#xD;
      Indiana University EUS physicians for the treatment of tumors or adenopathy. No additional&#xD;
      clinical procedures will be performed outside current standard of care for endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound. The patient's information collected will be pre-procedure identification of the&#xD;
      adenopathy, labs, the endoscopic ultrasound(s) and post procedure follow up and care related&#xD;
      to the adenopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by phone at post-procedure 1 &amp; 2 weeks and asked to report&#xD;
      symptoms related to the procedure.&#xD;
