    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that assess the baseball pitchers' fatigue status. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to find the pitching mechanic change and the fatigue point to provide&#xD;
      guidance for coaches to schedule training items . It is expected that earlier detect the&#xD;
      pitchers' fatigue point could be able to prevent overuse injury caused by compensatory&#xD;
      actions.&#xD;

      The expected outcomes of this study include providing more reliable scientific evidence of&#xD;
      the effects of fatigue on baseball players' performance and movement control, which can help&#xD;
      to improve muscle endurance and the quality of movement control. Moreover, fatigue that&#xD;
      resulted from the prolonged practice can be reduced and recovered faster after exercise, as&#xD;
      well as more understanding on the ideal pitching posture and compensatory action that caused&#xD;
      by fatigue, providing a guideline for exercise training. This will not only help to prevent&#xD;
      fatigue and reduce risk of injury, but also strengthen weak muscle groups and improve&#xD;
      movement strategies before matches, as well as lengthen the time of being a baseball player.&#xD;
