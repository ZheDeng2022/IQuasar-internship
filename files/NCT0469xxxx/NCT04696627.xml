  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to evaluate long-term consequences of unintentional dural puncture in&#xD;
      women who had this complication during labor epidural insertion at Mount Sinai Hospital. A&#xD;
      dural puncture is the perforation of the dura mater (one of the layers protecting the brain&#xD;
      and the spinal cord) by the needle that is used to find and place a catheter in the epidural&#xD;
      space. A puncture will cause a leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the dura that results&#xD;
      in an acute and usually self-limited headache in half of patients who have this complication.&#xD;
      The usual treatment for this complication is conservative with the use of oral medications&#xD;
      like acetaminophen, anti-inflammatory and narcotics. In the severely symptomatic patient, the&#xD;
      injection of blood in the epidural space is a more invasive approach performed to &quot;patch&quot; the&#xD;
      hole that was created in the dura (epidural blood patch). The objective is to determine&#xD;
      whether or not there is a risk of developing long-term effects from the unintentional dural&#xD;
      puncture and its treatment by epidural blood patch by comparing women who had a dural&#xD;
      puncture during their labour epidural insertion with or without an epidural blood patch with&#xD;
      women who received an epidural but did not have a dural puncture during the same period of&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that women who had unintentional dural punctures during epidural insertion&#xD;
      will develop long-term effects such as chronic headache, chronic backache, chronic auditory&#xD;
      or visual disturbances and chronic disability more frequently than women who received an&#xD;
      epidural but did not sustain a dural puncture. The investigators also hypothesize that the&#xD;
      use of epidural blood patch may change the course of these complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study women who have sustained an unintentional dural puncture at&#xD;
      least one year prior to the start date of the study, and the investigators will study cases&#xD;
      occurring during a period of 5 years. These women will be matched by type of procedure (labor&#xD;
      epidural), month of delivery and age with women who have received an epidural but did not&#xD;
      sustain an unintentional dural puncture. The group of women who sustained dural punctures&#xD;
      will be further divided into two groups, whether they have received epidural blood patch or&#xD;
      not, to study the influence of the epidural blood patch on the outcomes. Women will have&#xD;
      their anesthetic records reviewed to collect data on the anesthetic technique, presence of a&#xD;
      dural puncture and treatment if applicable. All patients who qualify will be contacted and&#xD;
      invited to take part in this study. Those consenting to the study will be interviewed by&#xD;
      phone or answer the survey electronically. During the interview, they will answer questions&#xD;
      derived from validated questionnaires for the majority of our outcomes of interest. In the&#xD;
      few outcomes where a validated questionnaire does not exist, the investigators will search&#xD;
      for our endpoint with dichotomic (yes/no) questions. The investigators will then compare the&#xD;
      data gathered in the three different groups to validate or invalidate our hypothesis.&#xD;
