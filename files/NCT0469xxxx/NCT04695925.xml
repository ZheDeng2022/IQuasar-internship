  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III clinical trial aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of Osimertinib&#xD;
      monotherapy and combination of Osimertinib, pemetrexed and carboplatin in untreated patients&#xD;
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with concurrent EGFR and TP53 mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label, phase III study comparing the progression free&#xD;
      survival, overall survival, response rate, toxicity, quality of life between Osimertinib&#xD;
      monotherapy and combination of osimertinib, pemetrexed, carboplatin in first-line treatment&#xD;
      of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with concurrent EGFR and TP53 mutation.&#xD;
      Besides, the association between other genetic mutations and efficacy will also be analyzed&#xD;
      as exploratory endpoint. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either osimertinib&#xD;
      or osimertinib combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions that comprise aspects of participant's functioning assessment (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social); symptom scales (fatigue; nausea, vomiting, and pain; the global health/quality of life [QoL]); and single items (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties), within a recall period of &quot;the past week.&quot; Most questions used a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much; two questions used a 7-point scale (1=Very poor to 7=Excellent). Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale; a higher score for Global Qol/functional scales=better level of functioning; a higher score for symptom scale=greater degree of symptoms.</description>
