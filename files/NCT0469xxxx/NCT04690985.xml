  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of dietary&#xD;
      behavior change intervention on the management of sarcopenic obesity (SO) among older people&#xD;
      in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility and preliminary effects of the intervention will be tested using a two-armed&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial among older people (N=60) with SO in the community in&#xD;
      Nanjing, China. Finally, 10 participants will be invited to join a semi-structured interview&#xD;
      to explore their perceptions about the whole intervention process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the experimental group will have a greater improvement in the body&#xD;
      composition, muscle strength and physical function compared to the control group after&#xD;
      receiving the 15-week dietary behavior change intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study is a single-blind, two-arm randomized controlled trial. A total of 60&#xD;
      subjects (60 years old or more) are planned to be recruited. The subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into 2 groups witht a ratio of 1:1. One is the experimental group and the other is&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will receive 15 weeks of dietary intervention, including 6&#xD;
      face-to-face meetings and weekly telephone call. Each meeting lasts for 1 hour. The&#xD;
      participants in the experimental group are required to control of calorie intake (decrease&#xD;
      energy intake by 12%) and increase protein intake (1.2-1.5 g/body weight kg/day), and take&#xD;
      dietary diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will not receive any dietary interventions. They will only receive regular&#xD;
      contacts with a similar frequency as the experimental group. The content of the conversations&#xD;
      will not involve any topics related to SO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, 10-15 people from the experimental group will be randomly selected to&#xD;
      receive semi-structured individual interview, which will last around 1 hour. The researcher&#xD;
      plan to understand their feelings about participating in the study.&#xD;
