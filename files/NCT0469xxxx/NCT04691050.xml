  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and radiological outcome of root canal&#xD;
      treatment with OrthoMTA in primary second molars without successors in which traditional root&#xD;
      canal treatment with gutta-percha could not be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included 13 primary mandibular second molars with infected pulp and congenitally&#xD;
      missing second premolars in which traditional root canal treatment with gutta-percha was&#xD;
      contraindicated. Pulpectomy was performed in each tooth and the canals were filled with&#xD;
      OrthoMTA. The clinical and radiological outcomes of the treatment were evaluated at 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      and 12 months. Fractal analysis was used to detect changes in the trabecular bone after the&#xD;
      treatment. Repeated measures analysis of variance test and two independent t-tests were used&#xD;
      to evaluate the data.&#xD;
