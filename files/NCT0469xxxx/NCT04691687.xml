    <textblock>
      Single-center, prospective double-blinded randomized control trial to evaluate the the&#xD;
      feasibility, efficacy and safety of outpatient IV diuretic therapy in treatment of heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized by a clinical pharmacist with the ratio of 1:1:1 into 3 groups:&#xD;
      standard of care control arm (Group 1), IV placebo infusion (Group 2), and IV furosemide&#xD;
      infusion (Group 3).Patients in Group 2 and 3 received a comprehensive Heart Failure (HF)-care&#xD;
      protocol that included bi-weekly clinic visits for dose-adjusted IV-diuretics, medication&#xD;
      adjustment and education. Patients, nurses and treating physicians were blinded to the&#xD;
      randomization. Patients in Group 1 received standard of care treatment per heart failure&#xD;
      guidelines at the discretion of the primary cardiologist involved in the patient's care.8&#xD;
      Patients in Group 2 received IV saline infusion (20-40 ml) concentrated by the pharmacist to&#xD;
      minimize fluid intake. Patients in Group 3 received IV furosemide calculated by the&#xD;
      pharmacist to be equivalent or higher in dose compared to the patient's home oral dose. The&#xD;
      dose assignments were categorized into low dose (20 mg bolus with 20 mg/hour infusion&#xD;
      sessions and 2 ml saline), intermediate dose (40 mg bolus with 40 mg/hour infusion sessions&#xD;
      and 4 ml saline) and high dose (80 mg bolus with 80 mg/hour infusion sessions). The infusions&#xD;
      were continuous over 3 hours, biweekly over a one-month period. Infusions were held at the&#xD;
      discretion of the physician utilizing a written protocol (creatinine 25% above baseline,&#xD;
      Systolic Blood Pressure(SBP) &lt;80 mmHg or symptoms of presyncope). Patients in both Groups 2&#xD;
      and 3 resumed all of their oral home medications for HF post infusion visits per standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Subjects, nurses and treating physicians will be blinded to whether the subjects are receiving continuous IV furosemide (group 2) or continuous IV placebo (group 3). The pharmacist will not be blinded to help administer the appropriate medication. Because the trial will be double-blinded, safety laboratory tests will be performed for each subject for the duration of the trial, regardless of the treatment arm, and will be monitored by the research coordinator. Similarly, monitoring of potential side effects will be continuous and irrespective of treatment assignment. Outcomes assessor will be blinded.</masking_description>
