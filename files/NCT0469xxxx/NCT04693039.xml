      1. Objective to evaluate the tolerance and safety of multiple administration of fenloramide&#xD;
           tablets in patients with early and mid-term Parkinson's disease: To evaluate the adverse&#xD;
           events of DLT and MTD, adverse reactions, clinical laboratory tests (blood routine,&#xD;
           blood biochemistry, coagulation function, urine routine, stool routine), vital signs, 12&#xD;
           lead ECG and physical examination of fenloramide tablets in patients with early and&#xD;
           mid-term Parkinson's disease .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of fenloramide tablets in patients with&#xD;
           Parkinson's disease in early and middle stages. The main PK parameters included Tmax,&#xD;
           SS, Cmax, SS, cavg, SS, Ke, T1 / 2, Cl / F (only fenloramide prototype), VZ / F (only&#xD;
           fenloramide prototype), auc0-24, SS, aucinf, SS, auc0 last, SS, AUC_ %Extrap, DF, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective to explore the efficacy of fenloramide tablets in the treatment of early and&#xD;
           mid-term Parkinson's disease, and to observe the changes of UPDRS and CGI.&#xD;
