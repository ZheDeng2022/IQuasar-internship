  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancers (HNSCC) are primarily squamous cell cancers represented by tumors of&#xD;
      the upper aerodigestive tract. Locally advanced stages (stages III and IV) account for 50 to&#xD;
      70% of all presentations. The three main risk factors are smoking, alcohol and oropharyngeal&#xD;
      infection with human papilloma virus (HPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from HPV status, there is no biomarker for the prognosis in HSNCC patients. Circulating&#xD;
      Tumor Cells (CTCs) can provide &quot;real-time&quot; information on tumor behavior and are already used&#xD;
      in various cancers (colon, lung). Their detection has limited sensitivity and biomarkers&#xD;
      cannot be used for early diagnosis, but may be useful during follow-up to assess local,&#xD;
      regional or metastatic early tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using blood samples at different times (at diagnosis, after initial treatment and during&#xD;
      follow-up), we will be able to measure the variation in quantification and establish a&#xD;
      predictive role of these CTCs for the response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that CTCs may have a key role, in addition to clinical and radiological&#xD;
      examination, in detecting early tumor relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that the joint consideration of clinical parameters, treatment strategy and&#xD;
      quantification of CTCs could optimize patient follow-up and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTC extraction system, ClearCell® FX from Biolidics, is an automated microfluidic&#xD;
      enrichment system. It has the advantage of recovering fully intact and viable CTCs from a&#xD;
      standard blood sample. The gentle sorting principle allows to preserve cell integrity and&#xD;
      thus the expression of surface antigens. The CTCs thus isolated can then be re-cultured or&#xD;
      analyzed by immunostaining. This high-performance technique, in operation since December 2017&#xD;
      in the Biochemistry Department of Pr Claire Rodriguez-Lafrasse (HCL), has demonstrated its&#xD;
      usefulness in lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcriptomic analysis of CTCs can be performed at the scale of a cell after isolation of&#xD;
      the CTCs. CTCs can then be sequenced in RNAseq either in bulk (pool of cells) or cell by cell&#xD;
      on our Illumina (Nextseq) sequencer, in order to define the heterogeneity of the tumor.&#xD;
      Transcriptome analysis then provides information on the state of the cell as to its position&#xD;
      in the epithelio-mesenchymal transition thanks to a molecular signature by phenotype. A&#xD;
      priori-free characterization is therefore possible thanks to the RNAseq single-cell. This&#xD;
      highly sensitive and innovative technique will allow the study of the gene expression profile&#xD;
      of CTCs.&#xD;
