      This study will collect high-quality data on how practicing specialist physicians,&#xD;
      specifically cardiologists and pulmonologists, across the U.S. currently manage patients with&#xD;
      unexplained chronic dyspnea and and how the results of Janssen Pharmaceuticals' test change&#xD;

      Clinical Performance and Value vignettes (CPVs) in a proven methodology to rapidly measure&#xD;

      This study will collect high-quality data on how practicing specialist physicians,&#xD;
      specifically cardiologists and pulmonologists, across the U.S. currently manage patients with&#xD;
      unexplained chronic dyspnea and and how the results of Janssen Pharmaceuticals' test change&#xD;
      clinical decision making. Data from this study will better illuminate the clinical use cases&#xD;
      in which the Janssen test has the most significant impact on clinical decision making (and&#xD;
      thus the largest potential clinical utility) and the associated physician characteristics&#xD;
      (e.g., age, practice setting, training) associated with test adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study leverages simulated patient cases called Clinical Performance and Value vignettes&#xD;
      (CPVs) in a proven methodology to rapidly measure physician care decisions. CPVs are a unique&#xD;
      and scalable tool that standardizes practice measurement by having all providers care for the&#xD;
      same (virtual) patients. With all providers caring for the same patients, the CPVs generate&#xD;
      unbiased data that yields powerful insights into clinical decision making and how these&#xD;
      decisions change with the introduction of a new product or solution. Data from the CPVs can&#xD;
      quickly demonstrate the clinical utility of a solution, be published in peer-reviewed&#xD;
      literature, inform marketing strategies and positively impact coverage and reimbursement&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective cohort trial with six steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrollment: The study will enroll 249 cardiologists and pulmonologists practicing in the&#xD;
           U.S. who are determined to be eligible by an eligibility screener.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provider survey: Once the participants are enrolled in the study, they will be asked to&#xD;
           complete a questionnaire describing their practice and professional background.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization: The 249 participants will be randomized into three equally-sized arms (83&#xD;
           participants each arm): Control, Intervention 1, and Intervention 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CPVs (First Round): Participants will complete three randomly-assigned CPV patient&#xD;
           simulations. Cases will be identical across the intervention and control arms. All&#xD;
           interactive cases are presented on an online platform, and are accessible via unique&#xD;
           weblinks and any internet-connected computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Education: The Intervention-1- and Intervention-2-arm participants will receive&#xD;
           educational materials duplicating what physicians would receive in the real-world market&#xD;
           as they adopt the Janssen technology. These materials are comprised of a slide deck, a&#xD;
           sample test report, and a frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. CPVs (Second Round): All participating physicians will then be asked to complete three&#xD;
           additional CPV patient simulations. The cases are given to the doctors in a random&#xD;
           order. Cases will be identical across the intervention and control arms. At an&#xD;
           appropriate point in each case, Intervention 1 participants only will receive the&#xD;
           Janssen test results whether they select it or not, and Intervention 2 participants will&#xD;
           receive the Janssen test results only if they select it. Control arm participants will&#xD;
           continue to have access to standard of care diagnostic tools, but not the Janssen test.&#xD;
           All cases are presented on an online platform, and participants are provided with unique&#xD;
           weblinks, accessible via any internet-connected computer.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will enroll specialist physicians, specifically cardiologists and pulmonologists, practicing in the US. Participants are randomly assigned to either a control, intervention 1, or intervenion 2 arm upon enrollment. All eligible and consented participants will complete two rounds of three patient simulations.&#xD;
The intervention 1 and intervention 2 arms only will receive educational material about the Janssen test in between these two rounds. Intervention 1 arm participants only will receive the Janssen test results whether they select it or not, and Intervention 2 participants will receive the Janssen test results only if they select it in the second round of simulated cases.</intervention_model_description>
