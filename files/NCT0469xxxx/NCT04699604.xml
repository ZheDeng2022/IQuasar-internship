  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study comparing asthma&#xD;
      control post treatment in African American/Black and Caucasian/White children in both hyper&#xD;
      and hypo responsive HILD (Histamine Lontophoresis with Laser Doppler monitoring) phenotypes&#xD;
      with uncontrolled persistent allergic asthma using Levocetirizine (LTZ) vs placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator hypothesizes that children with a hyper-responsive HILD (Histamine&#xD;
      Lontophoresis with Laser Doppler monitoring) response type are more likely to have improved&#xD;
      asthma control after the addition of the antihistamine LTZ (Levocetirizine) to standard&#xD;
      asthma regimen in comparison to children with hypo-responsive HILD type. This study will&#xD;
      provide a model for a functional biomarker to inform decision making for therapeutics in&#xD;
      children. This work is novel in testing and validating a biomarker accurately and predicting&#xD;
      response to asthma treatment in children. This work is significant because it has the&#xD;
      potential to alter the current treatment paradigms for children with asthma where response to&#xD;
      treatment is predicted a priority. The proposed research will be immediately relevant by&#xD;
      expanding knowledge in the field of asthma therapeutics by linking biologically and&#xD;
      mechanistically based approaches to an effective and inexpensive treatment for asthma. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to determine HILD prediction of therapeutic response in males and&#xD;
      females 6-17 years old who identify as African American/Black and Caucasian/White to an&#xD;
      antihistamine among children with allergic asthma, and the secondary objective is to develop&#xD;
      a robust predictive model of therapeutic response to an antihistamine among children with&#xD;
      allergic asthma. There will be 300 participants for approximately 17 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of therapeutic response to antihistamine will be determined by&#xD;
      change in asthma control as guidelines recognize asthma control as a major goal of therapy.&#xD;
      Asthma control will be determined based on the Asthma Control Test (ACT®) (children ≥ 12&#xD;
      years of age) or the Child-Asthma Control Test (C-ACT®) (children &lt;12 years of age),&#xD;
      validated measures to assess asthma control in children. Children with an ACT or C-ACT score&#xD;
      &lt;19 will be classified as having uncontrolled asthma. Assessments will occur at screening,&#xD;
      visit 2, 3 and 4 (4 weeks and 6 weeks after the participant is started on drug/placebo.) The&#xD;
      secondary measures will include assessment of asthma impairment, risk, and quality of life.&#xD;
      These assessments will occur at baseline/pre-dose, 4 weeks after starting drug/placebo, and 6&#xD;
      weeks after drug/placebo for both the LTZ and placebo arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team is utilizing HILD a surrogate marker of histamine response and will determine&#xD;
      if HILD can predict which participants have improvement in asthma control after treatment&#xD;
      with Levocetirizine.&#xD;

    <description>Asthma exacerbation rates will be assessed via questionnaires to assess the rate, duration, and time to first asthma exacerbation requiring systemic steroid. The investigator will also measure rates of acute office visits, emergency department/urgent care visits, and/or hospitalizations due to asthma.&#xD;
Participants will also be asked to keep a daily asthma symptom diary as a secondary measure of asthma control. Asthma control days will be defined as full calendar days without asthma symptoms, rescue medication use, or unscheduled health care visits.&#xD;
Participants will be asked to log asthma control and exacerbation data daily.</description>
