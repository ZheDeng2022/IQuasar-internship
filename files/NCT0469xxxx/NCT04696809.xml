    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response will be defined as partial response (PR) or better as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria in multiple myeloma (MM).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the duration from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year and 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined as the time between date of first dose of study treatment and the first efficacy evaluation that the participant has met all criteria for PR or better.</description>
