  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Myanmar, community health workers, known as malaria volunteers, have played a key role in&#xD;
      reducing the malaria burden in the malaria control phase, providing essential malaria&#xD;
      services in rural areas where the coverage of formal health services is limited. However, the&#xD;
      community-delivered models that have worked well for malaria control may not work well for&#xD;
      malaria elimination. In parallel with switching from interventions for malaria control to&#xD;
      those for elimination, the motivation and social importance of malaria volunteers has&#xD;
      declined along with the decline of the malaria burden. To sustain volunteer motivation, the&#xD;
      social importance and effectiveness in the malaria elimination program, the&#xD;
      Community-delivered Integrated Malaria Elimination model for Myanmar (CIME model) was&#xD;
      developed based on global evidence and qualitative consultations with community members,&#xD;
      leaders, volunteers and health stakeholders in Myanmar. This study will assess the level of&#xD;
      effectiveness of the CIME model in increasing malaria testing by its application in an open&#xD;
      cluster-randomised controlled stepped-wedge trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CIME model integrates interventions for malaria, dengue, tuberculosis, childhood&#xD;
      diarrhoea and Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)-negative fever. It will involve the recruitment and&#xD;
      training of a volunteer to implement the CIME model in each village.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the trial is blood examination rate as determined by number of RDTs&#xD;
      for malaria performed per week per village. 140 villages in 8 townships across Ayeyarwaddy,&#xD;
      Bago and Yangon Regions and Kayah State in Myanmar will be sampled at random with probability&#xD;
      proportional to size. Study populations include villages with ICMVs who will be re-trained as&#xD;
      CIME volunteers (intervention phase) and the community members in the service catchment areas&#xD;
      of those volunteers. An open stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial, randomized at&#xD;
      the volunteer level (i.e. the volunteer and the village / workplaces they service), will be&#xD;
      conducted over 6-months to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the CIME&#xD;
      model intervention. The stepped-wedge design will comprises 24 weekly measurements of the&#xD;
      number of malaria blood examinations performed by each village, with villages grouped into 10&#xD;
      blocks of 14 villages and transitioned from control to intervention phases at bi-weekly&#xD;
      intervals following a universal two-week control period. Differences in the per weekly rate&#xD;
      of blood examination (primary outcome), will be estimated across intervention and control&#xD;
      phases using a generalised linear (e.g. Poisson or negative-binomial link functions) mixed&#xD;
      modelling analytical approach with maximum likelihood estimation.&#xD;
