  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical analysis of athletes has been performed in the sports field to obtain parameters&#xD;
      for reliable evaluations. Among the tools used is the myotonometry, an analysis capable of&#xD;
      quantitatively measuring tone, stiffness and elasticity. Its reliability has been tested in&#xD;
      several populations, however, showing changes in results and presenting high variability in&#xD;
      the confidence interval, also, the values of myotonometry differ according to sample&#xD;
      specificity and the biomechanical properties of each muscle. Therefore, it seems pertinent to&#xD;
      perform the reliability analysis in swimming athletes and verify their applicability and if&#xD;
      the values of tone and muscular biomechanical properties vary according to the specificity of&#xD;
      the modality. It will be a test and retest study composed of 50 young male and female&#xD;
      swimming athletes, aged between 12 and 20 years. The evaluation of myotonometry will be&#xD;
      performed randomly by two evaluators and the parameters measured will be: tone, stiffness,&#xD;
      elasticity, relaxation time of mechanical stress and displacement. In the test stage, the&#xD;
      first evaluator will perform the measurements bilaterally on the muscles and the second&#xD;
      evaluator will perform the same measurements in the same order immediately after the first&#xD;
      one. After 15 minutes, the retest will be performed following the same order of evaluators in&#xD;
      the test. For characterization of sample will be used descriptive statistic through central&#xD;
      tendency and variability for all variables collected. Relative reliability will be tested by&#xD;
      the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Absolute reliability will be verified by means&#xD;
      of standard error of measurement (SEM), values of least detectable change (MMD) and&#xD;
      coefficient of variation (CV). The statistical package SPSS Statistics 22.0 will be used to&#xD;
      conduct the reliability analyses.&#xD;

    <description>The evaluation of myotonometry will be carried out by two independent evaluators. The first evaluator will perform the test bilaterally on the middle deltoid, upper trapezius, pectoralis major, biceps brachii, rectus femoris, anterior tibialis, triceps brachii, lumbar multifidus, biceps femoris and soleus previously marked. Immediately after, the second appraiser will perform the same measurements in the same order (Inter-rater reliability). After a 15-minute interval, the retest (intra-rater reliability) will be performed following the same procedure and order as the test step.</description>

    <description>The examiner should exert a slight pressure on the determined point to the necessary depth, which will be indicated by changing the color from red to green light on the device. The device has an automatically controlled preload (0.18 Newton (N)) that will be applied to the contact area by an automatic mechanical pulse, with a duration of 15 milliseconds (ms) and a constant force of 0.4 N , these oscillations will be registered by an accelerometer next to the measurement mechanism inside the device. For each evaluation, a series of 10 consecutive pulses (multiscan mode) will be used with an interval of one second between each pulse. In each shot, the tone, stiffness, elasticity, relaxation time and creep will be calculated.</description>
