  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the randomized comparative controlled trial, 50 patients with insufficient keratinized&#xD;
      tissue at the anterior mandible were treated with either Modified coronally advanced tunnel&#xD;
      or epithelialized free gingival graft. At baseline, 6th week, 6th month, 12th-month visits;&#xD;
      keratinized tissue height, gingival thickness, recession depth, recession width, probing&#xD;
      depth, and clinical attachment level, were evaluated. Keratinized tissue change, Gingival&#xD;
      thickness change, root coverage, clinical attachment gain, and complete root coverage were&#xD;
      calculated. Wound healing index, tissue appearance, patient expectations, aesthetics, and&#xD;
      dentine hypersensitivity were assessed at baseline and 6th week.&#xD;

    <description>Dentine hypersensitivity (DH) was evaluated with air evaporative stimulus method at baseline and T2. After placement of finger(s) for preserving the nearby teeth, the recession sites were subjected to evaporative stimulus comprised of 1-second air blast from 1 to 3 mm distance by using the air spray at 40-65 psi pressure and 19±50C. After application, the patients were requested to give a score to their DH between 0 (=no pain) and 10 (=extreme pain).</description>

    <description>Initial sulcular incisions and flap separation were then carried out with tunnel knives. Dissection was extended at least 8 mm apically to the mucogingival junction and the muscle attachments were removed with curettes so that the flap could be moved in a coronal direction without tension. Interdental papillae were undermined to prepare the bed for connective tissue graft placement. Connective tissue graft was then inserted under the tunnel at the sites of recession and retracted laterally by sutures towards each end of the tunnel. After connective tissue graft positioning, the flap was gently stretched coronally to obtain passive flap closure. The exposed connective tissue was covered by connecting the adjacent flap margins with additional sutures.</description>

    <description>A partial-thickness flap was elevated (blade #15c) with horizontal incisions at the cemento-enamel junction level of the adjacent teeth. Then, two vertical incisions extending to the apical were made from two ends of the horizontal incision. The epithelium in the framed region was removed with a scalpel and the underlying connective tissue was exposed. To achieve the best vascularization from the recipient site, bed preparation was completed with a split-thickness horizontal incision that joins the vertical incisions in the apical region.</description>
