      The research was conducted as a single-blind controlled study with simple random sampling. It&#xD;
      was carried out at a tertiary-level hospital in Turkey in February-August 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research population was composed of the mothers who had cesarean delivery at the&#xD;
      maternity service of a tertiary-level hospital in Turkey. The size of the research sample was&#xD;
      calculated with power analysis. Considering the likelihood that some participants would later&#xD;
      be excluded from the research or leave it, a total of 156 mothers who met the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the research were assigned to the experimental group (78) and control group&#xD;
      (78).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the experimental and control groups each had 78 mothers, and hence, a total of 156&#xD;
      mothers were included in the study. The postpartum discharge training in which the PechaKucha&#xD;
      method was applied via the smartphones was offered to the mothers in the experimental group&#xD;
      whereas the mothers in the control group had solely the routine discharge training. The&#xD;
      research was completed with the participation of 140 mothers, namely, 70 mothers in the&#xD;
      experimental group and 70 mothers in the control group. The discharge training which was&#xD;
      comprised of 20 slides created as per the PechaKucha method was offered to the mothers in the&#xD;
      experimental group via smartphones. Each slide was displayed for 20 seconds. The presentation&#xD;
      took 6 minutes 40 seconds in total. The Q&amp;A session was performed after the presentation.&#xD;
      While care was provided and the follow-up activities were performed in the process following&#xD;
      the discharge training, feedback about the discharge training topics was received from both&#xD;
      groups, discharge training topics were reminded to both groups and the questions of the&#xD;
      mothers in both groups were answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Personal Information Form', the 'Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale - New Mother&#xD;
      Form', and the 'State-Trait Anxiety Inventory' were used for gathering the research data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the statistical analysis, the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) 22.0 software&#xD;
      was utilized. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency, percentage) were&#xD;
      used in the evaluation of the findings. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed for identifying&#xD;
      whether the research data were normally distributed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The research is a single-blind randomized controlled experimental study. In view of the two groups called E and C, the total number of blocks was calculated as 20 blocks and the number of the participant mothers per block was calculated as 12 mothers, namely, 6 mothers for group E and 6 mothers for group C. Through MS Office Excel 2013, 13 numbers were randomly selected from among numbers from 1 to 20 (9, 17, 19, 4, 14, 3, 14, 1, 20, 16, 12, 8, 20, 2, and 5). By ensuring that each group has 78 mothers, a total of 156 mothers were assigned to experimental and control groups in equal numbers and homogeneously.&#xD;
In this context, the research was completed with the participation of 140 mothers, namely, 70 mothers in the experimental group and 70 mothers in the control group.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>the pretest was applied in the first 8-12 hours in the postpartum period.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Readiness for Discharge After Birth Scale-Form for New Mothers (PRDABS-FNM); This is a scale assessing the readiness for discharge by mothers' perceptions. It consists of four subdimensions and 23 items. The first item is answered dichotomously (yes/no). The items between 2 and 23 are calculated through the Likert type points ranging from 0 to 10. The subdimensions consisted of 1. Care skills, 2. Expected support; 3. Strength and ability to cope; 4. Stress control and knowledge of accessing help. The lowest and highest scores are 0 and 220. High scores indicate women's readiness for discharge.</description>

    <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): The scale which was developed in 1970 by Spielberger, Gorsuch, and Lushene is comprised of two parts for measuring state anxiety and trait anxiety. Each part has 20 items. The STAI-State is scored as per the severity level of the emotions and behaviors (1: Not at all, 2: Somewhat, 3: Moderately so, and 4: Very much so). In the STAI-State, there are ten reverse-scored items (Items 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, and 20). The items of the STAI-Trait are scored as per the expression frequency of the emotions and behaviors (1: Almost never, 2: Sometimes, 3: Often, and 4: Almost always). In the STAI-Trait, there are seven reverse-scored items (Items 21, 26, 27, 30, 33, 36, and 39). In the scoring, two separate keys are prepared for identifying the total weighted values of the straight-scored and reverse-scored items. These constant values are 50 and 35 respectively for the STAI-State and STAI-Trait.</description>
