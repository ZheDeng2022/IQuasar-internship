  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract. Gastric&#xD;
      cancer patients diagnosed for the first time in China have a higher proportion of advanced&#xD;
      stages and a higher postoperative metastasis rate.Studies have shown that patients with good&#xD;
      pathological response after preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (such as tumor regression grade,&#xD;
      TRG0 or 1) have a better prognosis.The purpose of this study is to treat patients with&#xD;
      advanced gastric cancer who are difficult to perform R0 surgery with chemotherapy combined&#xD;
      with immunotherapy. At the same time as the primary cancerous lesions are reduced, the&#xD;
      distant metastatic lesions are effectively controlled in order to perform R0 surgery and to&#xD;
      improve the survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;
