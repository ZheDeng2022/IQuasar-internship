      determining the effect of psychodrama-based pregnancy education program on fear of childbirth&#xD;
      (FOC). The population of the study consisted of 18-45 years old pregnant who with high fear&#xD;
      of childbirth. The sample of the study was determined as 150 pregnant with confidence level&#xD;
      of 95% and theoretical power of 95%. The pregnant women were divided into two groups of 75&#xD;
      pregnant. In addition to routine pregnancy training, a 90-minute psychodrama study was&#xD;
      carried out to the experimental group. Data were collected using the information form, Wijma&#xD;
      Delivery Expectancy/ Experience Questionnaire Version A (W-DEQ), Wijma Delivery Expectation /&#xD;
      Experience Questionnaire Version B (W-DEQ), City Birth Trauma Scale and Edinburgh Postpartum&#xD;

      The pregnant women were divided into two groups of 75 pregnant. In addition to the 6-week&#xD;
      routine pregnancy training, a 90-minute psychodrama study was conducted to the experimental&#xD;
      group. The experimental group was divided into 6 subgroups and trained (min = 9, max = 14).&#xD;
      The control group was divided into 6 subgroups and trained (min = 11, max = 14). Prenatal&#xD;
      psychodrama is held by psychodrama psychotherapists in individual and group therapy sessions.&#xD;
      In these sessions the pregnant mother encounters herself, her baby, her partner, her mother,&#xD;
      her fear of childbirth and the moment of birth; she may act as protagonist in some scenes and&#xD;
      in this way she closes any unfinished business from the past and rehearses the future in a&#xD;
      safe therapeutic environment.Data were collected using the information form, Wijma Delivery&#xD;
      Expectancy/ Experience Questionnaire Version A (W-DEQ), Wijma Delivery Expectation /&#xD;

    <description>Psychodrama is not just a training but also a treatment technique where an individual is offered a potential cure, as well as improvement and awareness for his or her ongoing relationships within the group. In psychodrama, the participant is given an opportunity to re-experience of earlier incidents for a second time so that the person could be free from the impacts of that earlier experience. All of this happens simultaneously with joy, tears, laughter, and depth of feeling.Prenatal psychodrama is held by psychodrama psychotherapists in individual and group therapy sessions. In these sessions the pregnant mother encounters herself, her baby, her partner, her mother, her fear of childbirth and the moment of birth; she may act as protagonist in some scenes and in this way she closes any unfinished business from the past and rehearses the future in a safe therapeutic environment. In this study, 90-minute psychodrama practice was conducted in addition to pregnancy training for 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>Childbirth is one of the most significant events in a parent's life and has the potential to be an exhilarating and fulfilling experience for some or a frightening anxiety provoking experience for others. Structured antenatal classes have developed worldwide as traditional methods of information sharing have declined and expectant parents look for strategies to prepare for childbirth. In this study, routine pregnancy training was conducted for 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>In order to reduce the fear of cihildbirth, pregnant women are given 90 minutes right after the training in addition to the routine pregnancy training. In the psychodrama-based pregnancy education program, fear of childbirth were assesment by sociometric measurement in order to increase the awareness of pregnant women about birth fear levels in the first week. Afterwards, they were given the opportunity to express themselves about the factors that may cause fear in pregnant women (their previous traumatic experiences, negative prejudices about childbirth, etc). The group members shared about their process in the first session and the session was ended. The session was evaluated with other researchers. In the following sessions, in order to strengthen their coping with the fear of childbirth, besides psychodrama warm-up games, the basic techniques of psychodrama, role switching, matching and mirror were used in protogonist works.</description>
