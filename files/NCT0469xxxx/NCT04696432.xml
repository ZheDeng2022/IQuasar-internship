    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, relapsed/refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of EXP039 in relapsed and/refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.&#xD;

      This is a single-arm, open label, phase I study to evaluate the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of EXP039 in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. 10&#xD;
      patients are planned to be enrolled. Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of EXP039.&#xD;
      Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to EXP039 infusion. All subjects who have received&#xD;
      EXP039 infusion will be followed for up to 12 months.&#xD;
