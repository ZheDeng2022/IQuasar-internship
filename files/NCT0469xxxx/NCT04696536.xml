    <time_frame>4 Weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding will be assessed according to the Gingival Bleeding Index. A periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip will be inserted into the gingival crevice and swept from distal to mesial around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60 degree, while in contact with the sulcular epithelium. Each of 4 gingival areas (distobuccal, mid-buccal, mid-lingual, and mesiolingual) around each tooth will be assessed. After approximately 30 seconds, bleeding at each gingival unit will be recorded according to the following scale: 0- Absence of bleeding after 30 seconds; 1- Bleeding after 30 seconds; 2- Immediate bleeding.</description>
