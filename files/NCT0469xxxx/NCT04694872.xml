    <textblock>
      It is planned to recruit 30 individuals with Parkinson's Disease within the scope of the&#xD;
      study. Balance, gait, activity transfers of Parkinson's Patients will be evaluated. The study&#xD;
      will be randomly divided into two groups. In the first group, an exercise protocol called&#xD;
      LSVT BIG will be applied via the Zoom application with mobile phone, tablet or computer for 4&#xD;
      days a week for 4 weeks. This exercise protocol consists of reliable movements suitable for&#xD;
      the conditions of patients with large amplitudes. For the other group, balance and functional&#xD;
      mobility exercises will be applied via the Zoom application with mobile phone, tablet or&#xD;
      computer for 4 weeks, 4 days a week. Balance, walking and activity transfer measurements will&#xD;
      be repeated at the end of a total of 4 weeks. It is planned to include 30 patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) with a level of 1-3 according to the Hoehn-Yahr scale,&#xD;
      who applied to the Neurology Clinic of the Bakırköy Prof. Dr. Mazhar Osman Mental Health and&#xD;
      Neurology Training and Research Hospital. The volunteers who will participate in the study&#xD;
      will be informed about the purpose of the study, its duration, and the possible side effects&#xD;
      of the treatment to be applied. Primary outcome measures include Mini Best Test, Biodex&#xD;
      balance evaluation and Kinovea for gait assessment. Dynamic balance will be evaluated with&#xD;
      Mini-Best Test, postural stability and fall risk will be evaluated with the Biodex Balance&#xD;
      Device. With the camera to be placed on the sagittal, 3-meter walking distances will be&#xD;
      recorded. Colored marks will be affixed to the right and left heels. The colored marks placed&#xD;
      will be marked on the video and the step length and walking speed will be calculated with the&#xD;
      Kinovea motion analysis software. In the secondary evaluations, Activity Specific Balance&#xD;
      Confidence Scale-Short Form, Sit and Stand Test Five times, Parkinson's Activity Scale,&#xD;
      Parkinsona Specific Quality of Life Scale (PHÖ-39) will be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a degenerative process that affects the basal ganglia, primarily&#xD;
      substantia nigra, and other brainstem pigmented neurons, and its main clinical symptoms are&#xD;
      resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural reflex disorder (1). These movement&#xD;
      symptoms usually occur unilaterally and gradually affect the other side of the body. Gait&#xD;
      disorders are quite common in patients with Parkinson's, and the most common disabilities&#xD;
      during walking are reduced arm swing, step length, speed, step width, and postural control&#xD;
      inadequacy (2). One of the characteristic movement disorders in PD is hypokinesia, in which&#xD;
      there is a decrease in motion amplitude and speed. Hypokinesia can occur during movements&#xD;
      such as walking, speaking, and writing. When individuals with PD try to perform or coordinate&#xD;
      two motor tasks simultaneously, hypokinesia can occur during complex actions (3). Different&#xD;
      exercise approaches, including musculoskeletal exercises, aerobic exercises, Nordic walking,&#xD;
      repetitive task training, sensory cues, and balance exercises have been proposed for the&#xD;
      treatment of movement disorders and gait in these patients (4). The LSVT BIG protocol, which&#xD;
      consists of large-amplitude exercises for movement disorders, has been used in treatment in&#xD;
      recent years (5). High-intensity motion amplitude training in PD was firstly implemented in&#xD;
      the form of LSVT LOUD to improve hypophonia. The newly developed LSVT BIG treatment, derived&#xD;
      from LSVT LOUD, aims to restore the normal range of motion by re-adjusting the patient's&#xD;
      perception of movement and walking. Treatment focuses on intense exercise of large amplitude&#xD;
      movements. The LSVT BIG exercise intensity was determined as 16 individualized 1-hour&#xD;
      sessions, 4 times a week for 4 weeks. Each exercise is repeated at least 8 times and is&#xD;
      performed with an effort of 80%, with rest breaks minimized as much as possible (6). LSVT BIG&#xD;
      training consists of maximal daily exercises, functional component tasks, BIG walking and&#xD;
      hierarchy tasks. The aim of the training is to readjust movement during all functional tasks&#xD;
      in the clinic and to encourage the transfer of the newly acquired motion amplitude to all&#xD;
      non-clinical tasks. As needed, the therapist provides visual and verbal feedback to increase&#xD;
      the amplitude of the movement. The maximum daily exercises consist of 7 versatile standard&#xD;
      exercises performed while sitting and standing. In the functional component tasks section, it&#xD;
      performs 5 tasks selected according to patient goals and therapists' evaluation, these tasks&#xD;
      are performed over and over again, focusing on increasing the amplitude of motion in each&#xD;
      session. The BIG focuses on the patient stride length and the increasing amplitude of arm&#xD;
      swing, and the distance is determined by walking speed and endurance. In the hierarchy tasks&#xD;
      section, the therapist designs the functional task record form based on the patient's&#xD;
      notification, a set of movements created based on the patient's notification, and&#xD;
      hierarchical tasks are developed in accordance with the determined functional goals.&#xD;
      Hierarchical tasks can be advanced by increasing the complexity of the environment. In&#xD;
      addition, the patient is instructed to apply the acquired skills in the home environment in&#xD;
      order to maintain the principles of this education in daily life activities (7). Although&#xD;
      LSVT BIG treatment has been shown to have positive effects on walking speed and goal-oriented&#xD;
      activities, its effects on freezing, balance, bed mobility and transfers during walking have&#xD;
      not yet been specified (6). Although research on the efficacy of LSVT BIG treatment is&#xD;
      limited, the European Physiotherapy PD Guideline recommends this exercise approach to improve&#xD;
      walking, balance, transfers and physical capacity (8). In this guide, it is seen that&#xD;
      exercise programs that include functional activities related to balance have an important&#xD;
      place in the rehabilitation of PD. However, there are limited studies comparing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of exercise types and exercise methods that can provide normal range of motion&#xD;
      with similar intensity (9). Lack of dose-response relationships in LSVT-BIG treatment, access&#xD;
      to the clinical environment of patients for 16 sessions and four weeks, and limitations on&#xD;
      practical applicability of the treatment were emphasized (10). The determined standard&#xD;
      protocol imposes a significant temporal and economic burden for outpatients (11). For this&#xD;
      reason, it is thought that performing LSVT BIG treatment via video conferencing method and&#xD;
      remote exercise monitoring with tele-rehabilitation, will increase the participation of&#xD;
      patients. The implementation of remote rehabilitation interventions through&#xD;
      telerehabilitation or communication technology is used in individuals with PD as a means of&#xD;
      overcoming barriers and increasing compliance in many patient populations with good results.&#xD;
      It has been shown that participation in telerehabilitation and walking exercises is higher in&#xD;
      this population than in face-to-face exercises (12). In addition, it is stated that reduced&#xD;
      physical exercise and increased psychological stress in the Covid 19 pandemic can worsen the&#xD;
      symptoms of PD, and it is more important than ever to encourage home-based, adequate dose&#xD;
      exercises. During this period, remote follow-up of individuals with PD is more reliable; It&#xD;
      is clearly seen that online exercise, dance lessons or web-based applications for patients&#xD;
      stand out (13). The aim of our study is to compare the effects of telerehabilitation-based&#xD;
      LSVT-BIG protocol and telerehabilitation-based functional balance and mobility exercises in&#xD;
      Parkinson's patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include 50 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) with a level of&#xD;
      1-3 according to the Hoehn-Yahr scale, who applied to the Neurology Clinic of Bakırköy&#xD;
      Psychiatric and Neurological Diseases Hospital between August 2020 and September 2021. The&#xD;
      volunteers who will participate in the study will be informed about the purpose of the study,&#xD;
      its duration, and the possible side effects of the treatment to be applied. Their consent&#xD;
      will be obtained with the &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot; prepared in accordance with the standards&#xD;
      set by the Istanbul University Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty Clinical Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      and the study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.The number of&#xD;
      cases to be taken for each group at 80% confidence interval, considering the smallest&#xD;
      detectable difference (Smallest Detectable Difference, SDD) 3.4, and the minimal clinical&#xD;
      significant change (Minimal Clinically Important Difference, MCID) 3.5, among the primary&#xD;
      outcome measures 16 was determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures include Mini Best Test, Biodex balance evaluation and Kinovea for&#xD;
      gait assessment. Dynamic balance will be evaluated with Mini-Best Test, postural stability&#xD;
      and fall risk will be evaluated with the Biodex Balance Device. With the camera to be placed&#xD;
      on the sagittal, 3-meter walking distances will be recorded. Colored marks will be affixed to&#xD;
      the right and left heels. The colored marks placed will be marked on the video and the step&#xD;
      length and walking speed will be calculated with the Kinovea motion analysis software. In the&#xD;
      secondary evaluations, Activity Specific Balance Confidence Scale-Short Form, Sit and Stand&#xD;
      Test Five times, Parkinson's Activity Scale, Parkinsona Specific Quality of Life Scale&#xD;
      (PHÖ-39) will be used.&#xD;
