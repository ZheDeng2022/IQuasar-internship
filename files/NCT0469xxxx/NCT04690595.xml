  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial evaluates the side effects and best dose of BAFFR-CAR T cells in treating&#xD;
      patients with B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia that has come back (recurrent) or does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment (refractory). T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill&#xD;
      cancer cells. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and will have a new&#xD;
      gene put in them that makes them able to recognize BAFFR, a protein on the surface of cancer&#xD;
      cells. These BAFFR-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill&#xD;
      BAFFR+ cancer cells.&#xD;
