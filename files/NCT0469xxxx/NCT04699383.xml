      Outcomes of patients receiving SSG and Allopurinol combination have never been documented&#xD;
      systematically in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is not known how effective this combination is.&#xD;
      This study will provide evidence to help clinicians make the best choice regarding treatment&#xD;
      for complicated cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases. Due to diversity in host-pathogen&#xD;
      interactions across the different CL forms, early immunological correlates associated with&#xD;
      treatment responsiveness and unresponsiveness could help treatment recommendation and provide&#xD;
      us with the basis to develop new diagnostic and treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to document treatment outcomes of patients with cLCL, MCL, and DCL receiving&#xD;
      systemic treatment using SSG and Allopurinol combination within a routine care setting&#xD;
      located in a highly endemic area in Ethiopia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) in Ethiopia causes severe dermatological mutilations. Forms that&#xD;
      require systemic treatment are complicated localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (cLCL),&#xD;
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The clinical&#xD;
      presentation of CL depends on various factors including parasite species, infection history&#xD;
      and differences in the immune response. National guidelines recommend equally all drugs that&#xD;
      are also used for visceral leishmaniasis treatment. Sodium stibogluconate (SSG) is one of&#xD;
      these recommended medications. However, dermatologists in Ethiopia also use a combination of&#xD;
      SSG and Allopurinol for treatment of complicated cutaneous leishmaniasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of patients receiving SSG and Allopurinol combination have never been documented&#xD;
      systematically in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is not known how effective this combination is.&#xD;
      This study will provide evidence to help clinicians make the best choice regarding treatment&#xD;
      for complicated CL cases. Due to diversity in host-pathogen interactions across the different&#xD;
      CL forms, early immunological correlates associated with treatment responsiveness and&#xD;
      unresponsiveness could help treatment recommendation and provide us with the basis to develop&#xD;
      new diagnostic and treatment strategies.&#xD;
