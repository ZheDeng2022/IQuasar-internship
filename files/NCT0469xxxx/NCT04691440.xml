  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious endocarditis (IE) is defined as an infection anywhere on the endocardium, most&#xD;
      often localised to the cardiac valves. It is an infection with an increasing incidence and in&#xD;
      Denmark with 6-700 new cases annually. Approximately 45% of the patients must undergo cardiac&#xD;
      surgery with replacement of infected cardiac valves by prosthetic valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the formation of biofilms infections has drawn attention with respect to the&#xD;
      effects of hyperbaric re-oxygenation of stricken tissues as anaerobic bacterial metabolism&#xD;
      with low levels of activity within the biofilm environment, may be responsible for the&#xD;
      development of antimicrobial resistance. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) consume&#xD;
      available oxygen in the conversion of oxygen to ROS and in the formation of reactive nitrogen&#xD;
      species (RNS) by inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) as PMN's are activated by bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pre-clinical context the effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) in re-oxygenating&#xD;
      biofilm related infections have been demonstrated in infected lungs with Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjunctive HBOT has never been offered to patients with IE. However, HBOT may be associated&#xD;
      with reduced compliance and side effects, such as equalisation problems of ears and sinuses&#xD;
      and confinement anxiety, and the treatment is organizational challenging. On this basis the&#xD;
      investigators suggest an initial feasibility study as the basis for a later and larger scaled&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of HBOT in patients with IE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During antibiotic treatments with the indicated antibiotics the susceptible bacteria are&#xD;
      subjected to metabolic changes of the Krebs cycles leading to intrabacterial accumulation of&#xD;
      toxic hydroxyl oxygen radicals. The intrabacterial toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) can&#xD;
      subsequently react with DNA, lipids or proteins resulting in damages of those bacterial&#xD;
      components adding to the killing of the bacteria. A consequence is that bactericidal&#xD;
      antibiotics have reduced activity in infectious foci with poor oxygen supply like in&#xD;
      abscesses or in biofilm infections as in IE and/or rapid consumption of oxygen due to PMN&#xD;
      influx. The bacterial damages may, if killing is not obtained, result in mutations and&#xD;
      selection of antibiotic resistant mutants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these discoveries also provide a possibility for improving the antibacterial effect&#xD;
      by increasing the oxygen pressure in the infectious focus. This can be obtained by increasing&#xD;
      oxygen tension in the tissues by treating the patients with HBOT - and have been shown in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo pre-clinical experiments. Exposing Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm models in&#xD;
      vitro to HBOT has proved effective by significantly increasing the bactericidal effect of&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More important, in an animal (rats) model of left-sided S. aureus IE on the aortic valves,&#xD;
      tobramycin killing effect was significantly improved by adding HBOT as adjunctive therapy.&#xD;
      Moreover, the rats revealed a reduced inflammatory response and improved clinical scores. No&#xD;
      side effects were recorded during that study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the HBOT is also believed to improve the antibacterial effect of the PMNs, and&#xD;
      thereby add to an enhanced elimination of infectious focus. This is being estimated by&#xD;
      measurements of the respiratory burst of the PMNs, as well as their phagocytic capacity right&#xD;
      before and right after the HBOT.&#xD;
