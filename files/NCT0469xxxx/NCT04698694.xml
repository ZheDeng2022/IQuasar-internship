      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major obstacle to the preventive or therapeutic success of DNA vaccines is undoubtedly&#xD;
      their delivery. If this cannot be made simple, cheap and effective, they may not become a&#xD;
      viable option for human use. Numerous clinical trials have confirmed that a standard needle&#xD;
      and syringe parenteral (mainly intramuscular or intradermal) delivery is not enough. An&#xD;
      important tenet, confirmed by different DNA immunization studies, is that electroporation&#xD;
      dramatically enhances the expression of the encoded antigen as well as the potency and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. Electroporation (EP) creates transient increases in cell&#xD;
      membrane permeability, thus enhancing DNA uptake and leading to a more robust immune&#xD;
      response. EP involves the application of brief electric pulses to tissue in order to&#xD;
      permeabilize cell membranes in a transient and reversible manner. The temporary formation of&#xD;
      pores facilitate successful transport of macromolecules, like DNA, that occurs on the order&#xD;
      of microseconds vs. minutes in the case of passive diffusion alone. EP is considered a safe&#xD;
      and well validated procedure that can easily be handled as an out-patient procedure. In this&#xD;
      regard, electrochemotherapy and electro gene transfer with the Cliniporator® (IGEA Srl,&#xD;
      Carpi, Italy) has been added to clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present study is therefore to formally confirm the tolerability of electroporation&#xD;
      given by the EPSGT gun and the Cliniporator® device in a clinical setting of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, prior to the phase I/II study of the COVID-19 vaccine in a similar population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty (20) subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of the following EP conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. voltage amplitude of 40 V (10 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. voltage amplitude of 60 V (10 subjects). For the purpose of the study, 0.5 ml of sterile&#xD;
           0.9% saline solution will be injected intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle of the&#xD;
           right arm using a common insulin syringe inserted in the EPS gun; the saline injection&#xD;
           will immediately be followed by electroporation given by the gun connected to the&#xD;
           electrical pulse generator, Cliniporator®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electroporation technology has been optimized by IGEA developing a dedicated EPS&#xD;
      electrode gun. The EPS gun is an intuitive and handful procedure that combines in the same&#xD;
      device the injection of a DNA vaccine (or a sterile 0.9% saline solution as in the case of&#xD;
      the present study) and the delivery of the electrical pulses; the procedure is completed in&#xD;
      few seconds. The EP needles 7 (diameter 0.45 mm) are hidden under a sliding cap integrated&#xD;
      into the EPS gun, to reduce perceived pain potentially associated to anxiety or fear. The EPS&#xD;
      gun allows the insertion of both the electrode needles and the syringe needle into the&#xD;
      muscle. By pressing the syringe plunger, the content of the syringe will be injected, by&#xD;
      pulling the trigger the syringe needle will be retracted, and finally the electrical pulses&#xD;
      will be delivered by pressing a pedal connected to the pulse generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of injection and EP, subjects will be instructed to measure the length of time&#xD;
      pain is experienced by using a stopwatch. Additionally, subjects will complete the Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS) to rate the level of pain experienced immediately (0 min) and after 5 min,&#xD;
      15 min, 30 min, and 60 min post-EP. In addition subjects will rate discomfort level using an&#xD;
      11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), evaluated 60' (T4) after the procedure. On Day 2 and&#xD;
      Day 7 post-EP, subjects will complete again the VAS as described above, and NRS. In addition,&#xD;
      on Day 1 (T2, +15'), Day 2 and Day 7 subjects will complete a self-administered questionnaire&#xD;
      assessing the acceptance of the procedure. Therefore, to better measure the acceptability of&#xD;
      the injection related to the use of a new device from people's own perspectives, all&#xD;
      participants will complete the Perception of Injection (PIN) questionnaire, adapted from the&#xD;
      Vaccines' Perception of Injection (VAPI) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analyses will include summaries of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adverse events, including severity and relationship to the procedure (to the&#xD;
           intramuscular injection, to the electroporation, or to both procedures)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serious adverse events, including severity and relationship to the procedure (to the&#xD;
           intramuscular injection or to the electroporation, or to both)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abnormal changes in CPK&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abnormal changes in vital signs and ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No sample size calculation was performed on this study on the tolerability of two EP voltage&#xD;
      strengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses will be mainly descriptive. Qualitative variables will be summarized&#xD;
      by counts and percentages, while quantitative characteristics by quartiles or mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected longitudinally will be also described appropriately. Specific summary indices&#xD;
      will be calculated on the longitudinal VAS profiles (e.g. SPID and peak PID) and the&#xD;
      agreement between VAS and NRS collected at each time point will be also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be graded in accordance with the 2007 FDA toxicity grading scale for&#xD;
      healthy adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials (grade&#xD;
      1 = mild, grade 2 = moderate, grade 3 = severe, grade 4 = life-threatening) and will be&#xD;
      reported as percentages and narratives will be also presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data requested by the study will be reported in an electronic remote data capture system&#xD;
      (e-CRF). The subject data collected in the e-CRF during the study will be documented&#xD;
      anonymously and the subject can only be identified by an identification code.&#xD;
