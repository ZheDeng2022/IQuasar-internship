      Background Perioperative anxiety and postoperative pain can impact surgical morbidity. We&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate the effect of intraoperative music therapy in the reduction of immediate&#xD;
      postoperative pain in patients undergoing gynecological oncology surgery within an Enhanced&#xD;
      Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol. Secondary objectives include reduction in&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain overtime, neurohormonal response, morbidity, length&#xD;
      of hospital stay (LOS) and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Prospective, randomized, double-blinded single-center study including patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery for ovarian, endometrial or cervical cancer over a period of 12 months.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to receiving intraoperative music therapy (Group A) or&#xD;
      undergoing standard management (Group B). A reduction in immediate postoperative pain was&#xD;
      defined as a reduction in ≥2 points in the Verbal Rating Scale(VRS) at 4h postoperatively.&#xD;
      Hemodynamic variables and blood samples were collected during the procedure for determination&#xD;
      of cortisol levels. A scale of closed numeric questions (Likert-like) was used to assess&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were randomly assigned to either receiving intraoperative music therapy (Group A) or undergoing standard management without music therapy (Group B). Randomization was performed by a nurse specialist blinded to the study using anonymized, opaque envelopes provided by the Vall d'Hebron Research Institute. Participants were then randomized (i.e. given an envelope) to either Group A or Group B during the preoperative visit. The randomization allocation was performed using the ralloc function in STATA which randomly assigned participants in either of the two study groups in blocks of 2, 4, 6, until the total number of patients was achieved (n = 80).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Music therapy was administered before initiating anesthetic induction with the patient lying flat on the surgical table. A pair of non-reusable headphones (Disok, Alicante, Spain) were used in both groups which were connected to a tablet Fire 7 (Amazon, Seattle, WA, US) that was used as a music player device connected to Spotify. Two music lists were downloaded and reproduced without the need of access to WIFI to ensure good reproducibility. Group A was played a list consisting of rhythmic tones of 60-80bpm, music from the Seatwork 60bpm playlist with a duration of 11h and 5 minutes. Group B was played an empty playlist. Volume was set at a standard of 68dB. The surgical supervisor was responsible for opening the opaque envelope for each patient and to play the list according to the allocated group. Only the surgical supervisor knew the allocation for each patient, the rest of the surgical team were blinded to the allocation result.</masking_description>

    <description>The main objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction in postoperative pain, defined as a reduction in two or more points in the VRS, in patients undergoing gynecological oncology surgery within the ERAS protocol with the use of music therapy. VRS is verbal rating score is a numeric rating scale (NRS-11) is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain. 0 means you have no pain; one to three means mild pain; four to seven is considered moderate pain; eight and above is severe pain.</description>
