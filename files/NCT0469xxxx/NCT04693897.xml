  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About one to two million women in Taiwan suffers from overactive bladder (OAB). The most&#xD;
      commonly used anti-muscarinic drugs have a high rate of side effects. While beta-3&#xD;
      adrenoceptor agonist, Mirabegron, has far fewer side effects, there are no consensus on&#xD;
      whether it can be used as first-line treatment. The investigator's preliminary study showed&#xD;
      that the concentration of beta-3 adrenoceptor in the urine of OAB patients is higher than&#xD;
      that in the normal control group, so comparing urinary beta-3 adrenoceptor concentration of&#xD;
      OAB patients before and after treatment may be used as a biomarker of therapeutic&#xD;
      effectiveness. The results of this study will be of great help in understanding the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Mirabegron and formulating OAB treatment plans.&#xD;

    <description>Concentrations of urinary beta-3 adrenoceptor levels will be analyzed for 1)before and after treatment of patients with overactive bladder syndrome treated with Mirabegron; 2)before and after treatment patients with overactive bladder syndrome treated with Solifenacin; 3)patients with urinary tract infection, and 4)control (subjects without lower urinary tract symptoms).</description>

    <description>Individual participant's change score on Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) will be compared between participants treated with Mirabegron with and without detrusor overactivity after 12 weeks of treatment. The OABSS is a validated symptom questionnaire that sums the score of four symptoms (daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence). The total score ranges from 0 to 15, with higher the number, the greater the symptoms are.</description>

    <description>Individual participant's change score on the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire short-form (OAB-q SF) will be compared between participants treated with Mirabegron with and without detrusor overactivity after 12 weeks of treatment. The OAB-q SF assess the impact of OAB symptoms on the patient's life, and consists of symptom-bother and health-related quality of life. The subscales are summed and transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100; a high symptom-bother score indicates greater symptom severity and a high health-related quality of life scale score indicates higher quality of life.</description>
