    <textblock>
      The present study aims to examine the effects of Xbox Kinect exercise training program on the&#xD;
      sleep quality, anxiety and functional capacity in older adults. Older adults were randomized&#xD;
      into two groups. The XBOX group performed exercise with Xbox Kinect during 60 min, three&#xD;
      times/week for 6 weeks. The CONTROL group did not exercise. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&#xD;
      was used to evaluate sleep quality, anxiety symptoms by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory,&#xD;
      and the functional capacity was analyzed using following tests: Chair Stand Test, 8-Foot Up&#xD;
      and Go Test, and 6-min Walk Test.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Sleep Quality at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep Quality: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval and provides quantitative and qualitative information on sleep. The questionnaire consists of 19 self-report items and other questions. The score ranges from 0 to 21 and scores &gt; 5 indicates the patient is a poor sleeper</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Anxiety at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety Symptoms: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) assesses anxiety level using two scales (State and Trait) with 20 items. Range of scores is 20-80, and the scores indicate low (0-30), medium (31-49), or high (50 or more) anxiety levels</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline strength at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Chair Stand Test is used to assess lower body strength. After a signal participants completed as many &quot;stand-ups&quot; as possible with 30s. Total repetitions completed within 30s are used to score the participants' performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline agility/dynamic balance at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 8-ft Timed Up &amp; Go Test is used to assess agility and dynamic balance. Participants are asked to sit on a chair. On cue, they stood up, walked as quickly as possible around a cone set 8ft from the chair, and sat back down on the chair. Total time to complete the test in seconds was measured to assess performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline aerobic endurance at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-MWT is performed in a 20-m-long indoor hallway free of obstacles. Participants are instructed to walk at a self-selected regular pace to cover as much distance as they could during the allotted time. The score is the total number of meters walked in 6 min</description>

    <description>The XBOX group performed exercise for 60 min, three times/week, for 6 weeks, using the Xbox Kinect game &quot;Your Shape Fitness evolved&quot;. This game was chosen because it simulates an environment with a variety of physical activities, in which the majority can be practiced by older adults. The activities were carried out individually. The game activities selected for the physical activity sessions were: 1) Zen-Develop it (stretching, balance and flexibility activities, similar to Yoga); 2) Pump it (to fill balls until they burst); 3) Wall Breaker (to break blocks, similar to boxing); 4) Kick it (soccer activity); 5) Hurricane (to lift the balls off the floor and not let them fall); 6) Stack in Up (balance activity).</description>
