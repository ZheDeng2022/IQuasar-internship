  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Together with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the major forms of&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).Currently, no curative therapy is available, since the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of this disease is incompletely understood (1-3) and clinical practice&#xD;
      demonstrates that current therapies induce remission in subgroups of patients only.&#xD;
      Scientific evidence suggests that colitogenic immune responses can be controlled by&#xD;
      increasing the number of circulating regulatory T cells (Treg) (4). The production of large&#xD;
      numbers of autologous Treg is possible by isolation of CD25+ cells from the whole blood of a&#xD;
      patient and subsequent ex vivo expansion in the presence of the immunomodulatory drug&#xD;
      rapamycin, Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and CD3/CD28 expander beads (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ER-TREG 01 is a single-center, open-label, fast-track phase I dose-escalation study designed&#xD;
      to assess the safety profile and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of a single infusion of ex vivo&#xD;
      expanded autologous Treg in patients with active ulcerative colitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the primary cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development remains unknown, it&#xD;
      is widely accepted that the initial events culminate in persistent immune responses with&#xD;
      infiltration of immune cells and tissue destruction in the gut. Immune cell populations&#xD;
      present within the inflamed bowel wall of IBD patients have been extensively characterized&#xD;
      and studied (1;6). Studies focusing on T cells have demonstrated that the mucosa of Crohn's&#xD;
      disease (CD) patients is dominated by Th1 cells, while in patients with ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC) T helper cells with an atypical Th2 profile, which excessively produce IL-5 and IL-13&#xD;
      but not IL-4, are abundant (7). Furthermore, Th17 cells can be identified in the inflamed&#xD;
      lamina propria and these cells are thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of IBD, although the pathogenic mechanisms of these cells are not yet fully understood (8;9).&#xD;
      Treg are also present within the lamina propria and these cells control the effector T cell&#xD;
      populations mentioned above. They can be generated through the interaction of local T cells&#xD;
      with CD103 expressing dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial cells, respectively (10;11).&#xD;
      Moreover, the expression of integrins on the Treg surface (e.g. α4β7) facilitates mucosal&#xD;
      migration through their interaction with specific ligands (e.g. MAdCAM1). As such, homing and&#xD;
      local expansion of Treg cells create a local Treg pool that is essential for self-tolerance&#xD;
      and the support of gut homeostasis (12). In addition, Treg cells are shown to suppress&#xD;
      proinflammatory intestinal immune responses in colitis and colitis-associated cancer (13-16)&#xD;
      and they are thought to augment intestinal Th17 responses (17). As previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated insufficient expansion of mucosal Treg cells in IBD patients in comparison to&#xD;
      the massive local expansion of effector T cells, it is likely that the relatively low number&#xD;
      of Treg cells in IBD patients explains why these cells fail to control excessive immune&#xD;
      responses (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental colitis studies in mice have demonstrated that colitogenic immune responses can&#xD;
      be controlled by increasing the number of mucosal Treg cells and highlight the potential of&#xD;
      Treg-based cell therapy in IBD (19). Specifically, co-transfer of naïve CD4+ T cells with&#xD;
      Treg both prevents chronic colitis and ameliorates established colitis in severe combined&#xD;
      immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (20). Moreover, CD4+ T cells expanded ex vivo in the presence of&#xD;
      rapamycin prevent the development of colitis in a naïve CD4+ T cell model in SCID mice.&#xD;
      Importantly, the systemic administration of rapamycin alone only partially prevented the&#xD;
      development of colonic Inflammation (20). In addition, the adoptive transfer of nTreg cells&#xD;
      as well as the adoptive transfer of ex vivo transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced Treg&#xD;
      (iTreg) suppressed colitis activity in vivo in mouse models (13;15;21). Collectively, these&#xD;
      data suggest that Treg cells could be used for therapy of intestinal inflammation in IBD&#xD;
      (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow an adoptive transfer of large numbers of Treg, CD25+ Treg cells are isolated from an&#xD;
      autologous leukapheresis product and in vitro expanded during 21 days in the presence of the&#xD;
      additives Interleukin-2 (IL-2), rapamycin and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 expander beads. After 21&#xD;
      days of expansion, anti-CD3/anti-CD28 expander beads are removed from the Treg drug product.&#xD;
      Next, Treg are frozen in aliquots of 10 Million Treg/mL until further use (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve patients, including 10% patient loss, resulting in at least ten treated and fully&#xD;
      evaluable patients, will be enrolled in this single-center, open-label, fast-track&#xD;
      dose-escalation study. Autologous ex vivo expanded CD4+CD25+CD127-/lo Treg cells will be&#xD;
      adoptively transferred in patients with ulcerative colitis with active disease or stable&#xD;
      disease under the allowed concomintant therapy at the time of enrollment. The maximal&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose that does not produce more than one dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) among a total of four treated patients at the particular dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first enrolled patient will receive the initial starting dose of 0.5 x10e6 Treg/kg&#xD;
      bodyweight. Adoptive transfer is escalated to the next dose level (1 x 10e6 Treg/kg, 2 x 10e6&#xD;
      Treg/kg, 5 x 10e6/Treg/kg and 10 x 10e6 Treg/kg bodyweight), in a next patient, if no DLT&#xD;
      occurs. Consecutive patients will be treated at least four weeks apart to monitor acute&#xD;
      severe adverse advents. If a DLT is noted, three additional patients will receive the same&#xD;
      dose level. Dose-escalation continues until at least two patients among a cohort of four&#xD;
      patients experience a DLT. If two patients among a cohort of four patients experience a DLT,&#xD;
      dose de-escalation to the highest previously tolerated dose-level will follow. Three&#xD;
      additional patients will receive the highest previously tolerated dose. If a DLT is noted in&#xD;
      at least two patients at the tested dose-level, dose de-escalation will continue until less&#xD;
      than two patients have experienced a DLT. After successful enrollment at the highest&#xD;
      dose-level, five additional patients will be enrolled at the highest dose level to extend&#xD;
      safety assessment. If no DLTs or less than two DLTs are experienced at all dose-levels&#xD;
      tested, the MTD is not reached. In this case, a maximal administered dose (MAD) is defined.&#xD;

             control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1 percent&#xD;
             per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables,&#xD;
             combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or&#xD;
             a vasectomized partner. For subjects using a hormonal contraceptive method,&#xD;
             information regarding the product under evaluation and its potential effect on the&#xD;
