  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the safety of GH001 (containing&#xD;
      5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine; 5-MeO-DMT), and to investigate its effects on severity of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, and its dose-related psychoactive effects in patients with&#xD;
      Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of two open-label, single-arm study parts where Part A evaluates&#xD;
      single doses of GH001 at two dose levels and Part B evaluates a specific individualized&#xD;
      dosing regimen of GH001.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 (Part A):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses&#xD;
      of GH001 (containing 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine; 5-MeO-DMT) in patients with TRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the effects of single doses of GH001 on&#xD;
      various measures of depression, and on dose-related psychoactive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Part B):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of an individualized dosing&#xD;
      regimen of GH001 on the severity of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and tolerability of an&#xD;
      individualized dosing regimen of GH001 in patients with TRD and its effects on the severity&#xD;
      of depression, other measures of depression, and on dose-related psychoactive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Phase 1/2 study in two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: In the Phase 1 (Part A), a single dose of GH001 will be administered per&#xD;
      patient. Two different dose levels will be investigated with four patients at each dose&#xD;
      level. In the Phase 2 (Part B), an individualized dosing regimen will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts, GH001 will be administered via inhalation.&#xD;

    <description>Phase 1: The primary endpoint is a binary variable (yes/no) reflecting a combined medical/clinical evaluation of the occurrence of Outcomes 5 to 13. The endpoint will be considered met for any dose level or regimen if the Study Safety Group (SSG) - through a qualitative medical/clinical evaluation - considers that dose level or regimen sufficiently safe and tolerable for potential further clinical development in a subsequent study.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2: The assessment is done with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a diagnostic questionnaire with ten items for measuring the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. A higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item is scored from 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>
