  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study, is testing a program to improve lung health through smoking&#xD;
      cessation and providing education around lung screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study involves Studying the Enhanced Smoking Cessation Approaches to Promote&#xD;
      Empowerment (ESCAPE) program compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESCAPE program was developed help women with HIV quit smoking. Women in the ESCAPE&#xD;
      program quit smoking and stayed quit for longer (up to 3 months). For this study,&#xD;
      investigators have added a lung screening to the ESCAPE program and want to test if this will&#xD;
      improve lung health through increasing quit rates and lung screening.&#xD;

      -  This is a research study, is testing a program to improve lung health through smoking&#xD;
           cessation and providing education around lung screening. The research study procedures&#xD;
           include: screening for eligibility and study interventions including participation in&#xD;
           counseling and completion of questionnaires by e-mail, phone or in-person.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves participating in either the Enhanced Smoking Cessation&#xD;
           Approaches to Promote Empowerment (ESCAPE) program or the usual care. Participants will&#xD;
           be randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ESCAPE: The ESCAPE program provides 8 counseling sessions over the phone, provides&#xD;
                nicotine replacement therapy at no cost, and education about lung screening&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Usual Care: The usual care program will include 1 counseling session, nicotine&#xD;
                replacement therapy at no cost referral and enrollment in quitworks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in this research study for up to 6-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 250 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

The scale scores range from 1-7 with 7 indicating greater engagement.</description>

    <measure>Polygenic risk score (PRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will construct three PRS. The first will be based on the lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 183 independent genetic loci associated at genome-wide significance (p&lt;5x10-8) with ever smoking status in adults from the UK Biobank and the Tobacco and Alcohol Genetic Consortium. The risk will be calculated as the weighted sum of each genetic variant, under an additive genetic model, counting the number of copies of the risk increasing allele. The weights will be proportional to the estimated effect size of each SNP. The second risk score will be constructed from a larger set of SNPs (~1 million) from the same GWAS using LDPred that allows for the construction of more powerful PRSs for specific racial groups using linkage disequilibrium information from large genetic reference panels. Finally, we will also construct a PRS based on the GWAS results for the largest available study specifically for nicotine dependence using the LDPred approach.</description>
