  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both high and low environmental temperatures are associated worldwide with higher morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality and an estimated 8% of the mortality is estimated to relate to non-optimum&#xD;
      temperatures. The majority of the adverse health effects occur at to low, and not high&#xD;
      temperatures, and already with a modest change in temperature. Persons with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      can be sensitive to the effect of temperature due to their altered neural, metabolic and&#xD;
      circulatory functions. The pathophysiological responses of type 2 diabetes in a cold and hot&#xD;
      environment are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine how advanced type 2 diabetes (disease progression &gt;10&#xD;
      years) alone, an in conjunction with coronary artery diseases and hypertension affect neural,&#xD;
      cardiovascular and metabolic responses in a cold and hot environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes is associated with altered neural regulation, weakened cardiovascular&#xD;
      function, structural changes in blood vessels, altered blood constitution and metabolic&#xD;
      disturbances. These affect thermoregulation and result in increased susceptibility to cold&#xD;
      (lesser heat production, increased heat loss) and heat (lesser sweating and heat loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are exposed under controlled conditions in a random order to both cold (+10째C)&#xD;
      and heat (+44째C) while resting and lightly clothed for 90 min at a time. The exposure itself&#xD;
      is preceded by baseline measurements of the parameters of interest, and followed by repeating&#xD;
      the same measurements after the exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The topic of the research is very relevant due to the worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, the comorbid conditions associated with diabetes become more common and are&#xD;
      related to a higher occurrence of cardiac events. The research information is useful for all&#xD;
      individuals with type 2 diabetes in their protection and self-management of the disease, and&#xD;
      enabling to maintain functional ability in a cold or hot environment. The research knowledge&#xD;
      can be utilized when developing weather warning systems for the identification of susceptible&#xD;
      populations. Health care personnel may utilize the research information while advising their&#xD;
      patients and for proper care. An increased awareness of the health effects of both low and&#xD;
      high temperatures improve the functional ability of individuals and reduced help reducing&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality from weather conditions.&#xD;

      Significance of the project in relation to current knowledge Temperature, health and climate&#xD;
      change. Both high and low and environmental temperatures cause discomfort and degradation of&#xD;
      physical performance. These normal physiological responses elicited to lose or preserve body&#xD;
      heat can aggravate the course of chronic diseases and lead to a higher amount of health care&#xD;
      visits, hospitalizations, or deaths. Globally, most of the adverse health effects are caused&#xD;
      by cold, rather than heat, and occur already at mild non-optimal temperatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental temperatures reflect the primary effects of climate change (CC), the biggest&#xD;
      health threat of the 21st century. CC primarily involves a global increase of temperatures,&#xD;
      and especially in the frequency, intensity and duration of heat extremes. Connected to the&#xD;
      variability of weather, also higher amounts of precipitation, clouds, and winds are&#xD;
      predicted. Northern climates, such as Finland, are subjects to huge annual variations in&#xD;
      temperature (from ca. +30째C to -30째C) together with periodic prolongation of temperature&#xD;
      extremes (heat and cold spells). Global projections predict that health effects of cold&#xD;
      continue to outnumber those of heat in Finland, but heat exposure becomes increasingly&#xD;
      important, also due to the lack of adaptation to high temperatures of northern residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2D and temperature. The global occurrence of diabetes is 425 million people of which 77% are&#xD;
      working aged and is estimated to increase to 629 million people by 2045. Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D) accounts for 90% of the diabetic patients. In Finland, the incidence of T2D has&#xD;
      increased markedly in men for the last 35 years. Diabetes of all types can lead to micro-&#xD;
      (retino-, nephro- and neuropathies) and macrovascular (cerebral, coronary and peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease) complications and resulting in higher morbidity and premature deaths. The&#xD;
      economic burden of the direct and indirect costs of diabetes is tremendous and represented&#xD;
      1.8% of the GDP in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies suggest that non-optimal environmental temperatures and diabetes are&#xD;
      associated with higher morbidity and mortality. A study of 4.5 Million GP consultations&#xD;
      showed that persons having T2D sought medical attention more often with both low and high&#xD;
      temperatures. Furthermore, cold and hot temperatures were associated with a 12% and a 30%&#xD;
      increase in diabetes-related hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heat exposure may involve a lesser ability to lose additional body heat (higher heat load) to&#xD;
      the environment and higher cardiovascular strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there are only three controlled studies that have assessed whole-body heat&#xD;
      exposure among persons with T2D. In healthy persons high temperatures dilates superficial&#xD;
      blood vessels enabling conveying additional body heat to the environment. Consequently, blood&#xD;
      flow is directed to the body surface augmenting heart rate and cardiac workload. In persons&#xD;
      with T2D the dilation of the blood vessels may be delayed and lead to diminished capacity to&#xD;
      lose heat through skin circulation. In addition, disrupted endothelial function and&#xD;
      stiffening of blood vessels can lead to an attenuated reduction in blood pressure. Factors,&#xD;
      such as reduced sweating capacity, as well as autonomic and peripheral neuropathies may&#xD;
      further impair the ability to lose body heat to the environment. In fact, a study involving&#xD;
      older adults with T2D detected reduced capacity to lose additional body heat during exercise,&#xD;
      resulting in greater thermal strain. Also, cardiac regulation and ability to increase cardiac&#xD;
      workload could be impaired in T2D under exposure to heat. Supporting this, older (ca. 60&#xD;
      yrs.) persons with T2D showed reduced heart rate variability and response to heat. Lastly,&#xD;
      hypercoagulation of persons with T2D could be further increased during heat exposure, but&#xD;
      there are no studies of the topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cold exposure may involve higher cardiovascular strain and a reduced ability to produce or&#xD;
      preserve (increased heat loss) body heat in cold weather in persons with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no previous controlled studies which assess the effects of whole-body cold exposure&#xD;
      among persons with T2D. In healthy persons exposure to low temperature increases sympathetic&#xD;
      activity which constricts superficial blood vessels, results in elevated blood pressure and&#xD;
      cardiac workload. The aggravated blood pressure increase in persons with T2D can be due to&#xD;
      sympathetic over activity, disrupted endothelial function and stiffer arteries. The altered&#xD;
      neural regulation in T2D may impair cardiac responsiveness to the higher cardiac workload and&#xD;
      oxygen demand in cold. Cold exposure also increase blood coagulation potential, which&#xD;
      together with hypercoagulability related with T2D, could promote the production of thromboses&#xD;
      and adverse cardiac events. Microvascular dysfunction associated with autonomic neuropathy&#xD;
      can also impair vascular responsiveness during local cooling and possibly increase&#xD;
      susceptibility to low temperatures. Cold exposure may also be related to reduced heat&#xD;
      production (shivering thermogenesis or reduction in brown adipose tissue activity and mass).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modifying factors possibly affecting vulnerability to high or low temperature of T2D High&#xD;
      blood pressure is reported in over two-thirds of patients with T2D and the incidence of&#xD;
      diabetes and hypertension (HTN) predicts each other over time. The two diseases share common&#xD;
      metabolic abnormalities and insulin resistance is a characteristic of both prediabetes and&#xD;
      prehypertension. Like diabetes, also cardiovascular diseases are temperature sensitive.&#xD;
      Glycemic control may be important for coping with thermal stress, but the available evidence&#xD;
      is scarce. Heat exposure, especially when combined with exercise, can induce hypoglycemia. On&#xD;
      the other hand, a brief acclimation period to repeated mild cold exposure can improve insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and glycemic state. Medication associated with both treatment of T2D itself&#xD;
      (metformin, gliptines, gliflotsines) or HTN (beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium-channel&#xD;
      blockers, ACE-inhibitors), could significantly affect cardiovascular and thermal responses,&#xD;
      but their association with health outcomes are not known. Regular physical activity itself&#xD;
      reduces HbA1c, but may also improve heat dissipation capacity, but the mechanisms are&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aims are:1) Assess how advanced T2D in combination with hypertension, influences&#xD;
      cardiovascular function and associated neural, and metabolic responses during whole-body&#xD;
      passive exposure to heat (activating heat loss through higher superficial circulation and&#xD;
      sweating) and cold (causing increase in heat production and reduction in superficial&#xD;
      circulation) and compared with healthy persons. 2) Eamine how different diabetic micro- and&#xD;
      macrovascular complications involving varying degrees of severity, affect the observed&#xD;
      cardiovascular, neural and metabolic functions while exposed to either cold or heat. 3)&#xD;
      Assess how T2D (diagnosed or detected during clinical examination) alone, and in combination&#xD;
      with hypertension (diagnosed or measured during clinical examination) affect reported cold-&#xD;
      or heat-related cardiorespiratory symptoms and consequently, from a longitudinal perspective,&#xD;
      hospitalizations and mortality. We also aim to identify the influence of potential&#xD;
      determinants, such as the use of medication, physical activity and other demographic,&#xD;
      socioeconomic and lifestyle factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypotheses: 1) Exposure of those with T2D may lead to earlier heat strain due to&#xD;
      reduced ability to lose (reduced sweating and circulation) bodily heat at high temperatures.&#xD;
      2) Exposure to cold may lead to earlier cold strain due to weakened ability to preserve&#xD;
      (impaired circulation) or produce bodily heat (shivering) at low temperatures. 3) Having more&#xD;
      complications increase the vulnerability to these environments. 4) At the population level,&#xD;
      people with T2D report more heat- and cold-related cardiorespiratory symptoms and experience&#xD;
      more hospitalizations and deaths. These effects are dependent on the glycemic and blood&#xD;
      pressure control, use of medication and other lifestyle factors. 5) Health care visits and&#xD;
      mortality are preceded by temperatures that are higher or lower than average.&#xD;
