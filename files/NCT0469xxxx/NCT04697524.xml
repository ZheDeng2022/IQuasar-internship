    <textblock>
      This trial investigates whether a joint and integrative approach to cancer care using&#xD;
      palliative care and psycho-oncology is possible, and if it's beneficial to patients with&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places on the body (advanced). The information gained from&#xD;
      this study may help patients to learn about the medicinal and non-medicinal strategies to&#xD;
      cope with their symptoms and side effects of their diagnosis and treatment while receiving&#xD;
      peer support, in addition to standard individualized medical care.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To develop and refine a joint Integrative Palliative Care/Psycho-oncology telehealth group&#xD;
      medical visit (GMV) intervention based on feedback from an open pilot study with patient exit&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of the telehealth GMVs in a separate,&#xD;
      single-arm pilot evaluation among patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the preliminary efficacy of the GMVs among patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the financial viability of the GMVs. II. To measure the utilization of other&#xD;
      supportive care services at Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) and the&#xD;
      Osher Center 3 months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) healthcare utilization of&#xD;
      participants 3 months post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I: The group-based intervention is developed, tested, and continuously refined based on&#xD;
      participant feedback. Within 14 days of the first weekly group intervention, patients&#xD;
      complete baseline questionnaires over 30-45 minutes about their sleep habits, pain&#xD;
      management, anxiety/depression, and other symptoms. Patients then participate in a telehealth&#xD;
      group medical intervention program over 2 hours weekly for up to 4 sessions where they review&#xD;
      topics specific to managing fatigue and sleep habits, managing pain, managing emotional&#xD;
      distress, and managing other symptoms and advanced care planning. During the weekly sessions,&#xD;
      patients have the opportunity to meet with their symptom management service (SMS) provider in&#xD;
      a separate virtual space for individual consultation over 5 minutes to discuss symptoms that&#xD;
      they do not feel comfortable sharing in the larger group. The SMS provider may recommend&#xD;
      specific interventions or resources for patients to discuss with their oncology, primary&#xD;
      care, integrative medicine, psycho-oncology, or palliative care providers as appropriate.&#xD;
      Patients also participate in an exit interview over 30 minutes to 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Based on the feedback given in the first phase, three new cohorts of participants&#xD;
      are recruited to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the refined intervention using&#xD;
      similar procedures as in Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 7 and 14 days, and then up to 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
