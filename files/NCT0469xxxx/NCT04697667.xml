      This study is a prospective randomized controlled study of different treatments for knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and aims to investigate the efficacy of exercise combined platelet rich plasma&#xD;
      (PRP) injection versus only exercise or only PRP treatments.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured using the numerical pain rating scale. Patients are asked to circle the number between 0 and 10 that fits best to their pain intensity. Zero usually represents 'no pain at all' whereas the upper limit represents 'the worst pain ever possible'.</description>

    <description>Functional status of the patients will be evaluated by The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis (WOMAC) Index. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales (Pain, Stiffness and Physical Function). The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4). Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse results.</description>

    <measure>Functional performance - 40m fast-paced walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Functional performance of the patients will be evaluated by 40-meter fast-paced walk test. Participants are asked to walk as quickly but as safely as possible, without running, along a 10-meter walkway for a total distance of 40 meters. Walking speed will be measured in meters/second (m/s).</description>

    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Functional performance of the patients will be evaluated by 10-step stair-climb test. Patients are instructed to ascend and descend the flight of stairs as quickly as possible but in a safe manner. The time needed is recorded in seconds.</description>
