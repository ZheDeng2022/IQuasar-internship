  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hashimoto's disease (HT) and psoriasis (PsO) have a significant impact on patient's quality&#xD;
      of everyday life, and early diagnosis is critical for the symptoms management and prognosis.&#xD;
      There is evidence that HT and PsO share common metabolic pathways that relate to their&#xD;
      pathogenesis, and are affected by dietary and lifestyle factors. Previous studies have&#xD;
      identified potential metabolic biomarkers, although the small number of studies hamper their&#xD;
      validation. Of note, most studies are not longitudinal thus do not capture the metabolic&#xD;
      fluctuations in response to disease progression or dietary changes. Thus, the purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to identify metabolic biomarkers of HT and PsO and study the role of epigenetic&#xD;
      factors (diet and lifestyle) on the involved metabolic pathways . In addition, a comparative&#xD;
      analysis of the disease-related quality of life (QoL) will be performed in relation to&#xD;
      dietary changes to unravel possible links between the QoL and the associated metabolic&#xD;
      pathways in HT and PsO.&#xD;

      Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), patients with psoriasis (PsO), and healthy&#xD;
      individuals aged 18-60 will be recruited and assessed according to inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Eligible participants will be randomized to two groups. The intervention group will&#xD;
      receive a combinational nutraceuticals plan for 6 months as part of a Mediterranean diet and&#xD;
      the control group will follow usual diet. Data will be collected at baseline and at the end&#xD;
      of the study including levels of organic and fatty acids, lifestyle and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, adherence to Mediterranean diet through the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and&#xD;
      disease-specific quality of life through the Thyroid Patient Report Outcome (THYPRO) and the&#xD;
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaires for the HT and the PsO group&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
