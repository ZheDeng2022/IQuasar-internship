  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, waitlist controlled trial is to examine the efficacy of the&#xD;
      Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT©) in reducing psychological distress (i.e., stress,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression) and burnout symptoms while improving psychological well-being medical&#xD;
      students. The second goal of the study is to examine whether mindfulness and&#xD;
      compassion-related variables as well as emotional-cognitive emotional regulation processes&#xD;
      mediate the psychological distress and well-being changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of the CCT© program will be measured by means of self-report questionnaires&#xD;
      involving different domains (mindfulness, compassion, distress, and well-being measures) at&#xD;
      different time points (pre-intervention, inter-session assessment, post-intervention, 2-month&#xD;
      and 6-month follow-up).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compassion and empathy are essential components of health care quality. Several studies have&#xD;
      found a significant decrease in empathy and compassion levels during medical school and&#xD;
      residency (Hojat, 2004; Bellini, 2005; Stephen, 2006; Neumann, 2011). However, compassion&#xD;
      training is usually excluded from medical education. Compassion training in medical students&#xD;
      can increase their wellness and decreased burnout (Weingartner, 2019), which in turn improves&#xD;
      patients clinical outcomes (Kim, 2004; Rakel, 2009; Hojat, 2011; Attar 2012; Del Canale,&#xD;
      2012; Steinhausen, 2014; Trzeciak, 2017; Moss, 2019). Given that compassion can be trained&#xD;
      through standardized interventions (Stephen, 2006; Hojat, 2009a; Goetz, 2010; Kelm, 2014) and&#xD;
      educational programs (Patel, 2019), it highlight the need to investigate interventions aimed&#xD;
      to improving both, provider self-care and patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT©) program would improve psychological well-being&#xD;
           while reducing psychological distress (stress, anxiety and depression) and burnout&#xD;
           symptoms in medical students as compared to a waitlist control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These improvements would be maintained at 2 and 6 months after finishing the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mindfulness and compassion changes and emotional-cognitive emotional regulation&#xD;
           processes would mediate the relationship between the program and the psychological&#xD;
           distress and well-being changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compassion skills after the program will be a protective factor for stress and worry&#xD;
           produced by COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow a randomised waitlist controlled trial with five assessment moments&#xD;
      (i.e., pre, inter-session, post, 2-month and 6-month follow-ups). Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited via constitutional email and the informative screens of the Medical School at&#xD;
      Complutense University of Madrid. Participants will be randomized to either CCT© group (N=20)&#xD;
      or waiting list control group (N=20). The procedure will include an online assessment via&#xD;
      Qualtrics software at the different time points, as well as the completion of a &quot;practice&#xD;
      diary&quot; as the inter-session assessment one per week the day before each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT©) is an 8-week evidence-based standardized&#xD;
      meditation program designed at Standford University. The CCT© is aimed at cultivating&#xD;
      compassion and empathy toward oneself and others. The program is conducted in groups of 15-20&#xD;
      participants and consisting of weekly 2 hour on-line sessions (due to COVID-19 restrictions)&#xD;
      with 20-30 minutes of daily formal meditation practices and informal compassion practices.&#xD;
      The CCT© program will be guided by a certified instructor from the Compassion Institute.&#xD;
      Program adherence and fidelity will be monitored through revisions of the recorded sessions.&#xD;
      The CCT© program comprises six sequential steps: 1) Settling the mind; 2) Loving-kindness and&#xD;
      compassion for a loved one; 3) Self-directed loving-kindness and compassion; 4) Common&#xD;
      humanity; 5) Cultivating compassion for others; and 6) Active compassion (Tonglen).&#xD;
