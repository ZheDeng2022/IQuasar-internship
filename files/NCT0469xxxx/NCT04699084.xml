      To investigate the effect of Mozart music on postoperative pain and physiological parameters&#xD;
      in patients after total thyroidectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is a major concern in postsurgical patients. Meanwhile, there is a general&#xD;
      consensus on minimizing the use of analgesic drugs in patients undergoing total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy. Therefore, alternative methods need to be investigated in order to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative pain. Although the clinical importance of music has been recognised in other&#xD;
      pathological situations, further research is needed to investigate the effect of music on&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of VAS was evaluated; from the beginning (time of arrival at the PACU, baseline), to the middle (10 minutes after surgery), to the end of the music intervention (20 minutes after surgery) at the PACU and to 2 hours after surgery in the ward.</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative Pain was measured with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). This is a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 100 mm. The ends of the line are defined as the extreme limits of the measured parameter (pain). Specifically, the left end signifies the complete absence of pain and the right end represents the worst possible pain. Patients were asked to rate their pain by indicating a point on the straight line. Higher VAS scores mean more pain intensity. The more is the reduction of VAS score from the baseline measurement, the better is the outcome.</description>
