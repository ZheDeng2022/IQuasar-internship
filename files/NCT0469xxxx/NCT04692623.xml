      EFFECTS OF MOXIFLOXACIN AND GEMIFLOXACIN ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL OF EUGLYCEMICS:A PRE-CLINICAL&#xD;
      AND CLINICAL STUDY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim and objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify the possible mechanism of secretion of insulin via ATP-sensitive K+ channels&#xD;
           through power lab in comparison to a standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the blood glucose, insulin and C-Peptide levels in animal model plus&#xD;
           euglycemics using Moxifloxacin and Gemifloxacin in their recommended daily doses per&#xD;
           oral route and to check the histomorphological features changes of the pancreatic tissue&#xD;
           of rabbits (in vivo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Translate the results of animal model and healthy volunteers for possible effects on&#xD;
           release of insulin, peptide and subsequent shift in blood glucose level of healthy&#xD;
           volunteer (target population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the above entitled studies we are going to determine the effects of the above two 4th&#xD;
      generation fluoroquinolones drugs on the blood glucose levels of euglycemics healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.The drug will be gave as per approved standard adult dose.The drug is FDA approved&#xD;
      and marketed drug.No risk is to the patient only 3-5 ml of the blood will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline and after the drug completion at steady state concentration.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted under good clinical practice guidelines and a consent form will&#xD;
      be signed from the healthy volunteers as per design of World health organization.The study&#xD;
      has no harmful effects on the heaths of the volunteers as we are conducting the study for&#xD;
      five dose/one pack drug will be gaven. The volunteers will be sampled randomly and the effect&#xD;
      of the said drugs will be determined on blood glucose and insulin level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus (DM), a non-communicable disease, which is considered now-a-days a life&#xD;
      threatening disease to the human health (1,2).According to the report of International&#xD;
      Diabetes Federation (IFD) and World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes mellitus is one of&#xD;
      the World's fifth leading cause of mortality and about 415 million people of the world's&#xD;
      population have diabetes mellitus in 2018 (3). After every 6 seconds, a person dies from&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (4, 5). Pakistan is a country with 7th highest diabetic population in the&#xD;
      world and it is assumed to rise to 4th highest place by 2030 (6). Due to sedentary life style&#xD;
      of People, there is a maximum increase of DM in the last decade (7). DM is classified into&#xD;
      two classes i.e. Type I and Type II (8). The Type I diabetes is much more common. It is due&#xD;
      to defective insulin secretion or insulin action or both (9). The Type II diabetes is&#xD;
      now-a-days attributed to genetic disorders affecting the beta cells of the pancreas (10), or&#xD;
      the ability of body cells to respond to insulin action leading to insulin resistance DM (11,&#xD;
      12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a group of antibacterial antibiotics. Newer fluoroquinolones has&#xD;
      expanded its traditional coverage from Gram-negative coverage to Gram-positive as well as to&#xD;
      anaerobic organisms (14-16). It has been used since 2-3 decades and has been observed to have&#xD;
      excellent anti-microbial coverage, but unfortunately the FQs are associated with adverse drug&#xD;
      events including strong dysglycemic effects which has also led to irreversible brain damage&#xD;
      and even death (17). Till date, six different types of adverse drug reactions have been&#xD;
      reported with Fluoroquinolones. These include prolongation of QT interval, Photo toxicity,&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity and alteration in the blood glucose hemostasis (hyperglycemia or sometimes&#xD;
      hypoglycemia), damage to the tendons leading to tendinitis (18). Canadian Adverse Drug&#xD;
      Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP) reported that three marketed fluoroquinolones namely&#xD;
      gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacilin are under Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders&#xD;
      category. Among them Temafloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin have been reported to be&#xD;
      associated with hemolysis (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been assumed that the dysglycemic effects of FQs mainly occur through their action on&#xD;
      the ATP- sensitive K + channels. According to definition, an agent that causes the selective&#xD;
      relaxation of an induced contractility due to low K+ (20-25 mM) is grouped as K+ channel&#xD;
      opener. From the studies it can be assumed that fluoroquinolones may block the ATP-sensitive&#xD;
      K+ channels as well as the opening of as Calcium channels that are voltage dependent (22).&#xD;
      These opened Calcium channels further depolarize the membrane potential ultimately releasing&#xD;
      insulin. These Studies reveals that fluoroquinolones have pancreatic beta cell cytotropic&#xD;
      activity, however the dysglycemic effects of Moxifloxacin and Gemifloxacin have not been&#xD;
      proven but very strong associations have been demonstrated via some case report studies (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping in view all these studies and developments regarding the adverse effects associated&#xD;
      with fluoroquinolones specially the dysglycemic effects due to cytotropic influence on the&#xD;
      beta cells of the pancreas it is now very much needed to actually correlate these effects&#xD;
      seen in the beta cells of the pancreas with the pancreatic tissue histopathological changes.&#xD;
      Since, Moxifloxacin and Gemifloxacin are a new generation quinolones, thus our study focuses&#xD;
      on them to get a clear picture of its possible shift of blood glucose and insulin in our&#xD;
      society. Thus the hallmark of our study is to focus on dysglycemic effects (either&#xD;
      hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic effects) associated with quinolones, it is not clear to get a&#xD;
      clear picture on blood glucose level until it is tested in control environment of a&#xD;
      preclinical study, and to translate the possible effects of the preclinical study in a&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial of healthy volunteers who are euglycemics as well.&#xD;
