      Pain relief after renal surgeries is essential as it may lead to reduction in the incidence&#xD;
      of many post operative complications .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a lot of regional anesthetic techniques to provide analgesia postoperatively as&#xD;
      paravertebral block (PVB) and transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP block has been used to provide postoperative analgesia in a lot of abdominal surgeries&#xD;
      including upper abdominal surgeries.It is safer technique than PVB, but the effectiveness of&#xD;
      TAP block is unknown in comparison with PVB in post operative analgesia after renal surgeries&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pain relief after renal surgeries is essential as it may lead to reduction in the incidence&#xD;
      of post operative respiratory complications . A lot of patients presented to these operations&#xD;
      may have comorbidities as impaired renal function and respiratory problems , conditions like&#xD;
      these may contraindicate aministration of systemic analgesia as opioids .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a lot of techniques to provide analgesia postoperatively as paravertebral block&#xD;
      (PVB) and transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block is effective technique for post operative analgesia for upper abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries , but it may be associated with some complications as : pneumothorax , spread of&#xD;
      local anesthetic to the epidural space and paravertebral blood vessels , and this may lead to&#xD;
      systemic toxicity of local anesthetic .&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP block has been used to provide postoperative analgesia in a lot of abdominal surgeries&#xD;
      including upper abdominal surgeries , but it is safer technique than PVB , but the&#xD;
      effectiveness of TAP block is unknown in comparison with PVB in post operative analgesia&#xD;
      after renal surgeries .&#xD;

    <description>Thoracic paravertebral block is a technique in which , the local anesthetic agent is injected in the paravertebral space to anesthetise the spinal nerves after emerging from the vertebral canal in order to provide analgesia in the thoracic and upper abdominal area .</description>

    <intervention_name>Transversus abdominis plane block</intervention_name>
    <description>Transversus abdominis plane block is a technique is mostly done under ultrasound guidance to identify the transversus plane between the internal oblique muscle and the transverses abdominis muscle , the space in which the neurovascular supply of the anterior abdominal wall is present , and hence the injection of local anesthetic agent in this space results in anesthesia of the anterolateral aspect of the abdominal wall.</description>
