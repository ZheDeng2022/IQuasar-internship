  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm, Phase 3, 2-part, open-label, multicenter study aims to demonstrate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of L606 in patients with PAH switching from a stable Tyvaso dose. The&#xD;
      study will determine the short-term and long-term safety and tolerability of L606 in this&#xD;
      patient population; also evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of L606 as compared&#xD;
      to Tyvaso, effects on exercise ability, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction with L606&#xD;
      in patients with PAH.&#xD;

      This single-arm, Phase 3, 2-part, open-label, multicenter study aims to demonstrate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of repeated doses of L606 in patients with PAH switching from a&#xD;
      stable Tyvaso dose. The current Phase 3 study will help determine the short-term and&#xD;
      long-term safety and tolerability of L606 in this patient population. The study will also&#xD;
      evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of L606 as compared to Tyvaso, effects on&#xD;
      exercise ability (6-minute walk distance [6MWD] and Borg Dyspnea Score), quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL), and treatment satisfaction with L606 in patients with PAH. Part 1 of the study is&#xD;
      short-term (2-week) evaluation of L606 in patients with PAH. Part 2 of the study will&#xD;
      continue to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of L606 in patients with PAH. Results of&#xD;
      Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will be presented in separate clinical study reports and&#xD;
      clinical study report of Part 1 of the study will be submitted as part of new drug&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of Life assessed by PAH-specific Quality of Life questionnaire Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a validated PAH-specific instrument consisting of 65 items that assess overall symptoms (25 items), functioning (15 items), and QoL (25 items). The symptom and QoL scales have dichotomous (&quot;True&quot;/&quot;Not true&quot;) response options and the scores in each subscale can range from 0 to 25, where low score indicates less severe symptoms or good QoL. The functioning scale has 3-point (&quot;Able to do on own without difficulty&quot;/&quot;Able to do on own with difficulty&quot;/&quot;Unable to do on own&quot;) response options and the scores can range from 0 to 30, where low score indicates good functioning.</description>

    <measure>Treatment satisfaction of L606 assessed by Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQM)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is comprised of 14 items which represent 4 domains: effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction. The TSQM scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of L606 assessed by Borg Dyspnea Score</measure>

    <measure>Efficacy of L606 assessed by N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>NT-proBNP is released from cardiac myocytes in response to mechanical load and wall stress and correlates with several pulmonary hemodynamic metrics. NT proBNP is inactive but has a longer half-life compared with BNP (70 minutes versus 22 minutes) and is relatively stable in stored blood samples, hence is preferred as a biomarker of heart failure.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of L606 assessed by PAH symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue, dyspnea, edema, dizziness, syncope, chest pain, and orthopnea will be assessed prior to dosing at study site. The status of each sign and symptom will be assessed as 'present' or 'absent'. To assess overall change from baseline in signs and symptoms, a '1' will be assigned for each sign and symptom that is present at any postbaseline visit but absent at baseline, a '-1' will be assigned for each sign and symptom that is absent at any postbaseline visit but present at baseline, and a '0' will be assigned for no change. An overall change score at each postbaseline assessment will be calculated by summing these values for all signs and symptoms. The overall change score can range from -7 to +7.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
