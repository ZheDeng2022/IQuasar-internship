  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of the study drug YH001 . The study is designed&#xD;
      to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of YH001 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm clinical trial in subjects with advanced solid tumor receiving multiple&#xD;
      doses of YH001 intravenously (IV). YH001 will be administered (IV) in 19-37 patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. An accelerated titration method followed by a traditional 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation scheme will be utilized to determine MTD(maximum tolerated dose) and/or&#xD;
      RP2D(recommended phase 2 dose). Patients will be dosed at Dose A, Dose B, Dose C, Dose D,&#xD;
      Dose E, Dose F and Dose G every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 15 weeks (5 cycles).&#xD;
