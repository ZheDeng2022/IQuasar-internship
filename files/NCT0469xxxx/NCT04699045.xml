      Iron deficiency (ID) in early life is associated with significant morbidities. Most fetal&#xD;
      iron required for infant growth is acquired in the third trimester from maternal iron store.&#xD;
      However, how prenatal iron level affects newborn's ferritin level at birth and in early&#xD;
      infancy remains controversial. This study aimed to examine the associations between maternal&#xD;
      ferritin levels with cord blood serum ferritin (CBSF) and to compare the ferritin levels&#xD;
      between different feeding practices in early infancy.&#xD;

      Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common micronutrient deficiency globally. Pregnant women and&#xD;
      young children are at risk of ID. During pregnancy, there is an increased demand for iron to&#xD;
      accommodate the needs of the fetal-placental unit. This increase in physiologic demand for&#xD;
      iron renders pregnant women vulnerable to ID. In fact, ID is the major cause of anemia in&#xD;
      pregnancy and can increase the perinatal maternal morbidity and mortality. Iron is also an&#xD;
      essential micronutrient for fetal and infant brain development. ID in early life is&#xD;
      associated with worse cognitive, motor, social emotional as well as neurophysiological&#xD;
      development. Besides neurodevelopment, iron is also essential for proper immune function&#xD;
      affecting both innate and adaptive cell, and has implications for childhood atopic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, there is an increasing trend of breastfeeding especially in developed countries.In&#xD;
      Hong Kong, the government's continuing effort to promote breastfeeding has successfully&#xD;
      boosted the rate of babies being breastfed. This encouraging information means more children&#xD;
      will benefit from the many advantages of breast milk over formula milk, yet exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding, particularly in the context of maternal ID and late weaning, may be a risk&#xD;
      factor of ID in the infants. In view of the adverse impact of fetal and infant ID on&#xD;
      neurocognitive development, it is important to evaluate the iron status of young infants, the&#xD;
      effect of feeding practices on development of ID and the risk factors of ID in early infancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal ID is prevalent worldwide varying from 20% to 90%. Previous investigation performed&#xD;
      in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Prince of Wales Hospital, concurred a&#xD;
      significant prevalence (39%) of ID (serum ferritin &lt; 15 microgram/L) among 100 asymptomatic&#xD;
      pregnant women. Most fetal iron needed for infant growth is acquired in the third trimester&#xD;
      from maternal iron store, in preparation for the high growth rate in the first 6 months of&#xD;
      life. Iron status at birth is therefore critical and impaired iron status may persist into&#xD;
      early childhood. However, low maternal prenatal iron levels measured as serum ferritin have&#xD;
      not been consistently linked with low cord blood serum ferritin (CBSF) concentrations. Some&#xD;
      studies reported that there was no correlation between serum ferritin of mothers and babies.&#xD;
      However, others found that maternal ID or anemia, especially the severe type, adversely&#xD;
      affected cord blood or infant iron status. Further studies are needed to evaluate how&#xD;
      prenatal maternal iron status affects newborn's ferritin level at birth. Such data is&#xD;
      necessary to guide future recommendations regarding the need of iron supplement in pregnant&#xD;
      or lactating women and/or their infants. Hence, this study aimed to examine the associations&#xD;
      between maternal prenatal ferritin levels with CBSF and to compare the ferritin levels with&#xD;
      different feeding practices in early infancy at 3 months of age.&#xD;

        Healthy Chinese mothers with uncomplicated pregnancy were recruited from a cohort which was&#xD;
        established to evaluate gestational age specific thyroid function during pregnancy. Between&#xD;
        July 2014 and January 2016, pregnant women attended antenatal care in their first trimester&#xD;
        of pregnancy were recruited by research personnel in the antenatal clinic at the Prince of&#xD;
        Wales Hospital, which is a tertiary teaching hospital in Hong Kong. After delivery, mothers&#xD;
        were again approached and invited to join this study by research personnel in the postnatal&#xD;
        ward.&#xD;
