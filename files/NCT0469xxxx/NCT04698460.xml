  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare iFR-guided hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) and&#xD;
      traditional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in terms of a functional efficacy of&#xD;
      revascularization assessed by weighted average of iFRs measured 12 month post-procedure in&#xD;
      the qualified coronary arteries (all arteries with at least one significant lesion and&#xD;
      diameter &gt;1.5 mm at baseline). The true significance of coronary artery disease (CAD) is&#xD;
      reflected by the pressure gradients in coronary arteries showing the actual drop in&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion whereas the degree of anatomical narrowing in fact only indicates a&#xD;
      potential for hemodynamical changes that also depend on vessel compliance, distal vascular&#xD;
      resistance, and collateral circulation. Then, the true effect of myocardial revascularization&#xD;
      as treatment of CAD should be likewise assessed by measuring residual pressure gradients in&#xD;
      coronary arteries remaining after revascularization, i.e. as the functional efficacy in&#xD;
      analogy to the functional significance of CAD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      New generation of drug eluting stents (DES) have been shown to have better long-term patency&#xD;
      rates than the vein grafts utilized in conventional CABG. Then, it may be expected that&#xD;
      hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) combining minimally invasive direct coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass (MIDCAB) grafting of left anterior descending (LAD) artery by left internal mammary&#xD;
      artery (LIMA) and stenting of non-LAD coronary arteries with the new generation DESs may have&#xD;
      superior efficacy and safety compared to conventional CABG in patients with multivessel&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD). The true significance of CAD is reflected by the pressure&#xD;
      gradients in coronary arteries that show actual changes in coronary blood flow and myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion whereas the degree of anatomical narrowing only indicates a potential for the&#xD;
      hemodynamical changes that also depend on vessel compliance, distal vascular resistance, and&#xD;
      collateral circulation. Then, the true effect of myocardial revascularization as treatment of&#xD;
      CAD should be likewise assessed by measuring residual pressure gradients in coronary arteries&#xD;
      after revascularization, i.e. as the functional efficacy in analogy to the functional&#xD;
      significance of CAD. For multi-vessel disease the summary hemodynamic effectiveness of&#xD;
      revascularization may be captured either by continuous variable, e.g. averaged magnitude of&#xD;
      the post-procedural pressure gradients in the qualified arteries or by categorical index,&#xD;
      e.g. a relative proportion of the arteries with significant post-procedural pressure&#xD;
      gradients among the qualified arteries both preferably weighted for their significance in&#xD;
      myocardial blood supply. For comprehensive comparison of the revascularization strategies the&#xD;
      qualified arteries should include all arteries/branches that had significant disease at&#xD;
      baseline and were amenable to treatment with at least one of the revascularization methods,&#xD;
      e.g. with at least one stenosis &gt;70% and diameter &gt;1.5 mm. The categorical measure of the&#xD;
      functional efficacy may also be considered a measure of the functional completeness of&#xD;
      revascularization in analogy to the conventional anatomical completeness. This functional&#xD;
      completeness in terms of removal of all significant pressure gradients in coronary arteries&#xD;
      is expected to be superior to anatomical completeness for assessing the procedural success of&#xD;
      the intervention because the successful grafting/stent implantation does not guarantee the&#xD;
      permanent removal of the pressure gradients, which may still persist due to development of&#xD;
      intimal hyperplasia along the suture line of surgical anastomosis or stent&#xD;
      underexpansion/edge dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study is to assess whether iFR -guided HCR done as the staged&#xD;
      procedure with LIMA-LAD MIDCAB at first stage, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&#xD;
      of non-LAD arteries at the second stage, is superior to conventional CABG in terms of the&#xD;
      functional efficacy of revascularization assessed by the weighted average of iFRs measured 12&#xD;
      month post-procedure in all coronary arteries with at least one significant stenosis (&gt;70%&#xD;
      for CABG group, iFR ≤ 0.89 for iFR-guided HCR) and diameter ≥1.5 mm at baseline. For proximal&#xD;
      lesions in major coronary arteries - LAD, circumflex (Cx), and right coronary artery (RCA) -&#xD;
      the simple weights 0.5, 0.25, 0.25 will be used, respectively. For other lesions the Duke&#xD;
      jeopardy scores will be used instead. Measurement of functional efficacy at 12 month&#xD;
      post-procedure will allow assessment of the final result of the intervention after complete&#xD;
      vessel healing, endothelialization of the stents, on stable antithrombotic treatment, etc.&#xD;
      Also, this study will assess whether achieving the functional completeness of&#xD;
      revascularization described above in addition to the anatomical completeness of the procedure&#xD;
      may further improve the treatment outcomes in patients with multivessel CAD. Specifically,&#xD;
      the investigators will assess the relationship between the functional completeness of the&#xD;
      revascularization and the occurrence of the MACCE over 1, 3, and 5 years following&#xD;
      randomization in the patients with anatomically complete procedures. Finally, the hypothesis&#xD;
      will be tested that iFR-guided HCR has better overall safety than CABG. Whereas, compared to&#xD;
      CABG HCR is associated with less frequent perioperative complications, blood transfusions,&#xD;
      shorter ICU and hospital stays, these benefits of less invasive treatment may be overridden&#xD;
      by the additional complications of stenting, e.g. acute stent thrombosis, dissection,&#xD;
      arterial perforation/rupture and others. With iFR guidance of the HCR these additional&#xD;
      complications of PCI are expected to be less frequent and the whole procedure - more safe.&#xD;
