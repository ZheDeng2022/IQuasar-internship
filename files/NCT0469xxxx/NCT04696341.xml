    <textblock>
      Thirty individuals with chronic neck pain randomised into two groups. Group I (15 subjects)&#xD;
      received a total of 10 sessions as 5 sessions a week.Hot pack to cervical and upper thoracic&#xD;
      regions (20 minutes), conventional Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) (100 Hz&#xD;
      for 40 μsec), therapeutic ultrasound (1 Megahertz (MHz) for 5 minutes) and conventional&#xD;
      massage were applied. Five sessions of Matrix Rhythm Therapy (2., 5., 6., 8., 10. sessions of&#xD;
      combined physiotherapy programme) was added at combined physiotherapy Group II. Matrix Rhythm&#xD;
      Therapy was applied to cervical and thoracic regions using 10 Hz frequency for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain intensity was measured using by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measuring 10 cm. Muscle&#xD;
      spasm in cervical region was assessed by using a VAS measuring 10 cm. Turkish version of Neck&#xD;
      Disability Index (NDI) was used to assess the disability caused by neck pain. Turkish version&#xD;
      of Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess emotional status of participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included patients aged between 25-65 years who had neck pain for at least 3 months.&#xD;
      Patients with radiculopathy who had motor findings, who underwent any operations due to neck&#xD;
      problems, who had systemic, neurologic and psychiatric diseases, inflammatory or infectious&#xD;
      diseases, history of malignity, congenital anomalies, who benefited from another therapy&#xD;
      modality and the ones in whom physical therapy modalities could not be used due to&#xD;
      contraindications (individuals with sensory disorders, who use cardiac pace maker) were&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 36 individuals were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Randomization was allocated&#xD;
      by numbered envelopes method. A total of 30 subjects (15 in Matrix Rhythm Therapy (MRT) group&#xD;
      and 15 in CG) with neck pain due to mechanic causes like cervical discopathy, cervical&#xD;
      arthrosis or myofascial pain syndrome were participated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments were done by the same physiotherapist (FU) before therapy and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment sessions. The physiotherapist who did the assessments did not know to which group&#xD;
      the subjects were belonged. Another physiotherapist who was not informed about the results of&#xD;
      the evaluation treated the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based exercise programs and recommendations were also given to patients. Matrix Rhythm&#xD;
      Therapy is developed by Dr. Ulrich G. Randall at the university of Erlangen/Nuremberg.&#xD;
      Longitudinal stroking, compression and spooning techniques are specific methods of MRT.&#xD;
      Therapies of the patients were done by the physiotherapist who had certificate of MRT&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

Normal range of motion exercises, posture exercises, stretching exercises and isometric exercises were instructed as part of active physiotherapy.Five sessions of MRT (2., 5., 6., 8., 10. sessions of combined physiotherapy programme) was added at combined physiotherapy to Matrix Rhythm Group. Matrix Rhythm Therapy was applied to cervical and thoracic regions using 10 Hz frequency for 30 min (15 min for right and left sides each) according to the instructions of the technique developer.</description>
