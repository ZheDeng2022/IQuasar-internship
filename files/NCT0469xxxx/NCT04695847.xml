  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to establish a safe and tolerable dose and to investigate pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      the first clinical efficacy signals of M1231 as a single agent in participants with solid&#xD;
      tumors (Part 1) and with metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (Part 2). Dose escalation will be followed by the dose expansion once&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose for Expansion (RDE) has been defined.&#xD;
