    <textblock>
      The purpose of this program is to allow the use of domperidone in children from 12 to 21&#xD;
      years of age with symptoms related to motility disorders and Gastroesophageal reflux disease&#xD;
      (GERD) who have failed all the standard treatments for their condition.&#xD;

      The following will need to be completed before the investigational treatment can begin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be reviewed to make sure domperidone is a safe option for&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical examination, including heart and breathing rates, blood&#xD;
           pressure, height, weight, and an ECG. An ECG measures the electrical activity of the&#xD;
           heart over a period of time. This is a non-invasive procedure and involves attaching&#xD;
           sticky pads to your chest and recording your body's electrical activity on a machine.&#xD;
           The study doctor/nurse will explain this in more detail to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have up to 3 teaspoons of blood drawn through a needle in the arm to make sure&#xD;
           it is safe for you to receive domperidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a pregnancy test if you are female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your tests results are acceptable, the following will happen to you:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take domperidone 4 times per day. The dose will be calculated by your doctor&#xD;
           according to your weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every two months for the first year, you will have a physical examination, including&#xD;
           heart and breathing rates, blood pressure, height, weight, up to 3 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
           drawn through a needle in your arm to measure blood levels, and an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also have an ECG anytime there is an increase in the amount of domperidone you&#xD;
           are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the first year, if you are benefitting from taking domperidone you will have a&#xD;
           physical examination, blood draw and ECG every six months until you stop taking&#xD;
           domperidone.&#xD;
