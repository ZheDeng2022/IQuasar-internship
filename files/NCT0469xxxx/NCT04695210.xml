  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background/scope There is growing recognition that family caregiving is a serious public&#xD;
      health issue requiring supportive interventions. Family caregivers play an essential role in&#xD;
      sustaining a stable environment enabling individuals with motor neurone disease (MND) that&#xD;
      are technology dependent to live at home. The family caregivers can experi¬ence exceptional&#xD;
      burden and significant decline in psychological wellbeing due to MND's rapid and pro¬gressive&#xD;
      nature with profoundly debilitating effects and intensive support needs. Dependence on&#xD;
      assistive technology adds an additional level of complexity to family caregiving due to the&#xD;
      need to learn how to operate and troubleshoot medical devices, train other caregivers, and&#xD;
      negotiate appointments with new specialties within the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the recognized impact of caregiving for individuals with MND, data are scarce as to&#xD;
      effective interventions that provide direct practical and psychosocial supports. Difficulty&#xD;
      accessing support may increase psychological distress. As the burden of caring increases due&#xD;
      to disease progression and increasing technology dependence, access to existing informal&#xD;
      support networks may diminish. Online peer support using virtual modalities is a flexible and&#xD;
      low cost form of support. Peers, people who have experienced the same health problem and have&#xD;
      similar characteristics as support recipients, can be a key source of emotional,&#xD;
      informational, and affirmational support. Peer support improves psychological well-being of&#xD;
      caregivers of people with conditions such as dementia, cancer, and brain injury. Although&#xD;
      peer support programmes for family caregivers of people with MND exist, data as to their&#xD;
      efficacy are limited. Therefore, we have developed an online peer support programme,&#xD;
      completed beta and usability testing and now propose to test the effect on caregiver&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing and caregiver burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/research question(s) Overall aim: to determine the efficacy of a 12-week online peer&#xD;
      support programme on family caregiver psychological health and caregiver burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the effect of the online peer support programme on psychological distress measured&#xD;
      using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the effect on positive affect, caregiver burden, caregiving mastery, caregiving&#xD;
           personal gain, and coping?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How do participants use the programme (fidelity and reach)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the perceived usability and acceptability?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The investigators will conduct a parallel group randomised controlled trial with&#xD;
      participants allocated to 12-week access to the online peer support programme or a usual care&#xD;
      control group. The investigators will enrol family caregivers of an individual with MND who&#xD;
      is referred for consideration or receiving any of the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assisted ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cough assist&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. gastroscopy and enteral feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      i.e., entering King's clinical staging Stage 4A: nutritional support; or Stage 4B:&#xD;
      respiratory support [51]:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12-week peer-to-peer support programme entails:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. audio, video, or text private messaging;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. synchronous weekly chat;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. asynchronous discussion forum; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. informational resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect demographic and caregiving data including the Caregiver&#xD;
      Assistance Scale and Caregiving Impact Scale, and caregiver measures (HADS, Positive and&#xD;
      Negative Affect Schedule, Zarit Burden Interview, Pearlin Mastery Scale, Personal Gain Scale,&#xD;
      Brief COPE) at baseline and programme completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will download use of online peer support programme features, assess&#xD;
      usability, and conduct semi-structured interviews to explore acceptability using the&#xD;
      Theoretical Framework of Acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test for a medium size effect (d=0.5), at 5% level of significance (2-sided) with power&#xD;
      80%, 64 participants are required in each arm (128 total). Adjusting for 20% attrition&#xD;
      requires 154 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed findings The proposed study will demonstrate the effect of a online peer support&#xD;
      programme on psychological distress, positive affect, caregiving burden, mastery, personal&#xD;
      gain and coping. Data on programme fidelity will enable the investigators to objectively&#xD;
      assess acceptability and interpret study results. Data on usability and acceptability will&#xD;
      inform future scalability of the online peer support programme outside of the trial both&#xD;
      nationally and internationally, and to other family caregiver populations.&#xD;
