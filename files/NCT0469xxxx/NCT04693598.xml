    <textblock>
      This is a nonblinded, non-randomized dose escalation study of intravenous AAVrh10 after&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in which subjects will receive standard of&#xD;
      care hematopoietic cell transplantation for Krabbe disease, followed by a single infusion of&#xD;
      an adeno-associated virus gene therapy product. Extensive natural history subjects will be&#xD;
      compared as a control group.&#xD;
