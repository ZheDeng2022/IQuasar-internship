  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 2 million people in France and is the main&#xD;
      cause of irreversible blindness in France. All patients initially have an early form of the&#xD;
      disease. This early form can evolve in two different ways: the atrophic form, which&#xD;
      progresses slowly, and the exudative or neovascular form, which has a more rapid evolution.&#xD;
      While there are treatments for the exudative form of the disease, there is currently no&#xD;
      therapy for the atrophic form of AMD. Recently, it has been demonstrated in atrophic AMD that&#xD;
      there is accumulation of inflammatory cells, monocytes, in the sub-retinal space. This space&#xD;
      is located between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors. It is&#xD;
      physiologically devoid of immune cells (immune privilege). Monocytes secrete many&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines. Some cytokines (IL-1, IL6 and TNF) have a&#xD;
      deleterious role on RPE and photoreceptors in mouse models. The identification of specific&#xD;
      cytokines would help to better understand this disease and consider potential targeted&#xD;
      therapies. Our project is based on the hypothesis that monocytes extracted from patients with&#xD;
      AMD have a superior survival on RPE compared to monocytes extracted from healthy patients&#xD;
      (without retinal pathology), and more particularly in atrophic forms of AMD. The main aim of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the survival of monocytes extracted from patients with atrophic AMD&#xD;
      to monocytes extracted from patients without retinal pathology (control) on retinal pigment&#xD;
      epithelial cell lines (ARPE-19). Survival will be evaluated by automated counting of&#xD;
      monocytes after 24 hours of culture on ARPE-19 after specific immunostaining of monocytes. If&#xD;
      the survival of monocytes from patients with the late form of AMD is increased then therapy&#xD;
      directly targeting this pathological accumulation of monocytes could be considered. Moreover,&#xD;
      the identification of increased secretion of certain cytokines and the demonstration of their&#xD;
      deleterious effect on retinal physiology could lead to targeted therapies against them.&#xD;

    <description>Comparison of alterations in ARPE-19 cells lines after culture by human monocytes:&#xD;
Between the atrophic AMD group and the control group,&#xD;
With respect to the stage of the AMD (early / intermediate AMD, exudative or atrophic AMD),&#xD;

The alteration of ARPE-19 cells on expression level of OTX2, a ubiquitous transcription factor in EPR cells, will be studied. OTX2 is normally under-expressed in-vitro when a supernatant of lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes is added to the culture medium.</description>

    <description>: The blood sample from all groups will be taken on the day of inclusion, in the ophthalmology department. The patient will be cared for by a nurse and then taken to the collection room. A 100 ml sample will be taken (10 tubes of 10 ml). Blood samples will be labeled with the patient's identification number as part of the protocol. They will be transported to the research laboratory in order to be picked up for monocyte extraction. The purification of blood monocytes will be done. In case of excess, the samples will be destroyed at the end of the study.</description>
