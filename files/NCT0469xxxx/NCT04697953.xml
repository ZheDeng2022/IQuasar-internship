  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether switching nAMD patients from aflibercept to&#xD;
      brolucizumab would permit extension of treatment intervals while maintaining treatment&#xD;
      efficacy, thereby alleviating the treatment burden on patients, caregivers, healthcare&#xD;
      professionals (HCPs), and medical institutions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a 104 week, single-arm, open label, Ph IIIb multicenter study in Canadian nAMD&#xD;
      patients who will be switched from aflibercept 2mg to brolucizumab 6mg and extended using a&#xD;
      Treat &amp; Extend regimen by up to 2 week intervals assessing the durability, effectiveness, and&#xD;
      safety of brolucizumab 6mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline visit, patients who consent will undergo an assessment to evaluate their&#xD;
      eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients that meet all of the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate. The&#xD;
      study is expected to recruit 423 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If both eyes are eligible as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the eye with worse&#xD;
      visual acuity should be selected for the study eye, unless the investigator deems it more&#xD;
      appropriate to select the eye with better visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      nAMD patients stable on aflibercept q6w, q8w, q10w or q12w, will be switched to brolucizumab&#xD;
      6mg intravitreal injections. Disease stability is characterized by no disease activity based&#xD;
      on the disease activity assessment (DAA) criteria (defined below) and on the investigator's&#xD;
      judgment of visual function and/or anatomic outcomes (e.g. no change in visual acuity) or any&#xD;
      other signs of the disease (e.g. SRF, hemorrhage, leakage, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline patients will be treated with brolucizumab 6mg in the study eye only and will be&#xD;
      scheduled for the next treatment at the pre-baseline dosing interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At subsequent visits, the treating physician will perform a disease activity assessment (DAA)&#xD;
      to establish treatment extension based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in BCVA of ≥ 5 letters compared to previous visit or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in BCVA of ≥ 3 letters and CSFT increase ≥ 75μm compared to previous visit or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any intraretinal cysts (IRC) / intraretinal fluid (IRF) compared to previous visit If&#xD;
           the treating physician determines that there is no nAMD disease activity based on visual&#xD;
           and anatomical assessments, i.e. no change in visual acuity and other signs of disease&#xD;
           (e.g. IRF, SRF, hemorrhage or leakage), the following treatment can be extended by up to&#xD;
           2 weeks. Treatment extensions can occur at each subsequent visit to a maximum of 20&#xD;
           weeks between treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If disease activity is identified at any study visit the interval should be shortened. If the&#xD;
      patient is on a dosing regimen of q12w or less, the dosing interval will be shortened by two&#xD;
      (2) weeks. For patients on a regimen of greater than q12w, the dosing interval will be&#xD;
      shortened by four (4) weeks. If the treatment interval is currently q6w and patient fails&#xD;
      DAA, they are not forced to discontinue, and they can be reduced to a treatment interval&#xD;
      below q6w.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient fails the first attempt to extend, the patient will have two more attempts for&#xD;
      extension during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient shows significant disease activity after the second attempt for extension,&#xD;
      injection intervals will be fixed to the previous stable, disease free interval until the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any point during the study, the treatment interval can also be maintained, if the&#xD;
      investigator deems that the patient will not benefit from treatment interval adjustment&#xD;
      (e.g., DAA due to reasons other than nAMD disease activity [e.g. fibrosis, geographic&#xD;
      atrophy, etc.]).&#xD;

This study is a 104-week, single arm, open label, Ph IIIb multicenter study in Canadian nAMD patients.&#xD;
Neovascular AMD patients will be switched from aflibercept Q6-12W to brolucizumab at the same dosing interval at baseline. At the second visit the treating physician will conduct a disease activity assessment. If patient is stable, treatment will be extended by up to two (2) weeks using a Treat and Extend regimen interval. If the patient remains stable, the extension will also occur at next visits until maximum of Q20 Weeks.</intervention_model_description>
