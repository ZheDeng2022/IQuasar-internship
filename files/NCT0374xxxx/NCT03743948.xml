      The purprose of this study is to develop a single test based on circulating fetal&#xD;
      trophoblastic cells (CFTC) analysis from maternal blood, searching for the familial mutation&#xD;
      for a wide range of monogenic diseases.&#xD;

      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis (NIPD), based on the analysis of circulating cell-free fetal&#xD;
      DNA (cff-DNA) is very promising for early diagnosis of monogenic diseases. Such an approach&#xD;
      is a safer alternative to invasive methods of prenatal testing (amniocentesis or&#xD;
      choriocentesis) which entails a significant risk of miscarriage (0.5%-1%). However, technical&#xD;
      issues related to the characteristics of cff-DNA remain, and NIPD techniques require long&#xD;
      process development which are specific for a gene and/or a particular mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to complete our offer of NIPD by developing an approach on&#xD;
      isolated Circulating Trophoblastic Fetal Cells (CFTC) adapted to the analysis of the genes&#xD;
      and mutations involved in current prenatal testing requests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood of pregnant women from 9 weeks of gestation for which a prenatal testing is&#xD;
      requested will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFTC isolation using Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) enrichment systems will be followed by&#xD;
      whole genome amplification coupled to mini-exome sequencing and bioinformatic filtering that&#xD;
      will be specific to the prenatal testing indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in 2 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analytical validation of the method by studying the data quality of the sequencing of&#xD;
           targeted genes that are frequently subject to prenatal testing (see prenatal testing&#xD;
           diseases list from &quot;ABM DPN 2014&quot; in Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical evaluation of the method by checking the concordance between the results&#xD;
           obtained by our new approach versus those obtained by standard procedure (amniocentesis&#xD;
           or choriocentesis) for 15 pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to establish the proof of concept of a semi-universal NIPD&#xD;
      method based on a simple maternal blood test that could be applied on most rare diseases&#xD;
      requiring prenatal testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This NIPD approach would reduce the number of invasive procedures and thus eliminate the risk&#xD;
      of miscarriage due to amniocentesis or choriocentesis. It would also enable national access&#xD;
      to this NIPD test for a wide range of rare diseases.&#xD;
