  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to quantify elementary mechanisms of motivation, with innovative&#xD;
      tools adapted to clinical settings, in healthy subjects, and in stroke patients, and to&#xD;
      investigate their predictive value related to morbimortality, disability, and dependence. The&#xD;
      secondary aim of the study is to investigate the neural substrates of motivational&#xD;
      mechanisms, and to study the impact of lesions in the grey and the white matter, the&#xD;
      influence of lesion site, and the consequences of disconnection in functional networks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Disorders of motivation, such as apathy, are among the most prevalent symptoms in&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorders and during chronic diseases. They have a major impact on patients'&#xD;
      physical activity and lifestyle, and on their involvement in their own care. They affect a&#xD;
      wide range of morbidity outcomes, alter functional recovery in rehabilitation, impair&#xD;
      long-term disability, and prevent patients from returning to an active and independent life.&#xD;
      Yet, the neural bases of motivational deficits remain largely unknown. Current diagnostic&#xD;
      tools are sparse and cannot distinguish between distinct mechanisms responsible for apathetic&#xD;
      syndromes. Besides, current treatments remain extremely limited. However, recent advances in&#xD;
      the field of neuroeconomics - the science of decision-making - have provided concept and&#xD;
      tools to study the neurobiological bases of elementary cognitive processes underlying&#xD;
      motivated behaviors. These theories suggest that the brain implements optimization processes&#xD;
      that determine our behaviors by minimizing the cost of our actions while maximizing their&#xD;
      expected benefits. The adaptation of tools developed for basic research now enables the&#xD;
      assessment of these cognitive mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elementary deficits of motivation will be assessed with a phenotyping battery of motivation&#xD;
      tests in 20 healthy subjects (up to 10 healthy subjects can be replaced), 20 patients (up to&#xD;
      10 patients can be replaced) with a stroke in the medial prefrontal cortex, and 20 patients&#xD;
      (up to 10 patients can be replaced) with a stroke in the insula. This battery will allow us&#xD;
      to characterize, at the patient's level, elementary processes such as the encoding and the&#xD;
      learning rate of goal values or effort costs, the modulation of value with delay or episodic&#xD;
      context, the modulation of cost with fatigue, and the resolution of cost-benefit trade-offs.&#xD;
      We will record morbimortality outcomes, such as functional recovery, disability, quality of&#xD;
      life and burden for caregivers. Symptom-Lesion mapping studies and voxel-based morphometry&#xD;
      studies will be performed using whole brain MRI measures of structural and functional&#xD;
      integrity.&#xD;
