  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective and durable treatment for morbid&#xD;
      obesity. Surgery results in significant weight loss and helps prevent, improve or resolve&#xD;
      more than 40 obesity-related diseases or conditions including type 2 diabetes, heart disease,&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea and certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery results in greater improvement in weight loss outcomes and obesity-related&#xD;
      co-morbidities when compared with non-surgical interventions, regardless of the type of&#xD;
      surgical procedure used. The most impressive change in bariatric procedure is the advent of&#xD;
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Since 2014, LSG has become the leading bariatric&#xD;
      procedure in the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleeve gastrectomy with loop bipartition ( SG+LB) was derived from the combined concepts of&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy with transit bipartition (SG+TB), single anastomosis duodenal-ileostomy&#xD;
      (SADI), mini-gastric bypass (MGB) and duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB) with less nutritional and&#xD;
      surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transit bipartition with sleeve gastrectomy (TB-SG) has been getting increased acceptance due&#xD;
      to the advantage of preservation of the normal physiology and anatomy of duodenum. In&#xD;
      iloe-duodenal sleeve bypass ,patients have a bypassed duodenum which is important in&#xD;
      eliminating the foregut's negative incretin effects on insulin; however, this prevents any&#xD;
      biliary access, if required later. TB-SG overcomes this problem by preserving the normal&#xD;
      duodenal access, which makes the procedure more physiologic and easier to perform. With time,&#xD;
      the gastroileal anastomosis has a tendency to enlarge resulting in &quot;functional bypass&quot; of&#xD;
      duodenum, enhancing the anti-diabetic effect of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FIRSTLY,Sleeve gastrectomy technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Positioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
                It should be ensured that the operating table has the capacity to support the&#xD;
                weight of the patient. The patient may be positioned supine or in French position&#xD;
                with legs apart. The feet are secured to the foot board so that reverse&#xD;
                trendelenburg position is possible. The arms should be well padded to prevent&#xD;
                neurological injury should the arms be stretched out and secured to an arm board.&#xD;
                Once the patient is strapped down, the table should be tilted to extremes to ensure&#xD;
                that the patient is well secured and would not slip off the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Decompression of the stomach:&#xD;
&#xD;
                This can be achieved by insertion of orogastric tube, a hollow calibration tube by&#xD;
                gastroscopy. The operators insert disposable 38 french calibration tube after&#xD;
                positioning the patient and prior to draping. In doing so, surgeons are able to&#xD;
                empty the gastric contents prior to surgery and during surgery, to maneuver the&#xD;
                calibration tube to size the sleeve.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Port placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
                5 ports are typically inserted for LSG in our patients. A 10-12 optical trocar is&#xD;
                inserted 20 cm below the left costal margin along the mid-clavicular line to gain&#xD;
                access to the abdominal cavity. Other techniques like the use of Veress needle and&#xD;
                open Hasson technique may be used. A 5mm epigastric port is inserted for&#xD;
                introduction of a liver retractor. For patients where the distance between the&#xD;
                xyphoid and umbilicus is up to 35cm we insert an infra-umbilical 15mm port as the&#xD;
                working port for the surgeon. If the distance is more or the patient has central&#xD;
                obesity this port is changed to a 10-12mm port that is placed approximately 20cm&#xD;
                from xyphoid to the left of the mid line. Two 5mm ports are inserted in the left&#xD;
                and right hypochondrial regions of the patient for assistant and surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Measurement of the Antral pouch:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Once pneumoperitoneum is established, a diagnostic laparoscopy is performed and&#xD;
                hepatic steatosis assessed. The greater gastrocolic omentum is divided 5 cm from&#xD;
                the pylorus with the aid of an energy device. There is consensus among bariatric&#xD;
                surgeons that the antral pouch should be measured 2-6cm from the pylorus along&#xD;
                greater curve as risk benefit ratio is best within these limits. However, some&#xD;
                surgeons also believe that cutting too close to pylorus increases risk of leak and&#xD;
                most would prefer to stay 4-6cm away.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Devascularization:&#xD;
&#xD;
                In the lateral technique, the devascularization process is continued up the greater&#xD;
                curve of the stomach to the short gastric vessels with the help of the assistant&#xD;
                who maintains traction and exposure during this process. Eventually, one reaches&#xD;
                the left crus which is an important landmark of dissection. The left crus muscle is&#xD;
                then routinely dissected and hiatus explored by some for a hernia, while others may&#xD;
                differ. Surgeons selectively explore the hiatus of the symptomatic and&#xD;
                endoscopically proven hiatus hernia as all our patients are evaluated for symptoms&#xD;
                of reflux by questionnaire pre-operative and also have a gastroscopy performed. In&#xD;
                patients with hiatus hernia, the hernia should be reduced and the defect repaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In the medial approach, once the lesser sac is entered the process of stapling&#xD;
                starts and devascularization is done only upon completion of sleeve.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Gastric tube calibration:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The 38 French Bougie inserted preoperatively is then advanced into the stomach&#xD;
                along the lesser curve. This serves as the border of transection with the linear&#xD;
                staple with the remnant lesser curve forming the neo- gastric pouch. One of the&#xD;
                controversies lies in the optimal size of bougie to be used to size the sleeve.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Creating the gastric tube:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Linear transaction of the stomach can be performed using 3.5mm, 3.8 mm or 4.1 mm&#xD;
                staples height depending on the thickness of the stomach wall. Any serosal tears&#xD;
                during stapling or excessive unexpected bleeding should be carefully evaluated as&#xD;
                it may be signaling a poorly stapled area.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The use of staple-line reinforcement either through suturing or buttressing with&#xD;
                biological or synthetic material is a hotly debated topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Closure:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The specimen is then delivered via the umbilical port. The staple line is then&#xD;
                checked for any leaks; we do not routinely oversew the staple line. The 15mm port&#xD;
                site is then closed with absorbable suture and the overlying skin stitched with a&#xD;
                monofilament absorbable suture after local anesthesia is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SECONDLY,Combined sleeve gastrectomy and loop bipartition technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleeve gastrectomy is performed first, then a loop gastro-ileostomy 250-300 cm from the&#xD;
      ileocecal valve or 200-250 cm from duodeno-jejunal junction was created at the dependent part&#xD;
      of the antrum with 2 layers of handsewn suture but without division of the 1st part of&#xD;
      duodenum. The resultant stomach tube has two outlets, one to the first part of duodenum&#xD;
      through the pylorus and one to the terminal ileum through the gastroileostomy. The staple&#xD;
      line and anastomosis was tested with methylene blue test at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed up for a period for one year using the the same parameters as&#xD;
      preoperative and the outcomes of each procedure will be collected and compared with each&#xD;
      other ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Regular follow up of weight and estimation of Excess Weight Loss (EWL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Regular follow up of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Regular follow up of blood glucose and HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow up investigations as serum electrolytes , iron studies and lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Regular hospital follow up and strict adherence to nutritional supplementation and&#xD;
           dietary instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Follow up of outcomes for a period of one year; including effect on weight loss, and the&#xD;
           resulting complications of each procedure.&#xD;
