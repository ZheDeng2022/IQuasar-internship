    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that inhaled xenon will produce a rapid&#xD;
      improvement in depressive symptoms in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will conduct a parallel randomized, double-blind crossover&#xD;
      study that will compare the effects of xenon-oxygen (35:65 ratio by volume) added to&#xD;
      treatment as usual (X-TAU group) to the effects of nitrogen-oxygen (35:65 ratio by volume)&#xD;
      added to treatment as usual (N-TAU group). A total of 20 severely depressed patients, 10 with&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (MDD) and 10 with Bipolar Depression (BP), will be exposed in&#xD;
      random order to N-TAU and X-TAU in a double-blind protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs in up to 17% of the population, is associated with&#xD;
      profound dysfunction and, according to the WHO Global Burden of Disease Study, is estimated&#xD;
      to become the second leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020. While antidepressants&#xD;
      have proven efficacy, they usually take weeks to work and then only about a third of patients&#xD;
      reach remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the traditional monoaminergic approaches, recent advances in understanding the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of MDD have focused on the dysregulation of glutamate and associated neuronal&#xD;
      glutaminergic associated excitotoxicity. Xenon is a potent antiglutaminergic agent that has&#xD;
      been used as an anesthetic with minimal side effects, has neuroprotective effects consistent&#xD;
      with antidepressants, and has the potential to be a novel antidepressant drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although mania or hypomania are the defining characteristics of bipolar disorder, throughout&#xD;
      the course of the illness depressive symptoms are more common than manic symptoms. People&#xD;
      with bipolar disorder spend a substantial proportion of time with syndromal or subsyndromal&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. The risk of suicide is greatly elevated during depressive episodes.&#xD;
      Approximately 17% of people with bipolar I disorder and 24% with bipolar II disorder attempt&#xD;
      suicide during the course of their illness. Annually around 0.4% of people with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder will die by suicide, which is vastly greater than the international population&#xD;
      average of 0.017%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatments are commonly used during episodes of mania and bipolar depression.&#xD;
      Over time these episodes, particularly depression, tend to become more frequent and as&#xD;
      repeated episodes are associated with increased functional impairment, effective treatment is&#xD;
      a priority. The treatment of bipolar depression is quite challenging. Treatments used during&#xD;
      acute episodes include antidepressants, some antipsychotic drugs such as quetiapine, the&#xD;
      anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine and lithium. Response to these agents both acutely and during&#xD;
      maintenance treatment is often partial. There are concerns about the potential for switching&#xD;
      into mania and more frequent cycling mood with antidepressant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a handful of treatments are approved for bipolar depression and have been shown to be&#xD;
      superior to placebo (lurasidone, valproate, quetiapine, the combination of fluoxetine and&#xD;
      olanzapine, olanzapine alone, and lamotrigine), however atypical antipsychotics carry&#xD;
      significant burden of side effects in particular metabolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine has been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated in MDD and BP depression, with&#xD;
      low risk of inducing manic switch; other glutamatergic agents like memantine or lamotrigine&#xD;
      are used as augmentation in depression and are well tolerated. Therefore, investigators&#xD;
      believe Xenon could be well tolerated both in MDD and BP depression and possibly helpful in&#xD;
      alleviating the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that patients with a primary diagnosis of depression will have&#xD;
      a greater decrease in depressive symptoms after one session of xenon inhalation added to&#xD;
      treatment as usual (X- TAU) compared to their session with nitrogen-oxygen inhalation added&#xD;
      to treatment as usual (N-TAU). The investigators will specifically randomize the 20 patients&#xD;
      to receive in random order one session of X- TAU and one session of N-TAU. Blind ratings of&#xD;
      depression will be done with the modified Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Quick&#xD;
      Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician Version (QIDS-C) at baseline and at&#xD;
      predefined time intervals by clinicians experts in mood disorder who will be completely&#xD;
      blinded to all the administration procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods for depression assessments will be consistent with those used for the early&#xD;
      proof-of-concept ketamine studies with assessments at 40, 80, 110, and 230 minutes&#xD;
      post-administration and 1, 3, and 7 days post-administration. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      improvement at day 1. Mixed model repeated measures analysis will be used to compare the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

This concentration of xenon is very close to that at which subjects emerging from xenon anesthesia first respond to verbal commands, commonly referred to as MAC awake.</description>
