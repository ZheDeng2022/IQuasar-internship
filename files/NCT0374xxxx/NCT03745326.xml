      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new cancer therapy takes white blood cells from a person, grows them in a lab, genetically&#xD;
      changes them, then gives them back to the person. Researchers think this may help attack&#xD;
      tumors in people with certain cancers. It is called gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12D mTCR&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells are safe and cause tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-70 who have cancer with a molecule on the tumors that can be recognized by the&#xD;
      study cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, photography, and&#xD;
      heart, lung, and lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed in a large vein in the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in an arm. A&#xD;
      machine will divide the blood and collect white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be&#xD;
      returned to the participant through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few weeks later, participants will have a hospital stay. They will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get 2 chemotherapy medicines by IV over 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get the changed cells through the catheter. Get up to 9 doses of a medicine to help the&#xD;
           cells. They may get a shot to stimulate blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recover in the hospital for up to 3 weeks. They will provide blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have several follow-up visits over 2 years. They will repeat most of the&#xD;
      screening tests and may have leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants blood will be collected for several years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We generated an HLA-A11:01-restricted murine T-cell receptor (mTCR) that specifically&#xD;
           recognizes the G12D-mutated variant of KRAS (and other RAS family genes) expressed by&#xD;
           many human cancers and constructed a single retroviral vector that contains alpha and&#xD;
           beta chains that confer recognition of this antigen when transduced into PBL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A11:01+ target cells expressing this mutated oncogene, mTCR&#xD;
           transduced T-cells lyse target cells and secrete IFN-y with high specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12D mTCR&#xD;
           in concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;&#xD;
           aldesleukin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Determine if anti-KRAS G12D mTCR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of&#xD;
           tumors harboring the RAS G12D mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be/have:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or eqaul to 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HLA-A*11:01 positive&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Metastatic or unresectable RAS G12D-expressing cancer which has progressed after&#xD;
                standard therapy (if available).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may not have:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Allergies or hypersensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin, cyclophosphamide, or&#xD;
                fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I/II, single center study of PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12D mTCR in&#xD;
           HLA-A*11:01 positive patients with advanced solid tumors expressing G12D mutated RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and&#xD;
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant&#xD;
           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-KRAS G12D mTCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 0, patients will receive PBL transduced with the anti-KRAS G12D mTCR and will&#xD;
           then begin high-dose aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A complete evaluation of lesions will be conducted approximately 6 weeks (plus-minus 2&#xD;
           weeks) after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted using a phase I/II Simon minimax design, with two separate&#xD;
           cohorts for the Phase II component: Cohort 2a, patients with RAS G12D pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
           and Cohort 2b, patients with RAS G12D non-pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of up to 70 patients may be required; approximately 24 patients in the Phase I&#xD;
           portion of the study and 46 (21, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable per Phase II&#xD;
           cohort) patients in the Phase II portion of the study.&#xD;
