      Objectives:The aim of this study was to translate the Childhood Bladder and Bowel Dysfunction&#xD;
      Questionnaire into Turkish, adapt it for use with parents of 5-12 year old children and&#xD;
      determine the reliability and construct validity of the Turkish version. The main hypothesis&#xD;
      of our study was that it would be possible to translate and culturally adapt the CBBDQ into a&#xD;
      Turkish version, so that Turkish parents could understand it. Additionally, we hypothesized&#xD;
      that the Turkish version would provide adequate internal consistency and test-rest&#xD;
      reliability and acceptable construct validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:The Childhood Bladder and Bowel Dysfunction Questionnaire was guideline driven&#xD;
      translated into Turkish and administered twice, at 7-day intervals, to parents of children to&#xD;
      assess test-retest reliability. Cronbach's α was used for internal consistency and the&#xD;
      inter-rater correlation coefficient was used to calculate test-retest reliability. The&#xD;
      Dysfunctional Voiding and Incontinence Scoring System (DVISS) and Pediatric Quality of Life&#xD;
      Inventory (PedsQL) in 5-7, 8-12 years old children were used as an external criterion to&#xD;
      estimate construct validity.&#xD;

      The study was conducted as a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey of parents of&#xD;
      children (5-12y) with urinary incontinence, enuresis, constipation/fecal incontinence in two&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Translation Process &amp; Cultural Adaptation. The CBBDQ was translated into Turkish and&#xD;
      culturally adapted in accordance with the stages recommended by Beaton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Field Testing Prior to inclusion, the parents completed an informed consent form,&#xD;
      which had been approved by the ethical committee at Istanbul University (IRB study protocol:&#xD;
      2017/487).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were: 1) parents of children, aged between 5 to 12 years; 2) whose&#xD;
      children suffered from urinary incontinence, enuresis nocturia, constipation/fecal&#xD;
      incontinence; and 3) parents and children read and approved the informed consent form.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: 1) the presence of urinary tract infection; 2) patients having&#xD;
      spinal cord injury or neurological disease; 3) not being able to communicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parents of children were asked to complete the Turkish version of the CBBDQ and the&#xD;
      previously validated Turkish version of the DVISS and the Parent-Proxy-Report of the PedsQL&#xD;
      (5-7, 8-12) (12, 13). The physiotherapist distributed the Turkish CBBDQ, the DVISS and the&#xD;
      PedsQL (5-7, 8-12) to the parents in the waiting room after an interview with the&#xD;
      psychiatrist. The parents were then asked to complete the Turkish-CBBDQ5-12y by telephone, 7&#xD;
      days after their first assessment, to determine the test-retest reliability by the same&#xD;
      physiotherapist. After parents completed the questionnaire, the physical therapists checked&#xD;
      for missing responses. The parents who skipped a question on the questionnaire were asked to&#xD;
      give the reason for this. Any difficulty in understanding the question or incompatibility&#xD;
      with their problem was noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported Outcome Measures The CBBDQ consists of two subscales: (1) the bladder symptoms scale&#xD;
      (10 items) and (2) the bowel symptoms scale, including abdominal pain and bloated belly (8&#xD;
      items). The parents were asked to indicate the presence of the symptoms applying the past&#xD;
      months, using a 5-point Likert scale by checking a box labelled 0-4. '0' means no, '4' means&#xD;
      almost every day or every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DVISS is a 14-item questionnaire originally designed in Turkish with the aim to diagnose&#xD;
      patients with dysfunctional voiding. The DVISS includes 12 questions on bladder dysfunction,&#xD;
      one on bowel dysfunctions and one on quality of life and has variable (Likert scales,&#xD;
      dichotomous) answering options. The total score ranged from 0 to 35 points; sum scores higher&#xD;
      from 9 points indicate increased disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PedsQL measurement model is a modular approach to assess health-related quality of life&#xD;
      in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. This&#xD;
      scale was developed for children between 5-7 years of age and 8-12 years of age and their&#xD;
      parents. In the 5-7-year age group, the questionnaire is filled in by the researcher with the&#xD;
      help of a diagram that symbolizes facial expressions of the child like happy, neutral or sad.&#xD;
      Unlike other age groups, the response scale of the child's form has three options. There is a&#xD;
      parent and child form for the 8-12 age group. Scores of 23 items are scored in 3 areas.&#xD;
      First, the total score of the scale is calculated as the sum of all the items over the items&#xD;
      answered on all the scales. Second is the physical health total score, and third is the total&#xD;
      score of psychosocial health which is calculated by evaluating sum of the item scores&#xD;
      emotional, social and school functioning (14). The items are scored between 0-100 points. If&#xD;
      the answer to the question is never it is marked as 0 = 100 points, rarely is marked as 1 =&#xD;
      75, sometimes is marked as 2 = 50, frequently is marked as 3 = 25, and almost always is&#xD;
      marked as 4 = 0. The points are divided into the total answer number of questions. If more&#xD;
      than 50% of the questions are missing, the score cannot be evaluated. The higher the PedsQL&#xD;
      total score, the better perceived health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) 17.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P-value &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered to indicate statistical significance. We performed a power analysis to determine&#xD;
      sample size at the beginning of the study. To achieve an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient&#xD;
      (ICC) of at least 0.8 a sample size of 50 participants was needed. For the descriptive&#xD;
      analyses, data are expressed as means and standard deviations for continuous variables or as&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and the dispersion/distribution&#xD;
      (standard deviations, ranges) for continuous variables. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov test was&#xD;
      used to assess the normality of the distribution of scores. Internal consistency, test-retest&#xD;
      reliability, construct validity, and ceiling and floor effects were analyzed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability Reliability refers to the consistency of measurement and includes internal&#xD;
      consistency as well as the test-retest reliability. A measure of the homogeneity of the&#xD;
      questions within a questionnaire (internal consistency) was calculated by using coefficient&#xD;
      of Cronbach's alpha. An α of 0.7 is considered fair, 0.8 is good, and 0.9 represents&#xD;
      excellent internal consistency. In this study, baseline data were used to assess the internal&#xD;
      consistency of the Turkish version of the-CBBDQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test-retest reliability represents a scale's effectiveness in producing consistent&#xD;
      results when administered on different days when an individual's status has remained stable.&#xD;
      The outcome measure was applied and then re-applied after 7 days. The results were then&#xD;
      compared for agreement by means of an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), which was&#xD;
      used to measure the test-retest reliability of the Turkish-CBBDQ5-12y. The ICC was also used&#xD;
      to calculate standard error measurement (SEM), which is an index of measurement precision.&#xD;
      The SEM is calculated as the standard deviation (SD) of the scores the square root of&#xD;
      (1-ICC). The minimal detectable change (MDC) refers to the minimal amount of change within&#xD;
      the measurement error. The SEM was used to determine the minimum detectable change at the 95%&#xD;
      limit of confidence (MDC 95%) and was calculated as the SEM times 1.96 times the square root&#xD;
      of 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construct Validity Validity refers to the degree to which a study accurately reflects or&#xD;
      assesses the specific concept that the researcher is attempting to measure. In this study, we&#xD;
      examined three aspects of validity: construct (convergent and divergent) validity. Evidence&#xD;
      for construct validity of the Turkish version of the CBBDQ will be tested by determining its&#xD;
      relationship with the Turkish version of DVISS and the PedsQL (5-7, 8-12). The DVISS was used&#xD;
      to assess the convergent validity. Evidence for divergent validity was provided by&#xD;
      determining the relationships with the PedsQL (5-7, 8-12). Spearman correlation coefficients&#xD;
      and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess construct validity. Correlation&#xD;
      values are rated as: r ≥ 0.81-1.0 is excellent; 0.61-0.80, very good; 0.41-0.60, good;&#xD;
      0.21-0.40, fair; and 0.00-0.20, poor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution and Ceiling/Floor Effects Ceiling and floor effects of the Turkish-CBBDQ at the&#xD;
      first and second tests were assessed by calculating the proportion of the patients scoring&#xD;
      the maximum (72) or minimum (0) scores relative to the total number of patients. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics (number of percentage) were calculated to determine distribution and ceiling/floor&#xD;
      effects, which were considered to be relevant if more than 30% of the subjects experienced&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
