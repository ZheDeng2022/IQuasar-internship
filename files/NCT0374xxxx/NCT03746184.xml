      The treatment that patients with knee OA are offered varies largely. There is a need for more&#xD;
      evidence-based individualized guidance to treatment choice for knee osteoarthritis. This&#xD;
      study will register and evaluate the course and outcome of treatment in 5,000 patients with&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis. The understanding of knee OA treatment will advance in three ways:&#xD;
      Firstly, by describing the different treatment pathways that are currently being used for&#xD;
      knee OA. Secondly, by identifying wich individual factors that may impact the outcome of the&#xD;
      treatment course. And finally, by conducting the economic burden related to different&#xD;
      treatment modalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The problem: Knee Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a chronic,&#xD;
      widespread disease with a steadily increasing prevalence that places a major economic burden&#xD;
      on the society. Patients with knee OA suffer from chronic knee pain and functional&#xD;
      disabilities. The treatment that patients with knee OA are offered varies largely, and is&#xD;
      often not in coherence with clinical guidelines. The guidelines recommend patient education,&#xD;
      exercise, and weight control as core interventions for all patients with knee OA and surgical&#xD;
      intervention for end-stage knee OA. However, the timing of surgery is debated, and whether&#xD;
      the outcome of different treatment strategies depend on individual factors such as the&#xD;
      patients symptoms, OA severity, or prior treatment, has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The solution: This large-scale study aims at improving the understanding of which treatment&#xD;
      should be offered to which patient with knee OA at which time. The study is an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary, collaborative effort, including orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists and&#xD;
      general practitioners from two different regions in Denmark. At least 5,000 patients with&#xD;
      primary referrals to orthopaedic surgeons due to knee OA, at two public hospitals, will be&#xD;
      recruited through a two-year inclusion period. Patients' prior treatment and symptom severity&#xD;
      will be registered at the first consultation with the orthopaedic surgeon using a patient&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaire. OA severity will be defined on plain standing knee radiographs&#xD;
      using a well-established classification system. The course of treatment will be registered&#xD;
      after 6 months and 2 years through a self-reported questionnaire with additional questions&#xD;
      asking whether patients can accept their current symptom state, or, if not, whether they&#xD;
      consider the treatment to have failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Societal impact and clinical implications: The understanding of knee OA treatment will&#xD;
      advance in three ways: Firstly, our results will improve the overview by describing the&#xD;
      different treatment pathways that are currently being used for knee OA. Secondly, predictors&#xD;
      of good and poor treatment outcomes of different treatment modalities, or combinations hereof&#xD;
      will be identified. And finally, the cost-effectiveness of different treatment modalities&#xD;
      will be evaluated. These results will be used to develop a treatment algorithm to help&#xD;
      patients with knee OA and clinicians to tailor the right treatment at the right time through&#xD;
      shared decision-making.&#xD;
