  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use harms nearly every organ in the body and has been linked to ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, respiratory illness, lung cancer and&#xD;
      other cancers. The World Health Organization estimates that 6 million people worldwide lose&#xD;
      their lives due to tobacco use yearly, making cigarette smoking one of the leading single&#xD;
      causes of preventable death and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this knowledge becomes more common and wide-spread the sales of cigarettes has seen a&#xD;
      decrease in recent years. On account of this, the electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) has been&#xD;
      introduced to the market as an alternative to traditional cigarette smoking. Electronic&#xD;
      cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes or e-cigs, are delivery devices which heat a base&#xD;
      liquid, to which nicotine and flavorings can be added, into vapor which is then inhaled&#xD;
      (&quot;vaping&quot;). E-cigarettes have been aggressively marketed as a cheaper, healthier, cleaner&#xD;
      alternative to smoking in both advertising and media outlets, primarily targeting&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite growing e-cigarette use, scientific data on health effects are insufficient in some&#xD;
      respects and completely lacking in others. However, the investigators have recently shown&#xD;
      that cigarette smoking, as well as e-cigarette inhalation, both cause an acute increase of&#xD;
      endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the blood of healthy volunteers, suggesting vascular&#xD;
      injury, inflammation and a negative impact on hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, using well validated methods, including forearm plethysmography, biomarkers in&#xD;
      blood, arterial stiffness measurements and microcirculation assessment (GlycoCheck), the&#xD;
      investigators aim to further investigate the effects of e-cigarette inhalation on the&#xD;
      vascular system. These measurements will be performed before and after healthy subjects&#xD;
      inhale vapor from a e-cigarette on two separate occasions, with and without nicotine in a&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization cigarette smoking is today one of the leading&#xD;
      single causes of preventable death and morbidity. It is estimated that 7 million people&#xD;
      worldwide lose their lives due to tobacco use yearly. On average, cigarette smokers are&#xD;
      estimated to die 10 years earlier than non-smokers. Ischemic heart disease, chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, respiratory illness, lung cancer and other cancers&#xD;
      have all been linked to tobacco use. Cigarette smoking has known detrimental effects on the&#xD;
      blood vessels and both active as well as passive use causes endothelial dysfunction, one of&#xD;
      the earliest signs of atherosclerosis. The investigators have recently shown that cigarette&#xD;
      smoking, as well as e-cigarette inhalation, both cause an acute increase of endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells (EPCs) in the blood of healthy volunteers, suggesting vascular injury,&#xD;
      inflammation and negative impact on hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years the electronic cigarette has been introduced to the market as an alternative&#xD;
      to traditional cigarette smoking. Electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes or&#xD;
      e-cigs, are nicotine delivery devices, which heat a base liquid, to which nicotine and&#xD;
      flavorings can be added, into vapor which is then inhaled (&quot;vaping&quot;). Many of the first&#xD;
      generation e-cigs emulate conventional cigarettes in appearance, though in second and third&#xD;
      generation devices many shapes and sizes exist, varying from one time devices roughly the&#xD;
      size of a conventional cigarette to much larger atomizers, designed to be refilled.&#xD;
      E-cigarettes have been aggressively marketed as a cheaper, healthier, cleaner alternative to&#xD;
      smoking in both advertising and media outlets, primarily targeting women and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With declining cigarette sales in the western world, tobacco companies show a great interest&#xD;
      in this expanding and highly profitable market, buying already established e-cigarette&#xD;
      companies. In February 2014, the European Commission revised the tobacco products directive&#xD;
      allowing the trade of e-cigarettes in the European Union. Despite growing e-cigarette use,&#xD;
      scientific data on health effects are insufficient in some respects and completely lacking in&#xD;
      others. With limited knowledge of e-cigarette vaping health effects in humans it has been&#xD;
      challenging for governments and health officials to give advice and regulate the use of this&#xD;
      novel product. Therefore, using the 'gold standard' method for assessing vascular function,&#xD;
      forearm plethysmography, the investigators aim to investigate the effects of e-cigarette&#xD;
      inhalation on the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will attend on three occasions. The initial visit will be a health&#xD;
      assessment in order for inclusion into the study, when ECG, spirometry and blood sampling&#xD;
      (max 30 ml of blood) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will inhale vapor from a nicotine-containing e-cigarette for 30 minutes in a&#xD;
      specially prepared room with adequate ventilation. In a randomized cross-over fashion,&#xD;
      subjects will also 'smoke' e-cigarette without nicotine on separate occasions. These two&#xD;
      occasions will be separated by at least one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will rest for 20 minutes prior to vaping. Arterial stiffness, blood pressure,&#xD;
      microcirculation assessment (GlycoCheck) and pulse will be measured before and for 60 minutes&#xD;
      following vaping. Blood samples will be drawn before, as well as at several time points&#xD;
      throughout the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forearm blood flow will be measured using venous occlusion plethysmography in both forearms&#xD;
      before and during the intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine (5, 10 &amp; 20 µg/min; an&#xD;
      endothelial-dependent, NO- dependent vasodilator), glyceryl trinitrate (4, 8 &amp; 16 nmol/min;&#xD;
      an endothelial-independent, NO-dependent vasodilator), and bradykinin (100, 300 &amp; 1000&#xD;
      pmol/min; an endothelial-dependent vasodilator that stimulates release of tissue plasminogen&#xD;
      activator (t-PA)).&#xD;
