  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the body's immune response at different time points&#xD;
      to an FDA-approved seasonal influenza vaccine. By better understanding the way the immune&#xD;
      system responds to the influenza vaccine, the investigators can design more effective&#xD;
      vaccines against influenza.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of seasonal, cell-cultured inactivated influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (cc-IIV4) in healthy males and non-pregnant females aged 18 to 45 years old, inclusive. This&#xD;
      clinical study is designed to comprehensively evaluate the characteristics and kinetics of&#xD;
      the immune response to influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By developing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which the immune system&#xD;
      responds to influenza vaccine, including innate immune system responses, the effect of early&#xD;
      influenza exposures, and (eventually) the effect of potent adjuvants, the investigators will&#xD;
      be better equipped to design more highly effective vaccines to conquer seasonal influenza and&#xD;
      prevent influenza pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this pilot observational study will guide the design of global studies addressing&#xD;
      age-specific responses, the impact of sex and geography, and the role of adjuvants on&#xD;
      influenza immunity.&#xD;
