      Introduction: Late-onset asthma in women is characterized by poor disease control and reduced&#xD;
      quality of life despite intensive treatment with inhaled steroid and beta2-agonist. The&#xD;
      condition is further worsened at menopause due to the loss of estrogen leading to increased&#xD;
      asthma exacerbation frequency, increased airway inflammation and decreased lung function.&#xD;
      Exercise training may increase disease control of asthma patients, but to what extent the&#xD;
      same effect is seen in postmenopausal women with late-onset asthma is unknown. These asthma&#xD;
      patients represent a phenotype that is characterized by low eosinophilic airway inflammation,&#xD;
      severe symptoms, moderate obesity and poor response to conventional medicine. Thus, our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that regular physical exercise is especially associated with an improvement in&#xD;
      asthma control in this phenotype. The aim of this project is to test this hypothesis and to&#xD;
      assess whether an improvement is associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      change in heart function, lung function and/or body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: 40 postmenopausal women with late-onset asthma are recruited via the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic at the Respiratory Department at Bispebjerg Hospital and through advertisement. The&#xD;
      participants are randomized 1:1 into two groups. One group performs supervised exercise&#xD;
      training (spinning) three times per week for 12 weeks while the other group is a control&#xD;
      group. Before and after the intervention asthma control, local and systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      heart function and body composition is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Analysis will be performed to detect changes within and between the groups before&#xD;
      and after intervention. Primary outcome is change in ACQ (Asthma Control Questionnaire).&#xD;
      Local and systemic inflammation is measured by changes in bronchial challenge to&#xD;
      methacholine, sputum cell count and blood tests. Furthermore, secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      change in heart function measured by stress-echocardiography and change in body composition&#xD;
      measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: There are to date no prospective studies that can support recommendations&#xD;
      containing asthma rehabilitation with supervised regular physical activity for postmenopausal&#xD;
      women. Thus, this study will provide novel understanding of the importance of physical&#xD;
      activity in a chronic disease such as asthma.&#xD;

      Overall study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single-blinded randomized controlled intervention study. Forty postmenopausal&#xD;
      women with late-onset asthma (&gt;16 years at debut) are recruited from the asthma&#xD;
      outpatient-clinic at Bispebjerg Hospital or other hospital/practitioner in the region and/or&#xD;
      by advertisement. The participants are block-randomized into two groups of 20, where one&#xD;
      group is control and the other undergoes a period of regular exercise training. The&#xD;
      investigators will be blinded and will not know whether the subjects have trained or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the exercise training group undergo a training intervention&#xD;
      consisting of 45 minutes of intermittent high intensity aerobic spinning training three times&#xD;
      per week for 12 weeks. Participants allocated to the control group will continue usual care&#xD;
      without training. No changes to current treatment will be made by the investigators on any of&#xD;
      the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training will consist of short periods of high intensity intervals where subjects reach&#xD;
      above 80% of maximal oxygen consumption. Spinning sessions will be fully supervised by&#xD;
      trained instructors with a bachelor of sports and science or bachelor of medicine and&#xD;
      conducted in the Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen.&#xD;
      Subjects will wear heart rate monitors to ensure adherence to the training protocol. Within&#xD;
      two weeks, before and after the intervention, participants from both groups undergo 3 days of&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure equal compliance with asthma medication both groups will receive daily electronic&#xD;
      reminders. Once a week, all participants will be asked about their compliance to their&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
