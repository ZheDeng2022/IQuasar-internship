  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2 way crossover, single dose, open label study of the effect&#xD;
      of PF 04965842 on dabigatran PK in healthy participants. Participants will be randomized to 1&#xD;
      of 2 treatment sequences as described below. A total of 20 healthy male and/or female&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the study so that 10 participants will be enrolled in each&#xD;
      treatment sequence. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2 periods that are each 3 days in&#xD;
      duration. The total duration of participation from the Screening Visit to Day 7 will be a&#xD;
      maximum of 35 days and from the Screening Visit to Follow-up Contact/Visit will be a maximum&#xD;
      of 70 days.&#xD;

             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience:&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational&#xD;
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Diagnostic Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. A positive urine drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Screening supine systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt;90 mm Hg or &gt;=140 mm Hg following at&#xD;
             least 5 minutes of supine rest; OR Screening supine diastolic BP &lt;50 mm Hg or &gt;=90 mm&#xD;
             Hg following at least 5 minutes of supine rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If a participant meets any of these criteria, the BP should be repeated 2 more times&#xD;
             and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the&#xD;
                  ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or QRS values&#xD;
                  should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
