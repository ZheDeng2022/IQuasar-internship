      This study will advance the investigator's knowledge of the integrated cardiorenal and&#xD;
      humoral physiology in type 2 diabetic patients with and without pre-clinical diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, and test a novel therapeutic strategy which may prevent a progression to&#xD;
      symptomatic Stage C heart failure&#xD;

      6.1 Visit 1 Consent Visit: Possible study participants will meet with study coordinator to&#xD;
      review consent form. After enrollment into the study, a 6-minute walk will be performed&#xD;
      (minimum required distance: 450 meters). Diet instructions will be given by a dietician about&#xD;
      a no added salt diet, 120 mEq Na/day, which will be maintained throughout the study period.&#xD;
      Comprehensive metabolic panel (including albumin, bilirubin, calcium, bicarbonate, chloride,&#xD;
      creatinine, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, potassium, total protein, sodium, AST, ALT and&#xD;
      BUN)and complete blood count with differential will be obtained. Brief physical exam will be&#xD;
      performed by a qualified Study Team Member. Visit 2 will be scheduled at least one week out&#xD;
      from consent visit to accommodate diet compliance, unless participant is already compliant&#xD;
      with salt intake parameter. Instructions for completing a 24-hour urine collection, and&#xD;
      container for Study Visit 2, will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) will be switched over&#xD;
      to an equivalent dose of Valsartan or Losartan, which will be maintained for 3 days beyond&#xD;
      the end of the study period. This is due to the FDA recommendation that patients on ACEI&#xD;
      should have a 36 hour washout period before administering ARNI due to the increased risk of&#xD;
      angioedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Visit 2 Participants will start a twenty-four hour urine collection one day prior to the&#xD;
      active study day for assessment of baseline sodium excretion, creatinine clearance and urine&#xD;
      protein analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Translational Unit (CRTU). On the active&#xD;
      study day, subjects will withhold their usual dose of medications and will be placed in the&#xD;
      supine position for 1 hour. During the first 15 minutes, two standard intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      catheters will be placed (one in each arm). One catheter will be used for infusion and the&#xD;
      other (in the contralateral arm) for blood sampling. A bladder ultrasound will be completed&#xD;
      after the participant's first void after admitting to assess for urine retention. Subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to drink 10ml/Kg of water to insure sufficient urinary flow. A priming dose&#xD;
      (calculated according to body size) of Iothalamate, to measure glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (GFR), is infused, followed by a constant rate IV sustaining dose (calculated according to&#xD;
      estimated kidney function) of Iothalamate. The subjects will be asked to empty their bladder&#xD;
      spontaneously every thirty minutes (if subjects are unable to void every thirty minutes, a&#xD;
      urinary catheter will be used upon consent). Throughout the study, at the end of each&#xD;
      30-minute clearance period, subjects will be asked to drink an amount of water equivalent to&#xD;
      the sum of the blood losses and the urinary flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an equilibration period of 45 minutes, a 30-minute baseline renal clearance will be&#xD;
      carried out. Urinary samples for determination of volume, urinary sodium excretion (UNaV),&#xD;
      cGMP, and Iothalamate will be obtained at the end of the clearance period. Venous blood&#xD;
      samples for Iothalamate, sodium, ANP, BNP, cGMP, soluble neprilysin, renin, angiotensin II&#xD;
      and aldosterone will be obtained at the middle of the clearance period. Blood pressure will&#xD;
      be measured at 20-minute intervals by using an automatic blood pressure cuff, and heart rate&#xD;
      will be continuously monitored by electrocardiography. Echocardiography will be performed&#xD;
      during these baseline clearances to determine left atrial (LA) and LV volumes and systolic&#xD;
      and diastolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline clearance, the subjects will be randomized to receive either a) oral&#xD;
      placebo or b) Oral ARNI (LCZ 696/Entresto 97/103 mg). Previous studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      the maximum effect for LCZ 696 is about 1.5 hours after oral administration. Hence, one and&#xD;
      one-half hours after the administration of the oral medication, the acute saline load will be&#xD;
      administered (normal saline 0.9% 0.25 ml/kg/min for 1 hour). Two 30-minute clearances (as&#xD;
      outlined above) will be repeated with the subjects in a supine position during the saline&#xD;
      infusion. As above, blood samples are collected midway during each clearance and urine&#xD;
      samples are obtained every 30 minutes. Echocardiography will be repeated immediately after&#xD;
      the end of the saline infusion, after which subjects will be allowed to eat a meal and be&#xD;
      dismissed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will return after at least 1 week of washout for the second crossover study.&#xD;
      Container for 24-hour urine collection for Study Visit 3 will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Visit 3 Visit 3 will take place the same as described in Visit 2, receiving one of the 2&#xD;
      medication administrations not received on Visit 2: (a) oral placebo or b) Oral ARNI (LCZ&#xD;
      696/Entresto 97/103 mg)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Visit 3, study participation is complete.&#xD;
