    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called ribociclib (LEE011) given in combination with&#xD;
      everolimus and other standard of care chemotherapy drugs as a possible treatment for relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ribociclib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  everolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dexamethasone&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug or a combination of drugs. Phase I studies try to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug and&#xD;
      the combination of drugs are still being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the study drugs, ribociclib&#xD;
      or everolimus, for relapsed ALL, but these drugs have been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribociclib is a chemotherapy drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain&#xD;
      types of breast cancer. It has also been studied in children and adults with other types of&#xD;
      cancer. Information from these research studies has suggested that ribociclib may also be&#xD;
      effective in treating participants with leukemia that did not respond to standard treatment&#xD;
      or participants with leukemia that has come back after standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growth and survival of leukemia cells is controlled by proteins within the cancer cell.&#xD;
      The study drug, ribociclib, blocks a specific type of protein called a cyclin-dependent&#xD;
      kinases (CDK). Laboratory and other studies suggest that when ribociclib blocks CDKs, cancer&#xD;
      cells stop growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is a chemotherapy drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer, neuroendocrine tumor and kidney cancer. Laboratory and other studies suggest that&#xD;
      everolimus may prevent leukemia cell growth and also that it has been shown to increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of other chemotherapy drugs, including ribociclib. It has been studied in&#xD;
      hundreds of people with various types of cancer as a single agent (a drug that is used alone&#xD;
      to treat the cancer) or in combination with a number of other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug combination of ribociclib and everolimus has not been previously tested in children,&#xD;
      though these agents have been used together in adults with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study the investigators are looking to learn more about how ribociclib and&#xD;
      everolimus work in combination with other standard of care drugs commonly used to treat&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory leukemia. The main goals of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the side effects (good and/or bad) of giving ribociclib in combination with&#xD;
           other standard of care drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the highest dose of ribociclib and everolimus that can be given safely in&#xD;
           combination with other standard of care drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the amount of ribociclib and everolimus in the blood when it is given in&#xD;
           combination with other standard of care drugs.&#xD;
