  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate Transdermal Continuous Oxygen Therapy&#xD;
      (TCOT) as an adjunct to surgical wound healing in subjects undergoing vascular surgery for&#xD;
      lower extremity arterial occlusive disease. It is the intention of this study to administer&#xD;
      oxygen using the TCOT approach to the surgical sites of subjects undergoing the surgery and&#xD;
      to monitor the healing of the incision as well as infection rate. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      oxygen delivered transdermally to the surgical site in a continuous manner for up to 28 days&#xD;
      will accelerate the healing process and reduce the infection rate compared to the Standard of&#xD;
      Care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This Safety &amp; Efficacy Study will be a randomized controlled trial of 100 subjects (Parallel&#xD;
      design) aged 18 - 90 years who are scheduled to undergo vascular surgery at the University of&#xD;
      Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) hospital. 50 subjects will be recruited for the control arm&#xD;
      and 50 for the treatment arm. Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive the treatment device with Standard of Care or Standard of Care alone&#xD;
      (1:1). The most proximal (e.g., groin) incision (subject to safety exclusion) will be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected study treatment duration is 4 weeks. This means the subjects will be seeing&#xD;
      their physician weekly for the first 4 weeks following their surgery, once they are recruited&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, there will be five study treatment visits: Study visit 1 (day 0) is the day&#xD;
      of the surgery and of randomization. For those randomized to the treatment arm of the study,&#xD;
      the EPIFLO device will be applied on this day immediately following surgery. For those&#xD;
      randomized to the control group, standard gauze dressing will be applied to their incision&#xD;
      site. The second study visit is 7 days following surgery (day 7) and the third, fourth, and&#xD;
      fifth study visits are on days 14, 21, and 28 respectively. On the third study visit (day&#xD;
      14), a new EPIFLO will be applied and the old one discarded for those in the treatment arm of&#xD;
      the study, because FDA has cleared each EPIFLO-15 device only for a maximum of 15 days of&#xD;
      use, after which the used device must be disposed (single use, single patient, disposable&#xD;
      device). The 5th study visit (Day 28), will be the final treatment study visit for all&#xD;
      subjects, regardless of which treatment group they are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those subjects whose incisional wound has healed during the study treatment period (28 days)&#xD;
      will come in for a healing confirmation visit two weeks after it's noted to be healed. Note&#xD;
      that an incision is not declared healed until the healing is confirmed after a two-week&#xD;
      period after the first observation of complete healing. They will then have one final study&#xD;
      visit, approximately 90 days from the first observation of wound closure, as their last study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects whose incisions have not completely healed by the fifth study visit (day 28)&#xD;
      will also come in for one final study visit, approximately 90 days following their surgery,&#xD;
      to have the study doctor assess the condition of the incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational device of this protocol is the EPIFLO® Transdermal Continuous Oxygen&#xD;
      Delivery. Components of this unit include: Small, silent disposable, battery-operated oxygen&#xD;
      concentrator capable of delivering 98% to 100% oxygen (balance moisture) for fifteen days at&#xD;
      a rate of ~3.0 ml/hour; and 36&quot; long sterile cannula (tube) that conveys the oxygen from the&#xD;
      concentrator device to the area beneath the bandage overlying the wound. EPIFLO is intended&#xD;
      to provide transdermal, continuous oxygen delivery to chronic wounds. EPIFLO concentrates&#xD;
      oxygen from atmospheric air and delivers the concentrated oxygen to the region of the wound&#xD;
      bed creating an oxygen-enriched environment intended to promote the healing process in&#xD;
      chronic wounds as an adjunct to standard wound care in wound management and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPIFLO is worn in a convenient location in the body within 4-5 feet of the wound, beneath&#xD;
      clothing without impairing its operation, and the subject is free to ambulate and continue&#xD;
      with normal daily activities while being treated 24 hours per day for 15 days. The EPIFLO&#xD;
      unit measures 2&quot; x 2.5&quot; x 1&quot; and weighs 3.5 oz. A pouch (with belt loop) and arm band are&#xD;
      provided to facilitate wearing of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Safety Monitor will be selected from unbiased wound care experts/vascular surgeons,&#xD;
      selected by the Investigator and will not be affiliated with the sponsor of this study. The&#xD;
      monitor charter will define the specific processes and procedures by which their assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be presented in subject data listings. Statistical analyses, if&#xD;
      applicable, will be performed using SAS® for Windows, version 9.1 or later. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) will be calculated by&#xD;
      treatment group for continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages will be presented by&#xD;
      treatment group for categorical variables. Missing data will not be imputed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disposition of all subjects who sign an ICF will be provided. The numbers of subjects&#xD;
      randomized, completed, and discontinued during the study, as well as the reasons for all&#xD;
      post-randomization discontinuations will be summarized by treatment group, for all centers&#xD;
      combined and each center separately. Disposition and reason for study discontinuation will&#xD;
      also be provided as a by-subject listing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and baseline characteristics, including physical examination and medical history&#xD;
      will be summarized by treatment group for Intent to treat (ITT) and Safety populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be summarized, descriptively, according to the variable type:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous data: summaries will include the number of observations, mean, standard&#xD;
           deviation, median, and minimum and maximum values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Categorical data: frequePrimary endpoint The primary endpoint of closure of the surgical&#xD;
           incision between the active and control populations will be tested using a repeated&#xD;
           measures analysis, specifically using a mixed model for repeated measures. This will be&#xD;
           tested with a necessary p-value of .05 or smaller to demonstrate significance regarding&#xD;
           the interaction between treatment and time of the follow-up visit when the measurement&#xD;
           was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test statistic will follow a t-distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom, where&#xD;
      t=(Interaction between time and treatment)/(Standard Error of the interaction) is the test&#xD;
      statistic for testing the significance of treatment on wound healing, where n is the total&#xD;
      number of patients in the study with at least one measurement taken for % of wound healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test for significance will be conducted using a t-test against the Null Hypothesis that&#xD;
      the impact of the interaction between treatment and measurement period on wound healing is&#xD;
      zero. The test for significance will be made at α=.05. The statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted in SAS using the MIXED procedure with the specifications of maximum-likelihood&#xD;
      estimation methods, model repeated measures, blocking by patient, and unstructured covariance&#xD;
      matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint The secondary endpoint regarding rate of infection between the EPIFLO&#xD;
      treatment and the control treatment will be tested at a significance level of .05 using&#xD;
      Barnard's test. A 2x2 contingency table will be made between patients in the Active and&#xD;
      Control arms, as well as the patients' incidences of at least one surgical site infection.&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be conducted in SAS using the FREQ procedure with the&#xD;
      specification of EXACT BARNARD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any correlation between the primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed first by&#xD;
      calculating the correlation coefficients for the secondary end points. If the secondary&#xD;
      endpoint was found to be correlated with primary, then further analysis will be done only if&#xD;
      primary endpoint shows statistical significance as per the study success rule defined above.&#xD;
      If the secondary endpoint is not correlated with primary, then, further analysis of the&#xD;
      secondary endpoint will be carried out as described below. The secondary endpoint will only&#xD;
      be tested if the primary endpoint is statistically significant by the study success rule&#xD;
      defined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multiplicity adjustment strategy (to be fully described in our Statistical Analysis Plan)&#xD;
      would be followed to control the overall Type I error at 0.05 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAP will fully describe the procedure to control the overall type I error rate at 5%&#xD;
      level (or below) using the methodology described in the literature (ICH E9 (1998) on&#xD;
      &quot;Statistical principles for clinical trials&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive Analysis To assess the consistency of the Primary Analysis results, supportive&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted using the Per Protocol (PP) population. Statistical methodology&#xD;
      for the supportive analyses will be the same as that of the primary analysis, with the&#xD;
      exception of the analysis population used. The PP population will be used for the supportive&#xD;
      analysis while ITT population will be used for the primary analysis. Subjects with no post&#xD;
      baseline value for the primary endpoint will be considered NOT HEALED in this analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analyses The Safety population will be used for the analysis of safety endpoints. For&#xD;
      continuous variables data will be summarized by treatment using n, mean, SD, minimum and&#xD;
      maximum values. For categorical variables data will be summarized by treatment using&#xD;
      frequency and percentage. No inferential statistics are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ncy counts and percentages will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All aspects of the study will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GPD), the Declaration of Helsinki (1989), the provisions specified in Title 21&#xD;
      Parts 50, 54, 56, and 812 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, this protocol, and all&#xD;
      federal, State, and local laws of pertinent regulatory authorities.&#xD;
