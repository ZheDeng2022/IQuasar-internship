    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pevonedistat works with azacitidine compared to&#xD;
      azacitidine alone in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Pevonedistat may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. It is not yet known if pevonedistat with azacitidine or azacitidine alone may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare overall survival (OS) of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) and azacitidine in combination&#xD;
      versus azacitidine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) of MLN4924&#xD;
      (pevonedistat) and azacitidine in combination versus azacitidine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the rate of early mortality, rate of allogeneic hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HCT) and time to response of patients treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat)&#xD;
      and azacitidine versus azacitidine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) target gene expression&#xD;
      is a biomarker of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) activity and predictive of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities and additional potential biomarkers&#xD;
      with treatment activity and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5&#xD;
      and azacitidine IV over 10-40 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on either days 1-7, or days 1-5&#xD;
      and 8-9, or days 1-6 and 8. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive azacitidine IV or SC as in Arm A. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, then&#xD;
      every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an established and confirmed diagnosis of AML by World Health&#xD;
             Organization (WHO) criteria, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have relapsed or refractory AML, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relapsed: &gt;= 5% bone marrow blasts by morphology, reappearance of minimal&#xD;
                  residual disease (MRD) (&gt; 0.1%) by flow cytometry, reappearance of peripheral&#xD;
                  blood blasts, or development of extramedullary leukemia after one or more prior&#xD;
                  lines of therapy. Consolidation regimens, including autologous and allogeneic&#xD;
                  HCT, do not count as a separate prior line of therapy, (e.g., 7+3 followed by&#xD;
                  cytarabine consolidation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell&#xD;
                  transplantation (HCT) would be considered one prior line of therapy). Note, there&#xD;
                  is no restriction on the prior number of relapses and prior treatment of relapsed&#xD;
                  disease is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Refractory: no complete response (CR) or complete response with incomplete bone&#xD;
                  marrow recovery (CRi) after two courses of induction therapy (e.g. therapy with&#xD;
                  the intent to induce remission). Patients 75 years or older, or patients of any&#xD;
                  age with comorbidities that prevent the use of further intensive chemotherapy,&#xD;
                  will be eligible if they did not experience CR or CRi after one course of&#xD;
                  induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have Karnofsky &gt;= 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a white blood cell count (WBC) =&lt; 25 x 10^9 cells/L. Hydroxyurea&#xD;
             and leukapheresis are permitted to satisfy this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) except in patients with&#xD;
             Gilbert's syndrome or post-transfusion hemolysis. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome or&#xD;
             post-transfusion hemolysis may enroll if direct bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x ULN of the direct&#xD;
             bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 3 x institutional ULN (unless resulting from liver infiltration with leukemia).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL. Patients may be transfused to achieve this value.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients will be eligible for this trial&#xD;
             if they are on effective antiretroviral regimens utilizing non-CYP-interacting agents,&#xD;
             they have an undetectable viral load, they have a CD4 count &gt; 350 cells/mm^3, and they&#xD;
             have no history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic&#xD;
             infections. If there is evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV&#xD;
             viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. If there is&#xD;
             history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must have been treated and&#xD;
             have undetectable HCV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to submit blood samples for the integrated biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. who are not postmenopausal for at&#xD;
             least 1 year before screening or are not surgically sterile) must have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first study drug administration and&#xD;
             must agree to practice one highly effective method and one additional effective&#xD;
             (barrier) method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to&#xD;
             practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the patient. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, must agree to practice&#xD;
             effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period through 4&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence when&#xD;
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods),&#xD;
             withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had prior allogeneic HCT at least 3 months prior to randomization&#xD;
             but should not have evidence of active graft versus host disease or require systemic&#xD;
             immune suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) will be eligible if they have a&#xD;
             legal guardian or a close family member available to assist them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had prior treatment with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), azacitidine,&#xD;
             or decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, azacitidine alone is not&#xD;
             an appropriate treatment will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have documented active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by&#xD;
             leukemia. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical&#xD;
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other&#xD;
             adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received any other investigational or commercial agents or&#xD;
             therapies administered with the intention to treat their leukemia within 14 days or&#xD;
             five half-lives (whichever is shorter) of first receipt of study drug, with the&#xD;
             exception of hydroxyurea used to control WBCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) of prior chemotherapy, surgery, or&#xD;
             radiotherapy, except alopecia, must have resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI)&#xD;
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade =&lt; 2 prior to starting&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a history of other malignancies, except:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any malignancy that was treated with curative intent, has no known active disease&#xD;
                  present for &gt;= 1 year before the first dose of study drug, and is felt to be at&#xD;
                  low risk of recurrence by the treating physician;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence&#xD;
                  of disease;&#xD;
&#xD;

             similar chemical or biologic composition to MLN4924 (pevonedistat), azacitidine, or&#xD;
             mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant metabolic enzyme inducers are not permitted during this study,&#xD;
             or within 14 days before the first dose of study drugs. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other&#xD;
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect their participation&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are ineligible because, as an Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor,&#xD;
             MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), breastfeeding must be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat). These potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of any&#xD;
             study drug or be scheduled for surgery during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled coagulopathy or a bleeding disorder unless&#xD;
             directly attributable to their AML (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have known hepatic cirrhosis or severe pre-existing hepatic&#xD;
             impairment.&#xD;

                  ischemic heart disease such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), MI, and/or&#xD;
                  revascularization more than 6 months before screening and who are without cardiac&#xD;
                  symptoms or those with a prior non-ST elevation MI due to demand-supply mismatch&#xD;
                  (NSTEM type II) may enroll;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy;&#xD;

                       lasting &gt; 7 days and/or requiring cardioversion in the 4 weeks before&#xD;
                       screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Grade 3 atrial fibrillation, defined as symptomatic and incompletely&#xD;
                       controlled medically, or controlled with a device (e.g., pacemaker) or by&#xD;
                       ablation;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or &lt; grade 3 atrial&#xD;
                       fibrillation for period of at least 6 months are permitted to enroll&#xD;
