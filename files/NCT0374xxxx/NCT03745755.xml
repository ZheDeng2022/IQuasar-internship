  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the leading cause of traumatic death in the elderly with head injury causing half&#xD;
      of these deaths. Each year, one in three adults over the age of 65 (seniors) fall, and half&#xD;
      of these seniors seek treatment at a hospital emergency department (ED). There is a major&#xD;
      evidence gap in the study of brain injury diagnosis in seniors, which is problematic for&#xD;
      emergency physicians since the number of fall-associated head injuries is rising. ED&#xD;
      diagnostic tools for risk stratification of these patients do not exist. The investigators&#xD;
      will derive a novel ED clinical decision rule for detecting traumatic intracranial bleeding&#xD;
      which will standardize the approach to head CT scans. Once validated, the investigators will&#xD;
      optimize patient care by ensuring that intracranial bleeding is identified early. By reducing&#xD;
      the use of head CT, this decision rule will lead to health care savings and streamlined,&#xD;
      patient-centered ED care.&#xD;

      This study is designed to develop a unique clinical decision rule for ED physicians&#xD;
      evaluating senior patients who have fallen. Clinical decision rules are a common method for&#xD;
      standardizing diagnostic decision-making and minimizing misdiagnosis in the ED. Each patient&#xD;
      will be assessed at their index ED visit by an emergency physician who will record history&#xD;
      and examination findings. The primary outcome will be clinically important intracranial&#xD;
      bleeding diagnosed with 42 days. Patients who return to the ED within 42 days with new&#xD;
      confusion, headache, loss of balance, repeat falls, change in behaviour, reduced Glasgow Coma&#xD;
      Scale score or other neurological symptoms will also undergo head CT. All intracranial&#xD;
      bleeding events will be adjudicated independently.&#xD;
