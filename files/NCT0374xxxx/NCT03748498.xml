      This study was designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 2 groups. The treatment&#xD;
      procedures were performed by one operator. After local anesthesia and rubber dam isolation,&#xD;
      access cavity preparation was performed by diamond burs with high-speed hand pieces under the&#xD;
      water cooling. . Instrumentation of procedures was performed by Reciproc R50 files.&#xD;
      Irrigation protocol was completed, canal were dried, filled with gutta-percha cones and AH&#xD;
      Plus sealer. After chemo- mechanical instrumentation and root canal filling procedures, LLLT&#xD;
      was applied for 60 second per tooth using Nd-YAG laser ( λ=1064 nm,100 mJ, 10 Hz, 1-W) The&#xD;
      same procedures as in the laser group were performed, been completed but the laser was not&#xD;
      activated in this group. These patients were assigned as placebo group. Postoperative pain&#xD;
      was measured and documented via the Visual Analogue Scale. Chi-square test was performed in&#xD;
      analysis of the nominal data.There was statistically significant difference between groups at&#xD;
      the 12th and 24th hours (p&lt;.05). ). However, no statistically significant difference was&#xD;
      found between the groups at the 4th, 8th, 48th, and 72th hours (p&gt;.05). No statistically&#xD;
      significant differences were detected between the groups in terms of demographic data (age&#xD;
      and tooth number) except for gender (P &gt; .05).LLLT can decrease postoperative pain after root&#xD;
      canal treatment of single rooted teeth.&#xD;

      The study was approved by the local ethics committee ....................., and informed&#xD;
      consent was received from all participants. Study subjects were selected among patients who&#xD;
      presented to the Department of Endodontics, Faculty of Dentistry ........................from&#xD;
      September 2017 to March 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root canal treatment was planned for patients who participated in this study and have single&#xD;
      root and single canal. Patients aged between 15 to 45 years. Exclusion criteria related with&#xD;
      teeth were swelling or sinus tract, acute pain, periodontal probing greater than 3mm,&#xD;
      internal and external resorption, fractured and cracked tooth, percussion sensitivity, and&#xD;
      periapical index classification 3, 4, 5 according to Orstavik et al. (1986). Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria related with systemic health of patients included diabetes, hypertension and&#xD;
      cardiovascular pathologies, the use of analgesics and / or antibiotics at least one week&#xD;
      before treatment, and using antidepressant drugs.The treatment procedures were performed by&#xD;
      one operator (G.A.). Initially, patients' age, gender, and tooth number were recorded by the&#xD;
      operator. 1.5 mL 2% articaine with 0.012 mg epinephrine (Ultracaine DS Forte; Aventis,&#xD;
      Istanbul, Turkey) was used as local anesthetic. After rubber dam isolation, access cavity&#xD;
      preparation was performed by diamond burs (ADIA Dental Burs, Turkey) with high-speed hand&#xD;
      pieces under the water cooling. A #10 K- type (Kerr Corporation, Orange, CA) file was&#xD;
      inserted to root canal to determine working length using an apex locator (Raypex, VDW).&#xD;
      Working length was set as 1 mm shorter than the apical foramen and confirmed with periapical&#xD;
      radiographs. Instrumentation of procedures was performed by Reciproc R50 files (VDW, Munich,&#xD;
      Germany). Irrigation protocol was completed 5 mL 17% EDTA (Werax, Turkey) and 15 mL 2.5%&#xD;
      sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)(Wizard, Turkey ) with a side-vented needle (NaviTip needle;&#xD;
      Ultradent Products Inc, South Jordan, UT). Subsequently, canal were dried with paper points&#xD;
      and filled with gutta-percha cones and AH Plus sealer (Dentsply Maillefer). Lateral cold&#xD;
      condensation technique was used for obturation. Finally, coronal access cavity was restored&#xD;
      with a temporary restorative material (Cavit G; 3M ESPE, St Paul, MN). Permanent restoration&#xD;
      was completed after the end of the experiment.A randomization was produced using through a&#xD;
      website (http://www.random.org), after the clinician (G.A.) was completed all treatment&#xD;
      procedures. All procedures were conducted by one clinician (C.E.B.), and assignment was&#xD;
      concealed from the clinician who performed the laser applications (U.B.). Data analysis and&#xD;
      interpretation were completed by the other researcher (C.F.) After chemo- mechanical&#xD;
      instrumentation and root canal filling procedures, LLLT was applied for 60 second per tooth&#xD;
      using Nd-YAG laser ( λ=1064 nm,100 mJ, 10 Hz, 1-W[Deka smart file, DEKA, Italy]). Application&#xD;
      of the laser was performed through root canal and to the buccal mucosa over the apices of the&#xD;
      target tooth. An application biostimulation tip was used to ensure a constant distance of 10&#xD;
      mm to the tissue.The same procedures as in the laser group were performed, been completed but&#xD;
      the laser was not activated in this group. These patients were assigned as placebo&#xD;
      group.Postoperative pain was measured and documented via the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). VAS&#xD;
      consists of a 100 mm line which is represented at one end by a sign 'No pain' and at the&#xD;
      other end 'unbearable pain'. This form was given to the each patient and they were instructed&#xD;
      to mark according to the pain intensity at 4th, 8th, 12th, 24th, 48th and 72th hours.There&#xD;
      was statistically significant difference between groups at the 12th and 24th hours (p&lt;.05).&#xD;
      However, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups at the 4th,&#xD;
      8th, 48th, and 72th hours (p&gt;.05). Aside from sex, No statistically significant differences&#xD;
      were detected between the groups in terms of demographic data (age and tooth number) except&#xD;
      for gender (P &gt; .05). During in this study, no patient reported swelling, sinus tract,&#xD;
      palpation pain and didn't need analgesics both in groups.Within the limitations of the&#xD;
      present study, LLLT can decrease postoperative pain after root canal treatment of single&#xD;
      rooted teeth.&#xD;
