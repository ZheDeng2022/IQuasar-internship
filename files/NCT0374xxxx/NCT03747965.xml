      Multiple solid tumors have positive targets of mesothelin expressed on the surfaces of the&#xD;
      tumor cells, the investigators use the technique of CRISPR-Cas9 to knocked out the PD-1 of&#xD;
      the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with the combination of Pretreatment by&#xD;
      Paclitaxel and Cyclophosphamideto to effect the immuno-microenvironment around tumors.&#xD;

      1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated PD-1 gene-knocked out&#xD;
           chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in patients with mesothelin positive multiple&#xD;
           solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the duration and in vivo persistence of transferred CAR-T cells.&#xD;
