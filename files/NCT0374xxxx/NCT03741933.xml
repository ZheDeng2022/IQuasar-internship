    <textblock>
      Investigators have designed a pilot study involving chronic hand dermatitis (CHD) patients&#xD;
      who attend the dermatology clinic at the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates (GW&#xD;
      MFA) in order to assess the efficacy and safety of apremilast treatment for the treatment of&#xD;
      moderate to severe CHD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders encountered by dermatologists.&#xD;
      Chronic hand dermatitis (CHD) is often due to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) or irritant&#xD;
      contact dermatitis (ICD) and has a 1-year and lifetime prevalence of up to 10% and 15%,&#xD;
      respectively, in the general population. On average, the disease affects patients for about 7&#xD;
      to 11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ACD show an increase in cytokines produced from T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells,&#xD;
      including (interleukin) IL-17 and IL-23, which are also implicated in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      psoriasis. Apremilast, a small molecule phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor, has&#xD;
      demonstrated clinical efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis, likely through the blockade of IL-17, IL-23, and several other pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators. Therefore, it may provide an effective treatment option for other Th1 and&#xD;
      Th17-mediated disease (such as CHD due to ACD and ICD), which share a common immunologic&#xD;
      pathway with psoriasis. Investigators hypothesize that apremilast has the ability to decrease&#xD;
      disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe CHD that is either secondary to&#xD;
      psoriasis, or occurring in patients with an atopic or allergic past medical history. Hence,&#xD;
      investigators have designed a pilot study involving CHD patients who attend the dermatology&#xD;
      clinic at the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates (GW MFA) in order to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of apremilast treatment for the treatment of moderate to severe CHD. The&#xD;
      objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the efficacy of Apremilast 30mg twice daily administered as monotherapy in the&#xD;
      treatment of moderate-to-severe CHD as assessed by improvement of the Physician Global&#xD;
      Assessment (PGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Apremilast 30mg twice daily as assessed by&#xD;
           monitoring adverse events, laboratory values (CBC, CMP), and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate CHD lesion time to response (TTR) as assessed by Modified Total Lesion&#xD;
           Symptom Score (mTLSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the patient's perception of CHD severity improvement as assessed by the&#xD;
           Patient Global Assessment (PaGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the patient's health-related quality of life as assessed by the Dermatology&#xD;
           Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire a measurement of the patient's subjective&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Proportion of patients achieving a 2 point decrease in Physician Global Assessment (PGA)&#xD;
      at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of patients achieving Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 (clear) or&#xD;
           1 (almost clear) at end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in mTLSS, patient global assessment, and DLQI scores from baseline to end of&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Photographic improvement of CHD from baseline to end of study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will be patients that have been screened within the Department of Dermatology at the GW MFA. Individuals meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. A total of 10 patients will be enrolled in the study and each patient will be given Apremilast 30 mg twice daily to be administered for a period of 6 months. Patients will present to clinic for clinical assessments, adverse event monitoring, laboratory testing, and/or photography at the following time periods of therapy: baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter until completion of the 6 month treatment period. Additionally, all patients will be required to return for a 4-week follow up visit after completing the final dose of the study medication.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PGA classifies the severity of CHD into five categories (clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, and severe). The PGA scale ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe disease). PGA ratings will be based on an integrated clinical picture of signs, symptoms, and the extent of disease.</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mTLSS is a 4-point scale that is calculated as sum of assigned scores for the symptoms of erythema, scaling, lichenification/hyperkeratosis, vesiculation, edema, fissures and pruritus/pain. The total score ranges from 0 (best) to 21 (worst). Scores will be assigned for the most affected side (palmar or dorsal) of the most affected hand. The investigator will assign mTLSS scores for patients at all visits.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate the patient's perception of CHD severity improvement as assessed by the Patient Global Assessment (PaGA).</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked by the investigator to grade their overall change from baseline by selecting one of the following descriptions, which best matches their perception of overall treatment effect: cleared or almost clear (at least 90% clearing), marked improvement (at least 75% clearing), moderate improvement (at least 50% clearing), mild improvement (at least 25% clearing), no change, or worsening.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate the patient's health-related quality of life as assessed by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire a measurement of the patient's subjective symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of dermatitis disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QOL). Patients are asked to assess QOL over the past week with a simple response (0 to 3; where 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 3 = &quot;very much&quot;), with an overall scoring system of 0 to 30 and a high score being indicative of a poor QOL.</description>

             Investigator, based on medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratories,&#xD;
             and urinalysis. (NOTE: The definition of good health means a subject does not have&#xD;
             uncontrolled significant co-morbid conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical diagnosis of CHD as defined by hand dermatitis for more than 6 months or more&#xD;

             picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             Screening and Baseline. While on investigational product and for at least 28 days&#xD;
             after taking the last dose of investigational product, FCBP who engage in activity in&#xD;
             which conception is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive§ options&#xD;
             described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral,&#xD;
        injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD); tubal&#xD;
        ligation; or partner's vasectomy;&#xD;

        † A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who 1) has not undergone a&#xD;
        hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical&#xD;
        removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive&#xD;
        months (that is, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        § The female subject's chosen form of contraception must be effective by the time the&#xD;
        female subject is randomized into the study (for example, hormonal contraception should be&#xD;
        initiated at least 28 days before randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. &lt;18 or &gt;79 years of age.&#xD;
