    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Expanded Umbilical Cord&#xD;
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells on patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Any adverse events&#xD;
      related to UCMSCs infusion will be monitored.The primary outcome is the improvement rate of&#xD;
      PASI(Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and treatment response will be computed from PASI&#xD;
      before and after UCMSCs infusion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both.&#xD;
      Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis.&#xD;
      Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities,&#xD;
      patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and&#xD;
      biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or&#xD;
      limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to&#xD;
      find new treatment for psoriasis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem&#xD;
      cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Umbilical cord&#xD;
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells were isolated from umbilical cord matrix and were reported to treat&#xD;
      moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports.&#xD;
      For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely&#xD;
      accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation,&#xD;
      migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that&#xD;
      the injection of UCMSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.&#xD;
