  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homeless adults are 8 times as likely to be alcohol dependent compared with adults in the&#xD;
      general population, yet few studies have examined the precipitants of alcohol use in this&#xD;
      vulnerable population. Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) that involve repeated&#xD;
      assessment of thoughts/mood/behaviors (e.g., via smart phone) is currently the most accurate&#xD;
      way to assess individuals in real-time in their natural environments. Advances in smartphone&#xD;
      technology also allow for the collection of continuous geolocation and other passive sensing&#xD;
      data. Thus, researchers can now link environmental risks and protective factors to outcomes,&#xD;
      without reliance on subjective reporting alone. Building on prior work, this study will use a&#xD;
      three-phase study to develop and test a &quot;just in time&quot; adaptive intervention to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol use in homeless men and women. Phase I will use smartphones and passive sensing&#xD;
      technologies to monitor geolocation, psychosocial variables (e.g., stress, affect, urge to&#xD;
      drink), and alcohol use in a group of 80 homeless adults with an AUD who are receiving&#xD;
      shelter-based treatment. Phase I will identify environmental (i.e., geolocation), cognitive,&#xD;
      and behavioral antecedents of alcohol use over 4 weeks. Phase II will use this information to&#xD;
      create a risk algorithm and tailored treatment messages that anticipate and intervene to&#xD;
      prevent drinking. The resulting app will assess imminent risk of alcohol use after each EMA&#xD;
      and will deliver relevant treatment messages that match a person's current risk factors.&#xD;
      Phase III will test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the app in a&#xD;
      sample of 40 homeless adults with an AUD who receive the EMA plus treatment messages over 4&#xD;
      weeks. Drinking will be determined via self-report, supplemented by a transdermal alcohol&#xD;
      sensor (i.e., SCRAM) worn by participants. This project will be the first to combine&#xD;
      geolocation and psychosocial variables to identify real-time antecedents of drinking. If&#xD;
      effective, this smartphone app could significantly improve treatment engagement, drinking&#xD;
      outcomes, and quality of life among homeless adults with alcohol use disorders.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 6.2% of US adults will be homeless at some point in their lifetime. Homeless&#xD;
      adults have higher rates of disease, greater risk of interpersonal violence, shorter life&#xD;
      expectancies, and disproportionately higher health care utilization and costs compared to&#xD;
      housed individuals. A significant contributor to morbidity and mortality among homeless&#xD;
      adults is the high prevalence of alcohol use. Approximately 33% of homeless adults have&#xD;
      current alcohol dependence, a rate nearly 8 times that of the general population. Although&#xD;
      shelter-based treatments are common, compliance is typically poor. Identifying factors that&#xD;
      influence alcohol use would significantly improve the ability to develop effective&#xD;
      interventions and engage homeless adults in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatively little is known about the environmental, cognitive, and behavioral antecedents of&#xD;
      alcohol use in homeless adults. Like other subgroups, alcohol use has most often been&#xD;
      examined using traditional lab/clinic based assessment methods that are not well suited to&#xD;
      capturing the complicated street-level interactions experienced by most homeless adults.&#xD;
      Traditional assessment methodologies may also provide biased and/or inaccurate estimates due&#xD;
      to recall biases and errors in memory, particularly in this complicated population.&#xD;
      Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), in which handheld devices (e.g., smartphones) are used&#xD;
      to capture moment-to-moment experience, is currently the most accurate way to measure&#xD;
      phenomena in natural settings. Additionally, recent technological advances have made it&#xD;
      possible to collect continuous geolocation data alongside EMA. Researchers can now link&#xD;
      environmental risks and protective factors to outcomes, without reliance on subjective&#xD;
      reporting alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will develop and test a &quot;just-in-time&quot; adaptive intervention to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol use among homeless adults. Phase I will use smartphones and passive sensing to&#xD;
      monitor geolocation, psychosocial variables (e.g., stress, urge to drink), and alcohol use in&#xD;
      a group of 80 homeless adults enrolled in shelter-based treatment for an AUD. Phase II will&#xD;
      use this information to create a risk algorithm and tailored treatment messages that&#xD;
      anticipate and intervene to prevent alcohol use. Phase II will modify an existing app,&#xD;
      previously validated for smoking cessation, to create the intervention. Phase III will pilot&#xD;
      test the newly developed app for utility, satisfaction, and preliminary effectiveness in a&#xD;
      group of 40 homeless adults with an AUD who are enrolled in shelter-based treatment. Alcohol&#xD;
      consumption will be validated via a transdermal alcohol sensor (i.e., SCRAM) worn by&#xD;
      participants in Phases I and III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that alcohol use is strongly affected by moment-to-moment risk and&#xD;
      protective factors. This study will be able to use EMAs to identify and automatically&#xD;
      intervene during moments when people are at high risk for drinking. This hypothesis is based&#xD;
      on preliminary findings among homeless, justice-involved, and socioeconomically disadvantaged&#xD;
      safety-net hospital patients. If effective, this smartphone app could significantly improve&#xD;
      treatment engagement, drinking outcomes, and quality of life among homeless adults with AUDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use EMA to identify environmental (i.e., geolocation), cognitive, and behavioral&#xD;
           antecedents of alcohol use among 80 homeless adults with an AUD who are receiving&#xD;
           shelter-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informed by Aim 1 findings, develop a &quot;just-in-time&quot; adaptive intervention to reduce&#xD;
           alcohol use, including an alcohol use risk algorithm and corresponding theory-based&#xD;
           treatment messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a just-in-time&#xD;
           adaptive smartphone app among 40 homeless adults with an AUD who are receiving&#xD;
           shelter-based treatment.&#xD;
