    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to slow&#xD;
      disease progression and improve overall survival in Chinese participants who have newly&#xD;
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have had a major positive response to initial therapy&#xD;
      and have not undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). This study will look at the effect of&#xD;
      ixazomib has on the length of time that participants are free of disease progression and&#xD;
      their overall survival. After the implementation of Amendment 8, participants who received&#xD;
      placebo-matching capsules before unblinding and have not yet experienced disease progression&#xD;
      will cross over to receive ixazomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will be assigned to a single&#xD;
      treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Ixazomib&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day&#xD;
      cycle, for up to 26 cycles or until documented PD or intolerable toxicity, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is until a total of approximately up to 67 months. Participants will make multiple&#xD;
      visits to the clinic, and every 4 weeks until the next line of therapy begins for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <description>Participants frailty status will be assessed on the basis of 4 components: age (&lt;75, 75- 80, and&gt;80 years correspond to frailty scores of 0, 1, and 2, respectively), the charlson comorbidity scoring system without age weighting (scores of â‰¤ 1 and â‰¥ 2 correspond to frailty scores of 0 and 1, respectively), the katz index of independence in activities of daily living (scores of &gt;4 and â‰¤ 4 correspond to frailty scores of 0 and 1, respectively) and lawton instrumental activities of daily living scale (scores of &gt;5 and â‰¤ 5 correspond to frailty scores of 0 and 1, respectively). The sum of the 4 frailty scores equals the total frailty score. A total frailty score of 0 corresponds to a frailty status of fit; a total score of 1, to unfit; and a total score of 2 or more, to frail. PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of PD as evaluated by an IRC. OS will be measured as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death.</description>

Time to improvement is defined as the time from the initial onset date (inclusive) of the maximum grade to the first onset date that the toxicity grade is below the maximum grade with no higher grade thereafter, or the resolution date, whichever occurs first.</description>
