  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated among individuals with the lowest levels of&#xD;
      income, education, and occupational status. In fact, smoking rates in the United States among&#xD;
      people living below the poverty line is nearly twice as high as those above the poverty&#xD;
      threshold. Highly flexible and low burden technology-based treatment approaches may overcome&#xD;
      many of the barriers that have limited the use and effectiveness of traditional smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatments among low socioeconomic status (SES) adults. Ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment (EMA), in which mobile devices are used to capture moment-to-moment experiences,&#xD;
      allows for the measurement of phenomena in real-time within natural settings.&#xD;
      Smartphone-based smoking cessation apps could offer easily accessible, highly tailored, and&#xD;
      intensive interventions at a fraction of the cost of traditional smoking cessation&#xD;
      counseling. The Smart-T app uses a lapse risk estimator to identify moments of heightened&#xD;
      risk for lapse, and the algorithm tailors treatment messages in real-time based upon level of&#xD;
      imminent smoking lapse risk and currently present lapse triggers. This study will compare&#xD;
      smoking cessation rates for those randomized to the Smart-T app or the NCI QuitGuide app.&#xD;

      Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated among individuals with the lowest levels of&#xD;
      income, education, and occupational status. In fact, smoking rates in the United States among&#xD;
      people living below the poverty line is nearly twice as high as those above the poverty&#xD;
      threshold. Highly flexible and low burden technology-based treatment approaches may overcome&#xD;
      many of the barriers that have limited the use and effectiveness of traditional smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatments among low SES adults. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), in which&#xD;
      mobile devices are used to capture moment-to-moment experiences, allows for the measurement&#xD;
      of phenomena in real-time within natural settings. Smartphone-based smoking cessation apps&#xD;
      could offer easily accessible, highly tailored, and intensive interventions at a fraction of&#xD;
      the cost of traditional smoking cessation counseling. The Smart-T app uses a lapse risk&#xD;
      estimator to identify moments of heightened risk for lapse, and the algorithm tailors&#xD;
      treatment messages in real-time based upon level of imminent smoking lapse risk and currently&#xD;
      present lapse triggers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the impact of treatment condition (i.e., Smart-T vs. QuitGuide app; n=225 per&#xD;
      group) on biochemically verified smoking abstinence. Hypothesis 1: Participants randomly&#xD;
      assigned to Smart-T will have significantly higher rates of biochemically-verified abstinence&#xD;
      than those assigned to QuitGuide at 26 weeks post-quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the effect of Smart-T treatment messages on key lapse risk factors. Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
      Smoking urge, stress, and cigarette availability will decline more and cessation motivation&#xD;
      will increase more following tailored messages that target these lapse triggers in real-time&#xD;
      (Smart-T condition) compared with similar situations wherein no messages are provided&#xD;
      (QuitGuide condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (N=550) will be recruited through the TSET Health Promotion Research Center&#xD;
      (HPRC) Tobacco Treatment Research Program (TTRP) which is directed by Dr. Darla Kendzor&#xD;
      (Co-I). Participants will also be recruited through advertisements. Individuals seeking&#xD;
      smoking cessation services at the TTRP will be given a verbal description of the study during&#xD;
      their first visit, and those interested will be screened for study eligibility. Those who&#xD;
      respond to study advertisements will complete a brief RedCap screener online (i.e.,&#xD;
      OKSmokerstudy.com), and those who qualify for the study will contacted by study staff and&#xD;
      scheduled for a screening/baseline visit. Consistent with our previous research with low SES&#xD;
      populations, we have limited exclusion criteria so that the sample is as broad and&#xD;
      representative of the population as possible. Interested individuals will be included in the&#xD;
      study if they: 1) earn a score ≥ 4 on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short&#xD;
      Form (REALM-SF)56 indicating &gt; 6th grade English literacy level (required to complete EMAs;&#xD;
      at least 88% of all individuals screened for our EMA studies have met this inclusion&#xD;
      criterion), 2) are willing to quit smoking 7 days after the baseline assessment, 3) are ≥ 18&#xD;
      years of age, 4) have an expired CO level ≥ 7 ppm suggestive of current smoking for those who&#xD;
      attend in person baseline visits or substantiate smoking status (e.g., produce a pack of&#xD;
      cigarettes) during baseline assessments by sending picture of cigarettes to staff 5) are&#xD;
      currently smoking ≥ 5 cigarettes per day, 6) have no contraindications to using NRT, 7) agree&#xD;
      to complete EMAs and CO tests on a study provided or personal smartphone, 8) have household&#xD;
      income &lt; 200% of the federal poverty guideline,57 and 9) agree to complete the 26 week&#xD;
      post-quit follow-up assessment over the phone and via EMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible and interested individuals will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups: 1) Smart-T smoking&#xD;
      cessation intervention plus NRT, or 2) NCI QuitGuide smoking cessation intervention plus NRT.&#xD;
      Stratified randomization will be used to assign participants to groups based upon race, sex,&#xD;
      and cigarettes smoked per day. Participants will be followed for 27 weeks and will attend&#xD;
      either 1 in-person visit or complete phone-based baseline visits. Participants will be&#xD;
      prompted to complete daily EMAs and tests of smoking status using a portable, low-cost,&#xD;
      carbon monoxide monitor (Bedfont iCO Smokerlyzer) on 3 days each week. This data will be used&#xD;
      to address primary (i.e., biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 26&#xD;
      weeks post-quit) and secondary outcomes (e.g., 30-day point prevalence abstinence, number of&#xD;
      days to first lapse, longest period of smoking abstinence). Geographic location data will be&#xD;
      captured multiple times per day to link characteristics of the present environment (e.g.,&#xD;
      proximity to tobacco outlets) with cessation-related outcomes. We have already created&#xD;
      software that integrates the iCO sensor into our InsightTM mobile application platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Study Update: A sample(n=30) of American Indian/Alaska Native participants who have&#xD;
      completed the 6 month follow-up assessment will be asked to participate in another&#xD;
      qualitative interview designed to assess the perceived utility and cultural fit of the&#xD;
      Smart-T App.Information gathered from these qualitative interviews will be used to culturally&#xD;
      modify and then experimentally test a new, culturally tailored, version of the Smart-T app&#xD;
      for AI/AN smokers who want to quit smoking. In addition, this will serve as an incredibly&#xD;
      valuable training opportunity for an emerging Native American scientist to learn tobacco&#xD;
      cessation, mHealth, and qualitative methods research from an interdisciplinary team of&#xD;
      leading experts in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROPOSED PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who provide informed consent and meet the study inclusion criteria will complete&#xD;
      the baseline assessment in TTRP clinic space (the TTRP is located in Research Parkway in a&#xD;
      building that is adjacent to the PI's office). Participants may alternatively complete the&#xD;
      baseline assessment via phone calls with study staff. Following the baseline assessment,&#xD;
      participants will be given instruction on how to complete phone-based EMAs and carbon&#xD;
      monoxide assessments. All participants, regardless of condition, will be compensated for&#xD;
      completing the baseline assessments, phone-based follow-up, and EMAs. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will complete expired breath carbon monoxide tests using the portable iCO device&#xD;
      3 days per week (weeks 1-27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and follow-up measures will assess demographic and smoking characteristics, multiple&#xD;
      constructs that are known to be related to lapse (e.g., depression, stress, affect, social&#xD;
      support), and document intervention effects (See Table 3 and Appendix). We will also access&#xD;
      participant perceptions of each app feature. The Baseline process will take approximately&#xD;
      60-90 minutes to complete and data will be collected either on laptop/tablet computers using&#xD;
      Questionnaire Development System (QDS) software or remotely via RedCap surveys. QDS uses a&#xD;
      computer-administered self-interview format (i.e., ACASI), which reduces data entry errors&#xD;
      and the need to retain paper copies of raw data. Each item appears on the computer screen&#xD;
      while the program simultaneously reads the item (participants touch the screen to select&#xD;
      answers only after QDS reads each item). Participants wear headphones so that others do not&#xD;
      hear the survey items. Participants from our previous studies in similar populations,&#xD;
      including those with no computer experience, have reported few problems using the QDS&#xD;
      program. Staff will be available to help participants who may have difficulty. The RedCap&#xD;
      surveys have been designed to replicate the QDS version as closely as possible. The 26 week&#xD;
      post-quit follow-up assessment, which includes a longer EMA (i.e., 20-30 minutes) and a phone&#xD;
      call based interview (i.e., The Treatment Improvement Survey, 10-15 minutes) that will be&#xD;
      recorded for qualitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who own an Android smartphone (OS version 6.0 or higher) will be encouraged to&#xD;
      download and use the study app on their own phone. Those who do not own this type of&#xD;
      smartphone and those who do not have a data plan will be loaned a Samsung smartphone (or&#xD;
      equivalent) for 27 weeks so that they may complete EMAs. Participants will navigate through&#xD;
      the EMA program and enter data simply by touching the screen. The study app (i.e., Smart-T&#xD;
      app or EMA only app) includes a &quot;Call Staff&quot; function/button that automatically calls study&#xD;
      staff (e.g., if they have problems completing EMAs). The EMA app also includes a &quot;Payment&quot;&#xD;
      button which, when pressed, indicates the number of EMAs that have been prompted and&#xD;
      completed and the current level of compensation based upon the up-to-the-moment percentage of&#xD;
      EMAs completed. Smartphones will automatically collect data when on-demand features are&#xD;
      accessed for both the QuitGuide and Smart-T groups (e.g., number of times features are used).&#xD;
      Use of personal vs. study provided phones will be examined as a covariate in all analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many smartphone based smoking cessation apps exist, none have been developed and&#xD;
      empirically validated via a randomized controlled trial in socioeconomically disadvantaged&#xD;
      populations of smokers who are seeking to quit smoking. This study is the next step in a line&#xD;
      of research that aims to develop and disseminate effective and automated treatments for&#xD;
      smoking cessation for this underserved and understudied population. Thus, the knowledge that&#xD;
      will be gained from this study is important. Furthermore, the Smart-T app will allow us to&#xD;
      reach a population that frequently lacks access to traditional intervention programs, due to&#xD;
      limited availability, income, and/or transportation, among other barriers. In addition, the&#xD;
      proposed smartphone app is highly versatile and may be easily modified for use in other&#xD;
      populations or communities. The risks to subjects are minimal, especially considering the&#xD;
      protections against risks that will be implemented for this study.&#xD;
