  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sore throat is a common problem in children typically caused by viral or bacterial&#xD;
      infections. While viral infections resolve without treatment, bacterial infections, such as&#xD;
      &quot;strep throat,&quot; are treatable with antibiotics. Diagnosing &quot;strep throat&quot; traditionally&#xD;
      required a throat swab for culture that delays treatment for several days. This may result in&#xD;
      prolonged illness, activity absenteeism, and significant healthcare costs. New molecular&#xD;
      tests can accurately diagnose &quot;strep throat&quot; within 8 minutes, but are more expensive and&#xD;
      require impact evaluation before widespread implementation. This study will compare a new&#xD;
      bedside molecular test with conventional throat cultures to evaluate for benefits to patients&#xD;
      and families seen in the emergency department, as well to healthcare system operations. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that care for children and the associated healthcare costs will&#xD;
      improve with these point of care molecular tests.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular-based, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), have been proposed as a diagnostic&#xD;
      solution for streptococcal pharyngitis. Indeed, available data suggest that NAATs have&#xD;
      similar performance to conventional culture testing, and point of care (POC) NAATs recently&#xD;
      became commercially available. These bedside tests do not require operation by laboratory&#xD;
      personnel and have been approved by Health Canada for use without the need for backup culture&#xD;
      testing. This study seeks to compare the clinical outcomes of a POC NAAT approach with a&#xD;
      conventional bacterial culture-based approach for children presenting to a Pediatric&#xD;
      Emergency Department (PED) with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis. Results from this&#xD;
      clinical trial will elicit critical information regarding the potential clinical benefit of&#xD;
      implementing this new technology in the PED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that clinical outcomes (duration of illness, incidence of&#xD;
      complications, absenteeism) and system utilization (PED length of stay, ancillary testing,&#xD;
      return visits to hospital or community healthcare facility, appropriate antibiotic treatment)&#xD;
      will improve with a POC NAAT diagnostic approach for suspected streptococcal pharyngitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the etiology of pharyngitis is necessary, both to minimize inappropriate&#xD;
      antimicrobial therapy for viral infections, and to reduce the incidence of complications,&#xD;
      duration of illness, and transmission of streptococcal infections, for which antibiotics are&#xD;
      indicated. However, signs and symptoms of viral and streptococcal pharyngitis overlap&#xD;
      significantly, and accurate differentiation based on history and clinical examination is&#xD;
      difficult even for experienced clinicians. As a result, the Infectious Diseases Society of&#xD;
      America (IDSA) currently recommends swabbing the throat and testing for streptococcal&#xD;
      pharyngitis by culture, which is the current standard of practice at BC Children's Hospital&#xD;
      (BCCH). However, while bacterial cultures are accurate and economical, they are often&#xD;
      clinically impractical and cause delay in treatment due to the relatively long lag time (&gt;48&#xD;
      hours) between collection of the specimen and final microbiological diagnosis. Available data&#xD;
      suggest that new POC NAATs have similar performance to conventional culture testing with&#xD;
      results available within 8 minutes. This could potentially improve clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      reduce system utilization, but implementation would require significant task shifting,&#xD;
      logistical support, and additional training. This study will provide an impact evaluation of&#xD;
      this new technology in a PED, which is a necessary first step prior to implementation, in an&#xD;
      effort to ultimately improve care for children and youth while minimizing costs to society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare POC NAAT testing with conventional throat&#xD;
      culture testing (the current standard of care) for children and adolescents presenting to a&#xD;
      PED for suspected streptococcal pharyngitis with regards to clinical management, symptom&#xD;
      resolution, and resource utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Visit Characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age in years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sex (Male or Female)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Triage acuity level using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visit day of the week (weekday/weekend/holiday)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Length of stay (minutes) using date and time of arrival (registration/triage) and date&#xD;
           and time of discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. McIsaac score (0-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Disposition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize study population demographic and baseline&#xD;
      characteristics. The Student t-test will be applied for continuous variables (mean time to&#xD;
      symptom resolution, mean days off, etc.), and the chi-square test will be applied for&#xD;
      categorical variables (proportion appropriately treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left over swabs from either study arm will be stored to subsequently culture or conduct NAAT&#xD;
      testing for patients randomized to the interventional (POC testing) or standard (conventional&#xD;
      culture) study arms, respectively. This alternate method testing will not be conducted until&#xD;
      the end of the study, unless culture and sensitivity testing is required earlier for a&#xD;
      patient that is randomized to the interventional POC study arm with a known severe&#xD;
      beta-lactam allergy and/or does not respond to second-line therapy. The POC test performance&#xD;
      will not be evaluated as part of this study as it has been determined to be at least&#xD;
      equivalent to culture detection in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using published literature on the effect of antibiotics on GAS pharyngitis, we estimate that&#xD;
      the mean time to resolution in the POC group is 3 days (with a standard deviation of 2 days),&#xD;
      and a minimally important difference in mean time to resolution between the groups being 1.5&#xD;
      days. Using 80% power at a significance level of 0.05, the required sample size is 28&#xD;
      subjects per group. With an estimated 30% positivity rate, and accounting for 10% of&#xD;
      individuals lost to follow-up, the investigators will aim to recruit 100 subjects per group.&#xD;
