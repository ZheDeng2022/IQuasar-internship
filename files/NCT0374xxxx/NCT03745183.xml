      Background: Tinea imbricata (&quot;tokelau&quot;) is a rare form of tinea corporis which is caused by&#xD;
      Trichophyton concentricum. It is endemic among the T'boli tribe in Sarangani, Philippines .&#xD;
      Temporary remissions, despite antifungal treatment, can be attributed to factors such as&#xD;
      genetic susceptibility, widespread poverty, poor hygienic conditions and overcrowding.&#xD;
      Limited access to commercial antifungal medications makes the treatment of tinea imbricata a&#xD;
      pressing public health concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Senna alata grows abundantly in the areas where the T'boli tribe resides. Anecdotal reports&#xD;
      about its efficacy as a treatment for tinea imbricata exist and need to be further validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of a community-prepared Senna&#xD;
      alata leaf decoction in the treatment of tinea imbricata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is a preliminary open label, before and after clinical trial. Enrolled&#xD;
      patients were taught how to make Senna alata leaf decoction and were asked to apply it as a&#xD;
      leave-on body wash once a day for 28+/-3 days. Disease severity, pruritus visual analogue&#xD;
      scale scores (VAS) and potassium hydroxide smear (KOH) of the skin scrapings were evaluated&#xD;
      before and after treatment. Two separate assessors evaluated post treatment severity based on&#xD;
      standard photographs. Diagnostic concordance was determined using Cohen's kappa statistics.&#xD;
      Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test was used to analyzed before and after clinical parameter&#xD;
      scores. Adverse drug events were recorded.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tinea imbricata is a rare form of tinea corporis caused by Trichophyton concentricum, an&#xD;
      anthropophilic dermatophyte. Its lesions would present embossed &quot;maze-like&quot; or lace-like&#xD;
      pattern of embosed concentric rings mainly on the trunk and extensor surfaces of both&#xD;
      extremities, sparing the palms, soles, hair and nails. Due to the rarity of the disease,&#xD;
      limited epidemiologic and prevalence studies exist. (Halickova, 2008) Tine imbricata is known&#xD;
      to be endemic in places such as the PaciÔ¨Åc Islands of Oceana, South East Asia, India,&#xD;
      Sri-Lanka, North, Central and South America. (Halickova, 2008 and Pihet, 2008) The first case&#xD;
      was discovered in the southern Philippines by William Dampier in 1789. (Fernandez, 1962) In&#xD;
      2010, cases of tinea imbricata were found to still exist among T'boli tribe who live in the&#xD;
      mountainous areas of Kiamba in Sarangani through the University of the Philippines-&#xD;
      Department of Science and Technology (UP-DOST) telemedicine project. (Carpio, 2010) The&#xD;
      inherited susceptibility of T.concentricum infection may explain why the disease affects only&#xD;
      specific group of people. The most accepted inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive&#xD;
      attributing to the inherited defect in cell-mediated immunity, which results to failure of&#xD;
      the T-lymphocytes to become sensitized to the fungi and mount an immune response. Majority of&#xD;
      the patients are blood-related individuals and rarely infect unrelated individuals even after&#xD;
      close contact or cohabitation., Other risk factors are isolated and primitive living&#xD;
      conditions especially in humid areas, widespread poverty, poor hygienic conditions and&#xD;
      overcrowding. (Bonifaz, 2003 and Bonifaz, 2004) Antifungals are the mainstay treatment&#xD;
      against Trichophyton concentricum. Griseofulvin, 500 mg/tab twice daily, and terbinafine, 250&#xD;
      mg once daily, for at least 4 weeks result to complete resolution. (Wingfield, 2004) However,&#xD;
      these commercial antifungal preparations are costly and not readily available in the health&#xD;
      centers of Sarangani. Furthermore, even with systemic antifungal intake, disease remission&#xD;
      would only last for at least 8 weeks post-treatment. Alternative treatment options that will&#xD;
      promote clearance of the infection that are accessible, inexpensive and practical to use&#xD;
      should be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antifungals from local plant sources are one of the potential alternatives. Among these,&#xD;
      Senna alata has validated efficacy on superficial dermatophytic infections and is included in&#xD;
      the Philippine National Drug Formulary. It is a tropical ornamental shrub, also known as&#xD;
      candle bush and locally as &quot;Akapulko, which grows throughout the low and medium altitude&#xD;
      areas of the country including Sarangani.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical screening of the leaves and roots of S. alata revealed the anthraquinones and its&#xD;
      derivatives such as aloe, emodin, chrysophanol, and rhein, are the major components&#xD;
      responsible for its antifungal activity. These are naturally occurring phenolic compounds are&#xD;
      readily oxidized to form a phenolate ion or quinone, which aids in the scavenging and&#xD;
      entrapment of microorganisms. Furthermore, phenols impair a variety of enzyme systems that&#xD;
      are involved in the microorganism's energy production. They also disrupt the integrity of the&#xD;
      cell membrane and interfere with the synthesis of its structural components. (Hemen and&#xD;
      Ledwani,2012) There were anecdotal reports on the efficacy of akapulko decoction against&#xD;
      tinea imbricata. A decoction is the liquid resulting from concentrating the essence of the&#xD;
      substance by heating or boiling, especially a medicinal preparation made from a plant. Plant&#xD;
      parts such as leaves can be used in decoctions. The first anecdotal report was published by&#xD;
      Dofitas and Non last 2010. Senna alata leaf decoction was used as leave-on body wash in a&#xD;
      T'boli woman resulting in complete clearance of the lesions. In the case series by Carpio et.&#xD;
      al., S. alata leaf decoction resulted to partial improvement of the skin lesions. (Dofitas&#xD;
      and Non, 2010 and Caprio, 2010) At present there are no existing clinical trials about the&#xD;
      use of akapulko as an alternative or complementary treatment to tinea imbricata. The&#xD;
      favorable results from the anecdotal and case series studies pave the way for the&#xD;
      consideration of akapulko decoction as a part of an accessible and affordable treatment&#xD;
      regimen for tinea imbricata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objectives: This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of Senna alata leaf&#xD;
      decoction applied once daily in the treatment of tinea imbricata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the treatment response at the end of four weeks (28 days +/-3) as measured&#xD;
           by disease severity, pruritus visual analogue scale score and potassium hydroxide smear&#xD;
           conversion of the patients with tinea imbricata treated once daily with Senna alata leaf&#xD;
           decoction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To document the adverse reactions associated with Senna alata leaf decoction&#xD;
           application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a preliminary open label, before-and after clinical trial. This study took&#xD;
      place at Kiamba Municipality, Sarangani Province, Mindanao from November 2014 to January&#xD;
      2015. The duration of patient involvement was 4 weeks (28+3 days). Figure 1 shows the flow&#xD;
      chart of the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants: An outreach skin clinic, manned by dermatology residents and&#xD;
      consultants of the University of the Philippines- Philippine General Hospital, was conducted&#xD;
      in the local health center. Patients with any skin disease and suspected tinea imbricata&#xD;
      cases were invited to consult. Patient recruitment began during the outreach mission and was&#xD;
      continued even thereafter. A consultant investigator assessed eligibility and disease&#xD;
      severity of the participants, during and even after the outreach mission. Trained research&#xD;
      assistants collected skin scrapings from active skin lesions of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant was assigned code numbers written on the case record forms. The&#xD;
      participants' names with the corresponding numbers were recorded in a separate registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Securing consent and enrolment of participants: All patients with clinically diagnosed tinea&#xD;
      imbricata and with microscopically positive KOH smear were invited by the investigators to&#xD;
      join the study. The purpose, duration, benefits and possible adverse effects were explained&#xD;
      to all participants and signed consent forms were secured by research assistants who could&#xD;
      speak T'boli dialect. A thumb mark was obtained in place of a signature for illiterate&#xD;
      participants. (Appendices A, B, and C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients were subjected to the following steps before starting therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detailed history-taking and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collection of skin scrapings and microscopic confirmation of fungal elements in skin&#xD;
           scrapings using potassium hydroxide mount&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Accomplishment of the standard case record forms, which details the severity of the&#xD;
           disease, pruritus VAS score and adverse drug effects. (Appendix D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pre-treatment photographic documentation. A written consent was obtained prior to&#xD;
           photographic documentation of each patient. Photography was done in a private room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of Akapulko leaf decoction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were instructed to take a bath once a day using a syndet bar and to towel&#xD;
      dry their skin before applying the akapulko decoction. Fresh decoction was prepared by the&#xD;
      patients every day. After a bath, the patient applied the fresh cooled decoction by hand on&#xD;
      the whole body especially on the affected areas and left it to dry. Approximately one&#xD;
      glassful (350ml) of akapulko decoction should be consumed for one whole body application. The&#xD;
      total duration of daily application should be 4 weeks (28 days +3) until the next outcome&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were given illustrated, laminated instructional materials and a tabulated&#xD;
      checklist of instructions on how to prepare and apply the akapulko decoction. This served as&#xD;
      a monitoring sheet of each patient. (Appendix E) The barangay health workers underwent&#xD;
      hands-on training by the investigators on the preparation of the akapulko leaf decoction.&#xD;
      Trained research assistants conducted demonstration of the akapulko preparation to the&#xD;
      enrolled patients. (Appendix F)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Parameters: Each patient was assessed based on disease severity based on erythema,&#xD;
      scaling and area of involvement. (Tables 1-3) Then, composite scores were combined and graded&#xD;
      no disease, mild, moderate and severe. (Table 4) Pruritus severity was gauge using 10-cm&#xD;
      pruritus visual analogue scale score. KOH smear of skin scrapings was also done before and&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response to treatment was assessed after 4 weeks. Standard photographs were taken by&#xD;
      the research assistants for documentation and sent electronically via email to the&#xD;
      investigators. A panel of two dermatologists who had prior clinical experience with tinea&#xD;
      imbricata assessed the treatment response based on the digital photographs taken at the end&#xD;
      of the treatment period. Post-treatment VAS scores were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycologic cure was assessed as a negative KOH mount after 1 month of treatment in both&#xD;
      treatment groups. The research aides or the public health nurse collected skin scrapings for&#xD;
      KOH on the same site as the pre-treatment KOH source. Samples were placed in clean pieces of&#xD;
      folded bond paper inside a properly sealed envelope and airmailed to the investigators for&#xD;
      KOH microscopic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis A standard case record form was used to collect patient data&#xD;
      (Appendix A). Accomplished records were checked for accuracy and completeness by the&#xD;
      investigators in the field. Data gathered were encoded in an electronic spreadsheet,&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis was done, which included epidemiologic characteristics, initial disease&#xD;
      severity, and clinical outcome per patient. Clearance rates were computed after 4 weeks using&#xD;
      the formulas below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearance rate = Number of patients who underwent clearance x 100/ Total number of patients&#xD;
      enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial clearance rate = Number of patients who underwent partial clearance X 100/Total&#xD;
      number of patients enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure rate = Number of patients who had no improvement + worsening disease severity&#xD;
      X100/Total number of patients enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient was classified as with complete clearance, partial clearance or no clearance.&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis by disease severity was performed. Diagnostic concordance between the two&#xD;
      consultants who assessed disease severity was determined using Cohen's kappa statistics.&#xD;
      Wilcoxon paired signed rank test was used to analyzed before and after clinical parameter&#xD;
      scores. Adverse drug events, reported by the patients, were recorded as a frequency&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions Presence of any adverse reactions was noted. Subjects were instructed to&#xD;
      report side effects for proper management. (Table 5) Participants with mild to severe adverse&#xD;
      drug effects were to be withdrawn from the study and provided appropriate management by the&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted in accordance to the guidelines of the Helsinki declaration. The&#xD;
      study protocol was formulated in accordance to the guidelines imposed by the National Ethical&#xD;
      Guideline for Health Research published by the Philippine Health Research Ethics Board and&#xD;
      was conducted upon the approval of the institution's ethics review board. Since indigenous&#xD;
      people are involved as subjects, this study was approved the National Commission on&#xD;
      Indigenous People (NCIP). A research grant was received from the Philippine Dermatological&#xD;
      Society. There were no conflicts of interest in the conduct of this research.&#xD;
