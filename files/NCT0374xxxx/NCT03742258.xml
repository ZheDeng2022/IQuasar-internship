      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new investigational drug, TAK-659, given&#xD;
      in combination with standard chemotherapy, for the treatment of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma&#xD;
      (DLBCL). ?Investigational? means that TAK-659 has not been approved by the United States Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a prescription or over-the-counter medication to&#xD;
      treat a certain condition. The primary purpose of this study is to find the appropriate and&#xD;
      safe dose of the study drug to be used in combination with standard chemotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of your disease and to determine how well the drug works in treating the disease.&#xD;
      Other objectives include measuring the amount of the study drug in the body at different&#xD;
      times after taking the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study is expected to last for up to 3 years after receiving the last&#xD;
      dose of the study drug. Patients will receive the study treatment for up to 18 weeks, as long&#xD;
      as they are benefitting.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of TAK-659 when combined&#xD;
      with R-CHOP in the front-line treatment of high-risk diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess preliminary efficacy of TAK-659 combined with R-CHOP in the front-line treatment&#xD;
      of high-risk DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-659 in combination with R-CHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV), cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride&#xD;
      IV over 3-5 minutes, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, and prednisone orally (PO) on days&#xD;
      1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive spleen&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659 PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
