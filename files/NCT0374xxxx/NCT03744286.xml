  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to fully test a newly developed affordable cost variable&#xD;
      slip inducer in the ambulatory, incomplete spinal cord population. It is a self-contained&#xD;
      device using a moving serial plank mechanism with wheels on the underside of each plank that&#xD;
      allow for structured slips while a person walks over the planks with a harness for safety.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All planks appear the same but can be adjusted on the underside allowing for it to be stable&#xD;
      or can allow a slip in the forward and/or backward direction of up to 8 inches. This distance&#xD;
      was determined from a review of slip bio-mechanics that noted that a slip is likely to occur&#xD;
      when a slip distance exceeds 10 cm (3.9 inches) with the probability of recovery decreasing&#xD;
      as the distance increases. The first goal of the project is to determine the optimal distance&#xD;
      required for individuals with incomplete spinal cord injuries to have a 50% fall rate, as&#xD;
      healthy individuals were found to have a fall rate of 50% at 11 inches. Investigators will&#xD;
      then look at common clinical assessments and examine their ability to predict an individual's&#xD;
      ability to recover from the individual's identified optimal slip distance. Investigators will&#xD;
      also look at within session training effect on a person's balance control following a&#xD;
      training session using the device.&#xD;

    <description>During the static stability test, the participants will be instructed to stand on the force plate as still as possible for 60 seconds with their eyes open. After 2 minutes of rest, the task will be repeated with the eyes closed. The excursions of the center of pressure (COP) and EMG of leg muscles will be analyzed.&#xD;
The AMTI Force System from Water Town, MA will be used to for this test. The platform is placed on the floor and subjects stand on the device. The force plate measures the forces and movements applied to its top surface.</description>

    <description>During the dynamic stability test, the ability to voluntarily displace the COP to a maximum distance without losing balance will be assessed (Limits of stability (LOS) test). The participant will be instructed to lean forward, backward, left, and right, hold the position for ~5 seconds and return back to the initial/center position.&#xD;
