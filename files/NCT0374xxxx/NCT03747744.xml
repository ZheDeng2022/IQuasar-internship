  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past few years it has become evident that cancer cells can be recognized by the&#xD;
      patient's own immune system. The immunological mechanisms at play are often referred to as&#xD;
      the &quot;cancer immune cycle&quot; (Chen and Mellman 2013; Mellman 2013; Chen and Mellman 2017).In&#xD;
      immune-evasive tumors a pivotal role has been attributed to myeloid dendritic cells (myDC) in&#xD;
      regulating the activity of anti-tumor CTL activity within the TME (Broz, Binnewies et al.&#xD;
      2014). In animal models, myDC have been demonstrated to play an essential role in &quot;licensing&quot;&#xD;
      anti-tumor CTLs to eradicate tumor cells. These myDC also migrate to tumor-draining lymph&#xD;
      nodes and present tumor antigens to T-cells in these secondary lymphoid organs (Roberts, Broz&#xD;
      et al. 2016). Human myDCs exist in two subsets that are differentiated by expression of&#xD;
      either the BDCA-1 or BDCA-3 surface marker. The CD1c (BDCA-1)+ antigen is specifically&#xD;
      expressed on human dendritic cells, which are CD11chighCD123low and represent the major&#xD;
      subset of myDCs in human blood (about 0.6 % of all peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMCs)). CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC play an important role in the cross-presentation of tumor&#xD;
      antigens following immunogenic cell death (Di Blasio, Wortel et al. 2016). Under conditions&#xD;
      of tumor growth, myDC will be poorly recruited to the tumor microenvironment, do not get&#xD;
      activated and thereby fail to efficiently coordinate anti-tumor immunity within the tumor&#xD;
      micro-environment and present tumor associated antigens within tumor-draining lymph nodes.&#xD;
      Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is a first-in-class oncolytic virus based on a modified&#xD;
      herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 designed to selectively replicate in and lyse tumor cells&#xD;
      while promoting regional and systemic antitumor immunity. In this phase I clinical trial we&#xD;
      propose to investigate the safety of intratumoral injection of autologous CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC&#xD;
      in non-visceral metastases of melanoma plus intratumoral injection of T-VEC (at its approved&#xD;
      dose and regimen for the treatment of melanoma). We hypothesize that CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC in&#xD;
      the T-VEC inflamed tumor microenvironment of the metastasis will capture tumor antigens in&#xD;
      vivo and through cross-presentation of these antigens coordinate an effective anti-tumor&#xD;
      T-cell response.&#xD;

      Over the past few years it has become evident that cancer cells can be recognized by the&#xD;
      patient's own immune system. The immunological mechanisms at play are often referred to as&#xD;
      the &quot;cancer immune cycle&quot; (Chen and Mellman 2013; Mellman 2013; Chen and Mellman 2017).&#xD;
      Remarkable anti-tumor activity has been achieved by blocking the inhibitory T-cell receptor&#xD;
      CTLA-4 and/or the PD-1/-L1 axis. Immune checkpoint inhibition by monoclonal antibody (mAb)&#xD;
      therapy has become a standard of care in patients with advanced melanoma, renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and bladder cancer. Indications&#xD;
      are still expanding. Activity of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition has been correlated with&#xD;
      hallmarks of pre-existing anti-tumor T-cell response (e.g. presence of cytotoxic T&#xD;
      lymphocytes (CTL) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), PD-L1 expression in response to T-cell&#xD;
      secreted IFN-gamma and transcriptional evidence for CTL-activity), mutational load of the&#xD;
      cancer cells and presence of highly immunogenic neo-epitopes in the cancer cell genome&#xD;
      (Tumeh, Harview et al. 2014). In immune-evasive tumors a pivotal role has been attributed to&#xD;
      myeloid dendritic cells (myDC) in regulating the activity of anti-tumor CTL activity within&#xD;
      the TME (Broz, Binnewies et al. 2014). In animal models, myDC have been demonstrated to play&#xD;
      an essential role in &quot;licensing&quot; anti-tumor CTLs to eradicate tumor cells. Activation of&#xD;
      oncogenic signaling pathways such as the WNT/beta-Catenin pathway can lead to the exclusion&#xD;
      of myeloid DC's from the TMZ (Spranger, Bao et al. 2015; Spranger and Gajewski 2016). Absence&#xD;
      of myDCs at the invasive margin and within metastases has been correlated with defective CTL&#xD;
      activation allowing the metastasis to escape the anti-tumor immune response (Salmon, Idoyaga&#xD;
      et al. 2016). These myDC also migrate to tumor-draining lymph nodes and present tumor&#xD;
      antigens to T-cells in these secondary lymphoid organs (Roberts, Broz et al. 2016). Presence&#xD;
      of myeloid DC's was more strongly correlated with T-cell infiltration into tumors as compared&#xD;
      to neo-antigen load in 266 melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas(Spranger, Luke et al.&#xD;
      2016). Human myDCs exist in two subsets that are differentiated by expression of either the&#xD;
      BDCA-1 or BDCA-3 surface marker. The CD1c (BDCA-1)+ antigen is specifically expressed on&#xD;
      human dendritic cells, which are CD11chighCD123low and represent the major subset of myDCs in&#xD;
      human blood (about 0.6 % of all peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)). CD1c (BDCA-1)+&#xD;
      myDC have a monocytoid morphology and express myeloid markers such as CD13 and CD33 as well&#xD;
      as Fc receptors such as CD32, CD64, and FceRI. Furthermore, myDC are determined to be CD4+,&#xD;
      Lin (CD3, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD56)-, CD2+, CD45RO+, CD141 (BDCA-3)-low, CD303 (BDCA-2)-, and&#xD;
      CD304 (BDCA-4/Neuropilin-1)-. A proportion of CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC co-expresses CD14 and&#xD;
      CD11b. These dual positive cells for CD14+ and CD1c (BDCA-1) have immunosuppressive capacity&#xD;
      and inhibit T-cell proliferation in vitro. Depletion of this cell type is preferred prior to&#xD;
      using CD1c (BDCA-1)+ cells for immunostimulatory purposes (Bakdash, Buschow et al. 2016;&#xD;
      Schroder, Melum et al. 2016). CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC play an important role in the&#xD;
      cross-presentation of tumor antigens following immunogenic cell death (Di Blasio, Wortel et&#xD;
      al. 2016). Under conditions of tumor growth, myDC will be poorly recruited to the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment, do not get activated and thereby fail to efficiently coordinate anti-tumor&#xD;
      immunity within the tumor micro-environment and present tumor associated antigens within&#xD;
      tumor-draining lymph nodes. When activated appropriately, human CD1c (BDCA-1)+ dendritic&#xD;
      cells secrete high levels of IL-12 and potently prime CTL responses (Nizzoli, Krietsch et al.&#xD;
      2013). In vitro, IL-12 production by CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC can be boosted by exogenous&#xD;
      IFN-gamma. (Nizzoli, Krietsch et al. 2013) CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC spontaneously &quot;partially&#xD;
      mature&quot; within 12 hours following their isolation. Optimal maturation with secretion of&#xD;
      IFN-gamma as well as the orientation of stimulated T-lymphocytes towards a Th1 phenotype is&#xD;
      only achieved following Toll-like receptor stimulation.(Skold, van Beek et al. 2015)&#xD;
      Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC; Imlygic) is a first-in-class oncolytic virus based on a&#xD;
      modified herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 designed to selectively replicate in and lyse&#xD;
      tumor cells while promoting regional and systemic antitumor immunity. T-VEC is modified&#xD;
      through the deletion of two nonessential viral genes. Functional deletion of the herpes virus&#xD;
      neurovirulence factor gene (ICP34.5) attenuates viral pathogenicity and enhances&#xD;
      tumor-selective replication. T-VEC is further modified by deletion of the ICP47 gene to&#xD;
      reduce virally mediated suppression of antigen presentation and increase the expression of&#xD;
      the HSV US11 gene. Insertion and expression of the gene encoding human granulocyte macrophage&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) results in local GM-CSF production to recruit and activate&#xD;
      antigen presenting cells with subsequent induction of tumor-specific T cell responses. T-VEC&#xD;
      has been evaluated in early-phase studies, which demonstrated intratumoral replication and&#xD;
      expression of GM-CSF and an acceptable safety profile (low-grade fever, chills, myalgias, and&#xD;
      injection site reactions) after intralesional administration. In a single arm phase II study,&#xD;
      an overall response rate (ORR) of 26% was reported in patients with stage IIIc to IV&#xD;
      melanoma, with responses observed in both injected and non-injected lesions, including&#xD;
      visceral lesions. Biopsy of regressing lesions suggested an association between response and&#xD;
      presence of IFN- producing MART-1-specific CD8+ T cells and reduction in CD4+ FoxP3+&#xD;
      regulatory T cells, consistent with induction of host antitumor immunity. The efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity of T-VEC in advanced melanoma was evaluated in a randomized phase III trial&#xD;
      comparing intratumoral T-VEC injections with subcutaneous GM-CSF injections. With T-VEC, the&#xD;
      primary end point of durable response rate (DRR; continuous response lasting &gt; 6 months) was&#xD;
      significantly higher (16% vs 2%; odds ratio, 8.9; P,.001), ORR improved (26% vs 6%), and the&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) improved numerically but not statistically by 4.4 months (hazard ratio,&#xD;
      0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.00; P = .051). Tumor regression was seen in tumors both injected and&#xD;
      not injected with T-VEC. The incidence of grade 3/4 T-VEC-related adverse events (AEs) was&#xD;
      11%. (Andtbacka, Kaufman et al. 2015) In an open-label, multicenter, phase Ib trial, the&#xD;
      combination of T-VEC with ipilimumab had a tolerable safety profile, and the combination&#xD;
      appeared to have greater efficacy than either T-VEC or ipilimumab monotherapy.(Puzanov,&#xD;
      Milhem et al. 2016) The combination of T-VEC plus pembrolizumab (an anti-PD1 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody) was associated with clinical benefit in advanced melanoma, as assessed by ORR and&#xD;
      CR rate (Ribas, Dummer et al. 2017). A randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial of T-VEC plus&#xD;
      pembrolizumab vs T-VEC placebo plus pembrolizumab is ongoing. In this phase I clinical trial&#xD;
      we propose to investigate the safety of intratumoral injection of autologous CD1c (BDCA-1)+&#xD;
      myDC in non-visceral metastases of melanoma plus intratumoral injection of T-VEC (at its&#xD;
      approved dose and regimen for the treatment of melanoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC in the T-VEC inflamed tumor microenvironment of the&#xD;
      metastasis will capture tumor antigens in vivo and through cross-presentation of these&#xD;
      antigens coordinate an effective anti-tumor T-cell response.&#xD;
