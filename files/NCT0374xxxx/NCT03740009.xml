      Using neuroimaging, the investigator will study the effects of estrogen on mood and brain&#xD;
      function in perimenopausal women with depression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite decades of clinical research, depression continues to affect 20.9 million Americans&#xD;
      each year and remains the leading cause of disability worldwide. Women are twice as likely as&#xD;
      men to experience depression, and depression symptoms are particularly common during periods&#xD;
      of hormone change. Depression risk increases 14-fold in the two years surrounding menopause,&#xD;
      suggesting that hormone changes may cause depression during this time. Past research has&#xD;
      shown that estrogen, in particular, plays an important role in depression during the&#xD;
      transition to menopause (&quot;the perimenopause&quot;) for the following reasons: 1) depression begins&#xD;
      when estrogen levels plummet, 2) estrogen therapy reduces depression symptoms, and 3) when&#xD;
      perimenopausal women who were treated with estrogen are taken off of estrogen (without their&#xD;
      knowledge), their depression returns. Despite clear evidence that estrogen plays a role in&#xD;
      depression during the perimenopause (DPM), the investigators don't know how estrogen affects&#xD;
      the brain, which is important for developing effective medications to treat DPM and also for&#xD;
      determining which patients are most likely to benefit from medication that replaces the&#xD;
      estrogen lost during menopause (estrogen replacement therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator received a grant from the National Institutes of Health, which received&#xD;
      preliminary support from the Foundation of Hope, to characterize the effect of estrogen&#xD;
      replacement therapy on the brain in women with DPM and women without depression (&quot;controls&quot;).&#xD;
      The brain pathway affected most by depression is the neural reward circuit, which consists of&#xD;
      a number of different brain regions that act in concert to determine a person's response to&#xD;
      rewards. Activity in the neural reward circuit depends on estrogen levels and is reduced in&#xD;
      people with depression. The investigator's NIH-funded study will be the first to examine how&#xD;
      the neural reward circuit is affected by DPM and estrogen replacement therapy. While estrogen&#xD;
      replacement therapy acts as an antidepressant, many women elect not to take estrogen and many&#xD;
      physicians discourage its use because of the risk of long-term negative health effects,&#xD;
      including breast and uterine cancer. A new FDA-approved compound, Duavee, combines estrogen&#xD;
      with another medication, bazedoxifene, which protects against breast and uterine cancer while&#xD;
      reducing hot flashes. Duavee may therefore be more acceptable to women with DPM and their&#xD;
      doctors than estrogen replacement therapy. However, the effects of Duavee on depression and&#xD;
      the neural reward circuit have never been tested, and one can't infer that estrogen will have&#xD;
      the same antidepressant effects in the presence of bazedoxifene (which partially blocks the&#xD;
      effects of estrogen in certain tissues).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed project is to 1) test the antidepressant effects of Duavee, and&#xD;
      2) quantify the effects of Duavee on the neural reward circuit. The investigators expect that&#xD;
      Duavee will reduce symptoms of depression and increase activity in the neural reward circuit.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will recruit medically healthy, unmedicated women with DPM&#xD;
      and administer Duavee for 3 weeks (a duration that has been shown in previous studies of&#xD;
      estrogen replacement to be sufficient for treating depression). Eligibility will be assessed&#xD;
      by an initial telephone screen and confirmed by a gynecologic exam, laboratory testing, and&#xD;
      an interview about their current and past depression symptoms. Only women with depression&#xD;
      that began during the menopause transition (i.e., when they started skipping periods) will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Both before and after treatment, women will have a fMRI brain scan to determine the&#xD;
      effects of the medication on the neural reward circuit. During the 3-week treatment, women&#xD;
      will come into the clinic to have their blood drawn, refill their medication, and answer&#xD;
      questions about their mood and menopause symptoms.This study is important because untreated&#xD;
      DPM contributes to cardiac deaths. Many women are afraid to use estrogen replacement therapy&#xD;
      because of the long-term risk of cancer and yet refuse to take antidepressants for fear of&#xD;
      side effects and stigma. Because Duavee addresses the main potential problems of estrogen&#xD;
      replacement therapy, this research stands to revolutionize treatment for DPM. The use of&#xD;
      estrogen replacement therapy to treat DPM is a relatively new area of research and one of&#xD;
      great importance given the large and increasing number of women who enter the perimenopause&#xD;
      each year and are potentially at risk for depression. Women with DPM seek treatment from&#xD;
      gynecologists, psychiatrists, and general practitioners, yet there is neither consensus nor&#xD;
      practical guidelines for preventing and treating DPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The investigators currently are assessing the neural reward system in subjects&#xD;
      with perimenopausal major depressive disorder (PM-MDD) and those without depression&#xD;
      (&quot;controls&quot;) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and following&#xD;
      estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). The Foundation of Hope (FOH) award will allow us to add a&#xD;
      Tissue Selective Estrogen Complex (TSEC) treatment condition in a separate group of PM-MDD.&#xD;
      The investigators' central hypothesis is that the neural reward system is hypoactive in&#xD;
      PM-MDD, and the antidepressant effects of a three-week TSEC intervention will be associated&#xD;
      with increased activity in the neural reward system, assessed using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI). The investigators will test the hypothesis by executing the&#xD;
      following aims: Aim 1: Determine the extent to which TSEC reduces anhedonia and other&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in PM-MDD. Anhedonia and other depressive symptoms will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and following TSEC administration. The investigators also will compare the effects&#xD;
      of TSEC and ERT in PM-MDD. Hypothesis 1: Women PM-MDD will report a significant reduction in&#xD;
      depressive symptoms following TSEC administration, and the degree of symptom improvement will&#xD;
      be associated with the change in frontostriatal responsivity to reward. Aim 2: Quantify the&#xD;
      effect of TSEC on the neural reward system in PM-MDD. The investigators will use fMRI at&#xD;
      baseline and following TSEC treatment in PM-MDD to probe frontostriatal reward circuitry. The&#xD;
      investigator will also compare the effects of TSEC and ERT in PM-MDD. Hypothesis 2: PM-MDD&#xD;
      will show increased activation of the frontostriatal circuit in response to reward following&#xD;
      TSEC administration (compared with baseline).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigators will employ the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW)&#xD;
             criteria to confirm perimenopausal status. The stages are primarily based on the&#xD;
             characteristics of the menstrual cycle and secondarily on follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
             (FSH) levels. The anchor for the staging system is the last menstrual period (LMP).&#xD;
             The investigators will enroll women who have &gt; 2 skipped cycles with an interval of&#xD;
             amenorrhea &gt; 60 days and FSH values &gt; 14, consistent with the late menopause&#xD;
             transition (stage-1)*. Women who have taken oral contraceptives continuously for&#xD;
             relief of perimenopausal symptoms will be exempt from our LMP criteria, and their&#xD;
             perimenopausal status will be determined by FSH alone. Because extremes of body weight&#xD;
             (BMI &lt; 18 or &gt; 35 kg/m2) or a history of chronic menstrual cycle irregularity can&#xD;
             contribute to inaccurate reproductive staging, these will serve as additional&#xD;
             exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current diagnosis of MDD with an onset associated with menstrual cycle irregularity.&#xD;
        Present or past mania, psychosis, suicide attempts, and alcohol or drug dependence, and&#xD;
        current substance abuse, as determined by the Structure Clinical Interview for The&#xD;
        Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision&#xD;
        (DSM-IV-TR) for Axis I Disorders (SCID) are exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        * Per the STRAW criteria, FSH values are highly variable in the late menopausal transition&#xD;
        (stage -1), and clinicians should &quot;carefully evaluate the appropriate FSH value, depending&#xD;
        on the assay they use&quot; (Harlow et al, 2012). For nearly two years following the LMP, FSH&#xD;
        values can fluctuate between levels characteristic of the early reproductive years and&#xD;
        levels characteristic of menopause (Hale et al, 2014). McLendon Labs at the University of&#xD;
        North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) uses an FSH assay that defines levels consistently&#xD;
        above ? 21.5 IU/mL as post-menopausal (McLendon Labs, 2016). As FSH values do not stabilize&#xD;
        at consistently high levels until post-menopause, the investigators are setting our minimum&#xD;
        required FSH value at &gt; 14 IU/mL to carefully select for women in the perimenopause&#xD;
        transition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will not be permitted to enter this protocol if they have any of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. current medication use (i.e., psychotropics, anti-hypertensives, statins,&#xD;
                  hormonal preparations, or frequent use of anti-inflammatory agents (&gt; 10&#xD;
                  times/month)). Women will be allowed to enroll who take medications without known&#xD;
                  mood effects (e.g. stable thyroid hormone replacement and occasional (&lt; 5&#xD;
                  times/month) use of Ambien);&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  all reported prescription medications will be reviewed and cleared by a&#xD;
                       study physician prior to a participant's enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. pregnant, breastfeeding or trying to conceive;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. LMP more than 12 months prior to enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;

                       perimenopausal symptoms will be exempt from the final menstrual period (FMP)&#xD;
                       criteria, and instead, the presence of menstrual irregularity prior to the&#xD;
                       use of oral contraceptives and elevated FSH will be used to determine their&#xD;
                       perimenopausal status;&#xD;

&#xD;
              10. 2+ first degree relatives with breast cancer (regardless of onset);&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. 3+ relatives with postmenopausal breast cancer;&#xD;

                       follow-up testing) and/or benign will be reviewed by a study physician prior&#xD;
                       to enrollment. All chronic conditions will be exclusionary.&#xD;
