  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Part 1, subjects will be administered thiamine, thiamine with metformin, and thiamine with&#xD;
      trimethoprim. Part 2 will expand on Part 1 and subjects will be administered thiamine and&#xD;
      thiamine with trimethoprim. The goal is to determine whether taking a drug and a vitamin&#xD;
      together affects the body's ability to absorb, distribute, and eliminate thiamine (Vitamin&#xD;
      B1).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thiamine is an essential vitamin meaning humans must consume thiamine from their diet in&#xD;
      order to stay healthy. Low thiamine levels can lead to adverse events. Thiamine is absorbed&#xD;
      in the intestine by a transporter protein. This is made by the SLC19A3 gene. The SLC19A3 gene&#xD;
      provides instructions for making the thiamine transporter protein, which moves thiamine into&#xD;
      cells. Certain drugs, like metformin and trimethoprim, have been shown to interrupt function&#xD;
      of the SLC19A3 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is a first-line therapy for patients with Type 2 diabetes and is associated with&#xD;
      improvements in diabetic complications. Trimethoprim is an anti-bacterial drug that is often&#xD;
      prescribed to treat infections such as urinary tract infections. At different phases of this&#xD;
      study, participants will be administered thiamine, thiamine with metformin, and/or thiamine&#xD;
      with trimethoprim to determine whether taking a drug and a vitamin together affects the&#xD;
      body's ability to absorb, distribute, and eliminate thiamine. The levels of thiamine in the&#xD;
      participants' blood and urine will be measured before and after taking thiamine or thiamine&#xD;
      in combination with metformin and/or trimethoprim.&#xD;
