      This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Reproductive Endocrinology and Invitro&#xD;
      Fertilization (REI) unit of our hospital, following the approval of the hospital's ethics&#xD;
      committee. Patients who underwent gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment&#xD;
      were enrolled in the study. During oocyte retrieval, follicular fluids of mature follicles&#xD;
      (≥18 mm) were collected and pooled for each patient. The thiobarbituric acid method was used&#xD;
      for the sialic acid levels and the absorbance values were measured by a spectrophotometer at&#xD;
      549 nm.&#xD;

      This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Reproductive Endocrinology and Invitro&#xD;
      Fertilization (REI) unit our hospital, following the approval of the hospital's ethics&#xD;
      committee. The inclusion criteria were as follows; under 40 years of age, normal thyroid and&#xD;
      prolactin hormone levels, a basal follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &lt;10 mIU/mL, BMI of&#xD;
      19-30 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria: a history of ovarian surgery, endometriosis, uterine&#xD;
      anomaly, any endocrine disease including congenital adrenal hyperplasia, smokers, use of any&#xD;
      medications and hormones in the last 3 months. Before the IVF treatment serum follicle&#xD;
      stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating&#xD;
      hormone (TSH), and estradiol (E2) levels were measured on the third day of the cycle. Age,&#xD;
      body mass index, duration of stimulation, duration of infertility, the total dose of&#xD;
      gonadotropins, E2 on the day of hCG administration, number of oocytes retrieved,&#xD;
      fertilization rate, and pregnancy rate were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment. Oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval was done 36 hours after the hCG injection and ICSI was used for all patients.&#xD;
      Embryo transfer was performed 48-72 hours after the oocyte retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During oocyte retrieval, follicular fluids of mature follicles (≥18 mm) were collected from&#xD;
      the first follicle entered and were aspirated for each patient. Follicle aspirates, which&#xD;
      were not clear and contaminated with blood, were excluded. Total and free sialic acid levels&#xD;
      were measured in the follicular fluid.&#xD;
