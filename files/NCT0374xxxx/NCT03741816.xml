  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of deep carious lesions in permanent mature molars with reversible pulpitis&#xD;
      represents a challenge for clinicians. Vital pulp therapy includes indirect and direct pulp&#xD;
      capping, partial pulpotomy and full pulpotomy. Indirect pulp capping is a procedure in which&#xD;
      a material is placed on a thin layer of remaining soft dentin that, if removed, might expose&#xD;
      the pulp. The objective is dentin bridge formation and pulp vitality preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the success rate of indirect pulp&#xD;
      capping with Biodentine and TheraCal LC in mature permanent molars with deep carious lesions&#xD;
      at one-year follow-up examination. The null hypothesis tested will be that there is no&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in success rate between both materials in indirect pulp&#xD;
      capping of permanent mature molars with deep carious lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options for permanent mature molars with deep carious lesions and a preoperative&#xD;
      diagnosis of reversible pulpitis are varied among clinicians. In the last few years, a more&#xD;
      biological approach is arising interest in the field of Endodontics through the development&#xD;
      of calcium-silicate based cements that are used in vital pulp therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A great variety of materials have been employed for indirect pulp capping. Although calcium&#xD;
      hydroxide has been the &quot;gold standard&quot; for decades for this procedure, nowadays&#xD;
      calcium-silicate based cements such as Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) are preferred. The&#xD;
      second generation of these cements, among which Biodentine (Septodont, Saint Maur-des-Fossés,&#xD;
      France) and TheraCal LC (Bisco, Schaumburg, IL, USA) stand out, try to overcome the first&#xD;
      generation limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, there is a paradigm shift in caries removal techniques. Nowadays, the&#xD;
      non-selective technique is not longer recommended and a selective removal technique until&#xD;
      soft dentin is preferred in deep cavitated lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out at the dental clinic of the Master of Restorative Dentistry and&#xD;
      Endodontics (Medical and Dental School) of University of Valencia (Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol that will be followed is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample size estimation: 212 participants (106 per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informed written consent will be obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A full dental and medical history will be obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical (thermal and electric pulp tests, and palpation and percussion) and a&#xD;
           radiographic examination (periapical radiograph and a small-volume cone beam computed&#xD;
           tomography (CBCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Anesthesia administration and rubber dam placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Selective caries removal technique with high-speed diamond burs with air/water spray for&#xD;
           enamel and Cariosolv gel and hand instruments until soft dentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Allocation to one of the two groups: Biodentine (control) or TheraCal LC (experimental)&#xD;
           for indirect pulp capping procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Final direct composite restoration using the selective etching technique and an&#xD;
           universal adhesive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Baseline periapical radiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Follow-up: clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations will be conducted at one&#xD;
           month, six months and twelve months (±2 weeks). In the one-year follow-up examination, a&#xD;
           small-volume CBCT will be taken.&#xD;
