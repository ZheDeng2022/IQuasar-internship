  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose clinical trial to assess the Pharmacokinetics of two (2) dosages; 10 mg&#xD;
      and 20mg of THC: THCa of Prana P1 bionutrients in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single oral dose, (10 mg Prana P1 or 20 mg Prana P1) in each period with a washout of 30 days&#xD;
      between doses. Patents will be randomly assigned dose for the first round of the study after&#xD;
      a thirty-day washout, patient will return to the study site and receive cross over dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolites to be Measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. THC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 11-OH-THC [primary secondary metabolite of THC, psychoactive]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. THC-COOH [inactive metabolite]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters for THC, 11-OH-THC, and THC-COOH will be assessed: AUC0-t, AUC0-inf,&#xD;
      Cmax, AUCt/inf, Tmax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored and assessed through adverse events reports, 12-lead ECG, vital&#xD;
      signs and laboratory parameters. Each participant will undergo a psychometric evaluation&#xD;
      using the CHAT assessment tool.&#xD;
