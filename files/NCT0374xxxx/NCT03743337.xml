      Mathematica Policy Research, funded by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) in&#xD;
      the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will collect descriptive information&#xD;
      for the Study of Coaching Practices in Early Care and Education Settings (SCOPE) project. The&#xD;
      goal of this information collection is to learn how the prevalence, implementation,&#xD;
      combination, and tailoring of core features of professional development coaching for early&#xD;
      care and education (ECE) providers vary across ECE classrooms and family child care (FCC)&#xD;
      homes serving children supported by Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) subsidies or in&#xD;
      settings that receive Head Start grants. The investigators will conduct three data collection&#xD;
      activities. First, the investigators will collect information on coaching taking place in&#xD;
      different states in winter 2018 from state-level entities. Second, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct one round of survey data collection with ECE center directors, coaches, teachers, and&#xD;
      FCC providers in winter 2019 through spring 2019. Third, the investigators will conduct case&#xD;
      studies to better understand factors that influence the coaching approaches identified&#xD;
      through the survey data collection. The case studies will include semi-structured interviews,&#xD;
      a coaching session observation, and collection of coaching logs. The case studies will occur&#xD;
      in spring 2020.&#xD;

      This study aims to advance understanding of implementation of core features of coaching in&#xD;
      ECE classrooms, and how features may vary by key contextual factors and implementation&#xD;
      drivers. This study will focus on coaching used for delivering professional development&#xD;
      services to ECE teachers and FCC providers to improve knowledge and practice in center-based&#xD;
      classrooms and FCC homes serving preschool-age children. At the classroom/teacher level, the&#xD;
      approach to coaching can vary by dosage, content, activities (e.g., assessment, observation,&#xD;
      goal-setting, modeling, reflection), materials (e.g., video, written plans, resource&#xD;
      documents) and other features. However, there is no consensus as to which of these features&#xD;
      are core to the practice of coaching. Additionally, little is known about how these features&#xD;
      of coaching are implemented, combined, and tailored to the needs of teachers or how&#xD;
      contextual factors or implementation drivers may mediate or moderate the effects of coaching.&#xD;
      Ultimately, SCOPE findings will improve coaching practice in the ECE field and determine&#xD;
      which coaching features are ripe for more rigorous evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Study: The investigators will carry out a descriptive study in a sample of seven&#xD;
      states. Sampled states will have one or more classroom-based coaching models offered to&#xD;
      centers and FCC homes that are serving preschool-age children and that receive Head Start&#xD;
      grants or serve children who receive CCDF subsidies. All of the data that will be collected&#xD;
      are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. State coaching informant interviews: To obtain information about coaching approaches and&#xD;
           about the available administrative data on coaching, including the range of coaching&#xD;
           providers and approaches occurring in states and what ECE settings may be receiving&#xD;
           classroom coaching. As part of this process, we will also seek existing administrative&#xD;
           data on coaching processes and participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ECE setting eligibility screening: To obtain information on the characteristics of the&#xD;
           ECE setting, the coaching taking place in that setting, and characteristics of&#xD;
           participants in coaching; and to determine if a setting is eligible for survey data&#xD;
           collection and if personnel are willing to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surveys for the descriptive study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A center director survey - To collect information on the center context, supports&#xD;
                for and challenges to coaching and professional development, and structural and&#xD;
                process features of coaching&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A coach survey - To collect information on coach characteristics, supports for and&#xD;
                challenges to coaching, and process and structural features of coaching&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A teacher/FCC provider survey- To collect information on teacher and FCC provider&#xD;
                characteristics, supports for coaching, structural and process features of&#xD;
                coaching, coaching outputs (such as attitudes and beliefs), and the FCC context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Studies: The investigators will also conduct case studies in twelve ECE settings&#xD;
      (centers and FCC homes) selected from the seven states; some of the settings may have&#xD;
      participated in the descriptive study and others may not have. Site visit data collection for&#xD;
      the case studies will consist of the following activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Semi-structured interviews with center directors, teachers/FCC providers, coaches, and&#xD;
           coach supervisors. To collect information on how decisions are made about coaching and&#xD;
           what features are included; supports for coaching; organizational context and climate&#xD;
           for coaching (e.g., organizational culture, philosophies, staffing and turnover,&#xD;
           languages and cultures of families served); individual experiences as part of the&#xD;
           coaching process; barriers/supports for coaching&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Teacher/FCC provider survey: The teachers and FCC providers in the case studies will be&#xD;
           asked to complete the descriptive study teacher/FCC provider survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collection of coaching logs (whenever available): To provide information on the&#xD;
           frequency of interactions between teachers/FCC providers and coaches, the focus of these&#xD;
           interactions, and the coaching strategies employed. The coaching logs are preexisting&#xD;
           materials used by some coaches when they provide coaching to teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Coaching session observations: To provide information on the process features of&#xD;
           coaching (coaching activities and relationship-building activities); structural features&#xD;
           (target of coaching and content); and outputs (teacher/FCC provider engagement, actual&#xD;
           dosage, and perceptions of the coach-teacher/FCC provider relationship)&#xD;
