  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pemetrexed and avelumab work in treating patients with&#xD;
      MTAP-deficient urothelial cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Pemetrexed may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system&#xD;
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Giving pemetrexed and avelumab may work better in treating patients with MTAP-deficient&#xD;
      urothelial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the response rate (RR) in patients with (methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)&#xD;
      MTAP-deficient metastatic urothelial cancer treated sequentially with pemetrexed and&#xD;
      avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with&#xD;
      MTAP-deficient metastatic urothelial cancer treated sequentially with pemetrexed and&#xD;
      avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the effect of pemetrexed +/- avelumab on the immune system and tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment including peripheral T-cells, tumor-infiltrating T-cells, macrophages, and&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pemetrexed intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1. Starting cycle 2,&#xD;
      patients also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 120 days, and then&#xD;
      every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologic confirmation of MTAP-deficient metastatic urothelial&#xD;
             carcinoma. MTAP-deficiency must be verified by institutional Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
             Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified immunohistochemistry (IHC). Histological variants&#xD;
             such as glandular, squamous, sarcomatoid, micropapillary, plasmacytoid, and small cell&#xD;
             changes will be allowed for this trial if these tumors are MTAP-deficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can be considered for second line of therapy (after chemotherapy or immune&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitor with PD-[L]1 agent) or for third line of therapy (can have&#xD;
             previously received chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor with PD-[L]1&#xD;
             blockade). Any prior intravesical therapy is allowed and does not count as a prior&#xD;
             line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received methotrexate-containing chemotherapy (e.g.&#xD;
             methotrexate/vinblastine/adriamycin/cisplatin [MVAC]) as neoadjuvant therapy or&#xD;
             first-line systemic therapy at least 12 months prior will be allowed for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;

             disease should have lesions of &gt;= 1.5 cm in shortest dimension. Patients with disease&#xD;
             confined to bone may be eligible if a measurable lytic defect is present. The study&#xD;
             principal investigator (PI) is the final arbiter in questions related to&#xD;
             measurability. Patients with a three-dimensional mass or pelvic sidewall fixation on&#xD;
             bladder examination under anesthesia are considered to have measurable disease.&#xD;

             a 24 hour urine, calculated using Cockcroft-Gault, or estimated using the MDRD method&#xD;
             from the National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) (the method reported by MD&#xD;
             Anderson Cancer Center [MDACC] laboratories).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening for women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;

             partner and non-sterilized males must use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
             for 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product, and must agree to&#xD;
             continue using such precautions for 180 days after the final dose of investigational&#xD;
             product; cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a&#xD;
             responsible physician. They must also refrain from egg cell donation for 180 days&#xD;
             after the final dose of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must use a highly effective method of contraception from days 1 through 180&#xD;
             post last dose. In addition, they must refrain from sperm donation for 180 days after&#xD;
             the final dose of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ability to interrupt nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) 2 days before&#xD;

             Hashimoto's thyroiditis only requiring hormone replacement, type I diabetes, or&#xD;
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are allowed to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancies or CNS metastases, including&#xD;
             leptomeningeal metastases, are not allowed. Subjects with previously treated brain&#xD;

             weeks following prior treatment and no ongoing steroid requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other malignancy from which the patient has been disease-free for less than 2&#xD;

             the basis of symptoms or clinical examination) before or during initiation of&#xD;
             pemetrexed therapy, consideration should be given to draining the effusion prior to&#xD;
             dosing. However, if, in the investigator's opinion, the effusion represents&#xD;
             progression of disease, the patient should be discontinued from study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel&#xD;

             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v.] 5.0 grade &gt; 1); however,&#xD;
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy grade =&lt; 2, or other grade =&lt; 2 not constituting a safety&#xD;
             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed&#xD;
