    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases&#xD;
      in Brazil and its treatment is still limited. Thus, this project aims to conduct a&#xD;
      double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of silymarin on&#xD;
      laboratory markers and clinical evolution of adult patients with NAFLD treated at Edgard&#xD;
      Santos Hospital, as well as identify the dietary pattern of these individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases&#xD;
      in Brazil. It has a significantly increasing incidence today and is considered an important&#xD;
      global health problem. It affects approximately 20 to 30% of the adult population and&#xD;
      increases according to the severity of the risk factors. The diagnosis of this disease&#xD;
      usually occurs in 10 to 20% of the non-obese individuals, 50% in the overweight and 80 to 90%&#xD;
      in the obese, being twice as present in individuals with Metabolic Syndrome. Pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment options for NAFLD are still limited and Silybum marianum, one of the most&#xD;
      sought-after herbal remedies in patients with liver disease, is commonly used by patients&#xD;
      because of the claim of the hepatoprotective effect of silymarin. Studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      the therapeutic potential of silymarin in patients with NAFLD, but clinical trials with more&#xD;
      judicious methodological designs is still needed to prove these effects. Thus, this project&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the efficacy of silymarin in adult patients with NAFLD seen at the Clinic of&#xD;
      Nutrition and Hepatology of Edgard Santos Hospital. A randomized, double-blind, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial lasting 12 weeks will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will also receive similarly 2 capsules per day, but without the bioactive principle tested (silymarin). Therefore, the capsules in the control group will contain only 700 mg of maltodextrin, a neutral food component derived from starch, in addition to the excipient and the same amount of vitamin E and phosphatidylcholine to balance the two groups.</description>

The intervention will last 12 weeks and the invited participants will be patients attended at the outpatient clinic of the Edgard Santos Hospital, which will be randomized into two groups: control and intervention. Data on laboratory and clinical markers, imaging, nutritional and dietary assessment will be collected at the beginning and end of the trial for comparison purposes.</description>
