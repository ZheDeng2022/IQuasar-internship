  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Gastrin treatment with&#xD;
      islet transplantation to help patients with difficult to control type 1 diabetes make insulin&#xD;
      again and improve blood sugar control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves two investigational (experimental) products not yet approved by the U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for any disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Human allogenic islet cells (islet cells from a deceased, unrelated human donor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gastrin-17 (Gastrin) - a hormone secreted by the gut&#xD;
&#xD;
      Islet cell transplantation involves transplanting the cells that make insulin from a pancreas&#xD;
      of deceased organ donor to a patient with diabetes. Because there is a limited supply of&#xD;
      donor islet cells available, this study is testing whether Gastrin injections can help make a&#xD;
      fewer number of transplanted islets work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrin is a natural gut hormone that is present in the pancreas during its development in&#xD;
      the embryo but not after birth, and is believed to participate in the formation of the normal&#xD;
      pancreas. Several studies have tried to use gastrin to help grow insulin making islet cells&#xD;
      in laboratory experiments or after transplanting islets in laboratory animals. In early&#xD;
      clinical trials, diabetic patients treated with gastrin and other growth factors required&#xD;
      less insulin after 4 weeks of gastrin treatment and the effect lasted more than 12 weeks&#xD;
      after stopping treatment, suggesting that gastrin may have increased the number of cells that&#xD;
      make insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate whether taking Gastrin injections following a single islet&#xD;
      transplantation is safe, improves how well the islet transplant works and/or helps increase&#xD;
      the number of insulin-making cells in the islets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified participants will receive treatment with a single islet transplant, followed by two&#xD;
      rounds of gastrin treatment (twice daily injections for 30 days) just after transplant and&#xD;
      again 6 months later. Study participants will also take anti-rejection medications (to&#xD;
      prevent the body from rejecting the islet cells) and other medications to guard against&#xD;
      infection and support their health and/or the health of the transplanted islets. Participants&#xD;
      will need to return to City of Hope in Duarte, CA for frequent follow-up visits for one year&#xD;
      after transplant.&#xD;
