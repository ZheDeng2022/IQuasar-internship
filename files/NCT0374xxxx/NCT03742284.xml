      This pilot study evaluates safety and performance of the Medical device, SoftOx Wound&#xD;
      Irrigation Solution (SWIS), in a model for acute wounds.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with an open-label, exploratory study design with the aim to document&#xD;
      preliminary safety and performance of the SoftOx Wound Irrigation Solution while used as&#xD;
      intended by the manufacturer, i.e. as an irrigation solution for mechanical rinsing of&#xD;
      breached or compromised skin as a result from acute wounds. This first-in-man study will give&#xD;
      valuable information on the feasibility of the treatment with the SoftOx Wound Irrigation&#xD;
      Solution to prepare for continuous studies in clinically significant settings prior CE&#xD;
      marking. The investigation population will consist of 12 subjects undergoing split skin graft&#xD;
      transplantation for treating chronic leg ulcers and that are fulfilling the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria for the clinical investigation. The SoftOx Wound Irrigation Solution will be applied&#xD;
      on the donor site of the split skin graft which is a representative model of acute wounds in&#xD;
      a controlled setting. All subjects will be followed up for 21 days. The duration of the&#xD;
      investigation is estimated to 4 months.&#xD;

    <description>The SoftOx Wound Irrigation Solution is a Medical device that contains a combination of hypochlorous acid and acetic acid in purified water. SWIS is primary intended for mechanical irrigation of acute wounds whereas hypochlorous acid acts as a ancillary medicinal (drug) substance with potential antimicrobial effects.&#xD;
Acute wounds will be rinsed according to protocol and safety (AEs/ADEs/SAEs/SADEs) is the primary objective.</description>
