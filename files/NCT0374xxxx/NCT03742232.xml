    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female outpatients and inpatients aged: ≥18 to ≤85 years undergoing a&#xD;
             screening, surveillance or diagnostic colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening&#xD;
             and at Visit 2 and must be practising one of the following methods of birth control&#xD;
             and agree to continue with the regimen throughout the study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives (for a minimum of three months&#xD;
                  before study entry) in combination with a condom;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine device in combination with a condom; Double barrier method (condom*,&#xD;
                  and occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] with spermicidal&#xD;
                  foam/gel/film/ cream/suppository); *A female condom and a male condom should not&#xD;
                  be used together as friction between the two can result in either product&#xD;
                  failing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If any female patient has a positive pregnancy test at Visit 2, they will be excluded&#xD;
             from further participation in the study for the efficacy evaluation, i.e. they will&#xD;
             not undergo the colonoscopy procedure. The Investigator will be required to arrange a&#xD;
             colonoscopy procedure outside of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: The above birth control methods do not apply to females who are postmenopausal&#xD;
             or surgically sterile i.e. 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea or 6 weeks'&#xD;
             post-surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             whose sole sexual partner has had a vasectomy and has received medical assessment of&#xD;
             the surgical success.&#xD;

             before resolution), known or suspected ileus, gastrointestinal obstruction, gastric&#xD;
             retention, bowel perforation, toxic colitis or megacolon.&#xD;

             colostomy, Hartmann's procedure and defunctioning ileostomy or other similar surgeries&#xD;
             involving structure and function of the small or large colon.&#xD;
&#xD;

             aspiration.&#xD;

             within three months of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not be included in the study&#xD;
