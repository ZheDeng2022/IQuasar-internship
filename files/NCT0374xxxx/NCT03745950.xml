    <textblock>
      Approximately 147 patients will be randomized using an Interactive Voice Response System /&#xD;
      Interactive web system (IVR/IWR system) in a 2:1 ratio to the treatments as specified below :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Olaparib tablets per os 300 mg twice daily,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo tablets per os 300 mg twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomization to the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient should be without evidence of disease (NED), or in clinical complete response or&#xD;
           in partial response or stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient must have completed a minimum of 4 cycles of first line platinum based&#xD;
           chemotherapy (recommended chemotherapy is carboplatine AUC 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be stratified according to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  P53 and MMR Immunohistochemistry, (Y/N)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response to previous chemotherapy line (Objective response versus Stable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive Olaparib/Placebo up to disease progression.&#xD;

Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum possible value of the raw score. All items are scored from1 to 4, giving a range=3.

Then a linear transformation is used to standardise the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. Score= (raw score-1)/rangex100</description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The maximum score of 1 indicates the best health state, by contrast with the scores of individual questions, where higher scores indicate more severe or frequent problems.</description>
