  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, phase IB treatment study to determine the safety of&#xD;
      administering anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies with AV-MEL-1 and to get some suggestion of&#xD;
      efficacy, in patients with measurable metastatic melanoma. These will be patients who have&#xD;
      either never received treatment for metastatic melanoma or were previously treated with&#xD;
      enzymatic inhibitors of the BRAF/MEK pathway because of BRAF600E/K mutations, and are about&#xD;
      to initiate anti-PD1 monotherapy. The intent is to treat 14 to 20 patients with the&#xD;
      combination of anti-PD-1 and AV-MEL-1.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sequence is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will provide consent for collection of blood and tumor, performance of&#xD;
           leukapheresis, and intended plan to treat with a standard anti-PD-1 regimen, and to&#xD;
           treat with their patient-specific AV-MEL-1 once it has been manufactured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior to starting anti-PD-1 therapy, surgically resected tumor tissue will be sent to&#xD;
           AIVITA Biomedical where it will be processed to establish a short-term cell line of&#xD;
           autologous tumor cells. Approximately 1 cm3 of surgically excised tumor is preferred.&#xD;
           Whenever possible the tissue should be obtained from a lesion no greater than 2 cm in&#xD;
           longest diameter. Part of the sample should be assessed by pathologists to confirm&#xD;
           melanoma and to test for PDL-1 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prior to starting anti-PD-1 therapy, patients will undergo leukapheresis to obtain&#xD;
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells that will be converted into dendritic cells (DC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients will initiate anti-PD-1 therapy monotherapy (e.g. pembrolizumab or nivolumab)&#xD;
           using standard doses and schedules of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. When the vaccine is ready, which will take approximately 8 weeks from the date of tumor&#xD;
           resection, and the patient has had the opportunity to have received about two months of&#xD;
           anti-PD-1 monotherapy, it is expected per standard of care that the patient will undergo&#xD;
           radiographic assessment to classify disease status and response (if there was measurable&#xD;
           disease at baseline) to the anti-PD-1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Starting week 10, AV-MEL-1 will be given concurrently with continuation of the anti-PD-1&#xD;
           therapy. AV-MEL-1 injections will be given weekly for 3 weeks, (weeks 10-12, then&#xD;
           monthly at weeks 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32). Blood will be collected from patients prior to&#xD;
           each injection for immune monitoring tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If anti-PD-1 therapy is discontinued during vaccine treatment, the remaining vaccine&#xD;
           doses may still be administered at the discretion of the patient's managing physician.&#xD;
