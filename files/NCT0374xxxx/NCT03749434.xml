  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substantial center variability exists in healthcare-associated infection (HAI) rates&#xD;
      following durable ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation for patients with advanced&#xD;
      heart failure. Preliminary evidence suggests that this variability may be related to process&#xD;
      (e.g., pre-operative intranasal mupirocin), provider (e.g., surgeon technique, physician&#xD;
      teamwork), device, (e.g., centrifugal vs. axial flow), and center specific (e.g., infection&#xD;
      prevention strategies and resources) factors. The investigators will undertake a mixed&#xD;
      methods study to: (1) identify determinants of center-level variability in HAI rates, (2)&#xD;
      develop a comprehensive understanding of barriers and facilitators for achieving low center&#xD;
      HAI rates, and (3) develop, iteratively enhance, and disseminate a best practices toolkit for&#xD;
      preventing HAIs that accommodates various center contexts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Durable ventricular assist devices (VADs) provide long-term mechanical circulatory support as&#xD;
      a bridge to cardiac transplantation or as permanent therapy, and have the potential to&#xD;
      benefit more than 250K patients with advanced heart failure (HF) refractory to&#xD;
      guideline-directed medical therapy. Upwards of six out of every 10 VAD patients develop a&#xD;
      healthcare-associated infection (HAI) following implant. Broader adoption of durable VAD&#xD;
      therapy is hindered by HAIs given their association with mortality (5.6-fold increased risk&#xD;
      of 1-year mortality) and healthcare expenditures ($264K - $869K per patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies evaluating HAIs in the setting of VAD therapy have been limited to post-hoc&#xD;
      analyses of small trials, or single center experiences. While some argue that centers with&#xD;
      lower HAI rates select healthier patients, others counter that improved practices (e.g.,&#xD;
      standardizing empirical and targeted antimicrobial therapy) or enhanced provider teamwork are&#xD;
      more predictive of improved outcomes. While evidence-based HAI prevention guidelines and&#xD;
      implementation tools (e.g., checklists) exist, these approaches are not comprehensive (e.g.,&#xD;
      neglecting device-specific determinants) or customizable to local context, thus limiting&#xD;
      usability, adoption, and likelihood of significant effectiveness for preventing HAIs.&#xD;
      Understanding the barriers and facilitators within individual centers for maximizing adoption&#xD;
      of prevention measures would serve as the foundation for targeted strategies. Without this&#xD;
      knowledge, evidence-based, action-oriented recommendations will have limited local adoption&#xD;
      and ultimately effectiveness in preventing HAIs after VAD implantation. The investigators'&#xD;
      long-term goal is to develop and subsequently promote wide-scale adoption of evidence-based&#xD;
      HAI prevention practices following durable VAD implantation. The objective of this proposal&#xD;
      is to identify prevention recommendations for the most significant HAIs after VAD&#xD;
      implantation. To achieve this objective, the investigators will undertake a mixed methods&#xD;
      study of adult patients receiving VADs in the U.S. from 2009 - 2017 and develop a modular&#xD;
      toolkit of evidence-based recommendations. To determine best practices for preventing HAIs,&#xD;
      the investigators will examine center-level differences in HAI rates to identify strategies&#xD;
      used by centers with low rates, and barriers to lowering HAI rates among centers with high&#xD;
      rates. The investigators will use a novel dataset including administrative claims and&#xD;
      detailed clinical data, along with in-depth center surveys, to address the following aims:&#xD;
      (i) identify determinants of center-level variability in HAI rates, (ii) develop a&#xD;
      comprehensive understanding of barriers and facilitators for achieving low center HAI rates,&#xD;
      and (iii) develop, iteratively enhance, and disseminate a best practices toolkit for&#xD;
      preventing HAIs that accommodates various center contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will have a positive impact on clinical practice by identifying targets for an&#xD;
      interventional study. Moreover, the mixed methods approach will serve as a model for&#xD;
      evaluating and improving clinical care more broadly - especially in the setting of complex&#xD;
      surgical procedures.&#xD;
