  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic valve stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the developed world,&#xD;
      affecting 3,9% of population over 70 years of age. If untreated it carries a poor prognosis,&#xD;
      leading to heart failure and death in 2 years after first symptom presentation. Treatment of&#xD;
      choice for severe aortic stenosis is surgical aortic valve replacement. A new treatment&#xD;
      option for severe aortic stenosis emerged in the last decade - Transcatheter Aortic Valve&#xD;
      Replacement (TAVR). This minimally invasive method was formerly reserved for high risk&#xD;
      patients deemed unfit for surgical aortic valve replacement. Increasing use throughout the&#xD;
      developed world and recent studies have established TAVR as a safe and viable treatment&#xD;
      option also for intermediate-risk patients. TAVR not only enables a less aggressive surgical&#xD;
      approach, but also a less invasive type of anaesthesia. Anaesthesiologists are trying to&#xD;
      modify the type of anaesthesia in the way of minimally invasive approach, aiming to improve&#xD;
      the overall outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAVR can be performed under general anaesthesia or conscious sedation (CS). From the start,&#xD;
      TAVR was performed solely under general anaesthesia. Over time the procedure became routine&#xD;
      and the anaesthesiologists started to commonly decide for CS. Many US and European&#xD;
      retrospective studies have established CS to be a safe and compelling method of anaesthetic&#xD;
      care for TAVR procedures with a favorable perioperative course, less complications, shorter&#xD;
      intensive care unit and in-hospital stay and lower early mortality, when performed by an&#xD;
      experienced anaesthesia team. There are many anaesthesia agents currently accepted for CS in&#xD;
      everyday anaesthesia practice. Presently, reliable data from studies comparing different&#xD;
      agents for CS for TAVR procedures is scarce. Most of it comes from retrospective&#xD;
      nonrandomized trials. Propofol is a popular anaesthetic agent for CS. According to current&#xD;
      studies, it is a safe anaesthetic agent with favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      profiles with quite low incidence of side effects. In recent years, dexmedetomidine has been&#xD;
      commonly used for CS having analgesic properties inclusive of its anaesthetic properties. In&#xD;
      addition, dexmedetomidine is associated with a lesser degree of respiratory depression as to&#xD;
      other anaesthetic agents. Patient comfort is also believed to be improved with&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine. Studies comparing outcomes of CS with propofol versus dexmedetomidine for&#xD;
      different non-cardiac and interventional procedures showed benefits of dexmedetomidine, owing&#xD;
      to its analgesic properties and preferable respiratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the outcome of patients undergoing TAVR under CS with&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine against those undergoing TAVR under CS with propofol. With the results the&#xD;
      investigators aim to aid in defining the optimal anaesthetic agent for CS for TAVR and&#xD;
      possibly other interventional cardiology procedures.&#xD;
