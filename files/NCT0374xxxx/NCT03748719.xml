  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) followed by prostatectomy&#xD;
      (removal of the prostate). SBRT is a relatively new radiation technique in which a few doses&#xD;
      of radiation are delivered to small, well-defined tumors. It has been used effectively in&#xD;
      other cancers like lung and liver. The radiation will be given for only 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of different doses of&#xD;
      SBRT given before prostatectomy.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed using 2 questionnaires: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM). The IPSS is an eight question questionnaire of symptoms ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;always&quot;. The SHIM is a five question questionnaire ranging from 1 &quot;almost never or never&quot; to 5 &quot;almost always or always&quot; to determine erectile dysfunction.</description>
