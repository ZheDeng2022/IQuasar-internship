  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate, with non-invasive methods, the relationships existing&#xD;
      between PEEP and renal perfusion in patients undergoing surgery and requiring ventilatory&#xD;
      support and monitoring in intensive care. Renal perfusion will be assessed at baseline (PEEP&#xD;
      0), subsequently ,at the application of progressive increases of PEEP. At the end of the&#xD;
      measurements, the implications of the use of PEEP on the renal vascular system will be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

      The present physiological, monocentric, observational clinical study evaluates the effect of&#xD;
      progressive PEEP increases on renal perfusion in mechanically ventilated patients who&#xD;
      underwent surgery with the need of ventilatory support and monitoring in intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precisely, will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The morphometric parameters (coronal diameter and cortico-medullary thickness) and the&#xD;
           renal resistive indices (IR). The inter-lobar arteries will be sampled and the IRs will&#xD;
           be measured as the upper and lower level and the mesorenes. Measurements will be&#xD;
           performed both in the kidney and in baseline conditions and incremental values of PEEP&#xD;
           (0 - 6 - 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gas exchanges, FC, systolic BP, diastolic and mean, Pmax, P1 and P2 of the airways,&#xD;
           total and ohmic resistances and static respiratory compliance indexed for weight body&#xD;
           (RRSmaxI, RRSminI, CrsI will be recorded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-class correlation coefficient will be measured to estimate the intra-observer&#xD;
      reproducibility of the conducted measurement.&#xD;

    <description>Enrolled patients will receive a sequential, step-wise increase in PEEP from 0 cmH2O to 12 cmH2O. The inter-lobar arterioles will be sampled at each PEEP increment and the IR will be measured as the average of three values recorded at the upper and lower pole and at the mesorenes in each kidney.&#xD;
Gas exchanges, HR, systolic, diastolic and mean PA, Pmax, P1 and P2 airway, total resistance and ohmic resistance and static respiratory compliance indexed for body weight (RRSmaxI, RRSminI, CrsI) will be measured at each Peep Level.&#xD;
The physiologic measurements will be obtained at regular intervals (within 15 minutes at each PEEP level) throughout the PEEP titration period.</description>
