    <textblock>
      In follow-up of the previous SynBioSe Study the present study is a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial designed to further investigate the long-term clinical and imunological efficacy of&#xD;
      combination B-cell targeting by starting treatment with belimumab (anti-BAFF) followed by&#xD;
      rituximab(anti-CD20) in lupus nephritis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SynBioSe-1 study is the first study to comprehensively describe the clinical and&#xD;
      immunological effects of combining rituximab (RTX) and belimumab (BLM) in patients with&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). From the pioneering SynBioSe-1 study, we have learned&#xD;
      that combining RTX+BLM was safe and well-tolerated with important clinical responses.&#xD;
      Immunologically, we unexpectedly observed that long-term B-cell depletion was not achieved&#xD;
      due to migration of mature B-cells triggered by depletion of BAFF serum levels. The latter&#xD;
      observation was in contrast to the study's null-hypothesis that combination therapy would&#xD;
      lead to long-term B-cell depletion. The contrary was demonstrated, namely the relative early&#xD;
      recirculation of mature B-cells. As such, the immunological and clinical lessons from the&#xD;
      SynBioSe-1 study in conjunction with accumulating data from several large studies on&#xD;
      combination B-cell targeted treatment have led to the postulation that starting treatment&#xD;
      with RTX+BLM would result in an improved B-cell targeting strategy, notably on&#xD;
      tissue-resident autoreactive B-cells, associated with improved long-term clinical disease&#xD;
      amelioration. Therefore, the present SynBioSe-2 study is designed to further investigate the&#xD;
      long-term clinical and imunological efficacy of combination B-cell targeting by starting&#xD;
      treatment with belimumab followed by rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess whether combination treatment BLM+RTX will lead to reduced&#xD;
      treatment failure and the improvement of pivotal, SLE-specific autoimmune phenomena compared&#xD;
      to SLE patients treated with standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a multi-center, randomized, controlled, open-label study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLE patients with a severe flare with major organ involvement or persistent high disease&#xD;
      activity despite conventional treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to standard therapy, SLE patients will receive self-administered, subcutaneous&#xD;
      injections of belimumab every week for the entire study period and 2 infusions of rituximab&#xD;
      1000 mg on day 28 (week 4) and day 42 (week 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical efficacy parameter is the treatment failure rate during the 2 years&#xD;
      study period. Secondary endpoints are clinical and non-biased immunological effects of the&#xD;
      treatment summarized as follows: reduction of disease relevant autoantibodies, in particular&#xD;
      anti-dsDNA autoantibody production at 28 weeks, total renal response rate at 28 weeks,&#xD;
      regression of immune complex-mediated excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NET)&#xD;
      formation at 28 weeks; sustained, long-term B-cell depletion during 104 weeks; sustained&#xD;
      reduction of relevant anti-nuclear autoantibodies, including seroconversion during 104 weeks;&#xD;
      and sustained regression of immune complex-mediated excessive neutrophil extracellular traps&#xD;
      (NET) formation during 104 weeks. Additionally, the study will perform safety and toxicity&#xD;
      monitoring according to Common toxicity Criteria (CTC) developed by the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (NCI) with the use of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and&#xD;
      evaluate the reduction of concomitant immunosuppression and the number of moderate and severe&#xD;
      flares during study follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 104 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation and potential&#xD;
      benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include SLE patients with a severe flare necessitating remission induction&#xD;
      treatment with intensive immunosuppression. The use of belimumab followed by rituximab can&#xD;
      ameliorate disease activity even more than conventional treatment in the short-term and&#xD;
      contribute to the successful tapering of concomitant immunosuppressive treatment. The latter&#xD;
      will possibly lead to the reduction of infectious complication as compared to conventional&#xD;
      treatment. The risks are predominantly related to the side effect profile of rituximab and&#xD;
      belimumab and infectious complications of long-term B-cell depletion.&#xD;
