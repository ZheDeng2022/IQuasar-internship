  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fine particulate matter &lt; 2.5 microns (PM2.5) air pollution is a leading global risk factor&#xD;
      for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PM2.5 presents a serious ongoing public health&#xD;
      threat to patients living in highly-polluted countries (ex: China, India) where air quality&#xD;
      is projected to remain extremely poor (far exceeding World Health Organization Air Quality&#xD;
      Guidelines) for the foreseeable future. This study reviews the benefits of personal level&#xD;
      intervention (wearing N95 respirator) over long term, to prevent clinical events among&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      CLEANAIR-ACS will be an investigation within ASPIRE, that will test the ability of&#xD;
      personal-level intervention (N95 respirators) to improve validated surrogate markers of&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic health in patients with a recent Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Patients&#xD;
      with ACS are a vulnerable patient population with vulnerability and at risk for future&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. This vanguard phase study in Beijing involving patients exposed to&#xD;
      high levels of air pollution who have recently sustained an ACS event, is necessary to obtain&#xD;
      feasibility data and gather a battery of information allowing for the appropriate design of a&#xD;
      larger clinical outcome trial. What is more, positive results would provide&#xD;
      critically-important information demonstrating for the first time that it is feasible to&#xD;
      &quot;prescribe&quot; the use of these personal protection devices to cardiac patients, and that their&#xD;
      usage is capable of translating into demonstrable health benefits (i.e., improved BP and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity) over the long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that long-term personal-level interventions to reduce exposure to&#xD;
      PM2.5 can be feasibly performed for 1-year post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and will result&#xD;
      in significant improvements in validated surrogate cardiometabolic endpoints predictive of&#xD;
      morbidity/mortality.&#xD;
