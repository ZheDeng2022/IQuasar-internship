  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to&#xD;
      improve outcomes from exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder, and facilitate extinction&#xD;
      of fear responding toward individuals outside one's own ethnic group (i.e., ethnic out-group&#xD;
      members).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although exposure therapy is among the most powerful treatment techniques for social anxiety,&#xD;
      many individuals do not achieve full remission. Furthermore, some research suggests that fear&#xD;
      responding toward ethnic out-group members may be more resistant to extinction. Enhancing&#xD;
      activation of the mPFC during exposure therapy may improve overall response to treatment, and&#xD;
      also facilitate extinction of fear toward ethic out-groups. Researchers have found that&#xD;
      greater mPFC activation during exposure therapy is associated with better outcomes, and that&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used enhance learning and cognition&#xD;
      with no known serious adverse effects. This study will therefore examine whether&#xD;
      active/anodal (versus sham) tDCS targeting the mPFC (a) enhances overall reductions in social&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, and (b) facilitates extinction of fear responding toward ethnic/racial&#xD;
      out-groups for both Latino and Caucasian/non-Latino participants. Participants will receive&#xD;
      either active/anodal tDCS or sham tDCS during a brief exposure therapy intervention involving&#xD;
      public speaking in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. The public speaking audience in the VR&#xD;
      environment will alternate between audiences that are either matched or unmatched to the&#xD;
      participant's ethnicity (in a randomly assigned order). Participants' fear reactivity will be&#xD;
      assessed with behavioral, physiological, and subjective measures at baseline, post-treatment,&#xD;
      and follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will provide a speech to (a) an audience primarily matched to their ethnicity, and (b) an audience primarily un-matched to their ethnicity. The speech will be for up to 5 minutes in duration. During each BAT, we will assess fear response behaviorally (length of the speech, up to 5 min in duration), physiologically (heart rate and electrodermal activity), and subjectively (self reported levels of anticipated and peak fear).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Public Speaking Anxiety Scale (PSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the PSAS, a 17-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported behavioral, cognitive, and physiological manifestations of public speaking anxiety. The items are sum scored, and totals range from 17 to 85, with higher scores indicating higher levels of public speaking anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale-II (BFNE)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the BFNE-II, a 12-item questionnaire that assesses the extent to which one has concerns about negative evaluation in social settings. A sum score is calculated for the scale, with total scores ranging from 12 to 60, and higher scores indicating higher levels of fear of negative evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Statements During Public Speaking Scale (SSPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the SSPS, a 10-item questionnaire that asses both positive and negative self statements associated with public speaking. The items within each of the two subscales are summed, with total scores ranging from 0 to 25 for each subscale, and higher scores indicating higher levels of agreement with positive or negative self statements, respectively.</description>
