  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the effects of adding a certain type of immunotherapy to&#xD;
      standard bladder-directed radiation as a treatment for muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      of the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug in this study is: Avelumab (also known as BAVENCIO®)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the use of avelumab and&#xD;
      bladder-directed radiation together for this specific disease but avelumab has been approved&#xD;
      for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While bladder-directed radiation is a standard treatment option for muscle-invasive&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, the use of avelumab in combination with bladder&#xD;
      radiation in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is investigational. Radiation&#xD;
      is used in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and avelumab has been approved by&#xD;
      the FDA in patients with more advanced stages of this disease. Avelumab is a form of&#xD;
      immunotherapy, which means it is designed to help the immune system fight cancer cells&#xD;
      together with standard cancer treatments like radiation. Avelumab is currently approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for the treatment of metastatic Merckel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and platinum-refractory&#xD;
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the combination of immunotherapy and bladder&#xD;
      directed radiation is effective in treating muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The study will&#xD;
      also measure other outcomes such as participant's overall health and quality of life during&#xD;
      and after treatment. In addition, the investigators will determine if certain biomarkers are&#xD;
      correlated with outcomes following treatment with immunotherapy and radiation.&#xD;
