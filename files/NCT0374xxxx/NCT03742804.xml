    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of repeat-dose&#xD;
      intratumoral G100 administration in patients with Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) alone&#xD;
      (Part 1) and following standard local radiation therapy or topical nitrogen mustard&#xD;
      application (Part 2). Plaque, patch, or tumor lesions of CTCL may be injected. Disease will&#xD;
      be assessed in all sites, including skin, nodes, and blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, Phase II study of intratumoral or intralesional injection of G100 alone&#xD;
      (Part 1) and in conjunction with topical nitrogen mustard (HN2) or radiotherapy (Part 2) in&#xD;
      patients with CTCL to generate anti-tumor immune responses. To confirm the safety of the&#xD;
      injections in this population, enrollment of the first four patients will be staggered by at&#xD;
      least 21 days each. If there are no grade 3 adverse events following the first 4 injections&#xD;
      in the first 3 patients, then subsequent patients can be enrolled without restriction to&#xD;
      timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: All patients will receive 6 intratumoral G100 injections alone over 5 weeks (first&#xD;
      dose on Day 0, second on Day 5-7, and then weekly thereafter; up to Week 5) to assess the&#xD;
      response to G100 alone. Response in target lesions will be measured by CAILS and abscopal&#xD;
      effect will be measured by Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (MSWAT). If applicable,&#xD;
      peripheral blood flow cytometry will be used to assess response of circulating tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 4-week break for restaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Patients will receive another 6 doses of G100 with either topical nitrogen mustard&#xD;
      for 2 days or local radiotherapy (2 Gy daily x 2 days) prior to G100 to the injected lesion&#xD;
      to assess the response to combination therapy. After the first 4 doses, nitrogen mustard is&#xD;
      optional and can be omitted at the discretion of the investigator. Response in target lesions&#xD;
      will be measured by Composite assessment of index lesion severity (CAILS) and abscopal effect&#xD;
      will be measured by MSWAT. If applicable, peripheral blood flow cytometry will be used to&#xD;
      assess response of circulating tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose regimen interruption in a single patient may be made by the clinical investigator&#xD;
           if it is deemed in the best interest of patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor imaging will be performed during the screening visit (baseline) in patients with&#xD;
           blood involvement, palpable nodes, or tumor stage disease (scans done within 4 weeks of&#xD;
           study entry are admissible), and in patients with clinically suspicious positive scans&#xD;
           (nodes felt to be involved, standardized uptake value (SUV) 4 or greater on positron&#xD;
           emission tomography (PET), imaging will be repeated at the completion of 6 weeks of&#xD;
           dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating Sezary cells will be followed if present at baseline. Quantitation of Sezary&#xD;
           cells will be done by flow cytometry using appropriate markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies will be obtained for histologic review and&#xD;
           exploratory immune analyses, including cell phenotype and genomic analyses of T cells.&#xD;
           On-treatment biopsies will be performed at Week 3 of both Parts 1 and 2 of the study.&#xD;
           Peripheral blood will be drawn for immune assays and other biomarker tests at time&#xD;
           points listed in the Schedule of Events and Study Procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and to observe clinical responses (by MSWAT and CAILS) with&#xD;
           intratumoral G100 alone and with G100 in combination with agents to induce apoptosis&#xD;
           (local radiotherapy or topical nitrogen mustard) in patients with CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess abscopal tumor responses in non-treated, distal tumor sites by MSWAT and CAILS&#xD;
           tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate pre-and post-regimen tumor tissue and blood for exploratory biomarkers of&#xD;
           immunologic and tumor response.&#xD;
