  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, muscle mass - a part of the concept of sarcopenia - is measured by computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. These devices are not always&#xD;
      easily available in clinical practice and cannot be used bedside. An innovation in sarcopenia&#xD;
      is the assessment of muscle mass and quality with ultrasound. Because this device is much&#xD;
      more available and applicable in all patients, diagnosis of acute sarcopenia would be much&#xD;
      easier with ultrasound. Moreover, if other factors that contribute to accelerated decline in&#xD;
      muscle mass and function can be determinated, the sensiblisation and early screening for&#xD;
      acute sarcopenia in those individuals can hopefully prevent them from declining.&#xD;

      Methods Study design A prospective, multicenter, international observational study will be&#xD;
      conducted. The study is designed to determine the effect of hospitalisation due to acute&#xD;
      illness on the changes in muscle mass and muscle function. The secondary endpoint of the&#xD;
      study is to identify health related parameters associated with the development of acute&#xD;
      sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Inclusion criteria Patients admitted between the 1st of December 2018 until the 31th&#xD;
      of November 2019 will be eligible for inclusion. Included wards for admission are: internal&#xD;
      medicine, acute geriatrics, orthogeriatrics and rehabilitation. Age limit will be set on 65&#xD;
      years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patients on dialysis will be excluded because of possible metabolic&#xD;
      features. Individuals with paresis of the lower limbs or hemiparesis due to a stroke will be&#xD;
      excluded because of neurological involvement that can influence the results. Hypo-or&#xD;
      hyperthyroid patients will be excluded because of the role of thyroid hormones in muscle&#xD;
      homeostasis. Pitting oedema of the legs (due to heart failure, anasarca oedema, renal failure&#xD;
      or liver cirrhosis) or severely dehydrated patients will be excluded because fluid shifts&#xD;
      could influence the ultrasound measurement results. Because of possible previous changes in&#xD;
      muscle mass, architecture and function, patients with systemic connective tissue disorders,&#xD;
      myositis, calcification and ossification of muscle, systemic atrophies primarily affecting&#xD;
      the central nervous system and demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system will be&#xD;
      excluded. Patients using chronic oral corticosteroids will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings and locations The study will be a multicenter study held in different university and&#xD;
      tertiary teaching hospitals throughout Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics Date of birth, gender, height and weight will be registered. If the&#xD;
      patient is bedridden, weight can be measured through either weight chairs or weight measuring&#xD;
      lifts. Height will be estimated using the ulna length or knee height. Date of admission and&#xD;
      discharge will be noted. The home care setting of the patient will be registered. The main&#xD;
      reason of hospital admission will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbidities on admission will be registered through the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Geriatrics (CIRS-G). The CIRS-G was designed to estimate the survival of elderly persons,&#xD;
      assessing disease severity using a score from 0 to 4 in 14 different categories of organ&#xD;
      systems: cardiac, vascular, hematological, respiratory, ophthalmological and&#xD;
      otorhinolaryngological, upper gastro-intestinal, lower gastro-intestinal, hepatic and&#xD;
      pancreatic, renal, genito-urinary, musculoskeletal and tegumental, neurological,&#xD;
      endocrine/metabolic/breast and psychiatric. Score '0' stands for 'no problem affecting that&#xD;
      system', score '1' stands for 'current mild problem or past significant problem', score '2'&#xD;
      stands for 'moderate disability or morbidity', score '3' stands for 'severe problem' and&#xD;
      score '4' stands for 'extremely severe problem'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory values that will be checked are either nutritional through albumin and prealbumin,&#xD;
      inflammatory through C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count, and the measurement&#xD;
      of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-vitamin D). Blood samples will be collected on day of&#xD;
      admission. Laboratory values that are not expected to fluctuate strongly (albumin,&#xD;
      pre-albumin, 25-OH-vitamin D) will be taken within the first 5 days of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle mass In order to obtain reliable and consistent measurements, all ultrasonography will&#xD;
      be done by an ultrasonographist that is trained to perform the measurements proposed. For the&#xD;
      measurements, a linear probe of 5 cm width will be used. Frequency of the beam will be set on&#xD;
      12 MHz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should not have had any physical exercise in the 30 minutes before the measurement.&#xD;
      Muscles should be completely relaxed and patients should be placed in the supine position,&#xD;
      with hips in neutral position and knees fully extended. The dominant leg will be taken for&#xD;
      the measurements. To calculate the relative muscle thickness values, the total length of&#xD;
      muscle will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonographic data of the four bellies of the quadriceps muscle (rectus femoris, vastus&#xD;
      lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius) will be taken. Measuring points will be&#xD;
      specified according to the propositions of the SARCUS-working group. Muscle thickness,&#xD;
      fascicle length, pennation angle, muscle cross-sectional area and echo-intensity of all&#xD;
      muscles listed will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first measurement will be taken as early as possible within 48 hours after admission at&#xD;
      the latest. Follow-up measurements will be taken according to the type of ward the patient is&#xD;
      admitted to. For patients that are expected to be hospitalized for a limited time (&lt;5 days),&#xD;
      the follow-up measurement will be done 3 days after initial measurement. For patients that&#xD;
      are expected to be hospitalized for a longer time (&gt;7 days), measurements will be repeated 7&#xD;
      days after initial measurement, to be repeated after another 7 days as long as the patient is&#xD;
      hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength and function Muscle strength will be measured through hand grip strength&#xD;
      using a Jamar dynamometer, using the Southampton protocol. The first measurement will be&#xD;
      taken as early as possible within 48 hours after admission at the latest. Follow-up&#xD;
      measurements will be taken according to the type of ward the patient is admitted to. For&#xD;
      patients that are expected to be hospitalized for a limited time (&lt;5 days), the follow-up&#xD;
      measurement will be done 3 days after initial measurement. For patients that are expected to&#xD;
      be hospitalized for a longer time (&gt;7 days), measurements will be repeated 7 days after&#xD;
      initial measurement, to be repeated after another 7 days as long as the patient is&#xD;
      hospitalized. Measurement will be done directly after the ultrasonographic assessment. If&#xD;
      feasible, muscle function will be measured through gait speed, using the 4-meter walking test&#xD;
      at usual gait speed. In case of those bedridden, gait speed will not be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-hospital activity Registration of activity level during hospitalisation will be performed&#xD;
      by means of pedometers in those centers that have access to these devices. Both amount of&#xD;
      steps and step length will be noted, and total walked distance per day can hereby be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional status Nutritional state of the patient will be registered through the&#xD;
      Mini-Nutritional Assessment - Short Form (MNA-SF). For diagnosis of malnutrition, the new&#xD;
      Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM)-criteria will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires The SARC-F and FRAIL-scale will be completed as routine screening&#xD;
      questionnaires for sarcopenia and frailty, respectively. The SAR-QOL questionnaire will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the self-reported quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Databases will be kept up in a Microsoft Access database. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be done by using SPSS Statistics version 24. Descriptive analyses will be used&#xD;
      for determining the clinical and demographic characteristics. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will&#xD;
      be used to verify the normal distribution of the different variables. Further statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed by Chi Square test, Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher&#xD;
      exact test, depending on the distribution and the nature of the variables analysed. P-values&#xD;
      of ≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
