  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SHARP-P is an observational cohort study investigating the effect of direct-acting antiviral&#xD;
      (DAA) therapy and reinfection in people with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and recent&#xD;
      injecting drug use. A prospective, observational cohort design will be used to enrol patients&#xD;
      from correctional centres in New South Wales, Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be prescribed a direct-acting HCV medication as per the standard of care.&#xD;
      The on treatment phase will vary dependent on the type of a direct-acting antiviral&#xD;
      prescribed as per the standard of care. Once patients have completed their treatment course&#xD;
      they will be followed up every 3 months for up to 3 years following the end of treatment&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to evaluate the incidence of HCV reinfection following successful DAA&#xD;
      treatment over the three years of follow up. The study will also evaluate the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks post end of treatment (SVR12) with&#xD;
      direct-acting anti-viral HCV therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Australia, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related morbidity and mortality have doubled in the&#xD;
      past decade, with health care costs of $220 million per annum associated with approximately&#xD;
      200,000 chronically infected cases. The majority of new (90%) and existing (80%) cases of HCV&#xD;
      infection occur among people who inject drugs (PWID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is a close relationship between imprisonment, injecting drug use, and HCV, in any&#xD;
      given year, almost 20,000 of those with chronic HCV in Australia spend time in prison,&#xD;
      including approximately 8,000 in New South Wales (NSW). These individuals are likely to&#xD;
      represent the most marginalised and 'hard-to-access' subgroup of the affected population. In&#xD;
      addition, the prison environment is a key venue for ongoing transmission. Amongst PWID in the&#xD;
      prison setting the report of any injecting drug use decreased from 71% prior to prison entry&#xD;
      to 27% following imprisonment. However, among people who reported injecting drug use, the&#xD;
      proportion reporting sharing a needle/syringe increased from 29% prior to prison entry to&#xD;
      73%. In the community, 15-20% of current PWID report recent (last month) receptive&#xD;
      needle/syringe sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prison, where there is no access to formal needle and syringe programs, sharing injecting&#xD;
      equipment can be normative with inmates' accounts of injecting practice revealing few ways&#xD;
      that they can minimise HCV risk. Establishing effective disease prevention in the prison&#xD;
      context is challenging, as prisons are unique in physical structure, and prisoners form a&#xD;
      distinct micro-society with their own rules and regulations. Many health problems amongst&#xD;
      prisoners arise directly from conditions of imprisonment such as overcrowding, uncontrolled&#xD;
      exposure to violence and illicit drugs, lack of purposeful activity, separation from family&#xD;
      networks and emotional deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing strategies for HCV prevention in NSW prisons are delivered by Justice Health &amp;&#xD;
      Forensic Mental Health and Corrective Services. Justice Health &amp; Forensic Mental Health&#xD;
      provides a targeted screening program for blood-borne virus infection with pre- and post-test&#xD;
      counselling, and opioid substitution treatment (OST) for those who are opioid dependent.&#xD;
      Corrective Services provides bleach (or the quaternary amine disinfectant, Fincol) to clean&#xD;
      used syringes. NSP is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these efforts, in the Hepatitis C Incidence and Transmission Study in prisons&#xD;
      (HITS-p; n=590) led by CI-Lloyd, half of the cohort (49%) of PWID reported injecting drug use&#xD;
      during follow-up in prison and 31% reported sharing injecting equipment. HCV incidence was&#xD;
      14.1/100 p-yrs (95% CI: 9.96, 19.3). There was no apparent protective effect of bleach&#xD;
      cleansing or OST, highlighting the additional challenges of HCV prevention in the custodial&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative research shows that decisions about sharing equipment are multi-factorial and can&#xD;
      include issues ranging from service access (such as distance to service and opening hours),&#xD;
      concerns about anonymity, perceptions that HCV is ubiquitous and unavoidable to&#xD;
      socially-located concerns that promote use of sterile equipment such as a desire to avoid&#xD;
      &quot;track marks&quot;. In the prison context, complex social, economic, and environmental risk&#xD;
      factors contributed to injecting practices with the person supplying the drugs injecting&#xD;
      first, and the person who owns the injecting equipment going next. Risk of HCV acquisition&#xD;
      did not regularly factor into determining order of injection within networks. There is no&#xD;
      research that examines sharing of injecting equipment in those who have been cured with&#xD;
      antiviral therapy in either community or prison settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing access to HCV therapy is a key objective of national and NSW Hepatitis C&#xD;
      Strategies. The advent of well-tolerated, simple, oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) regimens -&#xD;
      direct acting antivirals (DAAs) - has the potential to transform this landscape. These are&#xD;
      much shorter, tolerable treatment regimens with cure rates &gt;95%, providing an opportunity to&#xD;
      reverse the rising burden of advanced liver disease. From 1st March 2016, these highly&#xD;
      efficacious HCV therapies have been listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme, and people&#xD;
      with recent injecting drug use including prisoners are eligible to receive them. These are&#xD;
      important features of the listing. In many countries, people who have not ceased injecting&#xD;
      drug use are ineligible to receive DAA therapy, despite the fact that they comprise a&#xD;
      significant proportion of HCV cases. Australia is therefore is leading the world in the&#xD;
      scale-up of new therapies to an extent that many countries with such exclusions will not be&#xD;
      able to achieve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feature of DAA access also affords unique opportunities with respect to the&#xD;
      implementation of treatment scale-up in community drug treatment clinics and prisons.&#xD;
      Australia has good treatment coverage for people who are opioid dependent, with over 50% of&#xD;
      opioid dependent people estimated to engage in opioid substitution therapy (OST).&#xD;
      Community-based drug treatment clinics and prisons represent a logical venue for expansion of&#xD;
      HCV care beyond existing tertiary HCV treatment centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although response to DAA HCV therapy is high, lower responses have been observed among people&#xD;
      with previous treatment experience, cirrhosis and those with baseline or emergent resistance&#xD;
      associated variants. Such resistance associated variants can persist for up to two years&#xD;
      after treatment, affect re-treatment options, and be transmitted to new hosts. Further, PWID&#xD;
      are likely to be exposed to multiple HCV infections as a result of ongoing high-risk&#xD;
      behaviours and might commonly harbour mixed HCV infections (infection with two or more&#xD;
      distinct viruses). Underlying mixed HCV infection can contribute to nonresponse during&#xD;
      therapy, which has implications for DAA regimens that are preferentially active against&#xD;
      specific viral genotypes or subtypes. These data argue for surveillance of HCV resistance and&#xD;
      mixed HCV infection among PWID to resolve residual concerns regarding their clinical and&#xD;
      public health significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two systematic reviews assessing interferon-based therapy for PWID have demonstrated&#xD;
      responses comparable to randomised controlled trials excluding PWID. These data have&#xD;
      supported international recommendations for the management of HCV for PWID. However, there&#xD;
      are limited data on DAA therapy among recent PWID. As treatment is broadened to include more&#xD;
      marginalised individuals, many clinicians are reluctant to treat HCV among PWID with recent&#xD;
      injecting drug use with new DAA therapies. Major concerns include poor adherence/response,&#xD;
      increased risk behaviour and HCV reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major concern is that ongoing injecting risk behaviours following DAA therapy in PWID will&#xD;
      lead to HCV reinfection, reversing the benefits of cure. Ongoing risk behaviours following&#xD;
      successful HCV therapy may lead to reinfection and compromised treatment outcomes. In a&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis of HCV reinfection among PWID performed by the&#xD;
      investigators, the pooled estimate of re-infection was 2.2/100 p-yrs (95% CI, 0.9-6.1)&#xD;
      overall and 6.4/100 p-yrs (95% CI, 2.5-16.7) among individuals who reported injecting drug&#xD;
      use post-SVR. The one study of HCV reinfection post-therapy in prison performed to date was&#xD;
      small (n=74), retrospective, and did not assess the rate of HCV reinfection. Studies of&#xD;
      reinfection following HCV therapy are limited by small sample sizes, retrospective study&#xD;
      designs, incomplete follow-up, and a lack of sensitive methods to detect reinfection.&#xD;
      Further, there are no data on HCV reinfection among recent PWID treated with DAAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although DAA therapy could limit HCV-related disease burden, as treatment is broadened to&#xD;
      include more marginalised individuals, many clinicians are reluctant to treat HCV among&#xD;
      recent PWID, given concerns about poor adherence (and lower response to therapy), increased&#xD;
      risk behaviours (due to the ease and high cure rates of DAA HCV therapy) and HCV reinfection&#xD;
      (thereby reversing cure). However, no data exist on the extent to which this should be a&#xD;
      concern. Given that DAA HCV therapy is highly expensive, we urgently need data on the&#xD;
      magnitude of risk for, and predictors of, HCV reinfection. It is also unclear whether PWID&#xD;
      treated in these two settings will vary in their response to DAA therapy and risk for&#xD;
      reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have an excellent track record of conducting high quality cohort studies&#xD;
      and clinical trials among PWID in the community and prison, with high participant retention&#xD;
      in follow-up. The investigators have developed a network of community-based clinical sites&#xD;
      providing HCV care in nine community-based drug treatment clinics, and many years of&#xD;
      collaborative clinical research in the prison sector. In SHARP the investigators will explore&#xD;
      the risk of HCV reinfection and treatment efficacy among recent PWID with chronic HCV and&#xD;
      recent injecting drug use in the community and in the prisons.&#xD;
