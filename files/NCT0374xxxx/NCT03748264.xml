    <textblock>
      This pilot study is intended to evaluate the acceptance and performance of the DreamMapper&#xD;
      application and the Therapist Assist educational tool in naïve patients with Obstructive&#xD;
      Sleep Apnea who have been prescribed Positive Airway Pressure therapy. A total of&#xD;
      approximately 60 naïve participants will be recruited.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective trial designed to obtain subjective and objective feedback&#xD;
      in a home use environment with participants using a Philips Respironics System One Positive&#xD;
      Airway Pressure device. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three methods of&#xD;
      therapy introduction and monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: The first group, the control condition, participants will receive the sites&#xD;
           therapy initiation standard of care for setting up and educating the participants on&#xD;
           their Obstructive Sleep Apnea, mask, and device information. This group will use a&#xD;
           wireless modem that is attached to the Positive Airway Pressure device and uploads&#xD;
           adherence and other therapy information daily to a secured database (Encore Anywhere).&#xD;
           With this method, therapy information is not directly available to the participant.&#xD;
           Therapy information is available continuously to site staff personnel in the standard&#xD;
           care arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: The second group will receive the site's therapy initiation standard of care&#xD;
           for setting up and educating the participants on their Obstructive Sleep Apnea, mask,&#xD;
           and device information. Participants in this group will also download the DreamMapper&#xD;
           application on their iPhone or Android smart phone. Therapy information and educational&#xD;
           material will be available continuously to the participant with DreamMapper through the&#xD;
           application. Study personnel will have access to adherence and therapy information&#xD;
           continuously as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group 3: The third group will not receive the site's therapy initiation standard of care&#xD;
           but will review the Therapist Assist automated educational material on Obstructive Sleep&#xD;
           Apnea, and their Philips Respironics mask. and DreamMapper. These participants will&#xD;
           download the DreamMapper application onto their iPhone or Android smart phone. Therapy&#xD;
           information and educational material will be available continuously to the participant&#xD;
           with DreamMapper. Study personnel will have access to adherence and therapy information&#xD;
           continuously as well.&#xD;

    <measure>User Preference of the New Philips Respironics Positive Airway Pressure Application as Measured by the Attitudes Toward Use Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Attitudes Toward Use Questionnaire (0 to 10 scale) to determine user preference of the New Philips Respironics Positive Airway Pressure Application. The higher the value the higher participant confidence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be measured among the three groups to determine which participants used their Positive Airway Pressure device most throughout the trial: DreamMapper compared to site standard of care compared to using DreamMapper and Therapist Assist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Outcomes - Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment outcomes will be assess by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Epworth Sleepiness is 8 question survey asking questions about likelihood to fall asleep, each questions is answered on a 0 to 3 scale, 0-no chance, 3-high chance, the higher the score the higher likelihood of daytime sleepiness. The scale is 0-24, 0-no chance to fall asleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Outcomes - Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment outcomes will be assess by the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire. The FOSQ is a specific quality of life questionnaire to determine functional status in adults; measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on multiple activities of everyday living and the extent to which these abilities are improved by effective treatment. It asks sets of questions for activity level, vigilance, intimacy and sexual relationships, general productivity, social outcome, rate the difficulty of performing a given activity on a 4-point scale (4-no difficulty to 1-extreme difficulty 0-I do not do it for other reasons). 10 questions are asked with the lowest score of 0 and the highest of score of 40. The lower the score the more difficulty it is to complete tasks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Site Economic Savings Assessed by Number of Phone Calls.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Site economics savings will be collected and analyzed by reviewing the number of phone calls per arm. Exact numeric amounts of savings are not available but number of calls is.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Interactions</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
