  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence to indicate that the gut microbiota has an effect on mental well-being and&#xD;
      stress behaviours. This is highly relevant to both life on earth and spaceflight missions, in&#xD;
      which mental well-being is crucial to mission success. Bifidobacterium longum 1714 (BL 1714),&#xD;
      will be tested in the project ICELAND-2 in a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      pilot study in crew members of the Antarctica station CONCORDIA in order to test stress&#xD;
      resilience and possible outcomes on the immune system since the metabolic stress response and&#xD;
      the immune system are closely interrelated. Crew members of CONCORDIA station have a&#xD;
      prolonged stay (roughly 12 months) in a confined (antigen exposure restricted, overclean) and&#xD;
      isolated environment, mimicking the situation of long-term space travel. ICELAND-2 will be&#xD;
      conducted over three consecutive winter-over periods (3 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project ICELAND-2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. evaluates the effect of the probiotic BL1714 on well-being regarding mood, social&#xD;
           integration and stress and other parameters .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determines the effect of an antigen-limited environment like Concordia on gut&#xD;
           microbiota, immune system and epigenetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. examines the interaction between the factors mentioned in 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. examines the role of nutrition intake and behaviour in the interplay mentioned above.&#xD;

      EXPERIMENT CONCEPT&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-bind, controlled pilot study where volunteers will receive a novel&#xD;
      nutritional supplement powder (sachet, containing 1011 CFU Bifidobacterium longum 1714&#xD;
      (Alimentary 11 Health, Cork, Ireland) or placebo) once every day, to be taken in the morning&#xD;
      with breakfastthroughout the year. The intervention starts for every participant at arrival&#xD;
      (individual start). Using this study design, benefits of the probiotic on height adaptation&#xD;
      can be also studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental concept is based on the collection of biosamples (saliva, blood, stool) and&#xD;
      some paper-pencil and documentary data only. Thereby, the interference of the project with&#xD;
      the daily activities of the CONCORDIA crew is minimal. Both, female and male participants are&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One blood, one saliva and one stool sample prior to the CONCORDIA stay, in addition to&#xD;
           paper-pencil data collection once at the same time (-2 to 3 months prior to the stay - T&#xD;
           Zero, BDC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Three blood as well as a saliva samples (month 1, months 4 and 9, corresponding to T0,&#xD;
           T4 and T9) during the CONCORDIA stay, as well as monthly collection of stool samples&#xD;
           (months 1 to 9, T1 to T9), plus questionnaire data (paper-pencil data and/or online).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. One blood, one saliva and one stool sample after the CONCORDIA stay, in addition to&#xD;
           paper-pencil data collection once at the same time (3 to 6 months after the stay - T12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva Sampling: a standard saliva sampling kit (Oragene-DNA - OG-500, DNA Genotec, Ottawa,&#xD;
      ON, Canada) will be used (see Figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool Sampling: a standard stool sampling kit (Sarstedt) will be used (see Figure 3) to&#xD;
      retrieve 3 small samples from each stool, and stored in separated containers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feces Catcher: Paper-based stool collection aid (with instruction imprinted in variable&#xD;
      language (FecesCatcher®) (Figure 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling: Blood collection will be performed in two 5 ml heparinized tubes (total 10 ml&#xD;
      for cell collection) and one dried tube of 5 ml per blood sampling. An adequate number of&#xD;
      separation tubes and cryotubes for processing of blood will also be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sampling: can be done at any time prior to the CONCORDIA stay, easiest during the&#xD;
      pre-departure crew meeting. Saliva sampling will be repeated at month 4 and 9 as well as post&#xD;
      CONCORDIA stay. Saliva samples do not need any preprocessing and can be stored at room&#xD;
      temperature for the remaining time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pre-departure meeting, a 1-hour interview related to nutritional habits (including&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms like bowel movements) should be done. Paper-pencil tests (1 hour)&#xD;
      will be collected as well. This will include the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) and a structured questionnaire related to&#xD;
      previous illnesses, drug intake and medical treatments. The FFQ and the GSRS will be assessed&#xD;
      in Concordia at the same times as the blood sampling is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool sampling and short well-being assessment: Sampling (three aliquots, pea-size, in&#xD;
      separate containers) can be done at the discretion of each participating CONCORDIA crew&#xD;
      member once every month, but preferentially at approximately same day of the months each&#xD;
      time. No coordinated sampling between crew members is needed, but the day should be noted on&#xD;
      the sampling kits/diary. This should be supervised and documented by the ESA MD. Along with&#xD;
      the stool sampling the participants will be asked to rate on a visual analogue scale mood,&#xD;
      stress and social integrity. Additionally, the ESA MD will provide the information for every&#xD;
      participant. This measure is needed as outcome for the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food records: The ESA MD is asked to take pictures of meals/food/food condition on a regular&#xD;
      base if possible. Most importantly, the MD should take standardized photos of the meals (of&#xD;
      the last three days prior to the and the days of the stool sampling. The camera and storage&#xD;
      devices have been handed out to the MD in Aosta, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively and/or in addition the cook will record his cooking activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T - 3 days before stool sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESA MD takes photo (with a reference 2 euro coin) of breakfast meal, lunch meal and dinner&#xD;
      meal&#xD;
&#xD;
      T - 2 days before stool sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESA MD takes photo (with a reference 2 euro coin) of breakfast meal, lunch meal and dinner&#xD;
      meal&#xD;
&#xD;
      T - 1 days before stool sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESA MD takes photo (with a reference 2 euro coin) of breakfast meal, lunch meal and dinner&#xD;
      meal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days of stool sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESA MD takes photo (with a reference 2 euro coin) of breakfast meal, lunch meal and dinner&#xD;
      meal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-processing of stool samples is not needed, samples are stored away at -50°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling: Blood withdrawal for immune testing must be performed by a single phlebotomy,&#xD;
      and can be performed at the time of programmed health checks of the CONCORDIA staff. Blood&#xD;
      collection must be performed in two 5 ml heparinized tubes (total 10 ml for cell collection),&#xD;
      and one dried tube of 5 ml for serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-processing of the Blood Sample (to be performed by the ESA investigator physician)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cognate immune functions, live cells are needed and must be frozen and stored in&#xD;
      preserving conditions so they can be resuscitated after that. This means rapid processing&#xD;
      after collection (within 4-6 hours), fast freezing and in preserving medium (with DMSO) below&#xD;
      -40°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Cell storage: Vacutainer® CPT™ Cell Preparation tubes with Sodium Heparin are provided&#xD;
      to simplify cell preparation (Figure 5, left). CPT™ tubes directly contain ficoll (density&#xD;
      buffer) and a gel ready for centrifugation. The blood is collected on the top of the gel like&#xD;
      usual vacutainer tubes. Centrifugation will separate red blood cells, granulocytes (going&#xD;
      below the gel) from mononuclear cells and plasma staying on the top. Mononuclear cells need&#xD;
      washing in Sterile Hanks buffer (provided) and the pellet re-suspended in freezing buffer&#xD;
      (provided) and directly frozen at least below 40°C.&#xD;
