  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to confirm the hypothesis that Idelalisib may represent a new&#xD;
      therapeutic alternative for patients with ALL in a set of particularly complex scenarios:&#xD;
      relapsed, refractory to conventional treatments, and old age. For this reason, the primary&#xD;
      objective is the overall response rate [ORR, defined as complete response (CR) or CR with&#xD;
      partial hematologic recovery (CRh) and response duration (RD) in adult patients with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory ALL, or in adult ALL patients who are not suitable for treatment with&#xD;
      conventional therapies.&#xD;

      Phase I-II multi-site, exploratory, interventional, unmasked, non-randomized, single arm&#xD;
      clinical trial. A single drug will be administered in four different, increasing doses to&#xD;
      four consecutive cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the study will focus on determining the most effective and tolerated dose&#xD;
      of the study drug. The second phase will follow patients to the end to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation will be decided by the Study Coordinator, who will evaluate and assess&#xD;
      each cohort. Once the cohort of 6 patients is complete, the Coordinator will evaluate&#xD;
      patients and, based on the tolerability and efficacy obtained, will decide whether to proceed&#xD;
      with the dose escalation, or whether to end the trial The study will remain open until the&#xD;
      overall number of participants is achieved; §progressive dose increases (PI) will be&#xD;
      discontinued if dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in more than two patients in the&#xD;
      previous cohort, *PI of the dose will only continue (for the third cohort) if at least two&#xD;
      patients in the first two cohorts achieve the overall response rate (ORR), that is, complete&#xD;
      response (CR) at four weeks from initiation of treatment; ** the study will only move on to&#xD;
      the fourth cohort if CR is achieved in at least one of the six patients in the third cohort&#xD;
      at four weeks from initiation of treatment; ***microscopy/cytofluorometry; ****complete blood&#xD;
      count, microscopy, biochemistry; *****as long as there is no relapse, treatment will continue&#xD;
      after the end of the study (planned for 24 months after the start of recruitment); AE,&#xD;

          -  B-cell precursor ALL, in any of the following cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Second or subsequent relapses [including after hematopoeitic stem cell&#xD;
                  transplantation (HSCT)] in patients who are ineligible for subsequent HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Resistance to at least two lines of treatment. Line of treatment is understood as&#xD;
                  initial treatment y salvage therapy after the first relapse (that may include&#xD;
                  HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Older adult patients (aged &gt;65 years) for whom standard therapies are not&#xD;
                  clinically advisable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with Ph+ ALL, failure after receiving at least two treatments with&#xD;
             different TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors): imatinib, dasatinib or ponatinib, in&#xD;
             patients who are ineligible for subsequent HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG between 0 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values &lt; two times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin 2 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt;2 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 10% blasts in bone marrow in the two weeks prior to the start of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential: must agree to practice abstinence (abstain from&#xD;
             having heterosexual sexual relations/contact) or to use one highly effective birth&#xD;
             control method (failure rate less than 1%) during the treatment period and for at&#xD;
             least 28 day after the last dose of Idelalisib .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman is considered able to conceive if she is menstruating, is not post-menopausal&#xD;
             (≥12 consecutive months without menstruation for no cause other than menopause) and&#xD;
             who has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Examples of birth control methods with a &lt;1% yearly failure rate include bilateral&#xD;
             tubal ligation, vasectomy, proper use of hormonal contraceptives that prevent&#xD;
             ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The feasibility of sexual abstinence should be evaluated with respect to the duration&#xD;
             of the trial and the patient's normal lifestyle preferences. Periodic abstinence (for&#xD;
             example, the calendar method, ovulation, symptothermal or post-ovulation methods) and&#xD;
             the withdrawal method are not acceptable birth control methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients: must agree to practice abstinence (abstain from heterosexual sexual&#xD;
             relations) or use birth control methods, and agree to not donate sperm, as defined&#xD;
             below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With female partners of childbearing capacity or pregnant female partner, men must&#xD;
             practice total abstinence or use a condom plus one additional birth control method&#xD;
             which, combined, have a failure rate of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period, and&#xD;
             for at least 4 months after the last dose of Idelalisib to avoid exposure to the&#xD;
             fetus. Men must not donate sperm during this same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The feasibility of sexual abstinence should be evaluated with respect to the duration&#xD;
             of the trial and the patient's lifestyle preferences. Periodic abstinence and the&#xD;
             withdrawal method are not acceptable birth control methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isolated central nervous system relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
