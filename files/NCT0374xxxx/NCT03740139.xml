  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, controlled trial is to study the effectiveness of a potential new&#xD;
      form of pre-arrest jail diversion for people with serious mental illnesses: the Police-Mental&#xD;
      Health Linkage System. In the case of an encounter with a police officer, for half of the&#xD;
      participants, during the background check, a message will notify the officer that the subject&#xD;
      has mental health considerations. The notice contains a phone number of a provider working at&#xD;
      the mental health clinic where the subject is receiving services, who can provide telephonic&#xD;
      support to the officer. For the other half of participants, the message will not appear to&#xD;
      the officers in the case of an encounter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fragmentation between mental health (MH) and criminal justice (CJ) systems leads to many&#xD;
      persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI) being arrested/incarcerated when MH treatment&#xD;
      would be more appropriate. As defined by SAMHSA, the disorders typically meeting criteria for&#xD;
      SMI include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, other psychotic disorders, major&#xD;
      depressive disorders, and bipolar disorders. This study aims to test the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      new police-MH linkage system. This study is a randomized, controlled trial to study the&#xD;
      effectiveness of our new services-level intervention. Our &quot;linkage system&quot; piggybacks on the&#xD;
      Georgia's criminal justice information system such that a police officer running a routine&#xD;
      inquiry (similar to a background check) during an encounter with a consented and enrolled&#xD;
      outpatient with a serious mental illness will receive an electronic message to call for&#xD;
      information that might assist them. The officer can immediately call and connect to a Linkage&#xD;
      Specialist (licensed mental health professional in the local public mental health system&#xD;
      where the patient is or was enrolled in outpatient care), who provides brief telephonic&#xD;
      support, information, and advice to the officer. The investigators have shown, in the&#xD;
      recently completed NIMH-funded R34 intervention development project, that in some cases, a&#xD;
      discretionary arrest (i.e., not obligatory, no violence involved) is replaced by informal&#xD;
      resolution in light of the new information provided to the officer via the inquiry message&#xD;
      and telephonic support from the Linkage Specialist. Furthermore, even more common than jail&#xD;
      diversion, many patients involved in a police encounter were reconnected to care (after&#xD;
      having fallen out of care and becoming symptomatic). This trial aims to determine whether or&#xD;
      not the new linkage system is effective for reducing arrests and reducing discontinuities&#xD;
      (gaps) in outpatient mental health care services. Partnering with our CJ partner, Georgia&#xD;
      Bureau of Investigation (which houses Georgia's CJ databases/information system), as well as&#xD;
      4 public MH agencies covering 25 counties in Georgia, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized trial of the linkage system involving 1,600 outpatients with SMI. The&#xD;
      investigators will test the hypotheses that patients randomized to the linkage system (as&#xD;
      compared to those randomized to a database that does not generate the MH notice and phone&#xD;
      number) will: (1) be less likely to be arrested, (2) have fewer arrests (both based on&#xD;
      administrative (rap sheet) data provided by GBI), and (3) be less likely to have gaps in&#xD;
      outpatient MH services, as evidenced by fewer absences from care of &gt;3 months (based on data&#xD;
      from the MH agencies' EMRs).&#xD;
