  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BGB-A425 is a humanized, immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1)-variant monoclonal antibody against&#xD;
      TIM-3. Tislelizumab is a humanized, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-variant monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      against PD-1. This study tests the safety and anti-tumor effect of BGB-A425 in combination&#xD;
      with tislelizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 have achieved remarkable results in the treatment of many&#xD;
      types of tumors. However, based upon the rate of primary and secondary resistance to PD-1&#xD;
      blockade, it is apparent that additional immuno-regulatory mechanism(s) underlie tumor immune&#xD;
      escape. Indeed, research shows that the TIM-3 pathway cooperates with PD-1 to maximize the&#xD;
      suppression of effector TILs as well as promote resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore,&#xD;
      TIM-3 represents an ideal target with the potential to significantly improve and/or extend&#xD;
      the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 therapy to a greater number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIM-3 and PD-1 function as immune checkpoint receptors in the overlapping regulation of&#xD;
      immune tolerance and have been shown to be overexpressed on the tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TILs) from participant samples of various solid tumors including, but not&#xD;
      limited to non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Subsequently, the activation of&#xD;
      TIM-3 and PD-1 represent TILs from both participants or animals across solid tumor types with&#xD;
      the most exhausted immunophenotype (ie, cytokine expression, proliferation etc.), which can&#xD;
      be reversed with combined blockade of TIM-3 and PD 1. The overlap in expression and function&#xD;
      indicates that TIM-3 and PD-1 cooperate to promote effector cell exhaustion which may impede&#xD;
      an effective antitumor immune response. Based upon the overlapping expression profiles and&#xD;
      immuno-regulatory functions, the improved in vivo antitumor effects, as well as the potential&#xD;
      for TIM-3 mediated adaptive resistance, there is strong scientific rationale to evaluate the&#xD;
      antitumor effects derived from the combined blockade of TIM-3 and PD-1 in advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. Accordingly, this study will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of BGB-A425&#xD;
      (anti TIM-3) in combination with tislelizumab (anti PD-1) in participants with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trial. Phase 1&#xD;
      will determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for the combination of BGB-A425 and&#xD;
      tislelizumab. Phase 2 will continue to evaluate the safety but also focus on the efficacy of&#xD;
      the combination in select tumor types.&#xD;
