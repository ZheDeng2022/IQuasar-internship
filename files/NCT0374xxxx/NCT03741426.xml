    <textblock>
      Evaluation of proof of mechanism with relation to ktrans and/or CD8 count when 3 different&#xD;
      IMPs are given as monotherapy or as combination therapy. These would be administered in the&#xD;
      &quot;window of opportunity&quot;, prior to nephrectomy in surgically resectable renal cell cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, multi-arm, multicentre, non-randomised, proof-of-mechanism (single and combination&#xD;
      IMPs) trial using a Bayesian adaptive design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-centre trial. 2 centres initially planned - this may be reduced or increased in order&#xD;
      to recruit the required number of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to sixty (60) patients with surgically resectable renal cell cancer (Stage M0/M1). Up to&#xD;
      twelve (12) participants will be registered for each of the single treatment arms and up to&#xD;
      twenty (20) participants for the combination treatment arm(s) as per the Bayesian adaptive&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial duration consists of a 28 day screening period, a minimum of 2 weeks oral IMP&#xD;
      (Olaparib and/or Cediranib) treatment or a single dose of durvalumab alone or in combination&#xD;
      in the window-of-opportunity period prior to surgery (nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy)&#xD;
      performed as standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue oral IMP treatment up until surgery (stopping when indicated for&#xD;
      surgical safety reasons). As such treatment duration will be variable and an optional 21 day&#xD;
      telephone assessment will take place for patients who remain on IMP. Patients will then be&#xD;
      reviewed in the surgical follow-up clinic at 6 weeks and 3 months post-surgery as standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients on monotherapy or combination Olaparib and Cediranib IMP, response will be&#xD;
      measured using DCE-MRI (Ktrans), defining reduced tumour capillary permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients on monotherapy Durvalumab, or combination Olaparib and Durvalumab, response will&#xD;
      be measured using CD8 positive T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional safety outcomes will be assessed, along with the tumour response and various&#xD;
      biological measures that would indicate drug mechanistic response.&#xD;
