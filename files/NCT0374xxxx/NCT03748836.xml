  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK--the amount of study&#xD;
      drug in the blood), pharmacodynamics (PD), how the study drug affects the body) and&#xD;
      immunogenicity (how the study drug affects the immune system) of single and multiple doses&#xD;
      and dose levels of an investigational drug called ALPN-101.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      AIS-A01 is a phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. It will be conducted at a single center and will enroll approximately 104&#xD;
      participants. The study will have 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part A, participants will receive a single dose of study drug or placebo. Multiple&#xD;
           dose levels of ALPN-101 will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part B, participants will receive 4 doses of ALPN-101 or placebo--1 dose each week&#xD;
           for 4 weeks. Multiple dose levels of ALPN-101 will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each Part, safety assessments will be performed throughout the dosing and follow-up&#xD;
      periods, and multiple PK and PD samples will be collected.&#xD;
