  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the research is to discover how to reduce chronic disease health&#xD;
      disparities among older (ages 35-70) low-income African-American men more effectively. To&#xD;
      achieve this goal, we are conducting formative exploratory research with middle-aged,&#xD;
      low-income African-American men; testing two versions of a novel community-developed&#xD;
      intervention, MOCHA and MOCHA+ (where MOCHA+ is a modified version of the &quot;standard&quot; MOCHA&#xD;
      program, modified to incorporate narrative communication strategies); and advancing the&#xD;
      development of a Minority Stress Model through statistical modelling to test the relative&#xD;
      contributions of hypothesized explanatory variables identified in the formative research&#xD;
      phase of the project.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-income, African-American men continue to be disproportionately burdened by chronic&#xD;
      diseases and associated morbidities and mortalities. Primary modifiable and interrelated&#xD;
      causes of chronic disease include high levels of stress, low levels of physical activity, and&#xD;
      malnutrition. There are few demonstrated effective, preventive interventions that are&#xD;
      culturally relevant and gender appropriate for low-income, African-American men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local community concerns about health disparities led to a year-long series of community-wide&#xD;
      discussions and planning that resulted in the creation of Men of Color Health Awareness&#xD;
      (MOCHA) project. Started in 2010, in an unusual public-private partnership between the YMCA&#xD;
      and the state Department of Public Health, MOCHA's mission is to improve the health and&#xD;
      wellbeing of men of color in Springfield, MA and surrounding areas. MOCHA runs a 12-week&#xD;
      program with 15-20 men per cohort to decrease chronic disease vulnerability and bolster&#xD;
      resilience among low-income, African-American men, by addressing exercise, eating habits, and&#xD;
      stress stemming from impoverished economic conditions, racial and class discrimination, and&#xD;
      gender role strain. The MOCHA Steering Committee contacted a group of health disparities&#xD;
      researchers at the University of Massachusetts School of Public Health and Health Sciences in&#xD;
      2012, requesting assistance in documenting the impact of MOCHA on the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 350 men ages 40-60 years have completed the MOCHA program and preliminary data indicate&#xD;
      that the program has decreased weight, body fat percentage, and systolic blood pressure;&#xD;
      increased self-reported fitness and vitality scores; and decreased mean stress scores on the&#xD;
      Cohen Perceived Stress scale by 19%. Based on these preliminary data, we propose to&#xD;
      rigorously test MOCHA program effectiveness and to identify the causal pathways through which&#xD;
      it impacts outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the MOCHA Steering Committee has expressed strong interest in strengthening the&#xD;
      quality of their program, by incorporating narrative strategies for communicating key health&#xD;
      concepts and information into the existing program. Current research of the investigators&#xD;
      provides strong evidence that culture-centered narrative strategies are more effective in&#xD;
      producing positive health effects than didactic presentations. We have pilot tested the&#xD;
      feasibility of developing digital stories with the MOCHA Steering Committee, and with this&#xD;
      proposal, we are mutually excited about the possibility of integrating narrative&#xD;
      communication strategies into the MOCHA program, henceforth called MOCHA+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the effectiveness of the existing MOCHA chronic disease prevention program in&#xD;
      decreasing stress and compare its effectiveness with a new to-be-developed MOCHA+ program&#xD;
      (that integrates narrative communication strategies), we propose to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial with three arms: MOCHA, MOCHA + and wait-list control comparison&#xD;
      groups. Using a community-based participatory research approach, the three specific aims of&#xD;
      the proposed research are thus to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Further refine a Minority Stress Model developed by Co-PI Graham, to capture and explain&#xD;
           the dynamic, reciprocal and synergistic interactions of factors affecting the health of&#xD;
           low-income African-American men;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. (a) Determine the effectiveness of the MOCHA program in decreasing stress among&#xD;
           low-income African-American men, as measured by both self-report (Cohen's Perceived&#xD;
           Stress Scale) and bio-physiological measures of cortisol (assessed in hair samples); and&#xD;
           (b) Determine whether the MOCHA+ program is significantly more effective than the MOCHA&#xD;
           program in decreasing stress among low-income African-American men, on these same&#xD;
           measures;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the effects of the MOCHA and MOCHA+ interventions on mediating variables along&#xD;
           hypothesized causal pathways identified through intervention mapping and the&#xD;
           construction of a logic model, based on the Minority Stress Model finalized in achieving&#xD;
           Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will proceed in two stages. During the first 18 months, phase one of&#xD;
      the study will focus on (a) formative research designed to further elaborate the minority&#xD;
      stress model and (b) the incorporation of narrative communications strategies into the MOCHA+&#xD;
      intervention. In phase two, we will recruit 240 low-income African-American men between 35-65&#xD;
      years of age over a three-year period to participate in a randomized controlled trial, with&#xD;
      three arms: MOCHA, MOCHA+, or wait-list control. The primary research endpoint is&#xD;
      bio-physiological assessment of the ELISA cortisol hair-test (average hormone levels over the&#xD;
      past 3 months), administered at pre, post, and 3 month follow-up, as well as self-reported&#xD;
      stress levels using Cohen's Perceived Stress scale. Secondary outcomes include the&#xD;
      bio-physiological indicators of blood pressure and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of MOCHA in reducing stress and&#xD;
      whether it can be further strengthened by introducing narrative communication strategies. The&#xD;
      results of the proposed research will contribute to the development of an enhanced&#xD;
      theoretical model of factors affecting low-income African-American male health and to the&#xD;
      evidence base of effective interventions aimed at chronic disease prevention and control&#xD;
      programs in this population.&#xD;
