  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-component therapeutic consisting of FCX-013 and veledimex for the treatment of&#xD;
      localized scleroderma (or morphea). The first component, FCX-013, is autologous human&#xD;
      fibroblasts genetically-modified using lentivirus and encoded for matrix metalloproteinase 1&#xD;
      (MMP-1), a protein responsible for breaking down collagen. FCX-013 is designed to be injected&#xD;
      under the skin at the location of the fibrotic lesions where the genetically-modified&#xD;
      fibroblast cells will produce MMP-1 to break down excess collagen accumulation. With the&#xD;
      FCX-013 therapy, the patient will take an oral compound (Veledimex) to induce MMP-1 protein&#xD;
      expression from the injected cells. Once the fibrosis is resolved, the patient will stop&#xD;
      taking the oral compound which will stop further MMP-1 production from the injected cells.&#xD;
      FCX-013 plus veledimex is being developed in anticipation of improving skin function in&#xD;
      patients by resolving fibrotic lesions and normalizing dermal collagen production&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Castle Creek is developing a two-component therapeutic product for the treatment of moderate&#xD;
      to severe localized scleroderma (morphea). The first component is FCX-013, an autologous&#xD;
      genetically modified human dermal fibroblast (GM-HDFs) cell product that is genetically&#xD;
      modified with a lentiviral vector (LV) to express human matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1).&#xD;
      MMP1 is also known as interstitial collagenase or fibroblast collagenase and is an enzyme&#xD;
      that under normal physiological conditions breaks down the extracellular matrix.&#xD;
      Specifically, MMP1 breaks down interstitial collagens, types I, II and III. In addition, the&#xD;
      FCX-013 cells are also transduced with genetic constructs that encode the RheoSwitch&#xD;
      Therapeutic System® (RTS®) an inducible promotor system that in the presence of a small&#xD;
      molecule activator ligand controls expression of the MMP1 gene. The RTS® is activated to&#xD;
      express MMP1 by the oral administration of the small molecule component. The purpose of this&#xD;
      open-label single arm Phase 1/2 study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      FCX-013 plus veledimex.&#xD;
