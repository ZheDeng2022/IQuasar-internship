  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of spot-scanning based&#xD;
      hypofractionated proton radiotherapy for the treatment of intermediate and low risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer. The treatment effectiveness is defined as freedom from biochemical failure. Treatment&#xD;
      safety will be documented with acute and late morbidity assessments. Dose volume&#xD;
      relationships for late side effects in organs at risk surrounding the prostate will be&#xD;
      calculated from the dose volume histogram parameters assessed during treatment planning.&#xD;
      Patient assessed Quality of life data including sexual function will be collected to increase&#xD;
      our understanding how the reduction of normal tissue irradiation with proton therapy with&#xD;
      subsequent decrease in functional impairments will overall affect the patient's life.&#xD;

    <description>Change of quality of life and sexual function from Baseline following proton therapy. The Prostate cancer-specific Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC-26) will be used. EPIC is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. EPIC-26 was developed as a short-form version of the full EPIC. This version contains 26 item and the same 5 domains as the full version of EPIC: Urinary Incontinence, Urinary Irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better quality of life.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathological (histologically) proven diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical stage T1-T2b&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prostate specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 20 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gleason Score ≤ 7&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically negative lymph nodes evaluated by imaging (pelvic +/- abdominal CT or MRI&#xD;
             scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with lymph nodes &gt; 1.0 cm maximum diameter requires further studies to&#xD;
             address eligibility. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT is recommended for lymph&#xD;
             nodes &gt; 1.0 cm. Positive PET-CT indicates malignant involvement. Hence, the patient&#xD;
             will be staged as &quot;high-risk&quot; and therefore declared ineligible for study&#xD;
             participation. Negative PET-CT in lymph nodes 1.0-1,5 cm indicates non-involvement and&#xD;
             thus eligibility. Negative PET-CT in lymph nodes &gt; 1.5 cm is equivocal and requires&#xD;
             additional work-up, preferably by biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older. There is no upper age limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able to provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to complete the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite&#xD;
             (EPIC) Questionnaire to assess Quality of Life.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously initiated Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of chronic bowel diseases may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) performed for&#xD;
             urinary retention may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy to the pelvic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior prostate cancer therapy such as: prostatectomy, cryotherapy or hyperthermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy) for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regional lymph node involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) &gt; 20&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hip prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second invasive malignancy (except of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin in situ) if not controlled within last two years.&#xD;
