  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically significant arrhythmia and is&#xD;
      associated with increased rates of stroke, heart failure, mortality, hospitalization, and&#xD;
      cognitive decline. Approximately one third of ischemic strokes are attributable to either&#xD;
      previously known or newly detected AF at the time of stroke. Many AF episodes are&#xD;
      asymptomatic and stroke is the first manifestation of AF in at least 25% of AF-related&#xD;
      strokes. Anticoagulation for AF leads to a reduction in stroke to levels similar to matched&#xD;
      individuals without AF. Therefore, identifying AF in an earlier asymptomatic state (i.e.&#xD;
      screening for silent AF), with subsequent initiation of anticoagulation in at-risk&#xD;
      individuals, may decrease the risk of future thromboembolic events. The availability of&#xD;
      inexpensive smartphone-based or handheld ECG devices that rapidly acquire a cardiac rhythm&#xD;
      strip of quality comparable to a traditional 12-lead ECG have markedly enhanced the&#xD;
      feasibility of AF screening. Native Americans have a high prevalence of diabetes and higher&#xD;
      incidence of stroke than whites and blacks. Our central hypothesis is that screening for AF&#xD;
      using a single time point, 30-second iPhone-based ECG recording over 2 weeks will result in&#xD;
      identification of silent AF in a significant number of individuals at risk for stroke&#xD;
      compared to routine care (no screening) and will thus lead to improved outcomes through&#xD;
      initiation of anticoagulation. The aim of this study is to screen for AF in Native Americans&#xD;
      who are seen at the Absentee Shawnee Tribal clinic using a smartphone-based ECG device.&#xD;
      Individuals who are at least 50 years old and have no prior history of AF will be eligible&#xD;
      for enrollment in the study. Eligible participants will receive a 30-second ECG recording&#xD;
      during their visit at the Absentee Shawnee Tribal clinic. The device has an algorithm for&#xD;
      diagnosis of AF, which is 98% sensitive and 97% specific. A cardiologist will overread the&#xD;
      tracings that are diagnosed by AF by the device. Those confirmed to have AF will be referred&#xD;
      to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management. The clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      those who are found to have AF will be compared with those who are not, in order to identify&#xD;
      risk factors for AF. Newly diagnosed AF using this method is expected to be approximately&#xD;
      2.5%. We aim to include a total of 1,500 participants over 12 months. The proposed study will&#xD;
      provide the basis for the design of further intervention studies using mobile technology to&#xD;
      improve the health of Native Americans and other minority populations. In light of the high&#xD;
      prevalence of risk factors for AF in Native Americans and the association of silent AF with&#xD;
      stroke, this novel approach for AF screening has the potential to impact clinical practice&#xD;
      and improve health outcomes among a large number of individuals.&#xD;
