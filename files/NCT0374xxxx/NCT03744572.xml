      This pilot study is to investigate if a lesion preparation strategy with Phoenix atherectomy&#xD;
      before DCB (drug coated balloon) usage in patients with PAD (peripheral artery disease)&#xD;
      Rutherford Stage 4-5 and mild/moderate/severe calcium can improve outcomes including patency&#xD;
      and limb salvage and evaluate safety and performance of the combination therapy&#xD;
