    <textblock>
      This is an Expanded Access program (EAP), sponsored by WideTrial for the treatment of&#xD;
      critical limb ischemia (CLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Widetrial, an Expanded Access specialist, has arranged to supply participating sites with&#xD;
      PLX-PAD for CLI patients who cannot participate in the ongoing research trial and who seek&#xD;
      exploratory treatment options. This program includes FDA-authorized cost recovery, meaning&#xD;
      payment is required to cover a portion of the costs of delivering product and complying with&#xD;
      regulatory obligations.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult male or female subjects between ages 45 to 99 years of age at the time of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of PAD due to atherosclerosis at the stage of CLI, with&#xD;
             minor tissue loss up to the ankle level (ulcer/s and/or necrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ankle pressure (AP) ≤70 mmHg or toe pressure (TP) ≤50 mmHg in the index leg or&#xD;
             transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) ≤30 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject unsuitable for revascularization (by any method) in the index leg based on&#xD;
             unfavorable risk-benefit assessment of the physician investigator. Unsuitability to&#xD;
             revascularization should be based on any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Anatomic considerations as: inappropriate target artery, diffuse/extensive tibial&#xD;
                  and/or peroneal artery lesions, inadequate distal run-off.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Technical considerations as: inappropriate bypass conduit, failed recent&#xD;
                  revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Medical considerations: subject's comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Signed informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects are not eligible for the ongoing phase III study with PLX-PAD in CLI&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Evidence of active localized osteomyelitis secondary to contiguous focus of&#xD;
                  infection, unless amputation is expected within 1 month post PLX-PAD&#xD;
                  administration. In case of osteomyelitis, patients must be treated with&#xD;
                  antibiotics during screening and PLX-PAD administration or as long as there is&#xD;
                  evidence of active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subject on renal replacement therapy or with eGFR &lt;15 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Current treatment with high dose systemic steroids (prednisone equivalent &gt;7.5&#xD;
                  mg/day) or topical steroids on the index leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. History of autologous bone marrow transplantation (if not due to hematologic&#xD;
                  malignancy) or solid organ transplantation, clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Immunocompromised subjects due to disease for any reason, including&#xD;

&#xD;
               9. Past drug or alcohol abuse. Known history of cancer is eligible if occurred&#xD;
                  beyond 2 years before screening&#xD;
