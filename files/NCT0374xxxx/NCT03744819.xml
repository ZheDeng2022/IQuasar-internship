  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore potential biomarkers for prediction of therapeutic outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors after radiotherapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients pathologically confirmed with solid tumors that requires radiotherapy or surgery&#xD;
      will be recruited to this study. Tumor samples were obtained from patients underwent surgery&#xD;
      to establish the baseline status of biomarker assessed. Peripheral and microbiota will also&#xD;
      be collected before and after surgery. For patients undergoing radiotherapy, tumor biopsy as&#xD;
      well as collection of blood samples and microbiota will be performed during the course of&#xD;
      treatment. These biological specimens will be used for assessment of tumor phenotypes and for&#xD;
      exploration of potential biomarkers that could predict the tumor response to therapeutics and&#xD;
      prognsis in patients with solid tumors.&#xD;
