      &quot;This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre study to investigate&#xD;
      safety and tolerability and to provide pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics information of&#xD;
      orally inhaled multiple doses (80 mg, 160 mg or 320 mg) of the nebulised neutrophil elastase&#xD;
      inhibitor POL6014 in patients with Cystic Fibrosis. The controlled inhalation will occur via&#xD;

             presentation and laboratory criteria, more specifically, sweat or genetic testing&#xD;
             (i.e., presence of the most common genetic defect ΔF 508 or any other mutation that&#xD;
             can produce CF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient should confirm to produce frequently spontaneous sputum with a frequency of&#xD;
             over 3 expectorates per day. Patient should be capable of producing a spontaneous&#xD;
             sputum sample at screening (within a time range of approx. 3h during the screening&#xD;
             visit).&#xD;
&#xD;

             ECG assessment, pulmonary function testing (PFT), and clinical laboratory results.&#xD;
             Deviations of clinical laboratory results can be accepted if they are in accordance&#xD;
             with the diagnosis of CF and CF-related diseases, supposed they do not indicate a&#xD;
             clinical state that is expected to constitute a significant additional risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must have an FEV1 ≥ 40% of predicted value at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Body mass index (BMI) between 16.5 and 30 (both inclusive).&#xD;

             the eFlow® nebuliser device with a commercially available saline solution at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit once informed consent has been obtained).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. For patients with routine courses of inhaled antibiotics, patients should agree to&#xD;
             start routine course of inhaled antibiotic cycle on the same day or not earlier than 3&#xD;
             days before IMP administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient with unstable lung disease, as defined by a change in treatment regimen during&#xD;
             the preceding two (2) weeks, or a significant new finding on chest radiography (such&#xD;
             as, but not limited to, pneumothorax, lobar/segmental collapse or consolidation), or&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, patient with a decline in pulmonary status within&#xD;
             the last 12 months not considered a part of the usual, chronic progression of CF lung&#xD;
             disease. Routine cyclic antibiotic treatment regimens including &quot;off/on&quot; cycles are&#xD;
             not considered to be changes to treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has had an exacerbation of respiratory symptoms within the past four (4) weeks&#xD;
             before screening/randomization that required initiation of a new or altered&#xD;
             respiratory therapy, and, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient has not&#xD;
             returned to a stable level of health&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient with a history of lung transplantation.&#xD;

             to admission to an emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Participation in another clinical study with any investigational medicinal product&#xD;
             (IMP) or device, before randomisation, within an interval of 5 half-lives (minimum 4&#xD;
             weeks) from the last use of that investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Blood or plasma donation of more than 500 mL during the previous month before&#xD;
