    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of open-label exposure of&#xD;
      gNO in patients with NTM lung disease. Subjects will receive the study drug by inhaling&#xD;
      through a nasal mask. Subjects will be treated for 3 weeks (5 days per week) and followed&#xD;
      monthly for 3 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Reduction in Semiquantitative Cultures</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 15 from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Semiquantitative Culture Score is an assessment of bacterial burden with a lower score suggesting a lesser bacterial burden. The Semiquantitative Culture Score at Day 15 was compared to baseline, and a reduction in the Semiquantitative Culture Score suggests a reduced bacterial burden with treatment.&#xD;
Cultures were reported as positive if growth occurs in broth medium only; growth on broth medium plus solid medium cultures with countable colonies will be reported as 0-49 colonies, 1+; solid medium growth with 50-99 colonies, 2+; solid medium growth with 100-199 colonies; 3+, solid medium growth with 200-299 colonies; and 4+, solid medium growth with at least 300 colonies. For data analysis, each culture was scored as follows: 0, no growth in broth or solid medium; 1, broth medium growth only; 2, countable colonies (&lt;50 colonies) on solid medium; and 3-6, 1+ to 4+ growth on solid medium, respectively.</description>

    <description>This is a proof-of-concept study in which all subjects will be treated with gNO (i.e. no control) to see if there can be a microbiological effect by conversion to negative sputum cultures and how long that effect can be sustained following treatment.&#xD;
Participants will be treated for 3 weeks (5 days per week), Monday through Friday, and followed monthly for 3 months.&#xD;
The treatment period includes a physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, echocardiogram, spirometry test, sputum sample, questionnaires, and the inhalation gas treatment. During the inhalation gas treatment, participants will wear a face mask (similar to an oxygen mask) and will be given nitric oxide gas through the participants nose for three treatments with fifty minutes each time. They will then be followed up monthly during the Follow-up period with tests that include a physical exam and questionnaires.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are &gt;18 years of age and able to provide informed consent.&#xD;

        Subjects have NTM lung disease as defined by each of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sputum cultures positive for NTM (MAC or M abscessus) Radiologic studies that demonstrate&#xD;
        features consistent with disease such as nodular bronchiectasis and/or cavities Symptoms&#xD;
        consistent with disease including respiratory (e.g. cough, sputum production, hemoptysis,&#xD;
        chest pain) and constitutional (e.g. fevers, night sweats, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias,&#xD;
        weight loss) Subjects are able to produce sputum for culture (either spontaneous or&#xD;
        induced).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects have a history of persistently positive sputum cultures for NTM defined as &gt;4&#xD;

        treatment can be enrolled if they have been on a stable anti-NTM regimen for at least 6&#xD;
        months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Initiation of new chronic therapy within 4 weeks prior to screening Use of drugs known to&#xD;
        increase methemoglobin (see 12.2.7) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any of the following abnormal lab values at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        6-GPD deficiency Hemoglobin &lt;10g/dl Platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3 Prothrombin time&#xD;
        international ratio (INR) &gt;1.5 Abnormal liver function defined as any two of the following&#xD;
        ALT &gt;3x ULN AST &gt;3x ULN ALP &gt;3x ULN GGT &gt;3x ULN&#xD;

        contraception: abstinence, hormonal birth control, intrauterine device, or barrier method&#xD;
        plus a spermicidal agent) Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening&#xD;

        screening Any condition that the Investigator believes would interfere with the intent of&#xD;
        this study or would make participation not in the best interest of the subject.&#xD;

The treatment period includes a physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, echocardiogram, spirometry test, sputum sample, questionnaires, and the inhalation gas treatment.

        <title>Number of Participants With a Reduction in Semiquantitative Cultures</title>
        <description>Semiquantitative Culture Score is an assessment of bacterial burden with a lower score suggesting a lesser bacterial burden. The Semiquantitative Culture Score at Day 15 was compared to baseline, and a reduction in the Semiquantitative Culture Score suggests a reduced bacterial burden with treatment.&#xD;
Cultures were reported as positive if growth occurs in broth medium only; growth on broth medium plus solid medium cultures with countable colonies will be reported as 0-49 colonies, 1+; solid medium growth with 50-99 colonies, 2+; solid medium growth with 100-199 colonies; 3+, solid medium growth with 200-299 colonies; and 4+, solid medium growth with at least 300 colonies. For data analysis, each culture was scored as follows: 0, no growth in broth or solid medium; 1, broth medium growth only; 2, countable colonies (&lt;50 colonies) on solid medium; and 3-6, 1+ to 4+ growth on solid medium, respectively.</description>
