  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants receive a single dose of the&#xD;
      meningococcal serogroup A-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine, MenAfriVac, when they reach at&#xD;
      least 9 months of age. However, this leaves a window of susceptibility in early life when the&#xD;
      incidence of invasive serogroup A disease, and the case fatality rate for the condition is at&#xD;
      its highest. This study will investigate the potential role of administering the vaccine to&#xD;
      expectant mothers at the start of the third trimester of pregnancy in order to protect their&#xD;
      subsequent borne infants. Antibody transfer to the newborn and subsequent antibody decay will&#xD;
      be measured. The level of protection against neonatal tetanus provided by the tetanus toxoid&#xD;
      component of the vaccine, when compared to the routine dose of tetanus administered in&#xD;
      pregnancy will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a separate exploratory study, the follow-up of the cohort planned will also be used to&#xD;
      investigate the effects that the development of the gastrointestinal microbiome, and any&#xD;
      perturbations in the microbiome caused by antibiotic use, have on immune development and&#xD;
      vaccine immunogenicity over the first 10 months of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MenAfriVac is a Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A Men A polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine which was developed within the space of just nine years through the&#xD;
      Meningitis Vaccine Project. Although the effectiveness of the vaccine is well established,&#xD;
      the optimum strategy for maintaining protection following the mass vaccination campaigns has&#xD;
      yet to be determined. However, in mathematical models, even considering a coverage rate of as&#xD;
      low as 60 percent, the routine administration of MenAfriVac nine-months results in a lower&#xD;
      annual disease incidence than regular campaigns targeting one to four year old children.&#xD;
      Thus, the introduction of a single dose of MenAfriVac® at nine to 18 months in meningitis&#xD;
      belt has subsequently been recommended by the WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important limitation of such a regimen is that infants are left without direct protection&#xD;
      against Men A infection up to the age of at least nine months. While not classically&#xD;
      considered to be a disease of early infancy, the incidence of invasive Men A infection is as&#xD;
      high or higher in this age group as compared to the incidence in older children and the case&#xD;
      fatality rate is also at its peak under the age of one. Recent mass vaccination campaigns&#xD;
      rapidly achieved exceptionally high levels of coverage across the entire one to 29 year old&#xD;
      adult population and have resulted in herd protection and reduced level of invasive disease&#xD;
      in those under one year of age. However, such levels of herd protection cannot be assumed&#xD;
      following routine scheduling at nine months of age and thus alternative strategies both to&#xD;
      protect the infant up to nine months of age and also to boost herd protection in the&#xD;
      population warrant exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal immunization represents a potentially attractive option with both regards. The&#xD;
      safety of the vaccine when administered in pregnancy has been assessed through comparing the&#xD;
      rate of safety events in 1730 expectant mothers immunized during campaigns in the Navrongo&#xD;
      region of Ghana, and their subsequent born infants with the rates in the women who did not&#xD;
      receive the vaccine during the same campaign (n=919) and those vaccinated the previous year&#xD;
      (n=3551). No evidence of any safety concerns were reported. These data support current WHO&#xD;
      technical guidance which considers it safe to include pregnant and lactating women within&#xD;
      mass vaccination campaigns. Although the safety profile is reassuring, there are currently no&#xD;
      data on the immunogenicity of MenAfriVac in pregnancy or on the transplacental transfer of&#xD;
      Men A specific antibodies to subsequent borne infants. In addition, the comparability of the&#xD;
      tetanus toxoid specific seroprotection provided to the newborn through the tetanus toxoid&#xD;
      carrier protein and through the standard tetanus toxoid antenatal booster needs to be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the Protecting from Pneumococcus in Early Life (PROPEL) trial (NCT02628886) trial a&#xD;
      group of 200 expectant mothers were randomized into the control group and received tetanus&#xD;
      toxoid (and a 0.9% sodium chloride injection to maintain blinding) at 28 to 34 weeks&#xD;
      gestation. This group will serve as a control group for the MenAfriVac vaccinated mothers who&#xD;
      will be recruited here using an otherwise identical protocol. Those mothers confirmed to be&#xD;
      eligible (n = 100) will receive a dose of MenAfriVac at 28 to 34 weeks of gestation and will&#xD;
      subsequently followed up using the same approach as undertaken in the PROPEL trial. Their&#xD;
      subsequent born infants will also be followed until nine months of age in the same way.&#xD;
      Maternal and cord blood samples will be collected at delivery with peripheral infant samples&#xD;
      being obtained at delivery, 8 and 20 weeks and at 9 months plus 9 months 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      meningococcal serogroup A and tetanus toxoid specific seroprotection in the infants of&#xD;
      mothers vaccinated with MenAfriVac will be compared to the seroprotection in those mothers in&#xD;
      the control group for the main randomized trial who will only have received tetanus toxoid in&#xD;
      pregnancy. All safety procedures will be undertaken in the same way for comparability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most mothers in the study will have been immunized in the national MenAfriVac campaign in the&#xD;
      Gambia in Nov/Dec 2013, so the controls will not be naïve, and the MenAfriVac arm will be&#xD;
      receiving a second dose of the vaccine. This reflects the likely situation were maternal&#xD;
      immunization to be recommended in the future. Information on prior immunization history will&#xD;
      be collected and assessed within the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory nested study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study provides an opportunity to monitor the development of the intestinal microbiome&#xD;
      from birth to 10 months of age and to assess the effects that any antibiotics, administered&#xD;
      in early life for clinical indication, have on this development. Furthermore, to study the&#xD;
      downstream effects of distinct microbial profiles on baseline and post-vaccination&#xD;
      transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles and immune cell phenotypes, and on the serological&#xD;
      responses to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gastrointestinal microbiome is at its most dynamic in early life from the point of first&#xD;
      colonization at birth. It is also the period during which parenteral empirical antibiotics&#xD;
      are most likely to be administered given the difficulty in excluding invasive bacterial&#xD;
      diseases at this age. Thus, early infancy provides the best possible opportunity to study the&#xD;
      effects of the microbiome, including of any disruption in the microbiome driven by antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy, on baseline (unstimulated) and post-vaccination transcriptomic and metabolomic&#xD;
      profiles, immune cell phenotypes and serological response to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This component of the study is observational and exploratory. All 100 infants will be&#xD;
      administered the routine vaccines in the national schedule due at the time points they are&#xD;
      routinely given. Associations between the development of the microbiome with transcriptional&#xD;
      and metabolomics signatures, cellular and serological responses to vaccination will be made&#xD;
      within group.&#xD;

             to be HIV or HBV positive during screening*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive result for syphilis infection on laboratory testing*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any vaccine during the current pregnancy or plans to receive any non-study&#xD;
             vaccines during the current pregnancy (tetanus toxoid vaccination is not an exclusion&#xD;
             and vaccines given during national campaigns if applicable will not generally be&#xD;
             exclusions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition judged to significantly increase the risks to either the mother or&#xD;
             the infant within the current pregnancy (including relevant history from previous&#xD;
             pregnancies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions to previous vaccines or history&#xD;
             of anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions in previous offspring (if applicable) *&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any blood product including human immunoglobulins at any stage during the&#xD;
             current pregnancy or plan to receive any blood products during the period of trial&#xD;
             participation (receipt or blood products in an emergency or for obstetric reasons will&#xD;
             not represent a protocol deviation given such situations are unplanned)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of immunosuppressive or immuno-modulatory medication at any stage during the&#xD;
             current pregnancy or plan to receive any such medication during the period or trial&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically suspected or confirmed congenital or acquired clotting or bleeding&#xD;
             disorders or the current receipt of medications known to alter clotting or bleeding*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current malaria infection (on the day of vaccination)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant signs or symptoms of acute illness, significant&#xD;
             abnormalities in vital signs, an axillary temperature of &gt; 37.5°C or any recorded&#xD;
             fever (&gt; 37.5°C) in the preceding 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2 or more symptoms (nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, fatigue and myalgia) rated&#xD;
             as grade 2 and clinically significant on the maternal systemic reactogenicity scale&#xD;
             (Table 5) present at baseline on the day of vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        In cases on uncertainly, the clinical significance of any particular complaint will be&#xD;
        judged by the PI, in discussion with other members of the clinical trial team. The safety&#xD;
        of the expectant mother and unborn infant will always represent the key criteria with this&#xD;
        regard. The basis of such decisions will be documented in the participant notes maintained&#xD;
        by the clinical trial team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the case of an acute illness, including malaria, documented fever or abnormalities in&#xD;
        vital signs, and also when 2 or more grade 2 systemic reactogenicity symptoms are present,&#xD;
        the potential participant will not be deemed to be a screen failure and thus will not be&#xD;
        permanently excluded from participation (unless the assessing clinician has reason be&#xD;
        believe the problem will persist). Under these circumstances the expectant mother will be&#xD;
        termed a temporary exclusion and will be re-screened at an appropriate interval for&#xD;
        eligibility (a minimum of 24 hours in the case of a recorded fever and otherwise according&#xD;
        to the clinical judgement of the clinician). If 34 weeks gestation passes during this&#xD;
        period of observation, if any other inclusion criteria is no longer met (e.g. the potential&#xD;
        participant reaches her 41st birthday) or if another exclusion criteria is met (e.g. the&#xD;
        potential subject develops pre-eclampsia), the participant will be deemed to be a screen&#xD;
        failure. Repeat serological testing for HIV, Hepatitis B and syphilis is not required at&#xD;
        re-screening unless the PI has specific reason to believe that a potential participant's&#xD;
        status may have changed in the interval since the original test. A repeat haemoglobin level&#xD;
        is not required although may be undertaken if judged to be warranted on the basis of&#xD;
        clinical assessment.&#xD;
