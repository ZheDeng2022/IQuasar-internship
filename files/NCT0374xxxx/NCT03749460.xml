  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well nivolumab and ipilimumab works&#xD;
      when given together with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients with&#xD;
      salivary gland cancers. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special&#xD;
      equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This&#xD;
      method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to&#xD;
      normal tissue. Giving nivolumab and ipilimumab and SBRT may work better in treating patients&#xD;
      with advanced salivary gland cancers.&#xD;

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for up to 12 courses and then every 4 weeks for additional 8 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive ipilimumab IV&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning week 3, patients undergo 3&#xD;
      fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy every other day in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 8 or&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;
