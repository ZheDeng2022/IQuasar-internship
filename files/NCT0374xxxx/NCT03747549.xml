  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare acupuncture plus a prescribed home exercise program&#xD;
      versus a prescribed home exercise program alone to determine which has better outcomes at&#xD;
      improving pain relief and physical function in adult patients with insertional Achilles&#xD;
      tendinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to compare a combination of two standard of care treatments&#xD;
      (acupuncture plus a prescribed home exercise program) versus a single standard of care&#xD;
      treatment (a prescribed home exercise program) to determine which has better outcomes with&#xD;
      improving pain relief and physical function in patients with insertional Achilles&#xD;
      tendinopathy. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a significant improvement in&#xD;
      pain and functional outcomes, both acutely and over time, in the acupuncture plus a&#xD;
      prescribed home exercise program group versus the group performing a prescribed home exercise&#xD;
      program alone. The investigators will measure Achilles pain relief and physical function&#xD;
      immediately prior to treatment (baseline), immediately after the initial treatment at day 1,&#xD;
      2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks using the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment -&#xD;
      Achilles Questionnaire (VISA-A). After 3 months, patients with continuing pain in the&#xD;
      non-acupuncture arm will be given the option to crossover to the acupuncture arm of the study&#xD;
      for an additional 12 weeks of treatment with the subject's concurrence.&#xD;

      Screening Visit (research-related):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain and document signed Informed Consent document and HIPAA Authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review past medical history in Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application&#xD;
           (AHLTA) to verify the inclusion/exclusion criteria including previous encounter, vital&#xD;
           signs review, co-morbidities, demographics, and problems list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record: Date of birth, age, gender, race, ethnicity, DoD ID number, name of standard of&#xD;
           care medications (over-the-counter and prescription), current email address (to be used&#xD;
           for scheduling), height (in inches), weight (in pounds),history of prior injury to the&#xD;
           injured leg, and note any prior acupuncture received for Achilles tendinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the subject is an active duty member, the investigators will ask: Have you or are you&#xD;
           currently on a fitness restriction for Achilles tendinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If so, what are/were the dates of the restriction?&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ There are several standard of care treatments for Achilles tendinopathy which include&#xD;
      physical therapy as well as a prescribed home exercise program. The investigators will&#xD;
      standardize what patients in this study are receiving by having all subjects follow a&#xD;
      standard home exercise program defined as the Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy Eccentric&#xD;
      Training Protocol and have them discontinue any formal physical therapy or other therapies&#xD;
      when entering this study. Regular physical activity such as exercise is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 research treatment groups using block&#xD;
      randomization with repeated measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Acupuncture (needles will be placed at BL 60, BL 61, KI 3, KI 4 with needles&#xD;
           directed into the Achilles tendon. Needles inserted until a firm catch of the needle&#xD;
           entering the tendon was appreciated. Energy (a small electrical current) is placed from&#xD;
           KI 3(-) KI 4(+) and BL 61 (-) BL 60(+) at 30 Hz for 15min) plus the prescribed home&#xD;
