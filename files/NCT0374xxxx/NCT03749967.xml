  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental illness rarely occurs as a single, easily categorized condition. Instead, multiple&#xD;
      disorders often co-occur. This complicates the treatment plan for many Veterans, especially&#xD;
      those suffering the most severe dysfunction. This also means that clinical research aimed at&#xD;
      one specific disorder may not be optimized to treat the realworld presentation of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric illness. The investigators propose in this study to develop a novel,&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation treatment that would promote rehabilitation for Veterans&#xD;
      suffering a wide range of emotional difficulties. More specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to up-regulate the brain circuitry that supports flexible problem solving and&#xD;
      contending with daily demands. Rather than focusing on reducing the symptoms of a specific&#xD;
      disorder to reduce the intrusion into daily life, the investigators propose to augment those&#xD;
      brain circuits that promote adaptive cognition and thus quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that because rTMS to dlPFC is targeting cognitive neurocircuitry&#xD;
      integral to adaptive cognitive functioning, promoting neuroplasticity in this network with&#xD;
      rTMS could be more precisely optimized to improve quality of life across psychosocial domains&#xD;
      and across neuropsychiatric presentations. The investigators postulate that through&#xD;
      up-regulating cognitive control circuitry with rTMS that an individual would have 1) enhanced&#xD;
      capacity for successfully contending with the shifting contingencies of daily life and 2)&#xD;
      improved ability to regulate intrusive affect and impulses. As a function of these processes&#xD;
      an individual is expected to experience reduced psychosocial impairment. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators propose that rather than targeting specific symptom reductions in specific&#xD;
      disorders, rTMS could be dosed for efficacy in enhancing psychosocial functioning. Such an&#xD;
      approach has the potential to enhance rehabilitation for far more Veterans suffering a range&#xD;
      of neuropsychiatric conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Establish the dose-response curve for improved psychosocial functioning secondary to&#xD;
      accelerated rTMS in a transdiagnostic anxious and depressed sample of Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Establish the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of an accelerated delivery&#xD;
      schedule of therapeutic rTMS for improved psychosocial functioning in a transdiagnostic&#xD;
      anxious and depressed sample of Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 3. Establish whether neurocognitive function demonstrates a dose-response&#xD;
      function to accelerated rTMS similar to psychosocial functioning in a transdiagnostic anxious&#xD;
      and depressed sample.&#xD;

    <measure>Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (IPF)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The IPF is an 80-item self-report measure used to assess functional impairment across multiple psychosocial domains of functioning. It was iteratively developed in 697 male and female Veteran stakeholders to identify relevant domains of functional impairment common in PTSD and related psychiatric dysfunction. Total score range=0-480. Increased scores pre- to 4 weeks post-treatment would indicate improved function.</description>

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief Form (WHOQOL-BF)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item self-assessment form. Questions are rated on a 5 point scale (from 1-5) Likert scale. Reflects four domains: physical, psychological, social and environment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale (IIRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The IIRS is a self-report measure of the extent of psychosocial impairment secondary to illness. Total score range=13-91. Decreased scores pre- to 4 weeks post-treatment would indicate improved function.</description>

Tasks assess the following domains: information-processing speed, executive function, sustained attention/vigilance, verbal memory, working-memory capacity, inhibition/impulsivity, and sensorimotor function. Improved performance pre- to 4 weeks post-treatment would indicate improved function.</description>
