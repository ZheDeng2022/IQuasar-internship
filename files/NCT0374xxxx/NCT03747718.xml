      NCT02108821 Detailed Description: Gut microbiome plays a key role in gut immunology and&#xD;
      function. A disturbance in the diversity of gut bacterial composition could be linked to&#xD;
      several immune mediated diseases including Inflammatory Bowel Diseases IBD. IBD can be&#xD;
      classified into Crohn's Disease CD, Ulcerative Colitis UC and indeterminate colitis IC, these&#xD;
      diseases occur from an aberrant immune reaction to resident gut bacteria. CD can affect the&#xD;
      entire gut in a transmural fashion whereas UC involves primarily the mucosal layer of the&#xD;
      colon. The treatment options often overlap in both conditions. It has also been demonstrated&#xD;
      that both recurrent Clostridium difficile infection RCDI and IBD are associated with gut&#xD;
      dysbiosis. The process of fecal microbiota transplantation FMT, where fecal microbial&#xD;
      community from a healthy individual is transferred into a recipient, has been established as&#xD;
      an efficacious therapy for RCDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of FMT in treatment of IBD is still not well established. Recent data on FMT in UC&#xD;
      has shown promising results. Three out of the four double blind randomized trials&#xD;
      demonstrated superiority of FMT compared to placebo. The first randomized trial was conducted&#xD;
      by Moayyedi et al. in which six weekly fecal or water placebo enemas demonstrated a remission&#xD;
      rate in 24 percent vs. 5 percent in fecal and placebo group respectively which was found to&#xD;
      be statistically significant 1. Similarly FMT was found to be superior to placebo in&#xD;
      achieving clinical remission at week 8 2 percent FMT vs. 8 percent placebo by Paramsothy et.&#xD;
      al who gave fecal or placebo enemas 5 days a week for 8 weeks 2. Costello et. al used&#xD;
      multidonor fecal suspension compared to placebo autologous stool via colonoscopy followed by&#xD;
      2 retention enemas by day 7. They observed a significantly superior rate of remission 32&#xD;
      percent vs. 9 percent with fecal and placebo enemas respectively 3. Rossen et. al reported&#xD;
      results of FMT in UC where they used two nasoduodenal infusions, 3 weeks apart with no&#xD;
      significant benefit in the group that received fecal infusions compared to the placebo 4.&#xD;
      There have been no published randomized trials for CD. An open label study on pediatric CD by&#xD;
      Suskind et al showed promising results with response in 7 out of 9 children with a single&#xD;
      fecal transplant delivered by nasogastric tube 5. Another open-label study of 30 CD adult&#xD;
      patients who received a single FMT into the small bowel demonstrated 86.7 percent clinical&#xD;
      improvement in the first month after transplant that was sustained in 66.7 percent patients&#xD;
      till 6 months 6. A recent meta-analysis on FMT as a primary or adjunct therapy for IBD in&#xD;
      cohort studies showed clinical remission in 22 percent and 60.5 percent patients with UC and&#xD;
      CD respectively. It was found to be a safe procedure in both conditions. The authors also&#xD;
      speculated that children with IBD might respond better to FMT compared to adult patients 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on FMT in UC has thus demonstrated better results when multiple enemas are used for&#xD;
      induction. So far results from open-label studies on Crohn's disease also look promising.&#xD;
      However there is still a gap in knowledge and understanding about the safety, outcome and&#xD;
      preferred route of FMT for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Additionally, the role&#xD;
      or frequency of maintenance therapy with retention enemas has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed randomized trial, the investigators will perform an open-label induction&#xD;
      with fecal transplantation on the subjects with medically refractory mild to moderately&#xD;
      active but Clostridium Difficile CDI negative and otherwise uncomplicated Crohn's disease.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will receive the initial FMT into right colon while&#xD;
      undergoing a medically indicated colonoscopy. This will be followed by 2 retention enemas at&#xD;
      1 and 2 weeks plus 3 days after colonoscopy as long as they are able to tolerate this&#xD;
      treatment. All subjects will then be assessed at 6 weeks for response to FMT that will be&#xD;
      defined by a drop in PCDAI by 12.5 points. The responders will be randomized to fecal vs.&#xD;
      placebo maintenance retention enemas at 1-monthly intervals for 3 months. The subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for 6 months from the initial colonoscopy to assess for medium-term outcome and&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the safety of fecal transplant by colonoscopy and retention enemas for&#xD;
      induction followed by maintenance retention fecal vs. placebo enemas in children and young&#xD;
      adults with uncomplicated mild-moderately active Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess efficacy of this induction regimen followed by maintenance fecal or placebo&#xD;
           transplants in responders. The efficacy will be assessed by clinical evaluation and&#xD;
           fecal calprotectin that is a non-invasive biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate subject's baseline microbiome findings with likelihood for response to FMT&#xD;
           induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow the chronological microbiome shifts after transplant and correlate with response&#xD;
           using clinical and calprotectin assessment in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will maintain an adverse event diary and will be assessed 1 week after each&#xD;
      transplant either on telephone or in the clinic. They will have access to the medical&#xD;
      providers for 24 hours a day including weekends. They will also be assessed in the clinic&#xD;
      prior to each transplant procedure and at 6 months following colonoscopy. Blood work for&#xD;
      blood counts CBC with Diff, erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR, C reactive protein CRP, liver&#xD;
      function tests LFTs If clinically Indicated and fecal calprotectin will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, as well as at 1.5 and 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) after initial colonoscopy for FMT.&#xD;
      Stool collection for microbiome analysis will be performed at baseline and subsequently at&#xD;
      1.5, 3.5 and 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) following initial colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty subjects who are 2-25 years of age at the time of consenting will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      trial over a period of 24 months. Subjects with mild-moderate Crohn's disease defined as&#xD;
      having Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index PCDAI of 10-37.5 despite standard medical&#xD;
      therapy that has been stable for at least 4 weeks and are undergoing a medically indicated&#xD;
      colonoscopy will be eligible for screening. All enrolled subjects will get FMT via&#xD;
      colonoscopy into the right colon along with routine biopsies. Additional biopsies will be&#xD;
      collected from the terminal ileum and rectum for microbiome analysis and also stored for&#xD;
      future studies. Microbiota analysis will be performed on the donor at the time of stool&#xD;
      collection by Open-Biome and recipient stool sample collected within 7 (+/- 3 days) days&#xD;
      prior the scheduled fecal microbiota transplantation. They will be followed for adverse&#xD;
      events throughout the duration of the study. The clinical response will be defined as a drop&#xD;
      in PCDAI by 12.5 points. The clinical response and fecal microbiome changes will be assessed&#xD;
      at 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 6 month (+/- 2 weeks) throughout the duration of the study. The subjects&#xD;
      assessed as responders at 1.5-month will be randomized to receive monthly maintenance&#xD;
      retention fecal or placebo enemas for 3 consecutive months. The enrolled subjects will have&#xD;
      blood work CBC with diff, ESR, CRP, LFTs and fecal calprotectin evaluation at baseline, 1.5&#xD;
      and 6 months (+/- 2 weeks). The investigators will utilize the Open-Biome laboratory as the&#xD;
      fecal stool bank to supply both placebo and fecal suspension for transplant. The&#xD;
      investigators estimate that they will screen up to 100 patients with Crohn's Disease CD over&#xD;
      2 years, to reach our goal of 30 total study participants. Subjects who do not improve at 1.5&#xD;
      month post transplant assessment or require prompt intervention at any time during this study&#xD;
      will be offered escalation of medical therapy. All subjects will be clinically assessed at&#xD;
      1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) post colonoscopy. A rescue retention enema will&#xD;
      be allowed during the study if a subject who was previously responding develops a flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that fecal transplant will be a safe therapy in uncomplicated&#xD;
      mild-moderate Crohn's disease patients. About 60 percent of the subjects are likely to&#xD;
      respond at 1.5 month assessment. Subjects receiving maintenance fecal transplants will have a&#xD;
      longer duration of remission compared to those who receive only the induction treatment.&#xD;
