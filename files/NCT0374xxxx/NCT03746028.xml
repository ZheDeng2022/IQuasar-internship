  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to evaluate adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), their predictors and potential&#xD;
      preventive therapies, such as aspirin (ASA). The investigator aims to improve the outcomes&#xD;
      for women with SLE and offsprings. By quantifying the risk of APO conferred by clinical risk&#xD;
      factors that can be assessed early in pregnancy (i.e. first trimester), health professionals&#xD;
      could be better equipped to estimate the individual risk of SLE pregnancies and the need for&#xD;
      heightened surveillance and guide counseling for prophylactic measures, including ASA.&#xD;
      Moreover findings from this study could eventually lead to the choice and weighting of first&#xD;
      trimester clinical factors in future clinical prediction models for APO in SLE. The&#xD;
      investigator's research efforts will improve reproductive health of SLE women, &quot;mitigating&#xD;
      the damage, functional loss, and disability that result from a chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      disorder&quot;, such as SLE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects women during their reproductive&#xD;
      years. As SLE is associated with substantial fetal and maternal morbidity during pregnancy&#xD;
      and beyond it is crucial to identify predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) in SLE to&#xD;
      appropriately counsel patients and guide monitoring during pregnancy. SLE pregnancies result&#xD;
      in high rates of preterm birth, preeclampsia and fetal loss compared to pregnancies in&#xD;
      unaffected women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a prior effort to address this issue, team members performed a large prospective study&#xD;
      (the PROMISSE study) to determine baseline predictors of APO in SLE women with inactive and&#xD;
      mild/moderate disease activity. However, PROMISSE included a selected population, which might&#xD;
      not be representative of all SLE women particularly those with severe disease activity and/or&#xD;
      active nephritis. Furthermore new data suggest that antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin&#xD;
      antibodies (aPS/PT), which are antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), are strongly associated&#xD;
      with APO. These antibodies were not evaluated in the PROMISSE study, or any other study of&#xD;
      SLE pregnancies to date. Moreover, despite evidence of the beneficial effect of aspirin (ASA)&#xD;
      in non-SLE women at high risk of APO, there are currently no studies of ASA in SLE&#xD;
      pregnancies. This is a critical knowledge gap as ASA could have a large benefit for SLE&#xD;
      mothers and their offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to evaluate adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), their predictors, and potential&#xD;
      preventive therapies. The investigator aims to improve the outcomes for women with SLE and&#xD;
      their offspring. Primary outcomes of this study are to determine the risk of APO in this&#xD;
      cohort, as well as to evaluate the patterns of ASA use in the LEGACY cohort. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be to conduct pilot analyses to assess baseline predictors of APO determined in&#xD;
      the PROMISSE study (i.e. lupus anticoagulant (LAC) positivity, antihypertensive use,&#xD;
      platelets level, race/ethnicity, prior nephritis, disease activity), and to evaluate&#xD;
      prevalence of aPS/PT in SLE pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In order to achieve these objectives, clinical data and blood sample results obtained&#xD;
      through the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) LEGACY Biobank (directed by Dr. Evelyne&#xD;
      Vinet) will be analyzed. Patient recruitment, consent, management and storage of data/samples&#xD;
      will be done in accordance with the Biobank Management Framework. The LEGACY Biobank informed&#xD;
      consent forms will be used to obtain participant consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Research activities will be conducted in accordance with the LEGACY Biobank&#xD;
      Management Framework. English and French speaking pregnant SLE women will be enrolled up to&#xD;
      and including the 16 6/7 weeks regardless of disease manifestations, level of disease&#xD;
      activity and drug exposures. Pregnancies up to and including 12 weeks gestation will be&#xD;
      targeted but pregnancies up until 16 6/7 weeks will be included. The attending staff or a&#xD;
      nurse not involved with the study or the administrative assistant will introduce the study to&#xD;
      pregnant women with Lupus. If patients are interested in learning more patients will be&#xD;
      approached by coordinator who will explain the study in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of interest will be APO, which will be defined (as in PROMISSE) as a&#xD;
      composite of specific outcomes including either: 1) fetal death after 20 weeks gestation, 2)&#xD;
      neonatal death due to preterm birth and/or placental insufficiency 3) preterm delivery or&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy &lt;36 weeks due to placental insufficiency, gestational hypertension,&#xD;
      preeclampsia and/or eclampsia and/or 4) small for gestational age neonate (i.e. birth weight&#xD;
      &lt;5th percentile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reassessed in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and postpartum (8-12 weeks after&#xD;
      delivery). The investigator will calculate the risk of APO as a function of gestational age,&#xD;
      with the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The investigator will use descriptive statistics to measure&#xD;
      the prevalence of ASA use at baseline and compare the prevalence of use across all&#xD;
      trimesters. Exploratory analyses will examine correlates of ASA initiation and non-adherence&#xD;
      during pregnancy, using univariate regression analyses, evaluating relevant baseline&#xD;
      covariates. The investigator will calculate descriptive statistics to assess and compare the&#xD;
      baseline prevalence of positive aPS/PT and LAC in SLE pregnancies with and without APO. In&#xD;
      pilot univariate analyses, the investigator will evaluate if baseline covariates as&#xD;
      determined in the PROMISSE study (i.e. LAC, antihypertensives, platelets, race/ethnicity,&#xD;
      nephritis, disease activity) correlate with APO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality: All data/samples used in this project will be obtained from the MUHC&#xD;
      research ethics board (REB) approved LEGACY Biobank. Patient recruitment and informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained as per the procedures described in the management framework. This study will&#xD;
      be conducted in accord with Tri-Council Policy Statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of socio-demographic, clinical data and reasons for refusal will be conserved&#xD;
      anonymously from patients refusing to participate in the bank. This information will be&#xD;
      included in the statistical analysis in order to assess selection bias, that is, if patients&#xD;
      who refuse participation may be a little different (in terms of age, sex, socioeconomic&#xD;
      status, etc) from those who do participate.Only data relevant to this study will be collected&#xD;
      by the research team from the bank. All the information collected during the research project&#xD;
      will remain confidential to the extent required and provided by law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimating the Risk of APO (Primary Objective 1): The investigator will calculate the risk of&#xD;
      APO as a function of gestational age, with the Kaplan-Meier estimator. By using gestational&#xD;
      age as the time axis, the investigator appropriately uses a cohort of conceptions rather than&#xD;
      a cohort of births as the study sample for fetal complications. This approach is referred to&#xD;
      as the &quot;fetus-at-risk&quot; approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pattern of ASA Use (Primary Objective 2): The investigator will use descriptive statistics to&#xD;
      measure the prevalence of ASA use at baseline and compare the prevalence of use across all&#xD;
      trimesters. In addition the investigator will determine the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      initiated ASA during pregnancy and the proportion of subjects already on ASA prior to&#xD;
      pregnancy, exploring indications of use. The investigator will measure the frequencies of&#xD;
      dosage used (i.e. 80 mg, 160 mg, and 325 mg). Exploratory analyses will examine correlates of&#xD;
      ASA initiation and ASA non-adherence, during pregnancy using a univariate regression analysis&#xD;
      estimated with the generalized estimating equation (GEE) method, evaluating the following&#xD;
      baseline covariates: maternal age, race/ethnicity, obesity, aPL autoantibodies, prior&#xD;
      preeclampsia, prior nephritis, and anti-hypertensive use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimates for Predictors of APO (Secondary Objectives): The investigator will perform pilot&#xD;
      univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses with frailties, using gestational age&#xD;
      as the time axis. As mentioned this approach called the &quot;fetus-at-risk&quot; approach refers to&#xD;
      the use of cohorts of conceptions (by using gestational age as the time axis) rather than&#xD;
      cohorts of births, as the appropriate study sample for fetal complications. In these pilot&#xD;
      univariate analyses, investigator will evaluate if baseline covariates as determined in the&#xD;
      PROMISSE study (i.e. LAC positivity, antihypertensive use, platelets level, race/ethnicity,&#xD;
      prior nephritis, disease activity as measured by the PGA) predict APO, exploring additional&#xD;
      risk factors such as nulliparity, maternal age, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity (BMI above&#xD;
      30) and medication use (corticosteroids, antimalarials, immunosuppressive and low-dose&#xD;
      aspirin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      aPS/PT Prevalence (Secondary Objectives): The investigator will calculate descriptive&#xD;
      statistics to assess and compare the prevalence at baseline of positive aPS/PT and LAC in SLE&#xD;
      pregnancies with and without APO. In pilot analyses, the investigator will perform a&#xD;
      univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with frailties to explore if aPS/PT&#xD;
      predict APO. These secondary analyses are not meant to be definitive but rather allow the&#xD;
      investigator to make precise power calculations for a more definitive trial funded by future&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline: In the first 10 months patient recruitment and follow up will occur with concurrent&#xD;
      data entry. In the following month the investigator will perform analyses assessing the risk&#xD;
      of APO and the pattern of ASA use in ongoing and completed pregnancies. The investigator will&#xD;
      also conduct pilot analyses to determine the baseline prevalence of aPS/PT in pregnant SLE&#xD;
      women comparing those with and without APO. In last month the investigator will finalize&#xD;
      interpretation of results and prepare results for presentation at national and international&#xD;
      scientific meetings and complete at least 3 manuscripts for publication in a peer review&#xD;
      journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of Results: The measurement of success will go beyond the timely completion of&#xD;
      each objective, the publications anticipated from the investigator's research and the&#xD;
      successful application to additional funding opportunities. The project will offer a unique&#xD;
      opportunity of integrated knowledge translation (KT). The investigator will disseminate the&#xD;
      data generated by the proposal at different levels (public, patients, government etc) through&#xD;
      various venues (meetings, websites, publications etc). The investigator plans to hold one&#xD;
      stakeholder workshop and engage with key stakeholders including patient advocacy groups such&#xD;
      as Lupus Canada and Lupus Foundation of America and representatives of public health&#xD;
      agencies. The investigator has a proven track record in this area. Dr Vinet is leading the&#xD;
      subgroup dealing with reproductive issues in development of Canadian recommendations on the&#xD;
      monitoring and care of patients with SLE. The findings will help inform these efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Limitations: A possible limitation to the study is the lack of harmonization in the&#xD;
      collection of samples/data. The team of investigators has a very long history (over decades)&#xD;
      of working together in national (Canadian Network for Improved Outcomes in SLE, CaNIOS) and&#xD;
      international (SLICC) groups. These research networks have established methods for&#xD;
      standardized sample and data collection. However ongoing compliance of this standardization&#xD;
      will be monitored to ensure that efforts will indeed yield results that are generalizable&#xD;
      across SLE populations. The investigator will review sample and data collection protocols&#xD;
      with investigators and coordinators offering monthly teleconferences and summaries of&#xD;
      recruitment and data collection as feedback for investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss to follow-up is always a potential problem but in general loss to follow-up in SLE&#xD;
      cohorts is low (due to the fact that patients are not only being studied but are receiving&#xD;
      care) and in a pregnancy cohort, follow up is often very high, as pregnancy is a time when&#xD;
      women are particularly inclined to be adherent to visits. In PROMISSE, loss to follow-up was&#xD;
      very rare, occurring in less than 1% of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes: The investigator hypothesizes that APO rates will be higher in the LEGACY&#xD;
      cohort (an unselected cohort of SLE pregnancies) versus the PROMISSE cohort. In addition&#xD;
      despite the increased risk of APO, the investigator hypothesizes that at least one third of&#xD;
      SLE pregnancies will not be exposed to ASA before 16 weeks of gestation. The investigator&#xD;
      expects that the prevalence of aPS/PT in SLE pregnancies with APO will be higher than in SLE&#xD;
      pregnancies without APO.&#xD;
