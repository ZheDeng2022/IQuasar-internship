      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of BGB-290 and temozolomide in&#xD;
      treating adolescents and young adults with IDH1/2-mutant grade I-IV glioma that is newly&#xD;
      diagnosed or has come back. BGB-290 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving BGB-290 and temozolomide may&#xD;
      work better in treating adolescents and young adults with IDH1/2-mutant grade I-IV glioma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of Poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase&#xD;
      (PARP) inhibitor BGB-290 (BGB-290) and temozolomide (TMZ) in adolescent and young adult (AYA)&#xD;
      subjects with IDH1/2-mutant glioma, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      characterization of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in both, newly diagnosed and recurrent&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the preliminary efficacy of BGB-290 and temozolomide in terms of progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in Arm A and B stratified by tumor diagnosis,&#xD;
      calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with a goal of improving the historical high grade&#xD;
      glioma progression free survival of 10% and overall survival of 20% at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the mutational landscape studies via whole-exome sequencing (WES). III. Assessment&#xD;
      of gene expression patterns using ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the methylation profiling with Infinium methylation assays. V. Assess the&#xD;
      oncometabolite profiling via liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS)-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Assess the intratumoral drug level assessments via LC/MS-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts. After the&#xD;
      MTD is established, additional patients will be enrolled into the efficacy component of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Newly diagnosed IDH1/2-mutant high-grade glioma patients receive PARP inhibitor&#xD;
      BGB-290 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO daily on days 1-21.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Recurrent IDH1/2-mutant low-grade or high-grade glioma patients receive PARP inhibitor&#xD;
      BGB-290 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO daily on days 1-21.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B0: Recurrent IDH1/2-mutant low-grade or high-grade glioma patients receive PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor BGB-290 PO for 7 days pre-surgery at the MTD determined in the Phase I portion.&#xD;
      After recovery from surgery (14-28 days), the patient will proceed to the efficacy component&#xD;
      of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arm A Only: Subjects must have histologically confirmed World Health Organization&#xD;
             (WHO) grade III-IV newly diagnosed IDH1/2-mutant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arm B Only: WHO grades I-IV recurrent IDH1/2 mutant glioma. Subjects in Arm B must&#xD;
             have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirming progressive disease; re-biopsy is&#xD;
             encouraged, but not required at the time of recurrence for confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a primary spinal tumor, secondary glioma, or multifocal disease in the&#xD;
             brain, but without evidence of diffuse leptomeningeal spread, are eligible. In cases&#xD;
             where there are questions about multifocality versus diffuse leptomeningeal spread,&#xD;
             the study chair or co-chair must be contacted to make a final decision on eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have IDH1 or IDH2 mutation associated with neomorphic activity of the&#xD;
             encoded proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to provide archival formalin-fixed embedded (FFPE) and frozen&#xD;
             tissue specimens for biomarker studies if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects in Arm A must have been treated with maximal safe resection of primary tumor&#xD;
             followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). Treatment with TMZ during radiation is&#xD;
             allowed but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects in Arm B must have been treated with maximal safe resection of tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lower grade glioma (LGG) subjects who progressed after initial surgery alone are&#xD;
                  eligible. Any number of prior therapies are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  High grade glioma (HGG) subjects enrolled on Arm B must have been treated with a&#xD;
                  minimum of maximal safe resection of primary tumor followed by adjuvant RT prior&#xD;
                  to recurrence. Any number of prior therapies are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: subjects must have received their last dose of known&#xD;
             myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy at least three weeks prior to study&#xD;
             registration or at least six weeks if nitrosourea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biologic agent: subjects must have recovered from any toxicity related to biologic&#xD;
             agents and received their last dose &gt;= 7 days prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after&#xD;
                  administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse&#xD;
                  events are known to occur. The duration of this interval should be discussed with&#xD;
                  the study chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For biologic agents that have a prolonged half-life, the appropriate interval&#xD;
                  since last treatment should be discussed with the study chair prior to&#xD;
                  registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Monoclonal antibody treatment: at least three half-lives must have elapsed prior to&#xD;
             registration, and subjects on bevacizumab must have received their last dose &gt;= 32&#xD;
             days prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects in Arm A should begin therapy with TMZ and BGB-290 after completion of&#xD;
             radiation therapy and when all other eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects in Arm B, patients must not have received radiation therapy within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment. Post-RT, the diagnosis of true&#xD;
             progression versus ?pseudo-progression? can be challenging when imaging modalities are&#xD;
             exclusively used, and thus an additional resection is encouraged if clinically&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1000/mm^3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving&#xD;
             platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Total serum bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT) =&lt; 3 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum albumin &gt;= 2 g/dL.&#xD;

          -  Subjects with seizure disorder may be enrolled if on non-enzyme inducing&#xD;
             anticonvulsants and well controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have neurological deficits should have deficits that are stable for a&#xD;
             minimum of 1 week prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corticosteroids: Subjects who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or&#xD;
             decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of BGB-290 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because alkylating agents (such as TMZ) are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation and 4 months after completion of BGB-290 or TMZ administration.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to swallow capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to undergo serial MRI scans (computerized tomography&#xD;
             [CT] cannot substitute for MRI).&#xD;
