      This study will determine the value of TOD (first rib resection with partial scalenectomy and&#xD;
      neurolysis) on functionality and quality of life for patients with neurogenic thoracic outlet&#xD;
      syndrome. This will be done by randomizing patients into surgery or conservative therapy&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) is a condition caused by compression and&#xD;
      irritation of the brachial plexus serving the upper extremity. NTOS most frequently occurs in&#xD;
      relatively young, active and otherwise healthy individuals and can have a tremendous impact&#xD;
      on work, social and personal life. The diagnosis and therapy of NTOS still remains disputed.&#xD;
      This is partly because diagnosis is largely clinical and subjective in nature, with no&#xD;
      definitive (diagnostic) imaging or diagnostic studies available. As a result, disparities in&#xD;
      the definition have produced different opinions regarding diagnostic standards for TOS.&#xD;
      Furthermore, given the controversy surrounding the definition and diagnosis of TOS, conflict&#xD;
      exists regarding the optimal treatment approach for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in the last years, have shed light on some of the controversies in diagnosing and&#xD;
      treating NTOS. Many patients that benefit from thoracic outlet decompression (TOD) do not fit&#xD;
      the historical diagnostic criteria. Those patients (up to 90%) with disputed NTOS have shown&#xD;
      improvement of symptoms and functionality after TOD surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several studies have been published about outcome after TOD surgery for NTOS. These&#xD;
      large, multicenter studies show a very low complication rate, ranging from 0-2%, with an&#xD;
      extremely low risk of nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies however report on heterogenous populations, diagnosed without any&#xD;
      internationally validated diagnostic criteria. They hint beneficial results for TOD in NTOS&#xD;
      patients, however the level of evidence they provide is low. Critics have wondered if the&#xD;
      improvements - reported in these trials - are attributed to surgery, or are merely due to&#xD;
      coincidence, selection bias, conservative treatment or time (rest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The society of vascular surgery published reporting standards in 2016 to produce consistency&#xD;
      in diagnosis, description of treatment and assessment of results to allow more valuable data&#xD;
      to be reported. The investigators believe that a randomized controlled trial - using the&#xD;
      reporting standards- could demonstrate the actual added value of a TOD (first rib resection&#xD;
      with partial scalenectomy and neurolysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the value of TOD (first rib resection with&#xD;
      partial scalenectomy and neurolysis) on functionality and quality of life. This will be done&#xD;
      by randomizing patients who already received conservative physiotherapy into surgery or&#xD;
      continued conservative therapy (physiotherapy and pain relief). After 3 months, the patients&#xD;
      with continued maximum conservative therapy will be offered surgery as well if complaints&#xD;
      persist. The effect of TOD will be examined by following the change in functionality and&#xD;
      quality of life compared to conservative physiotherapy. The durability of these effects on&#xD;
      functional assessment and quality of life will also be examined by following patients for 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with NTOS refractory to conservative physiotherapy treatment (based on&#xD;
      criteria produced by the reporting standards) and considered to benefit from TOD in a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary TOS-consensus group are considered candidates for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into surgery (TOD) versus conservative physiotherapy. The group&#xD;
      randomised for conservative physiotherapy will be offered surgical therapy after 3 months if&#xD;
      complaints persist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is DASH SCORE. This endpoint will be measured with the DASH questionnaire&#xD;
      (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Secondary endpoints will be the score on the CBSQ,&#xD;
      VAS scale and SF 12. These endpoints will be measured with the CBSQ questionnaire&#xD;
      (Cervical-Brachial Symptoms Questionnaire), VAS scale (Visual Analogue Scale for Pain) and SF&#xD;
      12 (Short Form 12 questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are operated with the same technique and by the same operator. There is a delay&#xD;
      of 3 months for half of the subjects (control group), which is relative due to the early&#xD;
      operation (in comparison with the existing waiting list for regular TOD of around 3 months)&#xD;
      of the group that is randomised for TOD. There is no denial of 'optimal medical treatment'&#xD;
      for any of the participating subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  High suspicion of NTOS with high level of impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The decision to refer a patient with NTOS for surgery is placed at the sole&#xD;
                  authority of the TOS multidisciplinary workgroup. Members of this workgroup are 2&#xD;
