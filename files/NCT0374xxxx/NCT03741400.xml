  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Virtual Reality Glove for Hand and Arm Rehabilitation (vREHAB) trial is a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, phase 3 trial aiming to evaluate the safety, usability, and efficacy of a virtual&#xD;
      reality biofeedback system (Neofect RAPAEL Smart Glove) to promote recovery of distal arm and&#xD;
      hand function in the acute and subacute period after stroke, as compared to standard of care&#xD;
      therapy. The aims of the study is to demonstrate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the effect of Smart Glove use on functional recovery, in addition to standard of care&#xD;
           rehabilitation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the feasibility of increasing the dose of rehabilitation in acute stroke patients with&#xD;
           the Smart Glove.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the effect of Smart Glove use on quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neofect Smart Glove is a commercially available, non-invasive biofeedback based system&#xD;
      for distal upper extremity rehabilitation. The Smart Glove is very lightweight and allows for&#xD;
      easy movement of all distal upper extremity joints. It consists of a glove-shaped sensor&#xD;
      device and a software application which can be used with either a large screen or a portable&#xD;
      tablet. The system includes multiple ADL-based training games, and the system tracks the&#xD;
      motion and posture of the wearer's distal limb as they participate. Games can be selected to&#xD;
      focus on certain movements (such as forearm pronation/supination, wrist flexion/extension,&#xD;
      finger flexion/extension, etc.) based on the needs of the wearer. The software includes a&#xD;
      smart learning algorithm, in which the computer automatically adjusts to the optimal level of&#xD;
      difficulty to balance challenge and motivation. After initial set-up, the device requires no&#xD;
      therapist supervision to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible for the study if they are (1) within 30 days from an ischemic or&#xD;
      hemorrhagic stroke (with aim for enrollment within 1 week post stroke), and (2) have impaired&#xD;
      arm/hand function secondary to the stroke (see below for specific inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria). We will recruit eligible patients from acute care hospitals, acute rehabilitation&#xD;
      units, and outpatient facilities. Enrolled patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to&#xD;
      standard rehabilitation therapy versus standard rehabilitation therapy plus Smart Glove use.&#xD;
      All patients will be allowed to participate in any scheduled outpatient rehabilitation during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a 12-week intervention period and a 12-week follow-up period. During&#xD;
      the 12-week intervention period all patients will receive their usual rehabilitation therapy,&#xD;
      with their therapists documenting rehabilitation dose in a journal provided at the start of&#xD;
      the study. In addition, subjects randomized to the Smart Glove therapy arm will be provided&#xD;
      with a Smart Glove system, which includes the glove and tablet. Subjects will be instructed&#xD;
      to use the system for at least one session per day for 5 days per week during the 12-week&#xD;
      intervention period. Participants will present for in-person visits on weeks 6, 12, and 24&#xD;
      for blinded assessments by study coordinators. At the completion of the intervention period,&#xD;
      subjects will return the Smart Glove and subjects in both arms of the study will only receive&#xD;
      usual care during the 12-week follow-up period. Subjects will have a final assessment at week&#xD;
      24 (12 weeks after completing the intervention) to assess for persistence of effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All efficacy analyses are analyzed under the intention to treat principle. The primary&#xD;
      efficacy outcome is the change in score on the Jebsen Taylor Hand Test between baseline and&#xD;
      week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints are changes in scores on the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      Scale, Stroke Impact Scale, and total dose of rehabilitation received during the 24-week&#xD;
      intervention period. Persistence of the treatment effect will be tested by comparing changes&#xD;
      in scores on the Jebsen Taylor Hand Test and Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score at 24 weeks&#xD;
      between treatment groups&#xD;
