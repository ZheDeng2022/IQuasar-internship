      refractive outcome after cataract surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of biometry, immersion ultrasound was shown to be accurate and&#xD;
      reproducible. It is important to distinguish between immersion ultrasound techniques and&#xD;
      contact ultrasound. The later was shown to be less accurate and examiner dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although immersion ultrasound has been improved significantly and novel high resolution&#xD;
      ultrasound devices are available, the drawback of this technique is that measurement s take&#xD;
      longer compared to optical biometry. The advantage of immersion ultrasound is that structures&#xD;
      behind the iris are visible, whereas in optical biometry only structures within the pupil are&#xD;
      visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immersion ultrasound as well optical biometry can be used to calculate the needed power of an&#xD;
      intraocular lens (IOL) to achieve the aimed post-operative refraction. Although IOL power&#xD;
      calculation improved within the last decades, refractive surprises occur, especially in cases&#xD;
      with very short eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimation of the post-operative IOL position and therefore the estimated anterior&#xD;
      chamber depth (ACD) is presently the main source of error (35% to 42%) in IOL power&#xD;
      calculation and therefore for the refractive outcome of the patients after cataract surgery.&#xD;
      Early IOL power calculation formulae, such as the Binkhorst I formula, used a fixed ACD value&#xD;
      to predict the position of the IOL, but the refractive results were not appropriate because&#xD;
      the post-operative position of the IOL varied significantly between patients. Later&#xD;
      observations showed a correlation between the axial eye length and the post-operative ACD&#xD;
      (more myopic eyes showed a larger ACD post-operatively). These correlations were taken into&#xD;
      account in later developed formulas (such as the Binkhorst II formula). Olsen et al. measured&#xD;
      the post-operative ACD and substituted the predicted post-operative ACD with the true,&#xD;
      post-operative ACD in each case. The result after correcting the IOL position was a highly&#xD;
      accurate IOL power calculation, where no fudge factors were needed. Presently the&#xD;
      pre-operatively measured ACD is taken into account for several IOL power calculation&#xD;
      formulas, such as the Haigis formula, the Holladay II formula and the Olsen formula. However,&#xD;
      this new generation of formulas use the pre-operative ACD, without considering the thickness&#xD;
      of the crystalline lens. The ACD is measured as the distance between the anterior surface of&#xD;
      the cornea (anatomically speaking this should be the posterior surface of the cornea, but in&#xD;
      an optical context, as in IOL power calculations, the anterior surface is used) and the&#xD;
      anterior surface of the crystalline lens . Therefore the thickness of the crystalline lens&#xD;
      has a significant impact on the predicted post-operative position of the IOL. This parameter&#xD;
      was first taken into account by Olsen and later modified by Norrby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be mentioned that IOL power calculations developed from theoretical calculations&#xD;
      based on Gaussian optics to regression formulas, such as the SRK formula that uses&#xD;
      retrospective data of a large number of patients. All these findings suggest that proper&#xD;
      measurements not only of the dimensions of the crystalline lens but also of the lens capsule&#xD;
      after removing the crystalline lens are necessary to improve IOL power calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prototype of a combination of an anterior segment OCT (VISANTE; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) and&#xD;
      an operating microscope (OPMI 200; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) was introduced that allowed&#xD;
      measurements of the crystalline lens as well as the lens capsule itself after removing the&#xD;
      crystalline lens of cataract patients intraoperatively. This device uses OCT technology to&#xD;
      create high resolution B-scans (=images) of the anterior segment of the eye. The OCT was&#xD;
      shown to be highly reproducible for ACD measurements pre-operatively and small changes of the&#xD;
      IOL/crystalline lens can be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prototype set-up was used in a previous study published in the journal &quot;Investigative&#xD;
      Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science&quot;. It was shown that intra-operative measurements of the&#xD;
      anterior lens capsule were a better predictor for the post-operative lens position than other&#xD;
      factors and could improve the refractive outcome theoretically. Furthermore it was shown that&#xD;
      intra-operatively measured anterior chamber depth is useful to predict refractive outcome&#xD;
      using fourth-generation formulae. A further study aimed to observe, whether the postoperative&#xD;
      refractive outcome could be improved theoretically by using both pre- and intra-operative&#xD;
      measurements for retrospective IOL power calculation with new eye models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study a high resolution swept-source OCT was used to perform the measurements and&#xD;
      results were very promising (DIATHLAS; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, disadvantage of swept-source OCT technology is that the measured area is only within&#xD;
      the pupil, but structures behind the iris cannot be visualised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recent findings suggest that measuring the equator of the lens capsule and the cilliary&#xD;
      body could improve IOL power calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One CE marked device that allows measurements behind the iris is the ArcScan Insight 100&#xD;
      scanner. This immersion ultrasound device is a precision high frequency device for imaging&#xD;
      and biometry of the eye. A 20-60 MHz transducer scans the eye although its curvature&#xD;
      approximates the anterior ocular surface. During this process the device produces images with&#xD;
      1 micron resolution of the cornea or the anterior segment. In addition, measurements can also&#xD;
      be made of the anatomic structures comprising the anterior of the eye such as anterior&#xD;
      chamber depth, angle-to-angle width, and sulcus-to-sulcus width, and pathologic structures,&#xD;
      such as solid masses and cysts.&#xD;
