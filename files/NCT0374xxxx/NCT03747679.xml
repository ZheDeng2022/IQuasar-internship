    <textblock>
      Healthy Adult Volunteer Taste Study of Oral Formulations of Bosutinib for Pediatric Use. This&#xD;
      will be a single-blind, randomized, multiple-period (dosing over 4 days) study in healthy&#xD;
      male and/or female participants. Approximately 8 participants will assess the sensory&#xD;
      attributes of different powder for oral suspension (POS) formulations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taste evaluations for the formulations (Formulations A to N) in Sessions 1 to 4 each contains&#xD;
      4 periods. All the planned formulations in this study will have a bosutinib amount equal to&#xD;
      200 mg in each taste assessment. Session 1 consists of bosutinib POS, sorbitol base in water&#xD;
      (A); bosutinib POS, mannitol base in water (B); and bosutinib capsules to be opened into&#xD;
      water (C). Session 2 consists of bosutinib POS, mannitol base in low % (D) and in high % (E)&#xD;
      sodium saccharine sweetener vehicles, respectively; bosutinib POS, mannitol base in low % (F)&#xD;
      and high % (G) strawberry flavour vehicles, respectively. Session 3 consists of bosutinib&#xD;
      capsules to be opened into low % (H) and high % (I) sodium saccharine sweetener vehicles,&#xD;
      respectively; bosutinib capsules to be opened into low % (J) and high % (K) strawberry&#xD;
      flavour vehicles, respectively. Session 4 consists of bosutinib capsules opened onto apple&#xD;
      sauce (L); bosutinib capsules opened onto full fat natural yoghurt (M); and bosutinib&#xD;
      capsules to be opened into water (N). Participants will be assigned to one of the treatment&#xD;
      sequences available for each session. Except at session 4 for treatments L and M, each&#xD;
      formulation will be presented to the participants in a blinded fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to not swallow, rather to only swish the bosutinib containing&#xD;
      liquid in their mouths for approximately 10 seconds, after which the liquid will be spat out.&#xD;
      Each participant will record the sensory attributes at timed intervals of 0 (immediately&#xD;
      after dosing), 5, 10 and 20 minutes after spitting using a Bosutinib Taste Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;

             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent&#xD;
             document (ICD) and in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical Conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;

             positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody (HBcAb) or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb). As an exception, a positive&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) as a result of participant vaccination is&#xD;
             permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior/Concomitant Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within&#xD;
             7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             investigational product. (Refer to Section 6.5 for additional details).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational&#xD;
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Diagnostic Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A positive urine drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of tobacco-containing products.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Screening supine blood pressure (BP) 140 mm Hg (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic),&#xD;
             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is 140 mm Hg (systolic) or 90 mm Hg&#xD;
             (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values&#xD;
             should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Baseline 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results&#xD;
             (eg, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle branch block&#xD;
             [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST T interval&#xD;
             changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third degree atrioventricular&#xD;
             [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline&#xD;
             uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate corrected using the&#xD;
             Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and&#xD;
             reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be&#xD;
             repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread&#xD;
             by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level 1.5 ×&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal (ULN);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin level 1.5 × ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study&#xD;
                  provided the direct bilirubin level is ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Other Exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of&#xD;
             consuming 5 (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a&#xD;
             general rule, alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces&#xD;
             (240 mL) beer, 1 ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations&#xD;
             section of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and&#xD;
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or&#xD;
             Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Male participants with partners currently pregnant; male participants able to father&#xD;
             children who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
             as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of investigational product or longer based upon the compound's&#xD;
             half-life characteristics.&#xD;
