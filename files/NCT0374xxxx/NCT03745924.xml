  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect information on side effects and how well Refixia/REBINYN works during&#xD;
      long-term treatment (prophylaxis) in males with haemophilia B. While taking part in this&#xD;
      study, participants will receive the same treatment as given to them by their study doctor.&#xD;
      All visits at the clinic are done in the same way as the participants are used to. During&#xD;
      visits at the clinic, participants might be asked for some relevant tests if considered&#xD;
      useful by their study doctor. During the visits, the participants study doctor might ask if&#xD;
      the participants had any side effects since their last study visit. The participants will be&#xD;
      asked to note down the number of bleeds and the treatment of their bleeds as well as their&#xD;
      regular prophylaxis. During the visits to the clinic, the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      answer some questionnaires about their quality of life and their ability to be physically&#xD;
      active. The participant's participation in the study will last for 4-9 years, depending on&#xD;
      when they join the study. Participants are free to leave the study at any time and for any&#xD;
      reason. This will not affect their current and future medical care.&#xD;
