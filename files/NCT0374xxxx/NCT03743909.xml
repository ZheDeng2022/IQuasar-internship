    <textblock>
      &quot;Acute leukemia&quot; is defined by the World Health organization standards, in which greater than&#xD;
      20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (Kabuto et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute leukemia is a cloned expansion of tumor cells in bone marrow, blood or other tissues.&#xD;
      The acute leukemia is classified as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to defective&#xD;
      differentiation of myeloid lineage or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) due to defective&#xD;
      differentiation of lymphoid lineage(Olaniyi JA et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukemia is diagnosed by morphology and cytochemical examination of blast cells,&#xD;
      immunophenotyping, cytogenetic and molecular genetics. (Hazarika M et al., 2015 ).&#xD;
      immunophenotyping is mandatory for the diagnosis of hematolymphoid malignancies (Craig FE et&#xD;
      al., 2008)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunophenotyping of leukemia cells plays crucial role in identification of leukemia cell&#xD;
      line, assesment of maturation stage and finding possible aberrant antigens which in turn&#xD;
      serves for individual treatment monitoring and detection of residual disease(Kahng J et&#xD;
      al.,2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunophenotyping identifies cell surface/CD markers(cluster of differentiation), expressed&#xD;
      at different stages of cell development, by applying monoclonal antibodies against them helps&#xD;
      in the diagnosis and classification of leukemia. The morphologically similar blast cells can&#xD;
      be easily differentiated by immunophenotyping on the basis of expression and different CD&#xD;
      markers (Angelescu S et al.,2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aberrant expression of CD markers has been observed in several cases of acute leukemia(Chang&#xD;
      Y et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aberrant phenotype is a phenomenon in which lymphoid-associated and other myeloid lineage&#xD;
      markers expressed in myeloblasts or myeloid-associated markers expressed in lymphoblasts.&#xD;
      Aberrant phenotype incidence has been reported in both ALL and AML with varying frequencies&#xD;
      as high as 88%(Macedo A et al.,1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aberrant phenotypes are classified into different types: co-expression of&#xD;
      lymphoid-associated antigens or lineage infidelity; asynchronous antigen expression, in which&#xD;
      early antigens are coexpressed with more mature ones; or antigen overexpression and existence&#xD;
      of abnormal light scatter patterns(Gert Ossenkoppele et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence or absence of these aberrant markers may also be associated with poor or favorable&#xD;
      prognosis(Alhan C et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have reported correlations of aberrantly expressed markers with clinical&#xD;
      outcome in AML. For example, CD7 and CD25 expression has been associated with poor prognosis&#xD;
      in normal karyotype AML(Cerny J et al.,2013) The IL3 receptor alfa (CD123) is overexpressed&#xD;
      in 45% of AML patients, and this higher expression has also been associated with poor outcome&#xD;
      (Riccioni R et al.,2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD13 and CD33 are most frequently associated with aberrant myeloid expression in ALL (Hrusák&#xD;
      O et al,2002).Studies indicate that aberrant immunophenotypic expression can decrease the&#xD;
      time of remission and survival in children with ALL (Kurec et al., 1991).Aberrant expression&#xD;
      of CD13 in ≥ 5% of blasts of adult patients with ALL is an adverse prognostic factor,that&#xD;
      should be considered for more aggressive treatment(Dalal BI1 et al.,2014).&#xD;
