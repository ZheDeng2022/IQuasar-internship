    <textblock>
      Subjects are enrolled in this study following completion or early discontinuation from a&#xD;
      Poseida sponsored or supported study of P-BCMA-101 T cells and will be followed for a total&#xD;
      of 15 years post treatment from the last P-BCMA-101 treatment. Subjects will be monitored for&#xD;
      safety and efficacy to assess the risk of delayed adverse events (AEs) and assess long-term&#xD;
      efficacy, and PK and quantification of P-BCMA-101 T cells. Rimiducid may be administered as&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Per Health Authorities guidelines for gene therapy medicinal products that utilize&#xD;
      integrating vectors (FDA, 2006; Guidance for Industry, Gene Therapy Clinical Trials-Observing&#xD;
      Subjects for Delayed Adverse Events), long term safety and efficacy follow up of treated&#xD;
      subjects is required. Subjects are enrolled in this study following completion or early&#xD;
      discontinuation from a Poseida sponsored or supported study of P-BCMA-101 T cells and will be&#xD;
      followed for a total of 15 years post treatment from the last P-BCMA-101 treatment. Subjects&#xD;
      will be monitored for safety and efficacy to assess the risk of delayed adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      and assess long-term efficacy, and PK and quantification of P-BCMA-101 T cells. Rimiducid may&#xD;
      be administered as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits Subjects will only enter this protocol after completing or discontinuing from&#xD;
      their primary P-BCMA-101 protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled in this protocol a subject will return for regular follow-up depending on when&#xD;
      they last received P-BCMA-101 on their primary protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 3 months until the end of the first year after P-BCMA-101 treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 6 months until the end of the third year after P-BCMA-101 treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then yearly until the end of the 15th year after P-BCMA-101 treatment (ie. if a subject&#xD;
           discontinues from their primary protocol 2 years after receiving P-BCMA-101, they will&#xD;
           be entering this study at the beginning of the 3rd year, and will remain on this study&#xD;
           for 13 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo serial assessment of safety, chemistry, hematology, and disease&#xD;
      response as specified in the Schedule of Events. Subjects will further undergo a physical&#xD;
      exam and medical history, and anti-myeloma medications, related AEs, new malignancies, new or&#xD;
      exacerbated clinically significant neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic or other autoimmune&#xD;
      disorders will be recorded. After progressive disease (PD) has been confirmed for a subject&#xD;
      after P-BCMA-101 administration, visits may be performed remotely (AEs collected by telephone&#xD;
      and laboratory studies completed at a local facility).&#xD;
