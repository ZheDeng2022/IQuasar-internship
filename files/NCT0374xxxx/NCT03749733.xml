    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the bioavailability in fasting post-menopausal women of 2&#xD;
      film-coated tablet formulations containing 1.5 milligrams (mg) of estradiol and 2.5 mg of&#xD;
      nomegestrol acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at a single site. Participants will take a single oral dose of&#xD;
      the test product and reference product in 2 periods and 2 sequences (either test after&#xD;
      reference or reference after test). There will be a washout of at least 21 days between each&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      estradiol and nomegestrol of 2 film-coated tablet formulations with estradiol 1.5 mg and&#xD;
      nomegestrol acetate 2.5 mg and to demonstrate bioequivalence of both formulations in terms of&#xD;
      rate and extent of absorption:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test Product: new product manufactured by Laboratorios Andrómaco S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reference Product: Stezza [Trademark], product of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Farmacêutica Ltda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 90% confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus&#xD;
      Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma&#xD;
      concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72 hours&#xD;
      (AUC0-72), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total estradiol/estrone and&#xD;
      nomegestrol will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 36 hours during each study&#xD;
      period (for 12 hours pre-dosing and for 24 hours post dosing) during which pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) blood samples will be obtained. Three blood samples will be taken before the film-coated&#xD;
      tablet is administered (at pre-dose: -1.0, -0.5, and 0 h) and 16 samples up to 24 hours after&#xD;
      the administration in each period. Participants will return to the site to provide additional&#xD;
      blood samples at 36 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The washout period between the two study periods will be at least 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples from each participant will be analyzed with 2 methods of high-performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical assays to quantify total&#xD;
      estradiol/estrone and nomegestrol in plasma with citrate phosphate dextrose anticoagulant.&#xD;
      The blood samples taken at pre-dose will be taken to establish the baseline concentrations of&#xD;
      total estrone and estradiol. The baseline-corrected and uncorrected AUCs and Cmax will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in post-menopausal&#xD;
      women by collecting adverse events.&#xD;
