  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to assess the PK of a single 200 mg oral dose of&#xD;
      CC-90001 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, and in matched&#xD;
      healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degrees of hepatic impairment will be determined during screening by the subject's score&#xD;
      according to Child-Pugh Classification Criteria.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in Groups 1 through 5 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Approximately 6 to 8 male or female subjects with mild hepatic impairment (with&#xD;
           a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 5 to ≤ 6) will be enrolled in Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Approximately 6 to 8 male or female subjects with moderate hepatic impairment&#xD;
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic&#xD;
           function will be enrolled in Group 3. Subjects in Group 3 will be matched to subjects in&#xD;
           Group 2 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 10% body mass index [BMI]).&#xD;
           Group 3 will also serve as the control group for Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: Approximately 6 to 8 male or female subjects with severe hepatic impairment&#xD;
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13) will be enrolled in Group 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic&#xD;
           function will be enrolled in Group 5. Subjects in Group 5 will be matched to subjects in&#xD;
           Group 4 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 10% BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study employs a staged design as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and matching healthy subjects with&#xD;
           normal hepatic function (Groups 1 through 3) will be enrolled concomitantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 4 subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment must demonstrate&#xD;
           satisfactory safety and tolerability for up to 4 days after dosing before subjects with&#xD;
           severe hepatic impairment may be dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two subjects with severe hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory safety and&#xD;
           tolerability for up to 4 days after dosing before the remaining subjects with severe&#xD;
           hepatic impairment may be dosed.&#xD;
