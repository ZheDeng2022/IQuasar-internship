  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smart Matrix is a sterile, single layer dermal replacement scaffold. The scaffold consists of&#xD;
      a porous matrix of cross-linked human fibrin plus alginate that has been designed and&#xD;
      optimised to facilitate wound closure and healing through cellular invasion.&#xD;
