  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behçet' s disease (BD) is a complex, inflammatory multisystem disorder characterized by&#xD;
      recurrent attacks of oral ulcers, genital ulcers, cutaneous lesions, and inflammatory ocular&#xD;
      finding. The vascular inflammatory change is known to be the main histopathology. There is no&#xD;
      sensitive or specific laboratory test or pathologic findings , the diagnosis relies heavily&#xD;
      on mucocutaneous manifestations and other clinical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous studies,In order to diagnose and monitor disease activity in BD, many&#xD;
      cytokines and biomarkers have been identified such as increased blood levels of neopterin,&#xD;
      a1-antitrypsin, a2- macroglobulin were correlated with disease activity. Some markers&#xD;
      including interleukin-6, -interleukin1b, tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), thrombomodulin,&#xD;
      E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor, antilysozyme(5), serum endocan, serum growth&#xD;
      differentiation factor (GDF-15), serum alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and homocysteine had been&#xD;
      considered as inflammatory indicators in BD, However, they are not routinely used in clinical&#xD;
      practice as they are not simple or easily derived. Limitations of these markers also include&#xD;
      the reflection of short-term inflammatory activity and low discrimination ability with other&#xD;
      superimposed inflammatory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), and&#xD;
      similar parameters (red blood cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelet volume (MPV) and&#xD;
      neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which can be calculated from the peripheral blood&#xD;
      easily, have been demonstrated as a new expression of the systemic inflammatory indicators&#xD;
      that can aid in the diagnosis and assessment of disease severity in many diseases, such as&#xD;
      ankylosing spondylitis,rheumatoid arthritis,systemic lupus erythematosus,and psoriatic&#xD;
      Arthritis.nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated RDW, NLR, PLR, or MPV values in&#xD;
      patients with BD, none of which have evaluated the role of LMR in BD, not even the&#xD;
      relationships between LMR, PLR levels, and disease activity in patients with BD. The mean&#xD;
      size of the thrombocytes have been reported on the blood count as mean platelet volume (MPV).&#xD;
      MPV is indirectly associated with the activity of platelets. Large platelets are more active&#xD;
      than small ones by means of metabolic and enzymatic function. In addition, they also have a&#xD;
      higher potential of thrombogenicity. LMR is an easy-to-calculate indicator that can be&#xD;
      calculated by leukocyte subgroup of complete blood count. Also, it has been reported that LMR&#xD;
      ratio might have prognostic importance for some diseases. Therefore, to better understand&#xD;
      these serum inflammatory parameters in BD and to gain deeper insight into the roles of LMR,&#xD;
      MPV, NLR and PLR in BD, a prospective study to assess them all together in BD Will conducted&#xD;
