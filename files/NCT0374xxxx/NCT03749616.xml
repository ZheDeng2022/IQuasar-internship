  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are excellent medications&#xD;
      for providing pain control in certain patients. There is some data to suggest that NSAIDs can&#xD;
      be used to reduce postoperative pain and narcotic use in patients who had undergone carpal&#xD;
      tunnel release. There are mixed results about the effect of bone healing in adult patients&#xD;
      with broken bones. The investigators hypothesize that NSAID administration in the acute phase&#xD;
      of distal radius fracture healing will be non-inferior for pain control and decrease the use&#xD;
      of opioid analgesics compared to patients who take acetaminophen for pain control during this&#xD;
      same time period. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that patients will have similar&#xD;
      or better patient reported outcomes, range of motion, and strength with the administration of&#xD;
      NSAIDs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, drug overdose deaths and opioid-involved deaths continue to increase,&#xD;
      quadrupling since 1999; six out of ten drug overdose deaths involve an opioid. Overdoses from&#xD;
      prescription opioids are a driving factor in the 15-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.&#xD;
      The amount of prescription opioids sold to pharmacies, hospitals, and doctors' offices has&#xD;
      drastically risen, yet there had not been an overall change in the amount of pain that&#xD;
      Americans reported. Deaths from prescription opioids-drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and&#xD;
      methadone-have more than quadrupled since 1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to control both postoperative&#xD;
      pain and pain associated with some orthopaedic injuries in children and adults with certain&#xD;
      orthopaedic injuries. Further, the use of NSAIDs for pain control has been shown to lessen&#xD;
      the use of narcotic pain medications, the adverse effects of which are well known. With the&#xD;
      current opioid epidemic, more research is needed to determine strategies to reduce opioid use&#xD;
      in patients with orthopaedic injuries. Chapman et al. showed that NSAIDs can be used&#xD;
      effectively to reduce postoperative pain and narcotic use in patients who had undergone&#xD;
      carpal tunnel release. Although distal radius fractures are one of the most common fractures,&#xD;
      no studies have examined the effect of NSAIDs on distal radius fracture pain. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to compare pain and narcotic pain medication use in patients who have had&#xD;
      distal radius fractures in patients who use NSAIDs to those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the authors' knowledge, there have been no clinical prospective, randomized studies to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect that NSAIDs have on patients with distal radius fractures. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that NSAID administration in the acute phase of distal radius&#xD;
      fracture healing will be non-inferior for pain control and decrease the use of opioid&#xD;
      analgesics compared to patients who take acetaminophen for pain control during this same time&#xD;
      period. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that patients will have similar or better&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes, range of motion, and strength with the administration of NSAIDs.&#xD;
