  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is an acquired depigmented disorder that causes white spots on the skin due to the&#xD;
      loss of melanocytes. It is a common disease which accounts for 0.5-1% of the whole&#xD;
      population. It is a refractory skin disease with 25-50 thousand patients in Korea. And it is&#xD;
      often caused in the exposed areas of the patient, causing a great deal of mental and social&#xD;
      dysfunction in the patient's life, and may lead to suicide attempts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A nationwide study conducted by the Korean Academy of vitiligo showed that 61.8% of patients&#xD;
      with vitiligo always have emotional impairment. In addition, the incidence of recurrence is&#xD;
      high, and the recurrence rate is reported up to 40% within one year after the discontinuation&#xD;
      of treatment. Therefore, development of a marker for monitoring the disease activity is very&#xD;
      important and desperately needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HMGB1 is a protein located in the nucleus, such as histone, and binds to genes and&#xD;
      transcription factors to stabilize and control the DNA transcription. However, when released&#xD;
      from the cells, it acts as a danger signal and is thought to cause autoimmune diseases such&#xD;
      as inflammatory diseases and lupus. The present study demonstrated through ex vivo tissue&#xD;
      culture that HMGB1 can induce melanocyte apoptosis by inducing apoptosis and also observed&#xD;
      that serum concentration of HMGB1 was higher in vitiligo patients than in normal controls .&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of HMGB1 as a biomarker for predicting&#xD;
      the severity of disease and to confirm the association between HMGB1 levels and vitiligo&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
