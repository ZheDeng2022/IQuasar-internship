  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial designed for children who are have already developed&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis (AD or eczema) by 12 weeks of age. The aim is to compare the effect of&#xD;
      proactive sequential skin care, including the twice-daily use of a tri-lipid skin barrier&#xD;
      cream (Epiceram) or moisturizer and proactive use of fluticasone propionate cream, against&#xD;
      reactive AD therapy, to reduce the occurrence and severity of AD in early infancy and thereby&#xD;
      prevent food allergy (FA).&#xD;

      This is a randomized, controlled, parallel design, open-label phase 2 clinical study to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of the two proactive treatment arms versus the reactive arm, for the&#xD;
      prevention of atopic dermatitis in children at high risk of food allergy. We will recruit 875&#xD;
      infants who have signs of dry skin or atopic dermatitis between 0-12 weeks of life.&#xD;
