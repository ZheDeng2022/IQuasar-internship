  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of combined&#xD;
      abaloparatide and bevacizumab in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). A secondary&#xD;
      objective is to determine the response to treatment (based on bone marrow and peripheral&#xD;
      blood findings). A tertiary objective is to determine the impact of therapy on health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQOL) and patient-reported outcomes (PRO). A quaternary (scientific)&#xD;
      objective is to determine the impact of treatment on both hematopoietic and stromal cell&#xD;
      populations within the bone marrow of MDS patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of combined&#xD;
      abaloparatide + bevacizumab in MDS patients. This will be a single center, single arm, phase&#xD;
      1 trial in MDS patients. In cycle 1, patients will be treated with single-agent, subcutaneous&#xD;
      (SQ) abaloparatide at a dose of 80 mcg/day for 28 days. This will enable the investigator to&#xD;
      monitor for any potential toxicities of single-agent abaloparatide in the MDS patient&#xD;
      population. Following cycle 1, patients will have a bone marrow aspirate to determine the&#xD;
      impact of abaloparatide treatment on bone marrow stromal cell and hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      populations. In cycles 2-4 (each cycle is 28 days), patients will be treated with SQ&#xD;
      abaloparatide at a dose of 80 mcg/day and intravenous (IV) bevacizumab 5 mg/kg on days 1 and&#xD;
      15. At the end of study, patients will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to assess&#xD;
      disease response and to determine the impact of combined abaloparatide + bevacizumab on bone&#xD;
      marrow stromal cell and hematopoietic cell populations. After completion of trial therapy,&#xD;
      another bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be done 3 months later to assess the delayed&#xD;
      impact of treatment. The investigator has chosen a phase 1 trial design because this&#xD;
      combination has not been previously evaluated for toxicity. Since safe and effective doses of&#xD;
      both abaloparatide and bevacizumab have already been identified and both drugs are Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, the investigator does not feel there is a need to&#xD;
      dose-escalate. The investigator will carefully monitor for therapy-limiting toxicities (TLTs)&#xD;
      throughout the course of the study and impose an early stopping rule for toxicity. To monitor&#xD;
      for TLTs, patients will have laboratory tests weekly and clinic visits every other week&#xD;
      throughout the course of the trial. TLT is defined in the protocol with grading of adverse&#xD;
      events defined by the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
      Response will be defined according to 2006 IWG working criteria for MDS. Patients who have&#xD;
      achieved complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), marrow CR, and/or hematologic&#xD;
      improvement at any time during the 7 month trial period will be considered responders.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will have a diagnosis of MDS or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CMML) based on 2016 world health organization (WHO) criteria, and associated signs&#xD;
      of bone marrow failure characterized by at least some degree of cytopenia involving at least&#xD;
      one cell line such as anemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. Patients will not be allowed to&#xD;
      receive concurrent active chemotherapy or growth factors.&#xD;
