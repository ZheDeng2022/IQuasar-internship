      To evaluate the effect of selective micro-osteoperforations (MOPs) on the amount of distal&#xD;
      movement of the upper canine, the mesio-distal inclination of the canine and the messiah&#xD;
      movement of the upper first molar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Clinical trial with Split mouth design in 35 orthodontic patients with bilateral&#xD;
      extraction of the upper first premolar, each upper canine will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention (MOP) or to the control side. Participants will be followed for 3 months and the&#xD;
      investigators will take periapical radiographs, cast models and clinical measurements before&#xD;
      and after canine retraction. The measurements will be taken by previously calibrated&#xD;
      operators. The results are going to be determined and compared between sides, with the&#xD;
      corresponding statistical tests and the results are going to be analyzed.&#xD;

      PICO QUESTION: ¿Does the amount of distal orthodontic movement of the upper canine increase&#xD;
      in the side with MOPs compared with the side without MOPs? Population: Orthodontic patients&#xD;
      with bilateral extraction of the upper first premolar (Split mouth design trial)&#xD;
      Intervention: Distal movement of the upper canine with Selective MOPs (distal to canine) in&#xD;
      one hemi-arch Comparison: Distal movement of the upper canine without MOPs in the other&#xD;
      hemi-arch Outcome: Canine and first molar movements&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effect of selective micro-osteoperforations (MOPs) on the amount of distal&#xD;
      movement of the upper canine, the M-D inclination of the canine and the mesial movement of&#xD;
      the upper first molar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERVIEW OF DESIGN Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial in split mouth design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomly assign upper canines in to 2 sides in a split mouth design study: one side to&#xD;
           receive intervention (MOPs) and the other side as a control (without MOPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then follow both sides for three months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Split mouth design method: The investigators are going to randomly assign to the&#xD;
           patients' left or right sides, one side for the intervention and the other side for the&#xD;
           control (to eliminate the possibility of selection bias).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinding: It is not possible to blind participants and clinical staff, but the&#xD;
           investigators are going to blind the operators who will perform the measurements and the&#xD;
           data analysis (single-blinded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be with orthodontic fixed appliances (MBT prescription slot 0.022&#xD;
      &quot;x0.028&quot;, canine torque 0 °), with working arches 0.019 &quot;x0.025&quot; stainless steel and with&#xD;
      bilateral extractions of the first upper premolars for 6 months or more. For this moment the&#xD;
      crowding must be resolved and there must be a space of 3 or more millimeters between the&#xD;
      canines and second premolars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 upper incisors will be consolidated with a 0.010 &quot;stainless steel ligature below the&#xD;
      arch to prevent opening of anterior spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No transpalatal arch (TPA) will be used in any of the participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is going to place a mini-implant in the palate for reference point before the start&#xD;
           of the experiment PLANS FOR RECRUITMENT Patients of the Clinic University (UniCIEO) and&#xD;
