  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and inappropriate medication prescribing are highly prevalent among acutely&#xD;
      admitted older medical patients leading to re-admissions, frailty, poor physical, performance&#xD;
      compromised quality of life and mortality. Thus, the aim of this study is to optimise the&#xD;
      nutrition and medication in older medical patients admitted to an acute care department at&#xD;
      admission and up to 16 weeks after discharge. Participants in the intervention group receives&#xD;
      a medication review and participants with malnutrition or risk of malnutrition additionally&#xD;
      receive a transitional multimodal intervention. The control group receives standard care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OptiNAM study is designed as a single-blinded randomised controlled trial starting upon&#xD;
      admission and continues till 16 weeks after discharge. The trial has five sub-studies with&#xD;
      three independent primary endpoints, all with individual sample size calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of an intervention group and a control group. The control group receives&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are invited to&#xD;
      participate. After signing a written informed consent, the participants are block randomised&#xD;
      to either the intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group receives a personalised rehabilitation program, which is described&#xD;
      below. Outcome measures are performed at baseline, week 8 and week 16 after after discharge,&#xD;
      cf. section regarding outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 1, Malnutrition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As malnutrition among older patients has multifactorial etiology sub-study 1 investigates the&#xD;
      effects of a multimodal transitional intervention on quality of life in acutely admitted&#xD;
      older patients with malnutrition or risk of malnutrition (according to the Mini Nutritional&#xD;
      Assessment - Short Form) from baseline (admission day) and 16 weeks after discharge compared&#xD;
      to standard care. The intervention includes a medication review (cf. sub-study 2), a dietetic&#xD;
      intervention and if clinical relevant physiotherapeutic-, occupational-, geriatric- and/or&#xD;
      odontological intervention. It is secondary hypothesised that a multimodal intervention&#xD;
      compared to standard care may improve the quality of life, nutritional status, energy- and&#xD;
      protein intake, symptoms which compromise nutritional intake, physical performance, cognitive&#xD;
      function, frailty, re-admissions, inflammation and biomarkers. A cost-benefit analysis will&#xD;
      be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietetic intervention: The study subjects receives a personal diet plan during admission. The&#xD;
      diet plan is reviewed at discharge by a dietician. To ensure optimal energy- and protein&#xD;
      intake after discharge, a community-based dietician visit the participants for one hour in&#xD;
      week 1, 2, 4 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapeutic intervention: Participants with low ability to perform groceries shopping,&#xD;
      cooking and/or eating are offered a community-based strength, balance and endurance training&#xD;
      after discharge if they also have low muscle strength in the lower extremities. The training&#xD;
      sessions are based on algorithms, have a duration of one hour, and are offered twice a week&#xD;
      for 16 weeks after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational intervention, Dysphagia: If relevant (EAT-10 score &gt;=3), a hospital-based&#xD;
      occupational therapist review and treat the dysphagia based on the Facial Oral Tract Therapy&#xD;
      (FOTT) principle during admission. During the first week after discharge a community-based&#xD;
      occupational therapist continues with the treatment. A maximum of two weekly visits of one&#xD;
      hour throughout the interventions period is offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational Intervention, low Ability to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADL): If the&#xD;
      participant has low ability to perform grocery shopping, cooking and eating (evaluated by&#xD;
      Functional Recovery Score &lt;=2) then a community-based occupational therapist visit the&#xD;
      participant during the first two weeks after discharge to evaluate the quality of activities&#xD;
      of daily living. If relevant, and if there is a rehabilitation potential, seven visits of one&#xD;
      hour is offered during the 16 weeks after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geriatric intervention: If relevant (a Mini Geriatric Depression Score &gt;=2), a geriatric&#xD;
      physician conducts a clinical assessment of depression during admission and initiate&#xD;
      treatment if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Odontological intervention: If relevant (participant reported pain in mouth, difficulties&#xD;
      chewing or xerostomia), a dentist evaluate the dental status and oral health during&#xD;
      admission, and if necessary encourage the participant to consult a dentist after discharge.&#xD;
      If a participant shows insufficient oral hygiene a dental hygienist visits the participant&#xD;
      after discharge twice during after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 2, Medication optimisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication prescription for older patients is challenging and may be attributed to marked&#xD;
      inter-individual variations in general health, comorbidities, organ function, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic properties, biological age and physical performance. Thus, the &quot;one size&#xD;
      fits all&quot; approach is probably inappropriate in older patients. The aim of sub-study 2 is to&#xD;
      investigate the investigate the effect of an inter-professional conducted medication review&#xD;
      during admission in an acute care department regardless of the nutritional status in the&#xD;
      study participant, thus all subjects in the intervention group receive a medication review.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that inter-professional conducted medication reviews reduce the Medication&#xD;
      Appropriateness Index score (MAI score) in the intervention group eight weeks after discharge&#xD;
      compared to the control group. It is secondary hypothesized that inter-professional conducted&#xD;
      medication reviews improve: lack of medication prescribing for a condition/disease,&#xD;
      inappropriate polypharmacy and suboptimal medication prescribing of high risk medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 3, Accuracy of renal function estimates and the consequence for prescribing&#xD;
      recommendations guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy in renal function estimates is essential for optimization of medication prescribing&#xD;
      since 40 % of all medication or their active metabolites is renally excreted. Lack of&#xD;
      medication prescribing and dose adjustment according to the renal function is common in older&#xD;
      patients with renal impairment and can result in overdosing, adverse drug reactions, hospital&#xD;
      admissions, reduced quality of life and mortality. The gold standard for measuring glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (GFR) is an exogenous filtration marker. However, this method is costly, time&#xD;
      consuming and thus impractical in a clinical setting. Therefore, GFR is often estimated on&#xD;
      serum concentrations of an endogen biomarker. Sub-study 3 aim to investigate which&#xD;
      biomarker(s) and equation most accurately estimate the GFR in older medical patients who have&#xD;
      been acutely admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 4, Pharmacogenetic test on cytochrome 450 variations and its potential for&#xD;
      optimization of medication prescribing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytochrome 450 enzymes are responsible for metabolism of up to 80% of all medications. The&#xD;
      enzyme complex is mainly found in liver but are also present in intestinal mucosa, skin,&#xD;
      lungs, brain and kidneys. There are major genetic inter-individual differences in the&#xD;
      activity of the CYP 450 complex, resulting in lack of therapeutic effects, lack of effect or&#xD;
      adverse drug reactions. Insight into these genetic inter-individual differences via&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic tests possess a potential in optimization of medication prescribing with&#xD;
      regard to therapeutic effects, compliance and risk of side effects. Thus, sub-study 4 wish to&#xD;
      descriptively investigate the potential of pharmacogenetic test on cytochrome 450 variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 5, Assessment of Frailty:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults and defined as state of increased&#xD;
      vulnerability resulting from decline in reserve capacity and function across multiple&#xD;
      physiologic systems. Frailty affects the person's ability to cope with everyday life and&#xD;
      leads to high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization and mortality. The frailty&#xD;
      assessment is based on two different frailty scoring systems, Frieds &quot;Frailty Phenotype&quot; and&#xD;
      Morley's &quot;Frail Scale&quot;, examined at admission and 8 and 16 weeks after discharge. The purpose&#xD;
      of the assessment is to evaluate which frailty measure is the best applicable in describing&#xD;
      the patients and changes in their functional level. As there is no gold standard we use&#xD;
      FI-Outref as an independent measure of frailty. FI-OutRef is a Frailty Index, based on&#xD;
      standard admission laboratory test results Outside of the Reference interval.&#xD;
