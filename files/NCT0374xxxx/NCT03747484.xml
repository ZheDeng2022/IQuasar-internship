      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of gene-modified immune cells (FH-MCVA2TCR)&#xD;
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with Merkel cell cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      other parts of the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable).&#xD;
      Placing a gene that has been created in the laboratory into immune cells may improve the&#xD;
      body's ability to fight Merkel cell cancer.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of FH-MCVA2TCR autologous T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximated 5 days prior to receiving FH-MCVA2TCR T-cells, patients undergo radiation&#xD;
      therapy for 1 fraction per standard of care. Patients receive FH-MCVA2TCR T-cells&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes. Beginning 14 days after receiving FH-MCVA2TCR&#xD;
      T-cells, patients also receive standard of care avelumab IV over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 1&#xD;
      year or pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for 1 year in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with partial response or stable disease may&#xD;
      then receive an additional cycle of FH-MCVA2TCR T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 15&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EVALUATION: Metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)-associated&#xD;
             Merkel cell carcinoma (VP-MCC) that has progressed on or after prior treatment with a&#xD;
             PD-1 axis immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EVALUATION: Individuals that may be consented to undergo evaluation to determine&#xD;
             potential eligibility must have a history of metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell&#xD;
             carcinoma (MCC) (as documented by medical record).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EVALUATION: Be capable of understanding and providing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have metastatic or unresectable, histologically confirmed&#xD;
             virus-positive MCC. Confirmation of diagnosis must be or have been performed by&#xD;
             internal pathology review of initial or subsequent biopsy or other pathologic material&#xD;
             at Fred Hutch/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Approximately 80% of MCCs are caused by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) T Antigens&#xD;
             and the treatment is expected to only be effective in this population. Merkel cell&#xD;
             polyomavirus positivity may be established through one of two means: positive Merkel&#xD;
             cell polyomavirus T antigen serology (preferred) or immunohistochemistry of a primary&#xD;
             or metastatic MCC tumor lesion (if T antigen seronegative).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MCPyV T Antigen serology will be performed with the anti-Merkel cell panel (AMERK)&#xD;
             assay run through the University of Washington Medical Center Laboratory Medicine&#xD;
             Clinical Immunology Laboratory. Positivity will be defined as a Merkel oncoprotein&#xD;
             antibody titer (MSCTT) of &gt;= 75 standard titer units (STU) at any time point from&#xD;
             initial diagnosis onward. Patients with negative T antigen serology but MCPyV positive&#xD;
             tumor by other methodologies will be considered for additional MCPyV testing as&#xD;
             clinically appropriate, as the T antigen serology assays are highly specific but&#xD;
             incompletely sensitive for MCPyV status. In this case, immunohistochemistry of any&#xD;
             tumor lesion will be performed with the CM2B4 Merkel cell polyomavirus T antigen&#xD;
             antibody. Expression of MCPyV in at least 10% of tumor cells will be considered&#xD;
             positive. CM2B4 staining performed at any point clinically and at any clinical&#xD;
             laboratory may be accepted. However, if CM2B4 staining has not been previously&#xD;
             performed by a clinical pathology laboratory as part of MCC diagnostic workup, it will&#xD;
             be performed in a clinical diagnostic pathology laboratory at University of Washington&#xD;
             (UW)/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC)/SCCA as per standard staining&#xD;
             protocols. Persons are not required to have both CM2B4 positivity and seropositivity;&#xD;
             either will be acceptable confirmation of viral status and if one negative and the&#xD;
             other positive the patient will remain eligible provided other criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been previously treated with at least one dose of a PD-1 axis&#xD;
             inhibitor (e.g. PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibiting monoclonal antibody such as pembrolizumab,&#xD;
             nivolumab, avelumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab), developed progression of their MCC&#xD;
             tumor on or after treatment, and not developed grade 3 or higher toxicity. At least&#xD;
             four weeks must have passed between the administration of the first dose of PD-1 axis&#xD;
             inhibitor and determination of progression. If there is significant clinical concern&#xD;
             for pseudoprogression (i.e. progression developed rapidly after checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
             therapy), biopsy must be performed to demonstrate true progression. Patients may have&#xD;
             received 1 or more prior systemic regimens for MCC. There is no upper limit on prior&#xD;
             regimens. Patients may have received prior anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 in the neoadjuvant or&#xD;
             adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be HLA-A*02:01 in order for infused transgenic T cells to recognize&#xD;
             antigen-MHC complexes. HLA typing for HLA-A2 should be determined through molecular&#xD;
             approaches at a clinical laboratory licensed for HLA testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy must be anticipated to be &gt; 3 months at trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fewer than 0.5% of MCC occur in individuals aged 30 years or younger, thus the&#xD;
             protocol includes only adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding and providing a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If fertile, willingness to comply with reproductive requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Should there be no tumor tissue that is accessible for biopsy, patients will still be&#xD;
             considered for participation, at discretion of the investigator. Similarly, should an&#xD;
             investigator determine that a biopsy cannot be performed safely for clinical reasons&#xD;
             biopsies may be cancelled or retimed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 3 weeks must have passed since any: immunotherapy (for example, T-cell&#xD;
             infusions, immunomodulatory agents, interleukins, MCC vaccines, intravenous&#xD;
             immunoglobulin, expanded polyclonal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte [TIL] or&#xD;
             lymphokine-activated killer cell [LAK] therapy), natural killer (NK) therapy, small&#xD;
             molecule or chemotherapy cancer treatment, other investigational agents or other&#xD;
             systemic agents that target MCC. There is no washout period for radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &gt; 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin (tBili) &lt; 3.0. Patients with suspected Gilbert syndrome may be&#xD;
             included if Tbili &gt; 3 but no other evidence of hepatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 5 x upper limit&#xD;
             of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  =&lt; grade 1 dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oxygen saturation (SaO2) &gt;= 92% on ambient air.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are performed based on the clinical judgment of the&#xD;
             treating physician, patients with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &gt;= 50%&#xD;
             of predicted and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (corrected)&#xD;
             of &gt;= 40% of predicted will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients 60 years of age or older are required to have left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fraction (LVEF) evaluation performed within 1 year prior to study treatment. LVEF may&#xD;
             be established with echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan, and must be&#xD;
             &gt;= 35%. Cardiac evaluation for other patients is at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000 cells/mm^3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &gt; 200 cells/mm^3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematocrit (HCT) &gt; 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt; 50K.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy is excluded unless&#xD;
             discussed with the principal investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Kidney transplant will be considered on a case by case basis requiring discussion with&#xD;
             PI. If kidney transplant, patient must have dialysis access, dialysis plan, supportive&#xD;
             nephrologist, willingness to stop transplant immunosuppression, and express&#xD;
             understanding that rejection is likely. Dialysis or costs related to transplant kidney&#xD;
             will not be supported by the study. Participants having had any other solid organ&#xD;
             transplants will be excluded, as will those with a history of allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
             transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corticosteroid therapy at a dose equivalent of &gt; 10 mg prednisone per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of other investigational agents or MCC directed therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or psychological condition other than Merkel cell carcinoma that would&#xD;
             significantly increase the risk of harm to a subject or interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of trial endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active uncontrolled infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive&#xD;
             participants on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with a CD4 count &gt; 500&#xD;
             cells/mm^3 are considered controlled, as are individuals with a history of hepatitis C&#xD;
             who have successfully completed antiviral therapy with an undetectable viral load, and&#xD;
             those with hepatitis B who have hepatitis well controlled on medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness. Participants may not have uncontrolled or concurrent&#xD;
             illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated brain metastases. Participants with small asymptomatic brain metastases (&lt; 1&#xD;
             cm) or those with brain metastases previously treated with surgery or radiotherapy&#xD;
             will be considered for inclusion at discretion of principal investigator, so long as&#xD;
             other eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade 3 or higher immune related adverse event (iRAE) to any prior PD-1 axis blocking&#xD;

             PD-L1 inhibitors including colitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myositis, hepatitis,&#xD;
             encephalitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving treatment for prior immune-related adverse event (iRAE) are&#xD;
             excluded, with exception of hormone supplementation or corticosteroid therapy at&#xD;
             equivalent of up to 10 mg prednisone per day, unless otherwise approved by PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participants must not have significant active underlying neurologic disease,&#xD;
             unless approved by PI. Mild neuropathy related to diabetes or prior chemotherapy is&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical, social, or psychiatric factor that interferes with medical&#xD;
             appropriateness and/or ability to comply with study, as determined by PI.&#xD;
