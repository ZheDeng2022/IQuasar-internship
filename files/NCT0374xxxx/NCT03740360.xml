      This study evaluates the use of contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound (CH-EUS) and&#xD;
      cyst fluid molecular analysis in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic cysts and the&#xD;
      detection of malignancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cyst are a frequent finding on cross-sectional imaging on general population. They&#xD;
      are identified in up to 3% of the abdominal computed tomographies (CT) and 20% of magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) performed for other reasons but the risk of malignancy in pancreatic&#xD;
      cysts discovered incidentally is low, representing 1-5% of the total malignant pancreatic&#xD;
      neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic cysts are a broad group of pancreatic lesions that can be divided into benign and&#xD;
      premalignant or malignant lesions. Pseudocyst and serous cystic neoplasm (SCN) don´t have&#xD;
      malignant potential while others like mucinous cysts are premalignant lesions. But not all&#xD;
      mucinous neoplasms have the same risk of malignancy. According to recent publications&#xD;
      mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) have a potential for malignancy of around 15%, main duct&#xD;
      intrapapillary mucinous neoplasm (MD-IPMN) of 62% and branch duct IPMN (BD-IPMN) of 25%. The&#xD;
      correct identification of these premalignant lesions will allow to optimize the treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up of these patients, but in many cases it is difficult to accurately differentiate&#xD;
      between different types of cysts and their risk of malignancy. The differentiation between&#xD;
      lmucinous and non-mucinous cysts is suboptimal, with diagnostic accuracy for CT and MRI of&#xD;
      61% and 50-73% with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The endosonographic characteristics that&#xD;
      have been related with malignancy are the size larger than 3 cm, the presence of a solid&#xD;
      component, wall thickening, Wirsung dilation, abrupt change of the size of the main&#xD;
      pancreatic duct with distal atrophy of the gland and the presence of lymphadenopathies.&#xD;
      However, endosonographic characteristics are not sufficient as an individual predictor of&#xD;
      malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The puncture of the cyst and fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with biochemical and&#xD;
      cytological assessment is generally indicated to differentiate between cysts and to asses for&#xD;
      malignancy. The determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and amylase have low&#xD;
      specificity for the detection of malignancy and for mucinous cyst, and the cytological&#xD;
      assessment is highly specific but lacks of sensibility (50%). So further methods are&#xD;
      requested for an adequate detection of premalignant and malignant cyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound uses an ultrasonographic contrast agent to&#xD;
      visualize blood flow in fine vessels and may aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts by&#xD;
      enabling assessment of the vascularization of structures such as cyst walls, septa, or mural&#xD;
      nodules. Furthermore it allows the correct differentiation between contrast-enhanced mural&#xD;
      nodules, that predict for malignancy, from non-enhancing mucus clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular analysis of cyst fluid may detect mutations that are associated with&#xD;
      premalignant cyst and with malignancy. Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) gene has been related with&#xD;
      mucinous cyst while von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) is present in serous cyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the use of contrast-enhanced EUS and the molecular analysis for&#xD;
      pancreatic cyst diagnosis and malignant detection, and if their use may modify cyst&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
