  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI&#xD;
      705564 in healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is the exploration of the PK including dose proportionality of BI&#xD;
      705564 after single dosing.&#xD;
