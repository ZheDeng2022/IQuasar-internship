      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare liver cancer. It usually occurs in&#xD;
      young people who have no history of liver disease. Currently the only effective treatment&#xD;
      option is surgery that removes the tumor and part of the liver. Researchers want to study the&#xD;
      course of the disease to learn more about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect samples from people with FL-HCC to learn more about the disease and help develop&#xD;
      new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People any age with FL-HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be enrolled on another NIH protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least 1 study visit. They will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medical and cancer history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A review of their symptoms and their ability to do normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests to produce images of the body. They may have a scan (CT) that uses a small amount&#xD;
           of radiation. Or they may have a scan (MRI) that uses a magnetic field. These will&#xD;
           examine the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will study previous tumor samples if they are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants come to NIH for visits on other studies, data will be collected about their&#xD;
      disease, tests, treatments, and responses. Tumor tissue will be collected if participants are&#xD;
      having it taken for a procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other participants will be contacted to collect this data. They will be contacted once a&#xD;
      month for 1 year and 2 times a year after that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to contact researchers when their health changes. They may come in&#xD;
      for more tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
           accounting for 0.5-9% of primary liver cancer in various case series, which is usually&#xD;
           not associated with elevated serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels, is enriched in&#xD;
           younger age groups, and is not associated with underlying liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reports on the characteristics of patients with FL-HCC as well as predictors of&#xD;
           recurrence and survival are scarce, largely due to the rarity of this tumor. The only&#xD;
           potentially curative treatment option for FL-HCC patients who have resectable disease is&#xD;
           surgery: either liver resection (LR) or liver transplantation (LT). However, disease&#xD;
           recurrence after complete surgical resection is high, ranging from 33-100%. The clinical&#xD;
           outcome of patients with unresectable disease is suboptimal with median survival of less&#xD;
           than 12 months and no patient surviving beyond 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies, including systemic chemotherapy, remains&#xD;
           poorly defined and has been reported to have only a modest or no therapeutic effect.&#xD;
           Platinum-based chemotherapy in pediatric patients with FL-HCC resulted a partial&#xD;
           response in 31% of patients on imaging but a 3-year survival of only 22%. To date no&#xD;
           targeted therapy has been shown to be of any value in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The natural history of FL-HCC varies greatly with most patients surviving only months&#xD;
           while others can live with the disease for years. While one cannot exclude an immune or&#xD;
           other host component as responsible for the diverse clinical courses, it is also&#xD;
           possible that there may be a genetic basis for this phenomenon. A novel somatic&#xD;
           recurrent 400 kb deletion on the short arm of chromosome 19, giving rise to an in-frame&#xD;
           DNAJB1 PRKACA gene fusion was found in FL-HCC. mTOR signaling is significantly activated&#xD;
           in FL-HCC compared to other liver malignancies. A bio-specimen repository will be a&#xD;
           major step towards more comprehensive studies of this very rare and unusual tumor and&#xD;
           allow us to begin to characterize subgroups within the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with rare tumors seek expert advice in the management of their care. A natural&#xD;
           history study would establish a more formal mechanism for such referrals, while allowing&#xD;
           the systematic collection of epidemiologic data as well as much needed tumor samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Characterize the natural history of Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC),&#xD;
      including clinical presentation, family history, patterns of disease progression, response or&#xD;
      lack of response to therapeutic interventions, disease recurrence and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Subjects of all ages with histologically or cytologically proven FL-HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo a comprehensive study entry evaluation including clinical&#xD;
           phenotyping and imaging of tumor sites. Computed tomography scans of the thorax, abdomen&#xD;
           and pelvis may be performed if clinically indicated; occasionally, magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging may be performed for the visualization of lesions in the liver, spine, or other&#xD;
           anatomic sites if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical histories will be documented, and participants will be followed throughout the&#xD;
           course of their illnesses, with attention to patterns of disease recurrence and&#xD;
           progression, response to therapies and duration of responses. As part of this natural&#xD;
           history study, growth rates of target tumor lesions will also be calculated throughout&#xD;
           the course of the disease whenever available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and tumor samples will be obtained at study entry and while on study.&#xD;
