      Distal fracture of the radial bone is the commonest fracture and is also connected to&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Normally the operation is performed under neuroaxial blockade and sedation.&#xD;
      When the blockade rapidly vanish many patients experience a rebound pain much severer that&#xD;
      than the actual trauma pain. If long acting local anesthetics are used this will occur during&#xD;
      night time and many patients will go to the emergency room for pain treatment. Short acting&#xD;
      local anesthetics may make it possible to treat patients pain in-house prior to leaving the&#xD;
      hospital. In this study&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This investigation is a joint study involving Occupational Therapist, Orthopedic surgeons and&#xD;
      Anesthesiologist. Distal fracture of the radial bone is the commonest fracture, mainly in&#xD;
      elder females with osteoporosis and also obesity. Normally 75% of patients are treated with&#xD;
      plaster after fracture repositioning. The remaining 25% are operated upon. Routinely, the&#xD;
      operation is performed under neuroaxial blockade and sedation. When the blockade rapidly&#xD;
      vanish many patients experience a rebound pain much severer than the initial trauma pain. If&#xD;
      long acting local anesthetics are used the blockade will be terminated during night and many&#xD;
      patients will go to the Emergency room for pain treatment. Short acting local anesthetics may&#xD;
      make it possible to treat patients pain in-house prior to hospital discharge and thus reduce&#xD;
      severe rebound pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients with radial fractures are included and operated upon by a standard&#xD;
      surgical operation with plate and screws. They will receive either 1) ultra sound guided&#xD;
      supraclavicular block long-acting (n=30) local anesthetic , 2) ultra sound guided&#xD;
      supraclavicular block short-acing (n=60) local anesthetics or 3) general anesthesia (n=30) to&#xD;
      provide analgesia during the operational procedure. Patients given an ultra sound guided&#xD;
      blockade with short-acting local anesthetic (n=60) are further sub-divided into receiving&#xD;
      either postoperative plaster/cast (n=30) or an orthosis/brace (n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients pain will be measured by Numeric Rating scale (0 = no pain and 10 worst possible&#xD;
      pain) during the first 7 postoperative days. The opioid consumption will be noted by personal&#xD;
      contact intermittently by telephone and by a pain diary until day 7. Both parametric and&#xD;
      none-parametric analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of recovery will be assessed by Quality of Recovery Scale 15 at 5 occasions. Adverse&#xD;
      effects and unplanned health care contacts will also be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 days the Occupational Therapist will control the patients followed by investigations&#xD;
      at 2, 6 12 and 52 weeks. The patients will be graded the Patient rated Wrist Evaluation&#xD;
      (PRWE) and Michigan Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) Edema will be measured and strength will be&#xD;
      measured by Jamar dynamometer, Finally, Sense of coherence will be measured by KASAM-13&#xD;
