  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, crossover study with cluster randomization and a planned accrual of&#xD;
      300 patients with diagnosed breast fibroadenoma (One fibroadenoma treated per patient). This&#xD;
      is a trial based prospective cost consequence study. Costs will be estimated from the&#xD;
      viewpoint of the healthcare system and from the patient's perspective&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibroadenomas are well-circumscribed benign tumors, easily distinguishable from adjacent&#xD;
      normal breast tissue on ultrasound images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is to compare HIFU and surgery in terms of cost, safety, and&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness for the treatment of nonmalignant breast tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibroadenomas appear to be an ideal target for evaluation of ultrasound guided HIFU&#xD;
      treatment. However, not all the FA are suitable for surgical treatment and in many cases&#xD;
      surveillance associated or not with hormonal medication may be sufficient for limiting the&#xD;
      symptoms at the degree compatible with a good quality of life for the patients. In addition,&#xD;
      from the fraction of the patients for which ablation is a genuine medical need due to the&#xD;
      severity of the pathology (size, symptoms, disturbed daily activity with possible&#xD;
      psychological impact), only a part of them are suitable for undergoing the HIFU treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, all the patients to be included in this study have an initial indication of&#xD;
      surgical resection of the adenoma. Unlike the patients presenting FA and suitable for&#xD;
      medication and surveillance, the cases for which surgery is an indication are symptomatic&#xD;
      (significant pain, discomfort, anxiety) and/or are presenting a growth observed during their&#xD;
      surveillance with ultrasound examination. In addition, all the eligible patients will have to&#xD;
      comply with the technical limitations of the HIFU method in terms of lump size, subcutaneous&#xD;
      depth, presence of calcifications and other contraindications like presence of breast&#xD;
      implants or under areolar location. Knowing that after the age of 45 years the lumps are in&#xD;
      many institutions reserved exclusively for surgery in order to eliminate all suspicion of&#xD;
      malignancy, the upper age limit is fixed at 45. Further limitations as established by the&#xD;
      American Society of Breast Surgeons for potential candidates of percutaneous excision will be&#xD;
      added as inclusion criteria for all patients (the lesion must be sonographically visible, the&#xD;
      diagnosis of FA must be confirmed histologically, lesions should be less than 4cm in largest&#xD;
      diameter).&#xD;
