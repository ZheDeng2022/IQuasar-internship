  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A short pre-surgical non-therapeutic trial involving postmenopausal women with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed eR+, HeR2-negative operable breast cancers. After undergoing a core needle biopsy&#xD;
      for tissue acquisition, study participants will take a 7- to 56-day (1-8 weeks) course of&#xD;
      letrozole in accordance with standard of care. They will then undergo definitive surgical&#xD;
      resection of their primary tumor (mastectomy vs lumpectomy) as per standard of care&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a prescription for letrozole to be taken orally at a dose of 2.5 mg/day&#xD;
      for 7-56 days to allow for variations in surgical scheduling. Patients are to undergo&#xD;
      surgical resection of their tumor the day after the last dose of letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment tumor biopsies (a goal of 4-6 cores) will be obtained following 7-56 days of&#xD;
      letrozole treatment on the day of surgery. Frozen AND formalin fixed core biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained whenever possible. The tissue will be used for study-specific assays as well as&#xD;
      routine histopathology. Post-treatment core needle biopsy tissue will be obtained, whenever&#xD;
      possible, by the surgeon intraoperatively at the time of routine surgical resection. A&#xD;
      formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor block from the patient's surgical resection is also&#xD;
      requested. This block will be used for a subset of the correlative studies if no tumor is&#xD;
      obtained by the post treatment core biopsies. This block will be returned to pathology&#xD;
      promptly after the correlative studies are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment (total mastectomy or segmental resection with lymph node evaluation if&#xD;
      clinically indicated) will occur the day after completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary lesion obtained at the time of the definitive surgical procedure (partial or&#xD;
      total mastectomy) will be sent for standard of care histopathologic analysis; wherever&#xD;
      possible intra-opearative cores from the central portion of the tumor will be obtained for&#xD;
      study-specific assays. All specimens will be handled according to established institutional&#xD;
      guidelines to maintain the accuracy of the analysis of tumor size and margin status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following standard of care histopathologic analysis, additional paraffin-embedded sections&#xD;
      will be submitted at a later time to the Simmons Cancer Tissue Core to determine tumor&#xD;
      proliferation with Ki67 (MIB1Ab, Dako Cytomation) IHC. These tests are of no clinical utility&#xD;
      and will be done for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen cores and/or peels from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks from&#xD;
      the surgical specimen will be selected and/or macrodissected - when needed - based on ≥20%&#xD;
      tumor cellularity as assessed by Dr. Sahoo, expert breast pathologist in the trial. These&#xD;
      will be sent to Dr. Carlos Arteaga's laboratory for further testing.&#xD;
