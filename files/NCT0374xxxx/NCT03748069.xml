      This trial is aimed to study the immunological and pathological characteristics of influenza&#xD;
      versus non-influenza severe community-acquired pneumonia patients in ICU, and correlate&#xD;
      findings with occurrence of secondary invasive pulmonary aspergillosis infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients aged 18 or older admitted to ICU during the inclusion period with&#xD;
      respiratory distress due to influenza positive/negative community acquired pneumonia (CAP)&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
